0,5.0,                       so the    click  button finally bit me  this came to my doorstep and i had no idea where it came from  my roommate had been asking about a super basic tool kit to be had cheaply  i guess i ordered it while scrolling  i have   full size tool chests  yes  standing ones  full and literally top of the top of the line tools  yet i didn t send this one back  here s why  i use a lot of tools  more even than most professionals  i m a general contractor at work  and a woodworker and gunsmith and all around tinkerer at home why do i recommend this set to anyone who won t desperately miss      because these tools are just under the par of the basic ok big box store regular tools  i ve probably received       tool kits with cheap from china true junk  like the kind that a lot of times won t even get you by in a pinch  this is not that  i would describe these as a perfect homeowners kit  the steel in these tools is impressively hard  particularly in the bit set  i broke  damaged  or generally rendered unusable   screwdrivers in the month of april  the bit set included with this is higher quality and harder than any no name brand you ll find  the allen wrenches are slightly less hard than most of my others  but by design  allen keys aren t going to take on too much damage for a homeowner that sticks to putting together furniture  hanging things  maybe a little appliance work  etc  you can t go wrong here  if you know what you re doing you could even do a bit of light duty mechanic work  add a drill and a saw and you ve got some incredible versatility here this kit is set up to cover as many bases as possible in as little pieces as possible  for instance  instead of including a metric and sae set of sockets  they include the odd sae size that would be the metric  i wish a lot of my more expensive tools would do this  in some cases   same with the allen keys  they don t include a  mm allen key  a common size       is typically too big  but they do include a  mm hex bit which would take its place if you can only have one tool or tool set for twenty bucks  make this one it   you won t be sorry      
1,5.0,                       not high end but why would you expect it for the price  i ve spent years around high end tools and when i moved  i couldn t bring my stocked tool chest with me  i needed something to have handy for when small projects popped up and this set does the job  yeah  eventually i ll upgrade or send my tools across the country but for now  this set suffices  perfect for the weekend warrior  i ve used it to hang my flat screen and to tear apart my ps  to clean it out  a set that doesn t advertise for more than it really is and for that i can respect it      
2,5.0,                       i was looking for a mini tool set to use around the house for a few renovation projects  i looked in the store and online  i came across cartman      piece tool set  i usually use craftsman and i didn t want to waste any money  after researching this  i decided to purchase this tool set  i am glad i bought it  the case is small and can be stored anywhere securely  no worries about anything falling out  it has a basic tool just for about anything you need depending on the work that you are completing  i have used it to tighten up screws  hang boards on the wall  and take apart assemble a faucet  so far so good  i like it  i did not have to spend much on this  it was at a great price  i would recommend this if you are looking for tool kit to get you started or just to have around      
3,1.0,                       my friend picked this out for me bc i m a real girly girly and i have no idea how to build anything  recently single i needed a toolbox but had no idea which one would be good  there are literally so many options  it just made me more confused lol i just needed something simple to build some things around my apt  i was content with my friends choice   this one  even tho i m not a fan of orange i felt like it was a good price for things i would def use  unfortunately when i received my package i opened it to discover a lot of tools were missing   i even had to come back on here to double check it wasn t an error on my part and those items weren t included  but no they shipped me a tool box with missing tools lol i couldn t believe it my first tool box was a fool box lol long story short i sent it back im still waiting for my refund   i still have no tools  disappointed is a understatement      
4,5.0,                       gave this to my daughter and her boyfriend as a house closing gift  it s their first place and  as i told them  it s handy to have a good set of tools for all those little things that come up as a homeowner  it would take time and money to piecemeal together the tools in this set  i know how many times i had to run out to buy a tool to fix a single problem this is a nice sturdy set in a great compact storage case  they should be able to grab the case and find the tool they need to fix most any minor household problem  having so many tools in one case will reduce the number of times you grab a single tool out of box thinking it s what you need to fix something only to find out you need another tool or an additional tool   can you tell that i ve suffered my frustrations doing this more than a few times    the tools seems durable and comfortable to use  we just pulled things out and played around with a bit   over time  they may need to supplement this with heavier duty tools for a project but this should serve them well for years to come i looked at a few sets online and in local stores but for the sheer number and variety of tools in this set  and the price  this was by far  the best value highly recommend this set for your basic household needs  the kids were really pleased to get this  it seems silly but most people get new first time homeowners pretty things  and i will when they finish renovations and move in  but this is a great gift that anyone would be grateful to have when some random thing needs fixing      
5,4.0,                       the choice of tools in this set is really helpful and it is made with good quality material      
6,4.0,                       this  kitchen  tool box works for me  however  i wish it included a small level  i was comparing tools with a level and this cartman with a box cutter  i went for the box cutter and hoped i could  eye ball  the picture hanging  the box the tools are in could use some upgrades and a little better design but it stands between my refrig and wall quite nicely  the tools themselves are quality as cartman always is      
7,4.0,                       i needed a set of tools for minor projects here and there in my college dorm   this toolset works perfectly for that   if you wanted a collection of tools for more serious projects  or for bigger handyman jobs  then you definitely will want something a little more expensive not that this is a big deal  but a little bit of the finish  and i think the metal too  has worn off from both the screwdrivers after using them several times   they still work fine  but i wonder if the ends will become stripped eventually anyway  fantastic value   highly recommended if you need some tools for some minor projects here and there      
8,3.0,                       so this is a mixed review  the set seems pretty well made for the price and is well stocked  i shipped it into my daughters new house in college  we were flying and i did not being tools  in two days i had to build a bed  a chair and a desk  my main tool was the screwdriver  it has a dimpled handle no doubt for grip  however the hard plastic of the dimples really ate up my hands   this is a great set for a quick job and to have laying around  i would look further for my next kid to make sure the handles were easier on the hands      
9,3.0,                       i recently lost my shop in an oregon wildfire   i had spent the last     years accumulating tools and finally got to a point in life where i had the right tool for the job at hand   not anymore because of all the clean up and repair i needed to do on my property i needed a complete set of tools quickly  i chose the cartman     piece toolset   for the money the quality is pretty decent and the selection of tools is exactly what i was looking for my only gripe at this point is the      socket driver doesn t have an adapter to use the smaller sockets  i had to run some      lag bolts and the larger handle on the       driver would have given me more leverage  also the bit drivers break pretty easy under a work load  i ve lost two philips bits already from driving screws      
10,2.0,                       i regret waiting past the return window to send this back because it was a waste of money   all the tools feel really cheap but my biggest disappointment is that nothing will stay in it s place   the tools are supposed to  pop  into place and stay but every time i open it back up stuff is everywhere  and yes i have gone through a couple times and made sure they were properly positioned before closing it i have offered other people a couple tools to use  tape measure  some screws and a screwdriver  and everyone commented after that next time they d rather use  real  tools the nails and screws that came with it are so tiny as to be useless  the thumbtacks are more helpful      
11,1.0,                       after having tried to use this se  a few times  it s my opinion that it s the most useless set i have ever owned  one of the socket wrench heads is jammed onto the adapter for the socket handle  there is no rachet for the sockets  and cannot be removed  rendering all of the other sockets totally useless with the set  the most used tool around the house is not included in the kit   standard pliers  kit contains needle nosed pliers  but no standard pliers  the handles on the smaller allen wrenches bend when being used      
12,4.0,                       i bought this for a few tasks in a house i just moved to  it s pretty good for     and served its purpose  but some of the tools are definitely better than others  the screwdrivers have a decent selection of bits and are fine  the tape measure is also exactly what you d expect and probably so are the wrenches and hex keys  haven t used them  but they look fine  on the other hand  the pliers are neither here nor there  they re tiny and look like you d use them them for electrical work  but they don t have the holes typically used for wire stripping and they re not actually that sharp  i tried to strip a bit of the covering off of a wire and couldn t do it without losing a few strands of copper  the hammer is similarly small and lightweight    it worked for installing some curtain rods  but requires both more force and more precision than a traditional hammer finally  the case itself is compact and easy to carry  but very hard to open  it s almost painful to move the latches when not wearing gloves   also  the tools don t always stay secured in their places and since they re on both the top and the bottom of the case  there s always the chance of something falling out no matter how you open it in summary  better versions of some tools will probably have to be bought separately  but this is still good value for the money      
13,5.0,                       i bought this for our daughter in her new apartment  she loves tools  which has made her a success as an or nurse  but had always used her dad s tools  now that she has an apartment of her own and is putting things together  i bought her this tool box as a birthday present   it was fun to see her examine each tool in the box carefully and figure out how each one worked before she dug into her birthday cake   the selection of tools is quite complete for the occasional handy woman s usage   and is all packed together ingeniously  i recommend this tool set for everyday chores around the house      
14,5.0,                       i needed a bunch of tools to put my bike together and this tool box mostly delivered  i used the wrench  excellent   philips screwdriver  the big one was a bit iffy  the smaller one worked well when used   wirestrippers  don t ask     and attempted to use the allen keys  unfortunately my bike needed metric keys  and since it doesn t say anywhere that these are sae    here you go  i ended up going to local homedepot to get mm hex keys        and was able to put my bike together  i wish there was some space in the box to put small additional tools you may have around  but all in all   good value      
15,3.0,                       decent selection of tools but the quality leaves much to be desired  the hammer was glued on and the box holding the nails was busted  would make a decent starter kit but as for gifting them  would go with something else      
16,5.0,                       great value toolkit i m your average consumer so i m not looking to do much  or any  work around the house i got it just in case i needed it  and it had been useful in more occasions than i had imagined everything seems quality  i haven t gotten around to using every tool included  simply because the need has not arisen yet i have used the hammer and it felt very sturdy and did its job i have used the boxcutter as well and as far as i can tell  it is quite sharp  cut through leather of sofa like it was a piece of cake  i think this is something everyone will find useful at some point  and if it won t hurt your wallet  then it s probably a good idea to get it      
17,4.0,                       i really like this set so far  i was looking for a basic set just for minor repairs around the house  i did take a star off because some of the tools don t stay in their place  when you open the box some tools are sure to be loose even if you re careful  some of the tools also felt a little light  somewhat cheap feeling but they do still work      
18,5.0,                       quality is great for what you are paying  its understood buying this that the tools will not be elite quality or that it will solve every problem you encounter  this is however a great first tool set to be able to handle     of tasks you ll encounter and the slowly add specific tools for the specific tasks needed  highly recommended for a first resort      
19,5.0,                       i made a move into a small apartment recently  i wanted a decent tool kit for practical use in case something broke  after searching around for the best deal i found this kit and i couldn t be happier  the quality to price ratio went beyond my expectations  i would recommend this kit to anyone who is looking for a toolkit to fit their basic needs  this would also make for a great gift to anyone going out on their own for the first time      
20,5.0,                       this is a perfect set for home or anywhere needed  great price and the quality of the tools will last a very very long time  only one thing  no pliers  oh well easy to get  excellent purchase though  you won t be disappointed     
21,4.0,                    tool box was completely sealed with plastic  some components don t have that clean finish which reveals some of its flaws  but  for its price range this is an overall great tool box to have for low mid usage  la caja de herramientas estaba completamente sellada con pl stico   algunos componentes se les notan sus imperfecciones   pero en general por este precio esta caja de herramientas es suficiente para funciones de min med uso          
22,4.0,                       i m not going to pretend like this is the best tool kit ever  however  you get what you pay for  and in this case  it s quite a lot of value  the box isn t the sturdiest plastic  it came dinged up   probably from shipping   and the tools aren t the highest quality     see hammer picture   but they aren t flimsy  besides the box cutter   also  the box is decently difficult to open  which probably isn t a bad thing  but some of the locking areas aren t great  two of my wrenches were bouncing around willy nilly cause they don t lock in place  but overall  it has almost everything you ll need for a quick project  would have liked to see a level in there as well      
23,2.0,                       these tools are cheap  the hammer has a plastic handle  if you use it for anything other than hanging pictures in your house i am afraid it will snap  also  the     piece set that i bought comes with socket heads but no socket handle  just what the heck are you supposed to do with the socket heads then  do yourself a favor and buy tools that are better made      
24,5.0,                       this is a fantastic little kit with pretty much everything you would need in most circumstances  it s very well thought out  and extremely practical for the money  i got tired of running up and down stairs every time i needed to use a tool on the other level of our house  this was perect for those annoying little odd job things you need a quick tool for around the house      
25,1.0,                       i bought this for my daughter for a christmas gift to help her to fix things around her apartment  the day came when she needed it  and it wasn t worth a damn  i suggest going to homedepot and get some huskey tool kit  at least it will do the job   save your money  don t buy this guido huckball was here and gone      
26,3.0,                       the plastic that holds all the tools is super cheap and gets deformed almost immediately  this has happened multiple times over the few months i ve had this product  that means that none of the tools stay in their place  and when i open the toolkit  tools fall all over each other   the tools themselves are fine  that said  i ve seen cheaper sets with levels  so i was disappointed that this one didn t have it      
27,2.0,                       the inside of the case is made of probably the cheapest to second cheapest plastic you could get  it was bent up from the moment i opened the case  the allen wrench in that photo was snapped in half from the moment i pulled it out of the slot  if you re going to buy this product  make sure its on a super sale and make sure you check every part immediately  other than that the rest of the tools work the way they should     
28,4.0,                       good kit for the money   lots of different tools  especially with the    different screwdriver tips for almost any type of screwhead  nice compact and sturdy organization case as well  some construction seems a little less durable than professional grade tools  however they seem perfectly fine for the beginner do it yourselfer and regular households  great starter tool kit      
29,3.0,                       i was extremely excited when i received the tool kit  it has everything i need for small projects  i bought the tool kit to help me while i move and it definitely has been effective in that purpose  however  the tape measure broke  i ve used it only   times and the silver metal piece broke right off  now i cannot use the tape measure   i didn t  and still don t  think the tools are cheaply made but the tape measure was and now i m disappointed      
30,4.0,                       this tool set comes with a lot and they re good quality for the price  i only use them for smaller things around the house and they work well for that  my only complaint is the case  very obviously cheap  i expected that from other reviews and the price  but still   and every time i close the case  some tools break lose and fall out of their spot  other than that  it s worth the price and i would recommend it as a nice toolset for odd jobs around the house      
31,5.0,                       got this set of tools because husband really didn t like me using his   for the price  i think they are quite good   i have lots of plants  planters  gardening pots  shelves  etc   that always need some kind of mending  the tools have yet to fail me  and no more dealing w  picky hubby over the tools        
32,4.0,                       this kit is just what i needed for my kitchen  it is handy  and has all the home tools i need in one organized place     
33,5.0,                       bought this for a lady friend to have a few tools around her place  they looked study enough for light household type repair work and to top it off my lady friend was very thrilled with it  perfect to maybe send off with that college student or daughter son getting their first place if they don t have any basic simple hand tools       
34,5.0,                       i was more than pleased with the cartman     piece tool set  it arrived safe and sound and in great condition as expected  the box that it came in is a keeper since it didn t have any damage to it whatsoever so i can always use it again for something else   i was also surprised by the weight of the tool kit  it is heavier than i expected and when dealing with tools that is a good thing in my opinion  as for the   star rating i gave  for  durability  that is only because i haven t used it much yet though i will be sure to update if anything goes wrong in the near future      
35,5.0,                       i have purchased one for my home and one for my office  this is a great little set for minor task  the kit is fantastic because it holds all the tools in the slots so things don t fall out when you open it  i am very pleased with this purchase and i believe it will hold up a long time      
36,4.0,                       i was looking for an all in one kit for basic home maintenance and repair and this was such a great deal  i haven t used it yet  but the tools look well constructed  i d give it   stars  but the hammer isn t quite as heavy duty as the rest of the tools in the kit  but for      i m a super happy fix it gal      
37,4.0,                       i just began living alone and needed a basic tool set for random tasks that may arise  this set is a great value for the price  the tools are sturdy and almost everything you d need is here  my only gripe is there was no level included  i know it s just one item  and i don t mean to be a downer  but why include screws and fasteners and not a level  as long as you understand that s missing and you re okay with that  i highly recommend this product  i just can t justify   stars      
38,1.0,                       purchased this set in may     the off gases from the plastic were so bad that i left it open to air out for over   months i wanted to like this set         butstill terrible when i hold a tool  my hand smells like i spilled gasoline on it really nasty stuff     
39,5.0,                       as a suggestion  the heads should also be metric  we can get them separately although  also i m missing the extender for the heads  it s not critical  but highly desirable and it s usually a part of the set  the rest if ok  looks good and worked as a big surprise for a gift      
40,3.0,                       of course this isn t a tool set you would use to build a house but it s good for the little things you need around the house and then a little bit more  when you ask your boyfriend to fix something it s a good chance he won t have to go and get a tool from his truck      
41,5.0,                       i purchased this toolset as a graduation gift for my neighbor s son  he has already used it a lot and was thankful to have it as he gets ready to go off to college  his parents even told us that they were planning on getting him a tool kit to take and keep in his car  but this gift was perfect  this was a great gift idea        
42,4.0,                       gave it   stars b c i was working on fixing a faucet right after it arrived and still had to head to lowes to get the right size phillips  contents look good though so i m sure it will be useful in the future  also cannot yet speak to the product s durability and sturdiness      
43,4.0,                       this is a nice kit for the money  haven t used it yet much  i notice as someone else mentioned the hammer is not too good  but i didn t buy it for that  i ll update review if necessary  you do have to be careful opening it  bc parts will dislodge from their seats and mess up the tray  no big deal though      
44,5.0,                       this is such a great deal for everything you receive  i have used several things out of it multiple things now and everything is of great quality  sturdiness  and solid  as a    y o girl who only really uses tools for diys  decor  and furniture  this set has everything i have needed      
45,5.0,                       this product was exactly as expected  sturdy and utilitarian  the items did tend to fall a bit if opened on the wrong side  but that is my only complaint  and it has been the case for almost all tool kits of this style i have ever used   it was given to a college student to be her starter set of tools  and she thinks it will more than satisfy her diy and handyman needs in her first apartment      
46,1.0,                       this review is for the     piece tool set i feel as if i have been cheated  the fantastic reviews on this site seem to link all the tools sets together i bought this tool set because it seemed to be amazon s  best seller  however  as soon as i open the package  i was extremely disappointed it is very cheaply made  the tool box looks as if the plastic hinges will snap after just a few times of opening and closing  everything looks very cheap i have learned a lesson from this  pay really good attention to which model is actually getting the great reviews i am one very dissatisfied customer      
47,5.0,                       i see that a lot of people here are saying that things fall off of their box  when i push them in and they  click  they ll stay in place  i haven t had any problem with that  i don t use like     of the tools that are in this box  but at this price  even the things that i actually use would cost me much more than what was being offered here  it s a good start      
48,5.0,                       i was looking for a tool kit for small  ordinary jobs around the house   this fits the bill nicely  has most everything you need for ordinary repairs  etc   it is well made  and comes at a great price   glad i bought it      
49,5.0,                       i m amazed at how much came in this box  how nicely it packs away  and how relatively sturdy the tools are   i mean  you re not going to build a house with these  but for the occasional fix up projects  they are totally fine      
50,5.0,                       this is a lightweight tool set that has everything one needs  i recently moved into a new town home and of course  there is lots to put together  screw and unscrew  hammer etc this little kit had everything i needed in fact  i ordered a second one for a friend      
51,3.0,                       the toolbox is has a lot of useful tools but the box itself is horrible  the tools feel falling from the box and whenever you try to close the box they get get in between  the tools are nice but the box is very disappointing      
52,5.0,                       perfect little kit for household projects  we moved recently  and assembling furniture has been a hassle without the right tools  it s also very portable  and can fit right underneath a car seat  definitely worth the price       
53,5.0,                       i ordered this for my own personal tool kit  it has everything i need to do household jobs  such as  hanging blinds  curtains  etc  it is small  light weight and is very good quality  i love this tool kit and would recommend it to all ladies who need the essential tools to do the every day jobs we so often have to do on our own  i love my tool kit       
54,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my granddaughter  she is a new homeowner and did not have any tools  this was perfect for her for little repairs that she could do herself  plus everything is packed away in the handy carry case      
55,5.0,                       i bought this for my wife for christmas       she was always complaining tools she would need to fix a loose screw or a pair of pliers needed to tighten something up were always getting lost  she would then have to go out in the garage and grab a tool from my tool chest   this is her own little tool chest to keep in the kitchen      
56,5.0,                       i purchased this as a gift for a female friend who always borrows my tools  she lives in an apartment  so i thought this would be a great idea  it doesn t take up much space and all of the tools have a place inside  these are good quality tools as well      
57,5.0,                       this was a gift for a new homeowner who had a lot of furnishings to put together  the recipient told me that he uses these tools frequently for all kinds of projects   he is very pleased with this set      
58,5.0,                       older grandsons always like fixing things  working on his four wheeler  etc   he loves it and feels all grown up with a tool set of his own   he is very responsible with his things so it was worth the money      
59,4.0,                       doing very well overall   nice to have the basics in one location   my tool box raided so many times it s hard to find anything  sometimes container doesn t hold the individual tools in place very well      
60,5.0,                       just moved into my first apartment after college and i ve been able to do everything myself   even fixing cupboards  comes with a handy box of nails which is where i also keep extra screws from ikea sets and whatnot the tape measure could be longer  but honestly it s all you need to be your own little handyman      
61,5.0,                       i like having tools i my need around the house  i like having them in one place and easy to carry around  i haven t used them yet but they look well made and it has all the tools i may need      
62,5.0,                       this tool set is optimized for electrical work   includes wire stripper and terminal crimper   the screw drivers and pliers are the perfect size for working with electrical outlets and switches   all tools are excellent quality with excellent grips that are well insulated   only thing i can criticize is that some of the tools are not held very securely in the case and come loose      
63,3.0,                       the quality is more or less what you d expect for the price  just about everything seems to work but don t expect it to last very long  the reason why it s getting bumped down to   stars is because the it has one of the flimsiest box cutters i ve ever handled  to the point where it doesn t even feel safe to use  and likely isn t      
64,5.0,                       i m not a handy guy    but when ppl come over they sometimes ask for tools which i never have the right ones  bought this  sits in my garage looking pretty and now whenever someone needs a tool i point them there and no ones complained that it didn t have what they needed  success    stars     
65,2.0,                       you get what you pay for    i got this for an extra set of tool in my travel trailer and i m not sure i can fully rely on it  they ll work in a pinch but any type of torque could probably snap these like a stick     
66,1.0,                       i knew for the price these wouldn t be good but i wanted to keep them in the car in case of emergency  however the metal is such bad material and so soft these would do nothing but tease you in an emergency  you wouldn t be able to fix anything  i ve never seen a wrench stripped before      
67,5.0,                       comes with everything you need to do basic household repairs and tasks  the tools are sturdy and fit into place nicely  the box is compact  closes well and stores easily  there s a good variety of magnetic screwdriver bits  even some more uncommon sizes  the tools are really well made too  i assumed from the price that the quality would be passable  but the grips and the durability of the metal parts has been fantastic  none of these tools have stripped  for the price  this is a solid purchase      
68,5.0,                       honestly loving the fact that the screwdriver is magnetic  didn t know this prior to buying so when i found out i was extremely happy    loving the tools  they re very handy and get everything i need done  done perfectly c      
69,1.0,                       i didn t really like this product  i feel like it wasn t good quality  i will be returning soon and getting a different one  also the packaging wasn t great either  over all i would skip on this      
70,5.0,                       i purchased this for my grandson for his college dorm room      seems with the nice assortment of tools he should be able to fix most any thing that may go wrong   he really liked the compact size of the carrying case   easy to store      
71,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          no use of the     pieces if i cant even use most of them   one of the screwdrivers is missing  im not used to using these tools so i was confused at first on how to use the screw tips when i realized the toolbox i got was missing a screwdriver to fit those screw tips  instead i got   flat head screwdrivers  attached a photo  didnt open the toolkit until today coz i didnt need it  whats the point of a toolbox if its useless when you need it      
72,4.0,                       this tool kit has pretty much anything that i would need  only thing i ve noticed is that the coating on the tools flecks off during use  not that i care  but someone might  you get what you pay for and as long as the tools don t break bend  i couldn t care less how they look      
73,5.0,                       great all in one tool set for your first home  this is a must have set for people who will be doing a lot of furniture assembling and the like  plus  you never know when you are going to need a hammer or a screw driver or a good pair of pliers  this is a great set that covers all of your basic tool needs      
74,5.0,                       very nice set with a lot of different tools   all the basics you need basically   i bought one for each of my son who went off to college   it is dandy handy and a great price      
75,5.0,                       for    bucks this is absolutely a bad ass standard tool kit  if you have certain tools that you need to be very high quality then by those  but as a standard  organized set of tools you can afford to have banged up but get the job done  you can t beat it  as a standard basic tool kit you just can t beat it  all the driver pieces you could use  all the standard wrenches  i couldn t say enough about it in this age of over priced tools  highly recommend for apprentices  students  children  and for basic amateurs of cars and repair      
76,5.0,                       the only thing i didn t care for was some of the tools fall out of their spot depending on how you open the lid   other than that  good mix of tools  easy to carry around to get a job done      
77,5.0,                       packaged arrived complete w everything in it  whole package fits my hubby s needs for our small apt  only used the philips screwdriver so far  but it seemed durable and sturdy enough      
78,5.0,                       i bought it for my dad on father s day and he absolutely loves it  so far i have no complaints about this product  i highly recommend this product and the seller for it was a great investment  thank you      
79,5.0,                       i haven t used every part and its not like i m expecting snap on quality tools but i am happy with them so far  everything has been sturdy and solid yes i would buy it again      
80,5.0,                       first of all  for people with complaints and negative comments    it s    bucks  this is a great tool kit for the money   i purchased this for an emergency go bag  i needed something with the basic essentials  compact  and semi light weight  this definitely fit my criteria and i m very happy for     bucks       
81,5.0,                       this modest yet adequate well priced tool set is the best bang for your buck  this won t be suitable for a repair shop business or automechanic but it is more than enough for the average joe to get things done around the house and complete their honey do list  i would buy again     
82,5.0,                       i bought these so i d have some basic tools around to assemble shelves  hang things  and other light home maintenance  they work great for everything i ve needed i m not a professional and will only use these on occasion and they re just right for me      
83,5.0,                       bought this for my mom to have a good little tool kit at her house when i couldn t find a simple flat head  it s a good kit  pretty simple but a good deal      
84,5.0,                       took awhile to arrive but perfect for a young man starter set of tools  he is thrilled to have quality tools to work with while creating new things with his hands      
85,5.0,                       the carrying case makes this very handy if you live in a small apartment  was able to build a mayfair tv stand and mount a tv on the wall with these tools  great starter kit if you re moving out on your own for the first time  would eventually like to upgrade to a more sophisticated set when i have a larger place      
86,5.0,                       bought this for a trip and it turned out i needed several tools in this kit  sturdy tools but the mini screwdrivers are flimsy   worth the money      
87,4.0,                       great tool set for the price  you can t beat it  the heavier tools on the top tend to want to fall out as you go to close it  but otherwise everything works fine  the case is not bulky so it s easy to store      
88,1.0,                       i bought this kit to leave at an apartment i am renovating  the first tool i used was the tape measure  which did the job for three windows before the hook snapped off  causing the ruler to retract into the holder  i took apart the tape measure for what should have been a quick fix  but the springs seemed cheaply made and the whole thing was quickly unsalvageable  hope the rest of the tools turn out alright  but the tape measure self destructing within   minutes does not bode well      
89,5.0,                       this was for a christmas present and i am very happy with it   i do not use tools myself  so i cannot judge the durability or sturdiness of the product   for the price  it is a great gift with plenty of pieces and it should hold up for a long time      
90,5.0,                       this is a christmas present  but i did open it  i love it i might buy an other set for me   it came in faster than iexpected  i m very happy with it thank you very much a very satisfied customer        
91,5.0,                       sent this to my son as he told me he had misplaced so many of his tools he needed another set  i sent him this set as it had good reviews and i felt it was a good value for the price  my son agreed      
92,5.0,                       my daughter has moved out on her own  and this is a great set   i can t testify to the quality  but it is a really impressive set with almost anything she d need      
93,5.0,                       i usually do not buy tools off the internet  but i daw this set decided to give it a try  the price was with in reason  this is used around the home  they are sturdy enough for what i do with them      
94,5.0,                       this was a gift so i really don t know how well it will hold up but it looks great   it was purchased as a spare tool set to have at my son in law s new office so if and when he needs a tool he will have it there  it is nice and compact and in a case for convenient storage

96,4.0,                       i was looking for a small ish tool kit to carry in the car for trips and such  this is perfect  the carry case  with slots for each tool  prevents any irritating rattling that is the bane of car travel  the size of the case fits perfectly underneath my car seat and takes up little room  yet has such a nice compliment of tools that i feel prepared for most needs  thank you      
97,4.0,                       living in a one bedroom apartment there is not much use for the toolkit but for small repairs and this works perfectly   all the furniture i bought for my apartment needed to be assembled and this kit came in handy and had every tool i needed plus more   the reason i gave   out of   stars was because the hammer looks like the top part is just glued on and you can see lots of glue residue  however it still works for what i needed it for  so definitely a great buy      
98,5.0,                       good set for travel  will work well in the rv  has a great selection of tools and sockets has been used so many times   just the right stuff for quick repairs and work

101,5.0,                       i needed something to keep in the house  since all my other tools are in large cabinets in the garage and my wife was unhappy going outside to get a screwdriver or hammer  this kit is perfect  just the right selection of tools for basic light home maintenance in a durable case that isn t out of place being stored in a kitchen cabinet      
102,5.0,                       great for light jobs around the house  i ve found this kit very useful and there s so much in it for the money  i m very satisfied with this purchase  if you re doing heavy duty work this probably won t meet your needs  but for small jobs at home it s perfect      
103,5.0,                       i purchased this set right around the time i purchased a new home   between the screw drivers  allen wrenches  electrical tape  hammer  pliers  wrenches and sockets this thing has been ridiculously useful and easy to carry around with me vs my toolbag   i purchased this for my teenage son but have come back to buy one for myself      
104,5.0,                       we recently moved from florida for a family emergency and the movers left my husband tools behind  needless to say my husband was out of sorts not having any tools  i saw this a it was perfect birthday gift  my husband appreciated having the variety of tools to use

112,5.0,                       the case isn t the sturdiest thing in the world  but considering how cheap this tool kit is  it s to be expected  the tools inside are all durable and there s tools for just about everything you need around the house

118,4.0,                       this bad boy is slick  compact and handy   the tools themselves are excellent quality for the price   the only reason i didn t give it five stars is because it s lacking simple pliers and a small level   those are the only two items i find myself returning to my  big  tool box to retrieve

124,4.0,                       as other reviewers have noted  one of the tools will not stay in its spot and falls upon opening the case  other than this  and the cheapness readily apparent in the handles of the screwdrivers  there is nothing else wrong with this tool set  everything works as it should

127,3.0,                       tools look cheaply made unfinished  ie glue marks  scratch easily  and the case that they come in is plastic with latches that don t stay closed  the tools have been helpful so far   i have had no problems using them  my only complaints are that the tape measure still retracts on its  locked  setting and does not hold in place at all when attempting to make measurements and the cutter is pretty flimsy and easy to break     
128,5.0,                       the person who was gifted this set of tools was thrilled  he had been borrowing tools from home to use at his new home  it is a good starter set of tools      
129,4.0,                       very good set but don t know why a levelwasn t included   hanging pictures is going tobe one of the main uses for a set like this it s exactly like the photo i guess i just missedthe fact that a level is not included  but still worth the money

132,1.0,                       really bad quality specially the hammer  bought   at the same time and give one as a gift before knowing the quality when i finally decided to open mine i notice the hammer was the cheapest one they ever made and glue on very sloppy     
133,5.0,                       i ordered this tool set to have on hand at our beach house  my husband was skeptical of my purchase   until it arrived  we are both very happy with the variety and the durability of this set of tools

145,3.0,                       i had to send this back as it made no sense to have sockets without the socket wrench    otherwise i would have kept it as it was a good value for the money

166,2.0,                       this set is a nice complete set of tools you may need  but very cheaply made   no big jobs for these tools

179,3.0,                       the toolbox might be good for light weight use  but they are made of low quality plastic especially for the cutter  hammer  and tape ruler  wrenches are not quite useful as they can t fit with a regular sink hose

248,5.0,                       great tool set  more tools for the money    durability is great and so is the sturdiness   i definitely recommend these tools  they remind me of a generic form of craftsman   i think your just paying for the name brand of craftsman   but these tools are made by cartsman   still a great tool  d  jones
