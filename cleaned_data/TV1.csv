0,5.0 ,                       i replaced one of the earliest samsung lcd screens which cost       years back  first i must say that i live in a rural area and have antenna television  this tv exceeded the air channels i previously could get  then came the surprise  when i connected it to wifi  here comes  samsung tv plus   i now have hundreds of channels free  next  the apps are much faster than my blue ray player  you can switch from tv to amazon to netflix in seconds  the picture quality is unreal  i watch alot of old tv shows from the   s and   s  i never thought id be right on the set of gunsmoke lol  the one and only downfall is the speakers  volume ranges from the show to the commericals greatly  i highly recommend a soundbar  all in all a great tv      
1,5.0 ,                       i saw this on one of the amazon prime truck deals   i was going to pass but the price was right   it arrived within   days and the delivery was exceptional  even by amazon standards  it s a large tv  but the physical set up was simple even for one person   i don t have cable so i connected my antenna and set up my smart functions   most of the apps i use were already loaded so all i had to do was log in   it even updated my xbox   the universal remote works on everything connected  one remote to control them all  the picture and sound quality is great   it gives the space a true home theater feel  which is what i was after    i watched a john wick marathon and haven t left the sofa all day   i m beyond happy with this purchase      
2,1.0 ,                       worst tv i ve ever bought  do yourself a favor  buy a sony instead  had this tv repaired and it s still giving me problems  and i ve only had it for   months      
3,5.0 ,                       i already had two high end samsung tvs on upper floors   i bought this smaller  lower end tv for the basement in my home gym   lower end in that all the specs are higher on my other tvs  size  motion rate  etc    but it looks perfectly fine   had no trouble with setting it up   i  like having all my tvs by the same brand   they all have the same remotes  finally got rid of the old projection tv that was down there   so happy all my tvs are now smart   samsung seems to the top of line in tvs now      
4,5.0 ,                       alright  first off i never write reviews ever this tv is amazing especially for the price  i buy multiple tvs every year for my business  hi end   k      p  roku  amazon  all of it this far and above the best bang for buck  k tv i have ever seen it rivals so many higher models from other manufacturers my first arrival was a cracked screen  however amazon replaced it for me in less than a week  the second one came with zero issues  so many things being shipped these days its always a dice roll moving tvs all that said  if your on the fence  and spending hours looking at other tvs within    to     dollars  stop searching and buy this one      
5,3.0 ,                       tv is fine  especially for the price   but samsung s os is absolutely terrible   it is super slow and glitchy   they don t let you download certain apps   it barely ever works with screen share from an android   and its loaded with a bunch of  channels  that you will never use  which further gums up the os   just overall poor performance   just buy a chromecast and forget about it      
6,1.0 ,                       tv has an unwatchable dark picture when using built in apps  hdmi input displays fine   samsung support setup a repair ticket and cancelled it after a week without telling me why  the second support ticket was cancelled too  finally  they informed me that no repair techs were in my area and they would have to replace it  after another week  they informed me that they can t replace it because there are none in stock so they would have to issue me a refund and pick up the tv  then they told me they can t pick up the tv because of my location but would still issue me a refund  i m still waiting on the refund  i live in northern colorado and not in a rural location by any means and yet samsung is unable to service my area apparently  the entire support experience has been ongoing for nearly a month to try to get this resolved      
7,1.0 ,                       i have never experienced anything like this before  when i turned on the television  the picture showed that the screen was clearly damaged   completely unacceptable   never again      
8,1.0 ,                       smart tv  i thought i could down load all the normal apps that i use on my ipad   no  it only has very few apps you can down load   no cnn  no nhk world  etc   i thought something wrong with the tv  i called the samsung  the person was very good with explanations  samsung doesn t support those apps   so you can t get them   it has all the junk tv apps already built in   you end up subscribing cable service to get channels you want to get   also  sound system is not very good   being      i expect better sound system   if i knew  i could have kept my old samsung tv with cable service   check your favorite apps first before purchase it   it would be expensive waste if you don t get what you need or want      
9,1.0 ,                       product arrived with what seems to be a crack within the tv screen  it does not turn on  very disappointing      
10,4.0 ,                       happy with my purchase the picture and features are good enough for me   i did a lot of research online before this purchase and quickly became overwhelmed with the over analysis of picture quality  refresh rate   dark contrast   screen reflection   screen brightness for your room   bottom line is the picture looked good to me and all the other stuff i am sure for professionals is important but i couldn t  tell   i purchased the     viewing from    feet away and am happy with it   the apple air play works great to connect with iphone or mac book  for screen mirroring      
11,4.0 ,                       so i give this tv four stars  haven t bought one in   years so forgive me if the stuff i talk about is the new status quo  for starters love how the tv automatically finds my local channels and auto controls fire stick  yes i have to use fire stick only because samsung still has not talked twitch into making an app for their products  but having the fire stick part of your hub menu saves a point from being deducted since it s the same effort  meaning i don t have to switch sources  it acts as if hdmi is its own app  plus i don t have to switch remotes so again a huge plus  tv is not out of the box ready  super hard to watch movie show that is dark  but changing to dynamic mode then expert settings and turning shadow detail to   really helped  a good balance unless you wanna switch back and forth because dynamic mode without tinkering is too bright on its own if not watching night scenes  the recommendations on the hub is super annoying and if i was in bad mood would give tv   stars because of it  aside from that  first week tv kept freezing stalling but heck it was sitting in warehouse for months so i let that slide  works perfectly now  all in all good buy  ps samsung add the darn twitch app please      
12,1.0 ,                       we tried everything to adjust the picture   we read multiple articles online etc   simply put  the picture on this tv is substandard   we are sending it back and sticking with a       the quality isn t even close      
13,1.0 ,                       unfortunately this samsung  tv is not compatible with the most common cable box in america  cisco       many other companies market this box under different names  samsung customer support waa unable to provide and cable boxes that would be compatible  simply said  we don t have that information  we have half a dozen samsung panels in our home but will not purchase any more if this is the lazy support      
14,3.0 ,                       the tv is fine and does everything it is supposed to do   however  navigating the television via the remote is a tedious hassle   a good remote allows you to use that one remote for tv and cable   this is not a good remote though   there is no number pad on the remote so you have to use a button on the remote that opens a number selector that scrolls from side to side   if you use the mic on the remote and say  seven  then you will get every show that remotely has the word seven in it appear on your screen   if you choose to scroll through channels using the channel button it is very slow moving between channels   the channel button goes up and down but if you press on the edge of it it opens up a guide to ppv movies and you have to use your cable remote to switch back to your guide for regular tv channels or else will only scroll through ppv channels   the remote has dedicated buttons for netflix  amazon  and samsung tv   these buttons are not programmable so your stuck with them as your default streaming buttons   you can open the menu to select other streaming services though   in that menu are services that are stuck on there and cannot be removed from the menu although services can be added to the menu   did i mention the remote is terrible      
15,1.0 ,                       the picture quality is pretty good but the brightness leaves a lot to be desired  if you are watching anything with dark scenes or playing a game with a dark atmosphere  you absolutely cannot use the tv without blinds or you must use it at night  if not  you re basically just going to be staring back at yourself through the screen also  let s make this      clear  this tv does not support    hz  so if you re thinking of picking it up for the new consoles  look elsewhere what really sucks about this tv is the smart features  the only feature i constantly come into contact with is the unbelievably annoying  audio setup   i bought this tv with the samsung sound bar bundle  you would think a sound bar made by the same brand would work with the tv but it just doesn t  when i first received the tv  every single day  the tv would go through setting up the sound bar for no reason at all  the tv will emit a high pitched tone for      seconds  then it ll say  setup complete   sometimes it will do this multiple times a day and can be incredibly frustrating when it interrupts some impactful moment in whatever media you re watching and it will definitely interrupt  because every time this  setup  process completes  the tv inexplicably switches to  tv speakers  instead of  optical hdmi  which results in echoing of the audio due to the sound bar still emitting sound  to fix this you have to make your way to the settings  which has no dedicated button on the remote  and switch the audio output from  tv speakers  to  optical hdmi  after updating the tv s firmware  this problem seemed to be resolved but it wasn t  every week it goes through the same process and on the day it decides to set itself up  it does it multiple times throughout that day  after scouring forums for solutions  i found that its a problem that people have had with this tv since it s release  on samsung s own forums  this complaint was constantly dismissed as a  feature   it s an obvious bug  by their moderation bot  never actually addressed by anyone at samsung  so they have no intention of fixing this problem   keep in mind this is not something exclusive to samsung sound bars perhaps the most annoying part of this issue is that  sometimes  once this  audio setup  is complete  you are able to use the tv s remote to adjust volume instead of the sound bar  most of the time you can t though as the tv often cannot recognize the sound bar  you read that right  a samsung tv cannot consistently recognize a samsung sound bar  so one week the tv works fine and is able to be controlled with only one remote but the next   weeks it will require that you use the sound bar remote to adjust the volume  it absolutely blows me away that samsung would just ignore this issue when it is such a common complaint online  its ridiculous that this is even an issue in the first place as these two items are made by samsung and are often bundled together i have the tv disconnected from the internet as i have a separate media device  but i am aware of the ads they hardcode into the tv s  smart interface  as it is another common complaint on forums  it s true  as other reviewers have said  that the tv requires   inputs to get to the setting page  i should know having to switch the audio over so many times tl dr  i wouldn t recommend this tv to anyone  there are tv s with better picture quality and better functionality with similar  less expensive price tags out there  not to mention  they probably have the ability to properly set up something as basic as a sound bar  do yourself a favor and look elsewhere      
16,3.0 ,                       for us dropping dollars for something like a tv in the      range isn t something we do lightly or can afford to do easily  we were still using an older    inch dynex    dp tv as our primary  living room tv with an older roku on it  we were excited to get a larger   k machine with smart features and only have to keep up with one controller instead of two  for our one stoplight town there is no cable or cable based internet  everyone uses a wireless hotspot for internet entertainment streaming  it usually works pretty good with a blip here and there occasionally this samsung got to be unwatchable because be it direct now  hulu  or pretty much any streaming service it would hang up frequently  we spent as much time watching a spinning symbol or get  oops  messages as we did actually seeing programs  i can t blame our internet speeds or the router much because my mother had no issues at the same time getting her programs on her little     insignia hooked to another roku  we can run a couple of computer ipads streaming video and her tv at the same time  even with everything off the samsung struggles  out of frustration i pulled out the old      dp max roku we used on the old tv and connected it to the samsung  runs great  just at      and we re back to two controllers  so we have this  k samsung     smart tv that we can only get continuous streaming on if we have it hooked to another streaming device and are stuck at      resolution  i could have gotten a basic tv for hundreds less at walmart and just hooked the roku to it the tv is annoying because when you turn it off the next time you turn it on it s dumps you into whatever is on samsung s streaming app instead of the last app service you were using  there is little on the samsung service we want to watch  we already have our preferences thank you  we also had some issues with the time  we set it properly and sometimes the display will be    hours off  turn off the tv and back on and it will  mostly  be correct then maybe it s the tizen os  but i m not really impressed with the performance of the os or the tv overall  the image is great  the user experience sucks  and not in a good way  there isn t a good tactile feel for the control ring or the ok button to make it easily usable without looking  you have to slide your thumb or finger around a good bit to find it when not looking  also when you are holding the remote with the fatter part in your hand as you normally would the control ring and button do not fall intuitively under your thumb  they are a too far up  the volume and channel buttons are okay  unless you are doing oatv the channel selection is a pretty much unused feature as all the functions of most streaming services are not using the channel button i m a licensed amatuer radio operator  even using computers to program some radios and run another one  i ve been messing with computers since the mid   s to include programming in a few languages back in the day  and have several echo dots in use around the house  so i m not tech impaired  other than the picture i don t find a lot to be happy about with this samsung tv  the os is not quite ready for primetime and the tv is more hindrance and frustration than it is helpful and a smooth your way smart device sad because i ve been a samsung phone guy since before there were smartphones and have a nice upper end point and shoot class camera i ve been pleased with  this tv  not worth the money      
17,1.0 ,                       i have bought samsung tvs  monitors and other products for years and have had zero issues with them    so far this tv is possibly the worst samsung product i have ever owned the tv itself is fine  but the tv software is completely glitched  the tv randomly becomes unresponsive to remote control  menus hang and freeze causing the tv software to crash and reset  setting up the tv without an internet connection or skipping the privacy policy makes the tv unusable  connecting the tv to the internet makes it unusable later on as well  you get  malware detection  warnings about the tv built in software it s a complete mess  this is not a finished product  i don t know why samsung is shipping this      
18,1.0 ,                       had to replace my    inch curved screen way too soon  the    inch replacement is not working    days after purchase  samsung support was useless solving the issue  they told me it needed to go to a samsung repair center  for replacement parts  i gave it to a friend who performed a factory reset  the tech was wrong i bought a new samsung   series it is malfunctioning at    days old  it will no access prime video  even though the app is built in to the tv and has a prime button on the remote  called samsung support and have been waiting for a call back      
19,3.0 ,                       pros   it s a large tv with a nice form factor  relatively cheap among  k tvs of this sizecons   i had some color issues initially and had to modify the settings to get certain games movies to look natural   the smart tv software is absolute garbage  the homescreen includes random advertisements and channels that i don t care about  and multiple apps don t work well  e g   streaming with accompanying ios app results in choppy audio and slow to refresh video  the hulu app freezes whenever an ad plays  i purchased a chromecast so that i could avoid using the  smart  features as much as possible      
20,5.0 ,                       well  right off the bat  i have one complaint  the power cord could have been about a foot longer  i mounted the set on the wall and my power junction box is set on the floor  simple fix was to mount that  the junction box  on the wall though  one other thing that i need to figure out is how to get this set to recognize my roku stick  i have   hdmi cables connected and the set only recognizes two of them  the one not recognized is the port with the roku stick other than that i am pleased with the picture quality      
21,2.0 ,                       just finished setting the tv up   the picture out of the box made things look like bad soap operas from the    s  but it s better if you go into the advanced settings and set the contrast to  low    sound is quite good for a cheap tv the user interface is    obtrusive   the documentation is terrible  so there s lots of blundering about trying to figure out how to get stuff set up the way you want it    and that brings us to the  sponsored  box in the home menu   there s no way to get rid of it  as far as i can tell   there s apparently more obtrusive ads that will show up if you don t disable them   to do that  samsung has helpfully buried the opt out three levels deep in the  terms and privacy       interest based advertising  tab  samsung apparently has bought in to the orwellian school of marketing and product design    i think all this does is prevent them from collecting data  so maybe i m just going to get generic ads later on at least with amazon devices you can pay a few bucks to get rid of the propaganda   it s pretty infuriating having stuff that you don t want to see pushed at you in a way that you can t get rid of nice integration with providers  for us un cord cut   i have dish  and the built in app is moderately full featured   nothing particularly obnoxious with the streaming apps that i use  yet      
22,1.0 ,                       tv quality is great and i like that it has most of the apps i need  however  there   issues that are a bid deal   the voice search doesn t work  whenever i ask for something alexa goes  here are some results  but nothing happens  so this smart tv isn t very smart   it some time drops from the network for no reason  it s happened like   times already even though the internet works fine  the only way to fix it is unplug the tv and plug it back again   every time you turn on the tv samung tv automatically starts playing and is the most annoying thing ever and there is no way of turning it off  i spoke with tech support and he basically told i just have to deal with iti d recommend looking at a different tv  i would not recommend this garbage  i ll be returning it for my money back     
23,2.0 ,                       waited over   years for a  k tv  i m a huge brand whore and love samsung  samsung electronics  phones and appliances  thought this tv was it  but it falls extremely short main menu is very busy  so many features have problems regularly  nothing special in regards to video quality and refresh rate  the remote is extremely hard to use with all the features basically  it s like old vhs movies that are on bluray disc  yes you can play the movies on bluray players  but the quality is still vhs  yes  it s a  smart  tv  yes it can play  k  but does it knock it out the park  no this is exactly what the term  you get what you pay for  means      smart  k tv  meh     
24,5.0 ,                       great tv for the price  we ve only had it up for a week  but so far it s working great   remote is very hard to use   it s just not very intuitive   it s so bad  the person who designed it should probably be moved to another department  luckily  we had an extra samsung remote for a newer tv it works on this tv   but even that remote is pretty poorly designed  regardless of the remote everything else went smoothly   i updated the software first and foremost  before mounting to the wall   speaking of mounting to the wall   we were replacing an older samsung tv  and decided to use the same wall mounting bracket we had for that television   this tv needed larger vesa bolts than our old tv   the manual and samsung website says m        mm  and our hardware store had    s or    s   i m here to tell you    s or    s will not fit this tv and give you any thread left to tighten   even with the thinest wall mount brackets   we went with the    s and they fit perfectly   learn from us and save yourself the headache and valuable time      
25,5.0 ,                       super fast and easy set up with spectacular quality  this just sayin my first smart tv  having access to samsung tv plus is amazing  it s everything you love about television for free  the ambient lighting adjusts automatically based on the lighting of the room which i found to be incredible  everything looks crystal clear  i d recommend this television to anyone i know      
26,5.0 ,                       i still can t believe how cheap this tv was  it s really great quality  i own this as well as the qled version because i wanted to compare the two  it s hard to see much of a difference  i wouldn t say go with one over the other based on the experience  very comparable  it s been a great tv and both of the remotes are identical so that has made it easy to not have to learn two different remotes  very easy remote and the technology has been great  it auto detected my devices and appropriately labeled them for the most part  sometimes i have to change inputs multiple times because it wants to do its own thing but it s just a few extra button clicks on the remote when it happens  for example when i boot up my nintendo switch it will turn on the tv by itself which is great but it doesn t load the switch screen it goes to teh home screen  i will change it to the switch and then for some reason it shows the switch and then goes to the home menu again  then i go to the switch and it stays on the switch  kind of weird but consistent behavior  not a huge deal though      
27,5.0 ,                       you must subscribe to a service to get cnn  this tv does not support a cnn app  it comes with fox  cbsn  and the pbs app  which i use  but no cnn  i ended up having to purchase a firestick       and basic tv service through epb  my internet and electrics provider in chattanooga      mo   just to get cnn  along with loads of other crap i will never watch   had i known  i would have purchased a different make  ridiculous      
28,3.0 ,                       the price isn t bad for this product  but i expected much more from a samsung tv  the picture quality is ok but it seems so dark no matter what setting i tried especially on the built in apps like disney   my ps  pro however seems to boost the colors and blacks so the color definitely looks better  the problem i have on my ps  pro comes with the sound  for some reason  even though everything is set to pcm on both the tv and the ps   the sound is good on some things but slightly distorted on voices and other things  it doesn t sound even or consistent  however  if you do the built in test everything looks great and sounds great  i can t seem to duplicate the results on anything else  very frustrated and disappointed      
29,3.0 ,                       sound quality is only average for any tv  that means anyone wanting great or even good will need a sound bar  i saw some reviews said it was great but they must still listen to an am radio in their car with one speaker in the center dash i guess  i ve been a loyal samsung customer for    years  gotta say i m disappointed  i sent it back  you get what you pay for is still true  tv plus soundbar  cheaper by far to buy the sony  which i did  very happy but not exactly a fair comparison      
30,2.0 ,                       from day   tv makes a clicking sound every minute or so when on  and for     minutes after being turned off    working on getting a repair person from samsung to come and fix it ads are built into the home navigation bar with no option to remove all apps i ve tried  netflix  prime  iheartradio  disney  all work well with no issues remote has no lights so using it in a dark room is hard the picture quality is great and works well in my office with some light during the day and looks very black at night   sound is good without adding a soundbar  if i ignore the clicking already mentioned       
31,5.0 ,                       i had bought a smaller samsung for my bedroom and really enjoyed it so when our   in vizio in the living room started to get buggy i decided to buy a   in samsung  k uhd  absolutely love the tv  great picture  no grey areas as some reviewers talked about  and love that it is alexa controlled  would be better if i could edit the names of some of the inputs but overall it connected quickly and recognized all my add on equipment  too bad you cannot totally get rid of some of the preloaded apps but no one lets you do that      
32,5.0 ,                       amazing tv and quality at such a great price i was very amazed not only at the high picture quality and sound quality but also the many extras that samsung includes in all their products including using voice alexa   the setup was  fantastic  because it was so easy using the internet and a samsung account from a previous tv   the remote   internet walked me through the rest and it look like a professional the remote is still a little difficult using with my cable system  but with netflix  dvd  amazon prime etc it s much easier the only problem is that sometimes my alexa tv app and alexa thermostat often both answer me  if you call that a problem      
33,2.0 ,                       the first one i ordered arrived with a cracked screen  the box was completely undamaged so it appeared that it happened in the production packaging stage  i returned it for a replacement  the replacement arrived and i set it up and  sadly  after all of the delay  i was not happy at all with the tv  the picture was really disappointing and the audio was not good at all  regardless of how high i set the volume  however  when turning the tv on or off  it was outrageously loud  i ve owned some low end tv s so my bar was low and yet this tv didn t even meet that  low  expectation  i packaged it back up nicely  making certain to repackage everything as it came and returned it  it arrived back to amazon    days ago  still waiting for a refund  update     days and still waiting for refund         
34,5.0 ,                       a  k smart tv for a tech illiterate  the user manual doesn t offer much  trial and error was my path of discovery  after a couple of months i think i reached a tenable position  my biggest quest was trying to figure out how to shut off my dvd player without the tv turning it back on  if i shut off the tv first the dvd player would turn the tv back on  it was like a conspiracy  the only solution was to unplug the dvd player  i finally found a line item deep in the tv smart operations  i didn t understand what it was but it had an on off green dot  i pushed it to off and solved my problem  the  k resolution with compatible viewing programs is incredible  whether streaming  dvd or regular tv if everything is right the resolution will blow you away  this technology is almost scary  having fun      
35,5.0 ,                       a quality product that has been a challenge for me to use help is available and very helpful with the computer like problems when i can figure it out i am from the old generation and only used to an  on and an off  switch trying to use alexa and the various help sections on this tv is a maze which i haven t accomplished yet samsung products have worked well for me in the past   such as a washer and a dryer which i just learned that to turn the buzzer on the washer off   i need to not push the button to turn off the  buzzer lighted off button  off because it has to be on to be off on the tv only one problem which is hardly worth mentioning   but   when moving from one channel to the next   the banner for what channel it is stays on plus half the screen is blacked out with another message  i don t need to know what channel i just picked out to turn to  and when i click to turn off the banner   it takes me back to the previous channel sometimes if i am not quick enough      
36,1.0 ,                       the tv is beautifully designed and from what i can tell  crystal clear   when it works  we waited     weeks for delivery and the service dropped it off today  unboxed it and the tv was damaged beyond belief  crack at the bottom of the screen  lines   inches deep on the left side and   deep inches from the bottom  single black line through the middle  not sure if it s a manufacturing defect or damaged during shipping  talked to customer service  which was very helpful  but they couldn t initiate an exchange or expedite shipping  they were kind enough to refund the damaged product  but i had to rebuy the tv at a higher price from amazon and now have to wait another     weeks for delivery of the replacement  the experience has been highly disappointing  shopped local  but unfortunately the model isn t available here  will update the review upon receiving the replacement      
37,5.0 ,                       i love it  great size  checked out the picture quality at walmart before purchasing here  and you could see the difference in comparison to all the other tv s  samsung is superior  good speakers   volume  the remote is easy to use and we love the universal remote feature  don t have to switch between xbox controller   tv remote  one more thing i really appreciated is that it has the av inputs that most tvs are getting rid of  so it s easily compatible with older consoles  we also used amazon s mounting service and they came just   days after we got the tv   had it mounted in about    minutes  very pleased with the product and the service      
38,1.0 ,                       this tv has great  crisp picture quality but whenever the picture start to move things go horribly wrong  the motion areas go blurry and sometimes the pixels go gray entirely  it s a very odd effect and very noticeable  for example when i m watching the office  whenever the camera pans around the room the screen gets pixelated or turns gray nearly every time and sometimes freezes up in the problem areas i m not exactly sure this is a defect  this seems like samsung cheaped out on the internals of this tv and it shows   the overall os is very clunky  and the tv takes a lot longer to respond to remote input than other models i ve owned to top it off the remote is defective   the volume button isn t set properly and wobbles when i toggle it this tv is being returned      
39,5.0 ,                       this is a fine tv for the price  not really sure what others were complaining about with regards to the setup  even though judging by the slight racism of one of the reviewers i can see why he wouldn t know how to set up a tv  just a heads up dvd person  all tech in one way or another comes from asia china south korea so get over yourself disable the smart features  buy an apple tv  and this makes for a world class experience      
40,5.0 ,                       l love this tv  it works great and was easy to install  i read a lot of reviews and a couple were saying l would need to buy special screws to mount it because the shape  in preparation  l bought all of the advised screws when l ordered the tv and they went to waste  the tv is flat except for the very edges  see pics  maybe it was because my tv is     and perhaps theirs was smaller  causing the edges to interfere more  or could it be the mount they chose  i suggest getting a mount that doesn t cover the back like a wall  but leaves the back accessible to get to the hdmi and usb sockets  especially if you are buying a smaller size  after researching for a month before buying  l got the mount eglf  bk with it and it worked great   the sound works much better than my last tv and l don t see any sense in buying a soundbar  also  l still like my roku stick better than the smart tv software  maybe that is just out of habit and l don t find the alexa voice command so helpful  since l am already holding the remote and could easier press the button than speak into it  still   stars  i am very satisfied with this purchase      
41,4.0 ,                       this is absolutely an upgrade in picture for me   i find that with external devices the sound often needs to be up around      the interface takes a little time to get used to and you needed to sign up for samsung account during set up   plan on an hour or better if your mounting it to the wall and powering the device up and updating any software required   its advisable to have all the additional accounts ready you want to link  amazon  netflix  etc  and doing this right off   so far i am very happy with the overall experience and for the price of under      there is not a lot to be unhappy with   maybe the remote that is very basic but hey that is where having the dish remote works just fine      
42,3.0 ,                       we decided to buy a smaller set so that it didn t overwhelm the room  too many times  i ve seen sets that you can t avoid seeing  and they aren t even on  the     turned out to be somewhat underwhelming  if i could do it again  a     would be as much as i would want  but the picture is magnificent  the remote works well  as long as you have small fingers  and one more complaint  there are not enough hdmi ports    is not enough  i had to buy an additional   ports  it was very easy to set up and we were watching television within    minutes  all things considered  it is a good television set      
43,5.0 ,                       easy to setup  nice picture and sound quality for this price range  not specific to this tv  but i like the newer samsung os   it s more intuitive and user friendly      
44,2.0 ,                       the picture quality is good  the guys from amazon that delivered it were good  the smart features are not that smart  i got a tv with alexa built in thinking it would be better  it is not  if it is in netflix it is hit or miss if it will go to a tv channel  on the cable box  sometimes when telling it to change the channel it knows what channel to go to  but drops a digit so instead of going to channel     it goes to    or instead of     it goes to     the setup is just as unfriendly as the earlier series   for setting up the cable box  the cable box was in sleep mode  but there was no warning when going through the setup and it skips it without telling you  adding the cable box manually after is not easy to do and easier just to reset the tv to factory defaults and start over once the cable box is out of sleep mode  also the remote control itself is less usable than the older remote controls from samsung  it looks more futuristic but needs more buttons to be put back for when the smart features fail  like not being smart enough to bring up the guide on the cable box   i have more complaints than this  but i figure this is enough to get the point across     
45,2.0 ,                       they are requiring a samsung account to be created to use the smart tv functions  i have more than enough accounts with companies  i really don t want to have to create another one  i am absolutely against this kind of entrapment  it also does not have an app available for beach body  which we use every day  now we have to plug a fire stick into it to be able to use our apps  as a smart tv it is useless  hate this device for these reasons      
46,4.0 ,                       pros    decent picture quality  not amazing but it does do the   huge plus on the remote  other than the already preset buttons for  samsung tv plus  which i don t use  the controller is simple  ergonomic  and slim   okay sound qualitycons  bird feet  the smart os is not very user friendly  you cannot customize the menu at all  so whenever you go to  home  its just a bunch of preset list of movies that they are forcing you to buy  you cannot customize it to only show the apps you own  netflix  hulu  etc   and you cannot uninstall the preset apps which are quite a few  to access the apps you set as favorite you have to press the home button and they are the tiniest of squares compared to the movies they are forcing you to see if you do not mind the cons  then it is a decent purchase      
47,2.0 ,                       i couldn t get this tv to play any of my directv channels   also  it tried to set up a remote controller on my mobile phone  but that feature is not very helpful   i tried for a couple of hours to get my directtv channels  but nothing worked   there wasn t any help in the online manual about the issue   my cable box is older  but i also have a lg that works well with no issues   i wouldn t suggest this product if you are going to use it with directtv      
48,5.0 ,                       about   yr ago i bought a lg tv one a good sale from walmart  well the junk  no user friendly at all and the wifi receiver was week  yes my modem is on the other side of the house but none of my other iot stuff was having any issues  it would take hours to get the lg back up  the user interface and customer support stinks  i hung my new samsung and was up and running in minutes  the picture is great and the interface so much easier to navigate  its been one day but i don t expect any issues as with my   other samsung tv s     
49,1.0 ,                       this has been a very disappointing experienced with amazon prime   this is the second tv in two weeks thatarrived damaged   the first one was picked up no problem and second one delivered   sadly  it also had thesame screen damage and now you want me to return to a center   i am a senior citizen      and would beunable to get box in my car and find center as i am in a small mountain area   i have tried responding and requestinga pick up when believe it or not i am going to try again another tv  is delivered   i have received no response and amdisappointed in this experience   i would certainly appreciate some assistance or a least response to this issue       
50,1.0 ,                       i have never had so many problems with a tv  my tv keeps turning on and off  i reset it and it does  it again  i will never buy a samsung product again everyday there is some sort of problem with this tv  i m very unhappy with this tv  i have had a lot of tvs snd never experienced so many problems      
51,4.0 ,                       the picture quality is great and definitely lives up to the samsung reputation  for the price  it is a great deal the smart features  however  are pretty lackluster  the processor on the tv is very slow which makes the interface very laggy  there are a lot of built in ads and samsung internet channels that are particularly annoying  thankfully  i didn t buy this tv to use the smart features  if i had  i would have returned it  i much prefer a chromecast to these built in features      
52,3.0 ,                       firstly  i am not a tech person  i don t need the latest   greatest specs  this is why i considered this tv  i am an average person using this tv to stream netflix  that said  i wish i researched tvs a bit longer  even for an average person this tv only delivers in size the smart interface is confusing  it s horribly laid out  it is by far the worst smart interface i have used on any tv  i have seen much better menus in tv s from brands less desirable than samsung the glass is very reflective  if you don t want glare from the lights or open windows you better be watching in the dark video games appear a little dull but for myself i don t mind  if you play video games and care about the graphics then this might be the wrong tv for you this tv does work will alexa  well    it tries too  it s clunky   slow  it s just best not to yell at the robot on the counter   turn the tv off yourself if you want a huge tv with a name brand on the cheap then this is for you  if you want anything else just keep looking      
53,2.0 ,                       samsung should be ashamed of themselves for having a remote control but you cannot take the battery cover off of without using a screwdriver  it s not designed to use a screwdriver but that s the only way that you can get the cover off because it is locked in so well that it will not come off  i am reasonably strong and i ve been going at this for    minutes so far  pushing cover in the direction of the arrow just does not work   i have a remote similar from a couple years ago and i thought to myself surely they have fixed this by now  not   i would not recommend this tv for a grandparent  or an elderly person they may have difficulty getting the back cover off to insert the new batteries   i am very disappointed that this is still this design after this many years      
54,5.0 ,                       it got here quickly and in one piece  has a little bit of a learning curve to using it and finding the best settings  the remote is a little too simplified for my liking and it makes it hard to navigate certain apps on the tv  the wireless internet connection isnt all that great even under beat circumstance but a wired connection helps out  everything i feel lacking in this tv i feel i could sort out on my own so it still gets good marks  i did find the exact same tv at walmart for about      cheaper so that s the only downside i can see plus the steep learning curve  i still havent found out how to get the best out of the  k      
55,4.0 ,                       this is the  rd samsung smart tv i have recently purchased as we focused on upgrading things during this pandemic  i like the tv overall but slightly less then my other two due to a few annoying items  first i can for the life of me not remove an unwanted app from smart hub menu  easy on the other   but just cant seem to do it on this one  there is also sometimes a small delay when performing remote control actions  minor stuff but enough for to rate this   and instead of   stars  i might update this later  overall a nice tv and the    inch size is perfect in our bedroom update  i m now able to remove an app from the smart hub launcher but it is a slightly different action then with my other samsung tv due to it being a      version  i called samsung support and they were extremely helpful  this however was not noted anywhere in the manual  remote works better but still sometimes delayed   sound quality on this tv is poorer than on my    and    inch samsung so i will likely get a soundbar or other external source for better sound  still a solid tv  keeping this at   stars      
56,1.0 ,                       even compared to my older backlit samsung flat screen this picture quality was absolutely terrible  tons of post processing effects that you couldn t completely remove in adjusting settings  you could only make the image bright enough if you choose a specific preset that actually made everyone look like they had skin disease everything from the contrast  to the skin tones  black levels and white levels  and overall color was so bad that i had to return it normally i don t return things due to the hassle  and i had already mounted the screen to my wall and damaged some of the packaging  but it was well worth the hassle to get this thing returned the next day i went to best buy and found myself a backlit sony bravia model that was more than twice the price  but the picture quality doesn t make me want to die so i feel much better about it also should note that the reason i had to buy a new tv was because my older samsung suddenly got a big ole bright white spot in the upper left quadrant   apparently the backlights on those older samsung s just fall off sometimes      
57,1.0 ,                       the box and packaging are well designed  the tv was well packaged with solid styrofoam to hold it securely in place  and adhesive strips to prevent damage to the screen when moving the tv   the instructions were easy to follow and there was minimal assembly required  the form factor is slender and the unit itself is very attractive   the remote is another useless  smart  remote that replaces standard menu and navigation buttons with a very slimmed down selection and greatly encourages voice commands  i m not a fan of it   when powered on  the tv had multiple jagged lines that flickered beneath the perfectly intact screen and it never displayed a picture  i ve never seen a tv so broken out of the box in my life  there is no way that this was a working unit before it went into the box and the packaging was so meticulous that the box would have been ripped in half before the tv could have been damaged like this in transit  since it was clearly not a problem with the box or packaging  the only logical conclusion is that the shipping company was not to blame  and the manufacturer sent the tv out in this condition   unfortunately  amazon does not have the delivery service verify whether a unit is working  and there is no recourse for a broken unit except to schedule another delivery  and take another day off work waiting for the delivery service to come back   the lack of quality control calls into question what might be wrong with a  working  unit  so i ve scheduled a return of the unit for a refund      
58,2.0 ,                       first off  this is our first smart tv  but honestly you re better off not using it s smart features  the interface is very confusing  and there are a lot of apps already installed that we had no need for   but also couldn t delete  second  there is a button on the remote that makes no sense being there  it s a number color function that you can use to enter numbers  but then you also have a keyboard option that you can enter numbers with   either way you re scrolling through numbers  finally  and this is the biggest headache when it comes to this tv  every time it s turned off it disconnects from your internet and the only way to reconnect is to reset your internet access on the tv  samsung is no help  and any search on the internet will only find you others with the same problem and no solution   all in all  the best thing about it is the picture  and it s really not all that amazing      
59,5.0 ,                       there is nothing to dislike and i am ecstatic about my television  i bought it to replace a television that was  knocked  over by one of my many cats  a good friend came over and set  everything up for me and i can t stop smiling   this is a fantastic buy and well worth the price  i need a new stand because the  stand  i had for my other television is not large enough for this  one  i will recommend this television to all of my friends and neighbors  sorry i don t know how to include a picture         
60,4.0 ,                       my wife and i were very pleased with the quality of the picture which was significantly better than our previous hd one  the remote control could be best described as  primitive   perhaps  by installing alexa  which we haven t done  problems with the remote control could be bypassed  we shall see  a better introductory manual would have been useful in navigating the options within the software  for example  we had to learn by trial and error that the controls to closed captions were different for netflix  amazon  hulu  etc  the ability to go to google within the software is a plus   moving around the software with the remote control can be tricky  sometimes  it s not clear where you are  i would recommend this samsung tv with the caveats regarding the remote control      
61,5.0 ,                       i ve done my research on about   different tv s and models  this one by far was the better tv for the price  the picture quality is really clear and the crisp  i tried watching a few movies that had a lot of cgi in it  ie  black panther  avengers movies  and i m amazed by the color and picture quality  i am very satisfied with my purchase and i would definitely buy this tv again if i need one for my other rooms      
62,3.0 ,                       it was working great until all of a sudden we are now getting these chimes  we have no alexa  reset sound settings  factory reset  uninstall the smart things app  turned of location  settings  and even moved our phones into another room and still getting these chimes      
63,5.0 ,                       easy to set up  excellent picture  nice sound  superb selection of ota channels and streaming apps through its internal amazon fire set up  it takes a day or two to get used to the amazon fire styled remote control  the physical design of the  case   not referring to the buttons  is too smooth surfaced and too rounded  so it easily slips out of the hand  and it doesn t balance in the hand during natural use  i give the remote s  case  design a d   the button design and layout is a b   the tv is a straight  a       
64,5.0 ,                       i like the smart features that come along with samsung  including the ability to control the tv from the smart things samsung app  the tv is very easy to use and functions are intuitive  i love casting my child s online class onto the tv so that i can ensure that she is not wandering onto youtube kids while i work i am not as happy with the picture quality as it is not as good as my two year older samsung    inch tv      
65,1.0 ,                       original posted issue bought this tv in september       we had a smaller version of the same unit in another room and we loved it   the new     had immediate light leak clouding issues in the upper left quadrant and has since been spreading to the rest of the tv   we opened a ticket with samsung and they sent out technicians to diagnose the problem   they told us we d likely need a screen replacement or unit replacement but that  some clouding is normal    we politely awaited the next step  which was a repair visit      and then samsung closed the ticket   when we asked why  they said the technicians noted in their report that we were unhappy but the tv was  up to specs  and that the  repairs had been made    samsung has refused to do anything but set up another technician visit to start the process all over again   this has gone on for weeks   we re taking it up with amazon as well   beware this   you are gambling when you purchase a samsung unit and their customer service is terrible update since posting the above i contacted amazon customer service and was thrilled with them   they contacted samsung on my behalf to confirm all i stated below   and when samsung still insisted upon starting over with their process    amazon stepped in to secure me a replacement set   the new set arrived within   days and unfortunately    it has a very similar issue to the previous one  only not quite as bad   still  a brand new factory set that does not warn of cloudy  diffused patches and light seepage along the frame is not a set anyone is going to want   unfortunately we now must attempt to return for a refund again buyer beware   we ve had good sets from samsung in the past but we got two lemons in a row and their customer service was downright deceitful   thankful we at least bought on amazon where they look out for buyers      
66,5.0 ,                       my husband and i were ready to replace our very old hand me down tv  and were looking for a smart tv on a budget to fit in our small apartment  this tv from samsung is just what we were hoping for  great price  the picture is really lovely and the sound quality is great for our apartment  with no need for a soundbar  we purchased a roku at the same time  but it turns out that this smart tv has all of the channels apps that we use  so we actually don t need a roku at all set up was super easy for me to do on my own my only complaint is the remote   i find the volume and channel buttons are kind of poorly designed and not exactly intuitive  but this is a super small problem for us  so not much to be concerned about      
67,3.0 ,                       first  whoever created the stand for this yv should be fired  it s just two little pieces of plastic that don t stay in  no glue or anything was provided to keep them in  so when you you try to put the tv ip the gop  stand  falls out  so now i am buying a tabletop tv stand second  the remote control is inadequate  there is nowhere that i can figure out to change the source on the tv  the door to insert batteries does mot open easily and i have not been able to open it since i haven t been able to set up the tv yet as i am waiting for a tabletop stand due to the stand samsung ptovided i can t comment on the quality of the tv yet samsung needs to fix the stand problem  a friend of mine also just purchased a samsung tv and is having the same problem  not happy      
68,3.0 ,                       picture quality is good   sound is terrible   i am changing the volume constantly  from    to      also  the sound is  not sharp i do not like the fact that the on off and volume are controlled by the tv remote and i am not able to control it at all with my service providers  comcast  remote   just a nuisance i would have liked to send it back  but after imposing  on my nieces to set it up for me  i felt i should not i wish i could give a good review  but i cannot      
69,1.0 ,                       i would never buy this tv again  nor any samsung tv  samsung has a sponsored icon which is always on the home screen  lower left  can t move it  can t get rid of it  it is easy to trip  hard not to have it become active and very annoying  none of the search tips or helpful hints will get rid of it  i am not alone  one popular search site has a video that has been accessed over        times  others are having the problem too  if you buy this television  you will too      
70,4.0 ,                       love the tv  great smart features  samsung gives you free tv channels  really nice picture quality  the remote is cheap but acceptable   just has a small problem on the side of the screen  it looks like either a slight factory defect or it took a hit in shipping  not worth the hassle of returning  packaging could definitely been better  shipped in original box with no extra padding      
71,1.0 ,                       the tv worked great for a week  then the screen turned black   i called comcast and determined the issue is with the tv not the cable   i called samsung and scheduled an appointment  but no one showed or called   the next day a samsung rep called and scheduled and appointment for next wednesday   i won t buy electronics again on line   had i bought the same tv at a walmart or target store  i would have been able to take it back and get a replacement rather than be without a tv for   weeks      
72,1.0 ,                       so i bought this with the intent on motion rate     for the     hz  in description it says that the item has     hz  then with no indication that the     would be half the refresh rate of the    would ve been great to know that the different sizes was at different rates prior to buying  great tv  but very annoying that they would lie about the refresh rates      
73,4.0 ,                       no tv should have ads thrown into it just so the company can increase profit  you bought a product  they get ad revenue from you have the app  it s just greedy and the additional time you skip through the ads you easily loose   hours of your life from that extra time  tv picture looks good  audio levels are fine      
74,1.0 ,                       this sucks   i can t get the spectrum app to work   it worked for a few weeks    now the app won t start   i unplugged   then i reset the tv and after putting in all the passwords again  the app still won t load   can t believe i have to box this up and take it to ups   what a waste      
75,4.0 ,                       considering how much i paid  i am happy with the picture quality and the features except for the samsung s smart tv interface   i consider it to be unpolished and confusing   and the number one thing i wanted in a smart tv   the ability to play music and music videos on youtube hands free with alexa   doesn t work with youtube on this tv and i ve put a couple of hours into troubleshooting it to no avail   whatever music i search alexa will only launch it on amazon music   my friend s toshiba smart tv based on android doesn t have that problem  alexa works like a champ on youtube i m going to keep the tv but most likely buy a fire stick hd for     to use in place of the samsung tizen os and simply write off the samsung smart tv interface   four stars      
76,2.0 ,                       the samsung tv arrived and with in   hours i had it set up only to discover that there was these black pixel lines running across the top of the screen and two designs that look like leaves   at first i thought it was a plastic sheeting  i immediately call samsung tech support   mark assisted me and ask me to send a pic of the problem   he stated that the tv was either defective when it was shipped or it was damage during shipping   he stated the panel screen was defective and would need replacing   since it was new  return to amazon since they have a good return policy   i still love samsung brand and all my televisions are samsungs   i wanted this one for my   k swann surveillance camera system   i am returning however  i will go to my local stores and  do curbside pickup   i was trying to avoid going inside a store with the covid      i am not discourage   i really believe it was damaged during shipping   these delivery services toss everything around   thanks amazon and samsung support   i attached a pic so you can see the leaf design and the black lines in the panel      
77,1.0 ,                       i purchased this pos before christmas and i m still trying to get it up and running  i would have returned it to amazon but it s too big to fit in my car and too bulky to lift it arrived without the cables necessary to set it up  so i played  guess which cable will work   for a while the   x   remote is the biggest joke of all my two year old samsung stopped working so i tried replacing it with this  good luck to you if you buy one  i ll never buy another samsung product     
78,5.0 ,                       we took this tv out of the box and the only issue we had is we tried to put the feet in wrong  but that was soon cleared up   we quickly connected our smart dvr and our joey for our hopper system and all we had to add was our network password   to be fair  we skipped all of the options to load alexa and smart things and apps  figuring we would do that if an when we wanted them   we did follow the advice of another reviewer and we were careful to make sure we didn t load ads  there is one step of the process that asks your permission to access your data and you have to unselect say yes to all and specifically leave off targeted ad content   the picture quality  the sound  and the ease of use were all very good   we didn t seem to have the trouble that other people had with the remote  but it isn t my favorite designed piece of hardware   we use the dish remote anyway and we quickly got it to recognize the tv so we only use one remote   i would order this tv again in a heartbeat      
79,5.0 ,                       let s start with the main part   this is an incredible tv at a good value  the image is crisp  the colors are vibrant  and it is a pleasure to watch movies  shows  and games on this tv  the annoying lack of control over what is on the selection bar when changing from one source to another  live tv  hulu  netflix  etc   i m stuck sorting through sources i don t have or want because the smart hub is locked  i can add  but cannot delete or move around the ones they insist that must be on the hub      
80,3.0 ,                       this was purchased directly from amazon as a new unit  the unit i received upon gloved unboxing was a used unit  there was a visible hand print on the screen and deep scuff marks and gouges on the back of the unit  there was no visible damage to the box upon delivery this has made me loose faith in samsung and amazon  not only was this unit used and sold as new  but this makes the third time i have purchased a samsung tv that came with some sort of physical or electronic defect  poor quality control this unit  aside from the physical damage upon inspection works well  has a decent picture for its price point and the menu responds well though going to detailed settings is a touch laggy but not terrible ultimately this was a lackluster purchase due to the used and damaged nature of this new tv upon arrival      
81,2.0 ,                       i don t know which is more to blame  the tv  or the samsung hw t       ch soundbar with dolby audio         https   www amazon com gp product b   wtfcq   that i got to pair it with  but it has a serious flaw with audio i ve described the flaw in more detail in my review of the soundbar   bottom line is every       minutes the audio goes completely off  the  d in  light flashes on the sound bar  then the sound comes back a second or two later  often at a lower volume than before it went off  this despite being connected to the soundbar with a digital optical cable that came with the soundbar unit   i have spent a dozen hours hunting for a solution and have found none  i m about ready to toss the soundbar out    since it is past my return window   the problem seems to occur no matter what the source is    whether streaming through fire cube tv  or directly from an app in the tv   note that my tv and my fire cube have direct ethernet connections  so there is no problem related to wifi  also  if i turn off the sound bar and use the tinny  tiny speaker in the tv  it doesn t lose audio  and if you end up with some volume on both the tv and the soundbar    chances are very good that they will be out of sync   in short  two samsung products do not play well together our previous tv was an lg   the smartos on the lg tv was a nightmare to operate  on the samsung  the tv is much more navigable  except they seem to insist on having their  advertisement  as a necessary  and unavoidable   unremovable thing you must always skip over to get to the settings   this isn t really a surprise  samsung cell phones are loaded with similar unremovable  unwelcome junk while you can enable alexa  and or google  on the tv  you ll be sorry if you do   you get much more  and much more accurate control via an  echo dot  or better  a fire cube tv  the fire cube is far from ideal  too  by the way the good news is    you can add the apps for eg  netflix and hbomax directly to the tv  this is nice if you don t have fire tv  and it works  but you ll undoubtedly find it much easier to use the fire tv controls remote than to try to use the one that comes with the tv   assuming you pick up the right remote unfortunately  the soundbar remote and the tv remote are nearly indistinguishable  the tv remote has   more small buttons  but the extra   buttons on tv remote are really  really useless on my tv remote  you have  netflix  amazon prime  samsung plus tv    three direct streaming channels that you cannot change   it also has a silly  color mode  button that i can t imagine anyone would ever find useful on the remote    but the tv remote lacks a  go to settings  button   geez  even the lg tv had such a feature if you want to change the subwoofer volume or the sound mode  you ll need to find the soundbar remote   if you want to control the soundbar volume  it appears you need the soundbar remote   which has a prominent mute button whereas the tv remote does not have a mute button  hint  it actually does  but it s really non intuitive   it s certainly not labeled   which again is why i find the fire cube remote to be much better overall  picture quality has been good  but doesn t seem better  in fact doesn t seem to be as good as the elderly  k lg tv that it replaced   it s hard to say how much of the problem is due to bandwidth limitations in streaming vs tv cleverness    i haven t reconnected my over the air antenna which is where the lg was very noticeably sharp lastly  while samsung products are generally good quality  their huge land grab at gathering personal information rankles me  i m not a fan of sending my personal information to a korean company that seems more interested in selling me things  and selling my personal information  than in providing a quality product and quality service      
82,2.0 ,                       i bought this tv for a couple of reasons  one because the price was decent  two because it being an      series i figured that it had to be just as good  if not  better than the           series  the user menu seems like there is some sort of delay when switching through the apps  i ve had issues with the wifi connecting to the tv  a few of the apps wouldn t connect load  one of them being netflix and the other one was the spectrum app  the picture quality isn t as nice as it is on the      model      
83,2.0 ,                       ordered one while they were on sale and when it came  we were excited because it looked good  no damage  good picture  and worked nicely     for half a day  we probably used it for a total of   hours before turning it off to go to bed and the next day it would not turn on  the screen stayed black and would flash every few minutes  we contacted customer support   they gave the option of sending a replacement or refund so we chose to replace it  a few weeks later we received the replacement   from the beginning i felt there would be an issue because the delivery driver delivered it upside down on our concrete porch  when we finally opened it  the screen was noticeably damaged and was pretty much coming apart from the top  i contacted customer support again and chose a refund this time because we are tired of receiving tvs that some of their workers clearly do not care about and handle very carelessly the only reason they received a few stars was because customer support was easy to reach   handled everything without giving us a headache  which i very much appreciated i would definitely not recommend purchasing only because you have no way of knowing how the warehouse workers delivery drivers handle these items until you finally receive it only to have to put it back in the box moments later      
84,1.0 ,                       samsung is awful  you cannot remove samsung tv plus and it turns on automatically every time you turn the tv on or turn an app off  i don t want to watch tv chosen by samsung   you have to pass an advertisement every time you scroll the app bar  i don t find these automatic programs and adds appropriate for young children  i specifically ditched cable to avoid annoying adds  i am selling this and getting something else   you also have to have endless time and a degree from mit to manage privacy settings   never will buy another samsung product        
85,1.0 ,                       i like the way this tv was sent out quickly  it arrived in time for my sons birthday  upon gifting it to him  dad was going to mount the set in my sons room  pulled it out and checked operation before hanging unit  unit would power up  it would show lines  not a picture  crackly lines such as a broken glass  but the screen is not broken  its internal  the box is not damaged  i started a return with amazon  ups wont pick it up due to they have no order to do so  i can not find a  way to contact or email amazon so iam sitting on a top of the line   crystal ultra hd      tv  p o s   im hoping someone will read this and help     
86,4.0 ,                       we wanted to upgrade the tv in the family room to  k hdr from the    year old sony we were using  we tried a vizio from bj s but the picture was  weak    even after fine tuning about ten settings we bought this     and the picture is great  even with the standard factory settings the family room has several windows and gets afternoon sun  and the picture crisp and easy to see and simply amazing in hd  even in the brightly lit room the remote is another story   nothing intuitive there  but we use the roku or the fios remotes for channel selection and everything works fine even the sound is decent from the built in speakers be aware there are no analog audio outputs on this tv  only digital optic connector      
87,1.0 ,                       i have been a big samsung tv fan for quite some time  and my home has   samsung flat screen tv s bought over the last   or   years  i bought this     model because i wanted a bigger screen in my den  and wanted to give my daughter the     samsung it was intended to replace however  there were two features of the tv that were critical    to me  if not to all that many other people  first  i wanted to upgrade because my older     model didn t have bluetooth and support wireless earbuds  which i must wear  to avoid conflicts with my wife  who watches in an adjacent room   secondly  i am a big collector of movies and tv shows  and they re all stored on an external  tb hard disk  which i plug into the tv  the older     model handled the hard disk beautifully i was soon to be very disappointed first  the bluetooth support for wireless earbuds is a joke     if it works at all  it s not only intermittent  but the tv doesn t support the volume control when using earbuds  and the loudness is pitiful  i tried using the earbuds  one of sony s latest models  with a different samsung tv with bluetooth  and the story was the same  no volume control  and the loudness was so soft  it was useless the more important failure  however  was the support for the external hard disk  while the much older     tv i had been using supported the external hard disk without any difficulties  this new one failed to play over half of my stored videos  showing a  not supported  error message  a bit more digging revealed that this new tv doesn t support some of the common codecs used for video files  like divx i may have found the reason  however  this latest samsung tv employs an android based operating system called  tizen     something which is not shown on the literature for samsung tv s from last year or the years before  it is surprising  because the user control structure on screen is exactly the same as it was before  tizen     but clearly  there are differences i resolved my problem by swapping my tv for my wife s  hers was a     samsung from       and it supports the hard disk beautifully  although it has the same useless bluetooth support for earbuds   since she doesn t use the hard disk of bluetooth features  she s fine with the new one i  of course  lost the nice     screen    but  at least  i can play my library of movies for most people  this tv would be great  a really good screen image  for a reasonable price       just not for me      
88,1.0 ,                       what s the point in a smart tv if it s not very smart  youtube was quality limited  ads are enforced  the worst is that if you don t interact for     seconds when not playing  it closes your app and shows ads    the crunchyroll app was removed because samsung sucks  i d return this piece of junk  but am going to test a firestick with it first  good tv    terrible smart tv      
89,4.0 ,                       package arrived without any signs of damage in the usual   day shipping  setup is a breeze  especially since i own several samsung tvs and the process is the same as qleds of the same year range  to my dismay  i could not easily assign apps the home bar  on the other tvs you can tap up on the app  then select add to home and it pops right there  i had to go to the app manager and add them there  i found this slightly annoying  the home bar also did not let me arrange my apps in the desired order  overall a bit frustrating over the qled counterparts  i don t know if there is an update to install but i will check  after i set up the tv  i notice purple areas when the tv displays blacks  this really bothered me  it looks like a pattern of dots and a line  maybe screws tightened too much at the assembly process that damaged the display  i want to send back but every other color that is not black shows very well  i don t know how much of a hassle it would be to return but my wife told me to let it go  she doesn t mind it one bit  i will try to add update if possible      
90,2.0 ,                       i received this tv without  a remote  power cord or legs after feeling left out in the cold by both amazon and samsung  partly due to covid    restrictions   amazon finally stepped up and fixed the problem could have been easier but ultimately  kudos      
91,2.0 ,                       it does have a good picture  and we can access netflix  prime and youtube   but no other peripheral  dvd player  dish network  composite player  works at all   i called samsung tech support who said   not our problem   it must be the peripherals    i pointed out all were working fine on the old tv   her reaction was basically  so  i have never had these problems with any tv before   and really why should i   why isn t it plug and play i ll have to get a computer expert i know to try to make it work   that should not be necessary i expected far better from samsung and a tv that cost      part     with the help of a computer pro  we finally got it to work  but it took him two hours it s the opposite of user friendly   calling samsung was not helpful   they said since our peripherals are not made by samsung  they couldn t help to make them work with the tv now  after hours of effort by me and the computer pro  it finally works   the layout of the screens are confusing to say the least if you want an easy to use tv  this isn t it      
92,4.0 ,                       the home page is so cluttered with useless channels that you can t delete  i couldn t afford a more expensive model and wanted a tv that supported hbomax  the picture quality is awesome and it s fairly easy to switch from roku to hbo to netflix to primetv my main resources for entertainment      
93,5.0 ,                       tuned up a little bit out the box  it s breathtaking  good price for this tv and easily mounted with vesa stand i got with it      
94,2.0 ,                       the tv arrived and the package was in great condition  i unboxed the tv and it looked great  set up all the smart features and turned on netflix  as i was about    minutes into a show the tv just went black and sound turned off  i trouble shooted the tv and still nothing would make it turn back on  there was a faint burnt electrical smell from the tv as well  not sure if it blew a circuit or what    stars because the tv only worked for    minutes and phone call to amazon was easy and all ready have a replacement on the way at no extra cost      
95,5.0 ,                       the setup is simple and easy  the picture quality is awesome  i plan to buy another one for my bedroom  i use this one with my computer  i love the smart tv features the remote is simple and easy to use  not a lot of buttons but it works well  it does feel flimsy when pushing the volume or channel up down  every time i press them i think the remote is going to break i dislike the foot stands very much  they make placement difficult  i prefer the single center stand that i have on   previous models  i plan to buy a     but i am waiting because of the stand issue   i may purchase a center stand to replace the feet      
96,3.0 ,                       first  the remote has limited capability without scrolling through a bunch of options   and while doing that you re forced to watch ads that you apparently can t turn off   second  at least on the     model  the four mounting bolts are m   which are very difficult to find   perhaps they come with some mounts  but they didn t with the separate mount i got on amazon  and the mount i got wouldn t accommodate m  bolts even if i had them   i decided just to send everything back to amazon      
97,2.0 ,                       pros are the software is user friendly and responsive  i also really like all the preloaded apps  what i don t like is the picture quality and brightness  i unfortunately had to replace my previous samsung tv  which i loved  model number un  ku      the picture was far superior to the this new one   i am so disappointed with the picture quality compared to my last one  the viewing angle is also very limited  when i first turned it on i thought maybe it was just a setting  but i now realize that this tv just doesn t have enough lighting  also the edges appear to be dimmer than the rest of the picture  i don t recommend this tv unless you will be viewing it straight on and in a dark room      
98,5.0 ,                       this tv is amazing  as we recently cut direct tv to save      month  a big plus  that we did not expect  was that samsung tv came free  and using our internet it gives us access to more than     new and different channels  we have found new channels and new shows  in addition to getting all the local stations   more than     with an antenna from walmart  we highly recommend this tv  we wanted a smaller tv than costco offered for our bedroom  great value      
99,1.0 ,                       the morning after i installed this  the whole bottom half is darker than the top half  a freaking panel is out on a brand new tv      
100,5.0 ,                       our first smart tv was a visio  we wanted to upgrade another one of ours to a smart tv  we saw this on sale for the holidays and the price was within our budget  this was a significant upgrade from our other one  the smart features work great  the picture quality exceeds our expectations  not to mention this is significantly lighter than any other tv we ve had  people have complained about the audio quality  for us and what we watch  the sound quality is just fine      
101,5.0 ,                       this particular model is using more advanced  hands free  features  would be perfect for someone who isn t technical inclined etc now onto my review  assembly was easy  had some issues figuring out how to assemble  but finally got it  screen seems ultra thin while that may seem good in some ways it s not in others  i am always afraid when my cat jumps behind it into the window that he may knock it off  seems like it would break like a wine glass  shatter all over the place  worth the money  i don t like many samsung products  but for tv this is my choice      
102,1.0 ,                       ordered   tvs  both came delivered with internal screen damage   bad manufacturing      
103,5.0 ,                       i waa happy to get this tv used but it actually ended up being brand new    saved a bit of money         is a pretty huge tv   i have just an apartment   i can see if you have a lot of company or a sports movie buff wanting a big tv but this is really huge   even compared to my old tv which wasn t smart   im actually able to watch tv without paying spectrum which i love since it works over the internet    colors and everything is great easy to setup       
104,4.0 ,                       i love the tv   picture is super clear   smart functions work well   downloading the apps allowed me to move my apple tv to another room   remote is good except for directv where the lack of numbers makes it a pia   i still use the directv remote when watching that i am a big fan of supercross and motocross   this year i bought peacock premium to watch it on   very disappointed to find that it cant be downloaded onto this tv   so now i have to move the apple tv back into the room and use it   by the way  this tv recognizes every other device but apple tv is labelled unknown device   i guess it s all about who they make deals with and who they are competitors with otherwise i am very happy with it      
105,5.0 ,                       this is a good bargain smart tv   pretty good picture for the price and the smart features mostly work fine but     i specifically bought it because reviews said the comcast xfinity beta stream app would work with this tv  and initially it did work  but in november      it stopped working  app began generating error codes  so far no fix has been forthcoming  from comcast or samsung  whoever is responsible      
106,5.0 ,                       this is a beautiful television  i bought a     with the t sound bar and back speakers and i love it  but be aware  you re not going to unpack and connect everything and have it work  the manuals it comes with are brief and help  but they re not enough by themselves  immediately register everything and create a samsung id  your email address  suddenly the people at samsungtv are fantastic  there s an emanual     pages long  read it  people who don t like this television clearly haven t taken the time to learn it  the remotes aren t cryptic  again  learn them  the tv will explain your remotes  how to operate your tv  it detected my home computer  my phone  i have been extremely impressed with everything about it and the samsung people  for       without the sound bar  it s a hell of a television  trim  almost no bezel  i d buy another one in a second  extremely satisfied  the people who write bad reviews for this television probably work for competitors and wish they worked for samsung  the television comes with free  samsungtv  tons of add on apps  i love it      
107,3.0 ,                       this is a pretty solid set for the price  fantastic display when configured correctly and easy navigation with the updated remote  had to return it because of a major annoying factor  the video was consistently ahead of the audio by about    ms  this made any cable streaming blu ray like a badly dubbed movie typically if the audio is ahead of the video this isn t an issue as you can just configure a delay on the soundbar or set  unfortunately  you can t if the video is ahead of the audio  need to work on the basics samsung      
108,1.0 ,                       purchased for under      in advance of my sons bday in october  waited until the night before to open and setup his new  game room  when i discovered that the tv was completely broken  hairline cracks all throughout the screen  as it was already over    days since delivery i can t return it please make sure to not purchase in advance  i highly recommend purchasing from costco or anywhere that gives a longer return window  i m devastated my son s gift is broken but hopefully i ll be able to donate this one away or find someone who can fix it      
109,2.0 ,                       this smart tv does not stay connected to the internet    yes  i have checked my connection  my internet is fine  we did all the updates to the tv  etc    every time we turn the tv off it disconnects from the network   in order for it to reconnect you have to unplug the tv from the wall and plug it back in  then it connects right back to the network   who wants to have to unplug their tv every time they want to watch it   so essentially it is a dumb tv   i am not returning it because who wants to deal with the hassle of boxing up a     tv to have it returned   so if you still decide to purchase this tv ensure you have a roku or some other streaming device hooked up to it   also consider purchasing through best buy or walmart  at least you can go to the brick and mortar store if you have to   overall very disappointed with this tv      
110,5.0 ,                       pros     picture quality is unbeatable  film maker mode movie mode natural mode standard mode and expert mode that allows you to set picture quality to your likes and desire  airplay features awesome streaming from your iphone  samsung tv plus is another awesome feature that give you live streaming channels  this tv has endless app capabilities netflix youtube tubi google and hella more apps that you can download  on it  i also love its internet browsing feature i search online and watch movies with  k crystal clear picture while streaming online  i really do not understand some of the reviews by some other users about quality and size  the tv size is      or    inch from left bottom corner to right top corner  the tv has so many  smart options that any of you will not even have time to search through and be able to use them all the time  i recommend this tv it is awesome and i stand by the samsung brand cons      the remote control is really nerve racking small and i  always miss selecting the right selection while operating it have to do it twice packaging is absolutely amateur and basic and nonprofessional  the bottom of the box came open when i received the tv      
111,4.0 ,                       i ordered this tv for my one cyber monday purchase  i ve been wanting a bigger tv for my bedroom for a few years so i finally pulled the trigger on this one  i knew something was wrong right away when i noticed the glass in the top left corner was separated from the back of the tv  i plugged it in and it was indeed broken  i packed it back in the box and returned it however  i went to best buy the same day and purchased the same exact model tv  i m very happy with it and glad i decided to get the same one  even if i missed out on the cyber monday deal      
112,5.0 ,                       this has been a great tv   preface this with the knowledge we are not gamers so do not know how it would work for that use great  crisp picture   watch golf a lot and you can see the ball very clearly finds and plays ota channels fast and clear   even has a guide that shows the ota channels remote synched with all existing accessories including a no name sound bar and remote handles all functions of the specialty remotes that come with streaming services and the accessories sound is a little weak so a sound bar is recommended easy to navigate through set up  changing sources  etc     
113,4.0 ,                       the remote control is supposed to make tv control simple  most remote control units do that  the   button remote  control that came with this tv makes the control stupidly complicated  i chose to buy a good    button  rd party controller for about      at amazon   still  samsung needs to send their remote control designers to user friendly school      
114,5.0 ,                       i wanted to replace my      samsung     lcd  which still works perfectly   if it is one thing  samsung makes a quality tv   this unit was no different  great tv   apps work great  my roku functions by turning the tv on off   volume   the unit syncs automatically to the optical audio running to the receiver in my     credenza creating a perfect movie viewing experience   the wall mount was easy to install on the back of the tv   i couldn t be happier with it      
115,5.0 ,                       i have had this tv for    days now and i wanted to share my feelings on the positives  negatives  and overall traits  i did extensive research on youtube and amazon before landing on this one  i was moving up from a     plasma samsung which i was moving into my living room  to replace a     panasonic plasma which i am moving outdoors to my patio  i ve owned several samsung tvs  here are my thoughts positives    great packaging  the box has a  pull off top  that allows you to expose the tv while it is standing upright and easily get your hands under it to lift if straight out  there was plenty of styrofoam and the screen and tv overall were clean and devoid of scratches or cracks    delivery  i paid the extra few dollars for  delivery to any room  and the delivery team took it straight to my home theatre in the basement  both were very nice and wearing masks and arrived on time     k picture  i have watched hours of  k content on youtube to test the color  dynamic range  etc  it s brilliant  really blew me away  i would recommend  after making this mistake myself  to not get too wrapped up in all the comparisons and little distractions brought up in various youtube videos  the reality is a      samsung  k tv is going to look pretty amazing  the reviewers get down into crazy details that the average person just won t notice    setup  the setup for the remote  smart tv options  etc  was super easy  it automatically paired to the samsung sound bar i also bought  and also automatically connected to my cable tv box  spectrum  and the setup of netflix  hulu  and amazon prime video was done in minutes negatives and annoyances    the remote kinda sucks  it is very small  same size as an amazon fire tv remote  and has minimal buttons  i ve learned to use it just fine  but i really don t understand this dumb concept of  minimalist  tv remotes  if you are using the remote in a dark media room  it s basically impossible to see the buttons  and the remote has no backlite or glow in the dark features  also  the volume and channel buttons are narrow little toggles that you click literally forward backward instead of just pressing up or down  really  just stupid design  not a dealbreaker  but terrible nonetheless  also  the soundbar remote is basically identical  but without channel or home options  i can t tell you how many times i grab the wrong remote in the dark  overall  the remote sucks    soap opera effect enabled out of the box   disable this  it ruins  k movies  you can do your own research on this topic  but bottom line  this tv  like many competitors  automatically enables  motion smoothing technology  which might be ok for sports  but ruins real  k movies  but don t despair  just disable led clear motion in the expert settings  and the problem is solved    sound  the soundbar also  for whatever dumb reason  comes set up with  sound delay  which means moving mouths do not match the sound  this is also an option you can fix easily in expert settings  but again  so stupid for it to be enabled  it should not even be an option in my opinion overall  really love it and would recommend  note  i am not using it for gaming  just streaming movies and regular tv  beautiful picture  easy setup  good packaging and delivery  and very easy to use smart tv options  i would definitely buy it again      
116,1.0 ,                       please  do not purchase this tv  this is not a quality purchase for       i really liked this tv in the beginning when i purchased it back in june  i did not notice the banding and pixelation issues in the first few months  unfortunately  this tv suffers from serious banding  dithering and pixelation issues  especially when watching darker content or most videos that are encoded in     p look horrible  even  k content suffers immensely due to the lack of brightness and the limited calibration menu of this tv  the preset picture modes are a joke and don t really allow you to tune much of the picture quality  i feel samsung is just using their name to sell these lower end tv models like the tu     and tu      they want you to spend thousands on the high end  k resolution tv s or q series qled tv models and have purposely handicapped there lower end tv models for       there are much better options out there than this garbage like the hisense h  series or the tcl series   if you are on a budget  the sony x    series tv s are probably the best for the money but a tad expensive around        please do  it throw your money on this garbage and stay away from lower end samsung products or just the brand in general  i m really disappointed and kicking myself for buying this  refer to my attached images      
117,5.0 ,                       we first bought a hitense     roku television  of course  the price was the only thing right about it  we returned it and replaced it with this samsung for about      more  beautiful picture and sound  and well worth the money paid      
118,3.0 ,                       this arrived very quickly and in great condition  worked right out of box and easy to set up  was able to connect our    year old bose home theatre system and it works well    great picture  the remote isn t as intuitive user friendly  as an apple tv or fire stick   but works well ended up using our fire stick instead of the samsung apps for the simple reason that there is no way to turn off the highly irritating and irrelevant ads that pop up on the home screen  why pay for a tv and have to suffer thru these advertisements     ridiculous  i would have given a   star review otherwise      
119,1.0 ,                       i ve had several samsung s in my house in various rooms since these flat screens first came out  i still have one that s    years old and still working perfectly  i buy nothing but samsung tv s never had any complaints  i had an older      series     in my living room and it s being replaced by this          series  literally direct replacement  everything nowadays is made like crap though  so i guess i m going to update if anything goes wrong down the line  i just wanted to point out that the guy with     likes talking about how his     tv is        the guy is measuring the tv wrong  you don t measure from one side to another  to correctly measure a tv you measure from the bottom left corner to the top right corner ok so i m editing this just to let other people know because it s too late for me the previous model to this tv was actually a better tv  it was true  k     fps  if you look at the specs for this tv on the samsung website and check the frame rate  it says      however if you do a little more research you will come to find that the number they put on the website is a made up number based on some crap feature they put in this tv  it s actually   fps and not true  k  i got this tv for true  k gaming  and i was deceived by a gimmick  next tv i buy will not be samsung  they just lost a lifetime customer      
120,1.0 ,                       unfortunately this motherboard and remote were blown according to the comcast guy and getting amazon to even respond was a complete complete complete exercise in futility  i ended up giving it away in hope s someone could make use of it  this is the very first negative review i have ever written and i am    yrs old      
121,4.0 ,                       great picture  smart function really bogs down the network  and had to turn off the  smart   and take it off the network   i m using a roku appliance for streaming the remote seems like it could be good  if it didn t get confused from time to time and the small size makes it lost more than usual all in all i like the tv  but there are some shortcomings      
122,5.0 ,                       i know why some reviews have complaints about the dimness of the screen    go into eco settings and turn ambient light off  it adjusts to the room   people just don t know how to do research the picture is amazing and true  k   very bright and beautiful colors  it brings my game room to life  i got the     and it s massive   i love it a lot          stars    also  there s a review of an idiot saying that they ordered a     and got a     and they were measuring it horizontally and not diagonally     idiot     tvs don t even come in              
123,1.0 ,                       the sound quality is terrible  no adjustments help   but this is what i was prepared for   but several downsides i did not sign up for at all the remote operation is chunky with unreliable response time  you press a button and wait a little  then you press some other buttons  then all of a sudden all those button press actions come into life the apps are displayed in a small size perhaps to fit many on the screen  but i like them to look bigger  i am fine with having to scroll a little more  there is no way to adjust this  you can try to increase the size  but all it does is increase the text font  not the icon size the microphone on the remote is not the best quality  a little ambient sound will throw off the voice string  regardless what you are using   alexa or google assistant i should have kept the bravia i had  which was smaller in size  and no voice search  but this new tv provides no effective upgrade      
124,1.0 ,                       you will have to turn the tv off and reset your router and reconnect every single time you want to use it  tv is right next to the router and has obstructive line of sight between it  so it s not a connectivity issue  works fine once you do that but it s basically a five minute start up time every time i wanna watch tv  if i could return it i would in a heartbeat      
125,5.0 ,                       i got the     tv and i m very satisfied  when you research tvs one of the first things you learn is that they measure the screen diagonally  my tv in reality is about     when i just measured it  which is the length listed in the product details  which i hope ppl would read before buying a whole tv off the internet  but some of the reviews prove otherwise haha the tv came in a huge box straight to my apartment door  packaged rather thinly but there was no damage to the tv  i plugged it into the wall and the setup took like   mins but i skipped on a bunch of the set up since it was mostly stuff that isn t necessary for my streaming apps  i don t use cable  the tv volume is great too  i keep it around       to watch from my couch which is     ft away i use this tv mostly at night to watch movies on netflix amazon prime and it works perfect for that  i ve also watched some  k youtube videos which look great  there are some slight issues like the black not being a true black but i watch tv rather casually so it doesn t bother me  especially at the price point  my fianc  has used it a few times for his ps  to play simple games like fall guys and it connected without any issues i don t know how it works for cable but if you re just using it for streaming apps casual game play with friends this is a great tv   highly recommend     
126,1.0 ,                       constant audio and video lag regardless of input or streaming  i also did not pay for a tv to have forced advertisements shoved in my face   these tvs have ads you have to pass thru to get to settings on the tv using the remote   until these shady practices are done away with  i will not be purchasing further samsung products      
127,5.0 ,                       love this tv  lots to rave about here  firstly  it s super light weight     lbs  not too big for small spaces and easy to move around  also super easy to set up providing you have an updated router   you may have to buy a new one like i did   tplink ac      i recommend this one   once you have that  your streaming services will be a piece of cake   in addition there are literally hundreds of free channels with just about every topic covered running       the remote is super simple with very few buttons to push but covers everything you needs to access on your tv   i haven t tried to voice activation and don t really need it   otherwise i am very happy with the samsung which is also a favorite of one of my sisters      
128,3.0 ,                       the picture was too sharp and unrealistic looking the dark areas bothered me  they were almost solid black with absolutely no detail in them the colors are vivid and unrealistic i went through all the settings and couldn t improve the image i requested a refund right away i took a picture of the image on the tv  the second image is from the sony     that i bought to replace the samsung     
129,1.0 ,                       i ve had trouble watching my tv from the first day it was set up  the picture skips ahead  then it gets blurry  then it pixelates  it happens more on certain channels  samsung said i should call spectrum but now i ve had   people from spectrum come over to my apartment to try and solve the problem  i ve even had supervisors  they told me  no  it seems to be your tv  now it looks like i can t return my tv after september  rd    well i ve been trying to get it fixed all this time but nothing has been working  i just bought this tv        
130,4.0 ,                       the television s display was beautiful upon setup  i have it hooked up to my yamaha receiver through the earc hdmi  as of late though i can t seem to sync the voice with the video  inhave gone through the tv s menu and it doesn t come close enough to be in sync  does anybody else have this issue and is there something i can do to remedy this other than that i am very pleased with the value and display  this also arrived by box truck  two gentleman moved it to where i wanted it and the box was in great shape so they left me to my tv  i also began looking at a different model because of the amazon sale but  settled on a slightly more expensive model due to the reviews of the sale model      
131,1.0 ,                       i have to give this samsung a one    i have to say it s not very nice to send someone a tv that won t even turn on  not very happy that i have to have some one come out to look at my new tv because it won t even turn on after the samsung tech comes out  i will be returning it and buying a different brand i really think the tv i received was a return and that is why it s not turning on  not at all please      
132,4.0 ,                       the picture on this tv is very bright and crisp  it has good sound quality as well  if you are using it in conjunction with a hub of some sort  it is perfect  my issues lie with the tv s user interface  the tv defaults to a limited number of very random channels when it is turned on  rather than some sort of menu like on a roku tv  every time i turn it on  it s some show about fishing  then i have to hit a few buttons to change the input  the menu itself is a pop up menu at the bottom of the screen that gives you limited options  overall it takes a frustrating amount of time to get to what you actually want to watch  there is also an ambience mode included as a button on the remote that does absolutely nothing but interrupt your programming when you accidentally press the ambience mode button  overall  the hardware is good  but the software is shockingly bad      
133,1.0 ,                       if you want to play or watch anything in the lowest  k and hdr quality go ahead im not wasting my time with samsung anymore my  k      tu         samsung tv s right backlight went out   days before christmas and then the left a week later ive only used the tv for    months i have a           that still works this picture quality is trrrash with   r s olease do yourself the favor and buy a nanocell or save for a q  t if you still want a samsung but im donevwith there trrrash   r s of course      
134,2.0 ,                       i got this tv a few days ago  bought it from amazon  it arrived a day earlier than expected  very satisfied with most aspects of the tv but at this time i can only give it two     stars   here s my pro con opinion pro s   beautiful picture  plenty of options to manipulate the picture to suit your taste and room lighting  tv is nice and thin  its wall hung in our master bedroom and i used a very compact monoprice mount that tucks it tight against the wall  sound is decent with options  pickup of home wifi signal was instantaneous  the remote is very similar to my amazon firestick  k so its easy to use con s   samsung builds in some preset apps like  samsung freetv  and  samsung health  that could be nice to have  but rather than being able to move them out of the preset area over with the other apps like hgtv or hulu or youtube  it seems they are locked and whenever you turn on the tv  one of them is selected  my provider is youtubetv and i would like the tv to power on showing the youtubetv guide with its       channels  i can t seem to make that happen  and i was on the phone with a samsung  technician  who admitted he didn t know much about setting up the home bar  this set also says  alexa is built in  which is true  but it seems its a limited alexa  i press the microphone button and ask  alexa  switch to youtubetv  and the youtube logo appears  not the youtubetv logo  if i ask to switch to msnbc  alexa gives me a wikipedia explanation of the origins of msnbc  nbc  and the parent company i d like to like this tv five     stars worth  but until i can get someone to explain how to use the features i paid for  its just another basic samsung tv with wifi  i could ve bought a cheaper model and probably had the same picture quality  i will come back and re evaluate if i can get it working as advertised      
135,4.0 ,                       our old samsung      years  failed with a streak of dead pixels across the screen  i ordered this one and cannot be more pleased with it  especially at this price point pros   easy to setup  wi fi  apps  etc    great value    k and good quality picture   screen glare  i saw a few reviews talking about this but honestly have not experienced a problem  we have two windows where light hit the tv as well as a ceiling light very close to it and when we mounted it on our wall  we solved the problem by tilting it a bit down  day or night time viewing looks great neutral   smart settings on tv  i hardly use them as i just do everything from my fire tv   voice control was seems to work fine at times but others not so much cons   while the picture quality is good i had to fiddle with the settings to get it to look just right   the speakers on this tv do not fill the room  you ll need to really up the volume for certain movies  or output the sound by other devices      
136,5.0 ,                       amazing tv  easy to use and setup and my games looking amazing     
137,5.0 ,                       i gave it a   stars because i really liked how the tv looks  the small frame makes the tv look really great  the alexa feature and the apps are cool  the only problem is the remote control  not even a month using it and stop working  only the power on off button works  i checked the reviews about the remote control and it happened to a lot of people before  i just bought from amazon a regular samsung remote control that works just fine in that tv  it costs about    dollars  i you want the remote that has the alexa built in  last time i checked it cost about    dollars  so i love the tv  all the features it has  just don t trust in the remote     
138,1.0 ,                          this tv constantly cycles on off all day so no chance of using an energy efficient power strip unless you want to hear every thing turn on and off        times per day  i would love to see exactly how much added energy cost is accrued due to the constant cycling    it s loaded with ads garbage from their partners  every time you turn the thing on it opens into samsung tv provider  use roku  too bad  pay for cable too bad  use your tv for gaming  too bad  every single time you turn this thing on you re gonna be watching some low budget lifetime flick on samsung tv    it s loaded with ads garbage from their partners  in addition to only opening into the samsung sponsored tv service  the apps available for download are limited  difficult to navigate because of their home screen design  and the weird samsung sponsored ads are always listed first  you have to scroll past their garbage to get to your most frequently used preferred apps      
139,3.0 ,                       the protective film was loose and when i removed the energy efficiency sticker it pulled off  there is nothing in the owner manual to address this  but once that film comes off there is no picture beneath it  i had to tape back on but you can tell where it separated and it looks terrible  not what i expected for a tv of this magnitude  if the screen ever get scratched or damaged i imagine in the future it might do this  this happened upon unpacking and set up on the first day  now i have to return it      
140,1.0 ,                       once i set up internet it worked fine  it s strange that you have to instal the mobile app fo the initial setup  then when i turned it back on  the tv is not connected to the network  somehow it can still access youtube  the app on phone isn t fixing it because the tv needs internet access  which tells me the app is basically useless  i like my sony tv much more it has had no issues in months  i still haven t figured this out      
141,4.0 ,                       i really enjoy samsung tv products  i do own other tvs outside of this brand though  i ordered this tv based on a lightning deal and do not regret it  while setting this up  i kept getting a prompt to download a specific samsung app for ease of use and set up  i m not a fan of having to add an app just for ease of use  regardless  you can skip this step setting up disney  netflix   prime allows you to go and add a code on their respective websites to simplify authorization  vudu was an actual username and password  regardless  it was almost a seamless experience for connecting these apps what i don t like  terms of use seem invasive and will almost render tv useless if not accepted  while remote is simple  it s almost sluggish as there is no input option unless you hit the home button and select input  there are also a few proprietary apps that you cannot remove like fb  i do hope that a future update allows for removal of what i consider junk apps edit    no need for tools  legs snap in along with cable holder      
142,4.0 ,                       delighted with the picture and sound  irritated with the stylishly designed remote  whose form favors appearance over functionality  we ve ended up mainly using the remote from an older samsung with  normal  buttons  right now  i m battling with the battery cover on the new remote  and it s a pain trying to slide one curved surface over another  many of the smart features are great  but the dvr via an external drive feature is disabled for the us and canada  and it won t let me hook up a digital antenna along with a cable box  the picture is stunning and the sound is solid  so i don t regret the purchase  but more thoughtfulness to the end user would have been appreciated      
143,1.0 ,                       after several hours of effort  the remote will not pair with the tv   chat with support was unsuccessful   dealing with the telephone support to try to get a new remote sent      
144,4.0 ,                       don t be fooled by people that dont understand how to measure a television    very happy with this tv  got it as a present and my mom loves it wish it was a little brighter  though      
145,3.0 ,                       so this will be a very mixed review due to one major flaw in this tv  starting with the positive aspects  the picture quality is incredible  controls are very intuitive and lots of the apps are great  the major issue is the     error code  seems to be a flaw in the firmware where the wireless disconnects constantly  samsung will always blame your wifi but its not the case  it can be very frustrating since the tv becomes useless until you reset or use an ethernet cable  pretty dissatisfied with that and samsung s  help  with the issue      
146,5.0 ,                       this samsung tv has excellent picture quality and is rich with features     hdmi ports and the best smart tv i have experienced  it comes with all the apps we use and the ability to add others as needed the only negative aspect of the tv is the new remote   it is lacking an input button which we use often   instead you have to go into the settings menu on the tv  select input  then select the source  a  it tedious for a function that we use several times each day     
147,1.0 ,                       i was a loyal samsung customer for years   i ve had tvs  dishwasher  washer   dryers  phones  tablets  and vcrs from samsung   this pos tv is the last straw   the remote is the worst device i have ever used for controlling a tv   the voice defaults to your assistant  alexa  instead of defaulting to searching for programming   roku has been stripped to the point that the roku channel doesn t even have a search function   many of the channels aren t available  and i wish i hadn t thrown away the box   every samsung device i ve recently purchased has been designed by idiots   the dishwasher barely washed dishes   the washer crapped out soon after the waranty   my current phone and tablet won t let me use the sd card that was recommended for anything useful   i am done with samsung      
148,1.0 ,                       item came damaged  screen was damaged  package and styrofoam both ok but tv was not     
149,1.0 ,                       i bought this tv and it arrived on march   th  because if the covid    virus i wasnt able to get it set up until yesterday may   th    i m so upset  the screen has   red dots on it and a red smear area  hopefully samsung can either fix this or exchange it  i contacted them directly and they said they would send someone out this upcoming week  i will updated this and let you know what the outcome is      
150,1.0 ,                       the smart app freezes and is sluggish on hulu prime and netflix but when i put in my fire stick everything works great  is this just the way it is w smart tvs   seems like a waste to have to use a fire stick on a smart tv  btw my internet is working fine  any idea how to remedy this issue       
151,1.0 ,                       i love it  honestly  but after    days  the tv started to turn on and off repeatedly with no picture and sound for a sec in the background  i have followed all the steps to reset it but no luck  so  i decided to chat with samsung for service   i chated with them friday  and they said that somebody is going to come next thursday  but today tuesday  jan      i got another email from the service guys that said they might be available after january   nd  so  here we go  i bought something brand new  the product was defective  and i cannot enjoy it  simple as it january   nd   update    the amazon seller sent me a new tv  the carrier didn t pick up the non functional one  the new tv is working fine  please pray for me that it has a long life  in the meanwhile  the guys from the samsung service called me and apologized that they are not able to come on january   nd because they don t have the part  i don t understand which part   so they wanted to reschedule the service appointment for january   th or   th  almost three weeks since the tv stopped working   i let them know that amazon seller sent me a replacement item also  i have received a virtual message from samsung support with the steps that i should follow to restart the non functional tv  but unfortunately  non of them worked so  now i have an excellent working tv  yay   and another one ready to be shipped  i hope that somebody will come to pick it up soon    all the best to everybody      
152,2.0 ,                       first  yes  i disabled the power saving features and did everything possible to turn the brightness to its max  this tv is unwatchably dark  forget complaining about daytime watching  you can t even watch it at night with a dim lamp running in the same room  i am honestly shocked there are not more complaints about this i would almost assume i got a defective tv  but i am pretty sure the issue is in software  when testing with a laptop or airplay image it gets about as bright as expected  not amazing  but fine   the issue happens when watching hdr content  which is nearly everything these days   everything but the brightest scenes disappear into the shadows  the tv doesn t have the ability to push hdr on the bright side  so i guess instead they give you that high dynamic range my making low to mid lights very dark really a shame because it is otherwise a fantastic value tv  great feature set for the price  great image quality  if watching in a pitch black room  smart features are smooth and easy to use  sound is clear and impressive for built in speakers  i am debating if i will keep it or return      
153,1.0 ,wake up amazon customers  you get what you pay for   i know that you did not think you that were going to get        value in a      tv  because the reality is that i thought that was going to happen unfortunately   i personally think that samsung is the best brand in tv  that s why i was so excited to see an affordable tv made by samsung  i thought that i was going to get  samsung quality  from a      tv  and  unfortunately  i was wrong   i thought that  any tv samsung made was samsung quality regardless of the price   and i found out that this was not true at all  i found out that samsung is a  get what you pay for  company just like all of the other brands  in other words  if you pay            or more for a samsung tv  you will get  samsung quality   but if you pay less than      for a samsung tv  you will not get  samsung quality    we need to realize that this is a       tv   and even though it s coming from the best brand in the world  it s still just       value   don t let this tv fool you just because samsung s name is on it  even though samsung s name is on it  you are still getting a      tv  and if you think about it       tvs don t give you much value at all   below are the problems with this tv     i don t recommend buying a tv online  you will get anxiety and worry about whether or not the tv will arrive to you broken due to shipping and handling  also  when the tv came to my house  there was dirt and dust on the actual tv  like i said  i don t recommend getting a tv online  you will worry too much about the shipping and handling  and when you take it out the box  dirt and dust can be on the tv      on this tv  the words people are saying can t keep up the movement of their mouth  in other words  there s a lag when people are speaking  the sound of the words come in         seconds late after the movement of the mouth      sometimes  when you turn it on live tv such as cnn  the tv  hesitates  before it get into natural motion of the live feed      the game mode is no good at all  the game mode is too dark and the    hz refresh rate is not consistent  in other words  when you put it on game mode  it suppose to run games at    hz like we gamers like it  however  it does not run it at    hz for very fast moving objects  it will probably run at    z for  slow to medium speed  objects  but when it comes to very fast moving objects  you can forget it  it will run fast moving objects at   z with motion blur and judder  to put it simple  this tv can not run very fast video game motion at    hz  period      the sound for this tv is not good  you better get a soundbar if you want high quality sound      the picture has potential but it does not live up to it due to it being just      value  what i mean is that if you play around with the picture settings for like   days  you can actually get a very good picture  for example  i choose dynamic mode for my picture mode  and it was a very good picture  however  the problem is that even though the picture was good  it seems like the picture was not  smooth   it s hard to explain this part  but i hope you get what i m saying  it seems like a      samsung tv was trying its best to give you a  high quality picture  but it was struggling to do so  that s the best i can put it   i don t recommend this tv  i recommend samsung  but not this tv  i will get a refund for this tv and i will go to the local walmart  invest more money  and get a better samsung tv because this tv is not high quality   if you want a high quality tv  you have to spend the money  period  you have to spend at least            or more   you will not get high quality from a      tv  i don t care whether it s from samsung or not  you will not get high quality in a      tv  period   if you can t afford a tv above       and if you buy this tv  then good luck with it and i hope that you have a better experience than me and my family   but  the bottom line is that you will not get high quality in a      tv  period   i have learned my lesson about tvs  invest good money in a high quality one  and don y buy one online   take care   huge update on august            this is an update because i m trying to help you ll out  in my original review  i said i was going to a local walmart to get a high quality tv   news flash  walmart does not sell high quality tvs in local stores                       i just recently found this out   you see  walmart is basically is just about making profit  they bring in the cheapest products so they can make the most profit  this is how they bring in and sell tvs   all of the tvs at walmart is poor quality   yeah  they have the  big names  but they sell the lowest quality tvs of those big brands   so  even though i recommend buying a tv locally and offline in order to avoid shipping and handling stress  do not go to walmart  you will most definitely get the lowest quality there  guaranteed  instead  try another retail such as target  best buy  etc  but not walmart   also  i understand some people prefer buying online or they need to buy online  for example  you might find a can t miss deal online or something  so  if you buy online  make sure that you buy from an online retail that has a no hassle refund return policy  great shipping and handling  and a high quality tv   and even though i don t recommend walmart stores offline for tvs  if you want to buy online  walmart does have high quality tvs online partially because  rd party sellers put high quality tvs on their website  and walmart itself might throw you a bone with a high quality tv on their website if you look hard enough  but avoid local walmart stores for tvs   take care   huge update on august            i no longer consider samsung as the best company in tvs anymore  therefore  they are no longer my favorite  i think they are a company to  consider  but samsung is no longer my top choice   the reason is because after having a bad experience with this tv  samsung is simply not what they used to be  samsung used to be a company that used to give  nothing but high quality    but  as of now  they are making  a lot of garbage  tvs   simply put  if you are not investing        or more in a samsung  you are simply not going to get their best quality because they are saving their best quality for only tvs over        and they are making a lot of garbage tvs which costs under         and i think this is unfair to the customers in general   you should look for a tv brand that is making high quality tvs that is under        that includes the following         native refresh rate    quantum dot or better technology    have the ability to cut off  the soap opera effect  with ease     have a dynamic game mode    good quality build and good customer support   take care 
154,5.0 ,                       sound isn t the best  sound bar will be needed  but the picture is amazing  smart features make searching for anything seamless  countless apps that my fire stick doesn t support  love how it is all screen and you don t have an annoying boarder that even some new tvs have  will order another      next time   did become frozen during a set up screen but tech support was on top of it and helped me in moments      
155,5.0 ,                       no problems  everything works perfectly  you will need to change default setting for brightness otherwise your screen will look to dark  pretty easy fix  unpacking is   man job and you need to be carefully not grab the screen and break it  i have a feeling the bad reviews come from people who can not follow simple directions and damage the unit       
156,1.0 ,                       the tv legs are so wide that they don t fit on most tv stands or dressers   sony s legs are much closer together   plus  since redesigning from the previous center support  the engineers created an even bigger problem  tipovers increased after they redesigned to wide legs because because kids now knock them right off their furniture due to the extreme width of the legs      
157,4.0 ,                       i ve never owned a more complicated piece of equipment than this samsung tv  and when i first started buying a v toys  jfk was president  yeah  i m old  set up was a joke  and you need to create an account with samsung just to watch tv   and the personal questions they had to ask   just to watch tv   gimme a break in my opinion the remote sucks  plain and simple  you have to scroll all over the place to get to anywhere  whoever designed it obviously never tried to actually use the thing  compared to all the remotes i ve ever used  this one is by far the most complicated thing i ve ever seen  and i ve had a ton of remotes over the years  i have to use   remotes right now to run the tv  bluray  firestick and denon receiver  i tried unsuccessfully three times last night to set it up to where i d only have to use   remotes  but i m back to having to use    smdhwhere i m located windstream is my only source  so i have kinetic tv ran through the firestick  i ve got two vizio tv s that have no problems at all using the firestick  so it could be that samsung just makes it difficult for those of us stuck with a hdmi cable and a chuck of plastic attached to it  when i went looking for the kinetictv app  i was sure it wasn t even listed  i finally found it after scrolling about     apps down  now i have it loaded on my home screen  and only have to scroll through    others just to get to it  i m hoping it s something i m doing wrong and it could be  if someone out there knows if apps can be situated in a different order  please enlighten me having said all that  the picture quality of this tv is great  i ve owned samsung in the past  and there s something about a samsung picture you just know when you see it  i was more than impressed with the picture  the thin bezel running around the perimeter is also a nice touch  and the tv sound is better than one might expect since the picture is the most important aspect of a television  i ll live with the complaints i made above and just deal with it  not of my choosing  but really  it s not very user friendly at all  i m sure over time i ll get more adjusted to it  and possibly learn a few tricks to simplify things  i ve only had it    hours  probably should ve waited to write a review the coolest part is when you turn it off or on  buy one  you ll see what i mean      
158,5.0 ,                       all i can say is wow  this tv is nice  the picture is great  picture is clear even when your on the side of the tv  this tv integrates with the fire stick  i am using the tv s remote to control the fire stick  the smart software works without any lag  it has a bunch of free channels from the internet  i will update this in a month      
159,3.0 ,                       i have been using this tv for   months now  here is my experience there is annoying lag with the tv when using the remote  when scrolling through titles it will often freeze and you have to wait for it  this happens a lot the remote has levers to push the volume channels up and down and they are bothersome  you will accidently hit them  if you press down on the levers you will mute whatever you are watching and its easy to accidently do that when just trying to change the volume or channel the remote also has some buttons at the top you will most likely never use  one of them is a  ambient button   or something  all it does is shut off the tv  and the few times i tried to figure out what it did i had to unplug the tv to just get back to the regular main screens  no i didn t read the manual maybe its supposed to do something else    idgaf besides all that the picture is good  smart hub is fine  all i do is use the tv for streaming netflix  hulu  prime and youtube      
160,4.0 ,                       after looking at a lot of tv s and reading reviews i finally got this samsung tv   it replaces a sharp tv that the sound kept cutting out on needing turning the tv off for a minute and turning it back on  a known issue with sharp  but no update   the samsung is great bang for back  although performance was also important   it got better buyer reviews than most of the sets i was looking at  for a better price  picture is good  sound is good  set up with all the menus and smart functions to scroll through was a pita  all i wanted was a tv to watch movies on  the remote control turns on complicated menus on tv that one needs to scroll through  it is not intuitive  one need to spend some time with a downloaded manual to learn how to use this tv i prefer quick buttons on remote the instruction pamphlet included is very limited and one needs to download the full manual online  once i did that and took the time to read up on the control functions things became clearer  i still prefer buttons than scrolling through functions i have direct tv and wanted to set the dtv controller for this tv  could not find a correct code at first  direct tv gives the wrong code  and their code link is a blank page  seems to open their code list one needs to sign in first pita looking for all the passwords  and whats the secret      finally i found and old print out with several codes and the last one worked         ymmv  update  so after having this tv for a few weeks  its a second room tv   i looked at the samsung tv a few times and found the picture a bit flat not deep hue and vivid  especially faces  i went into picture settings set dynamic and than advanced  and adjusted there a bit  got better than standard setting  but my old sony      still has more depth and vivid colors  with all the functions this tv has i would have preferred  individual color control not a general color slider  i ll never use most of the other functions      
161,3.0 ,                       i was excited to purchase this       k tv  the image seemed blurry and dark to me  i asked my brother to look at it to see if it was just me  good news image was fine  i had to do a lot of manual adjusting to coloring  the remote is simplistic in design and leaves little to be desired  you have to go into a few menus to get to sleep timers  digital tv or apps  their samsung tv app takes over everything  when all you want is to do is change the local digital channel  nope  it automatically dumps you into samsung tv plus  extremely annoying  it s a cumbersome layout to say the least  i am a samsung household  dvd  tv  phones  tablets washing  machines all samsung  this is the first samsung device that has me frustrated and disappointed  i m giving the unit   stars simply because for a newer model it s missing a lot of bells and whistles      
162,3.0 ,                       lots of smart features with appear to work well  but lacks basic features  tv doesn t work with alexa as advertised  built in speakers only work by bluetooth  only two blue tooth connections available  one which has to be the speakers  if headphones are connected by bluetooth  the tv speakers don t work  one person can t use headphones while another listens to tv  remote had no number pad  can t choose a channel number to go to  remote is not back lit so you can t see the buttons in dim light or dark  haven t figured out a use for ambient mode  takes to many clicks to move to settings  these observations are after one week of using the tv      
163,3.0 ,                       picture okay  firestick portion is just the  new  amazon prime look also as others have stated  loses audio for no reason  only fix is to turn it off for   to   minutes then turn it back on   just turning it off then on does not work has built in alexa  which is very important to m e but you have to dig through the menus to find it   you can have google voice  samsung bixby or amazon alexa nice picture but not as good as my oled lg   didn t go with lg because of buggy software and the occasional audio  lip sync issue      weighs less than   lbs   does not include wall mount bolts   legs were easy to attach   tv feels well balanced on these feet   one of the better sets out there for the money   still cannot use the built in firestick  you can login then it tosses you back to the prime video app      
164,5.0 ,                       extremely happy with this purchase  we bought this for a father s day gift for my husband  he is thrilled with it  picture quality is amazing  the size was perfect for our wall  easy to connect  smart apps are easy to navigate  install and use  the remote is decent wish it was a bit bigger  easy to lose but hey aren t they all  happy with everything about this tv  reviewing after   months of use here      
165,5.0 ,                       granted  this is a significant upgrade from what i had  but this is a great tv  i bought it with the samsung sound bar to replace the main tv in the living room  great quality uhd picture and great sound as well  setup was easy  it has all the apps i want  it s very light  and it has plenty of inputs  just a few caveats though  i have an older panasonic vcr dvd recorder combo  it has hdmi out  but when trying to connect this there were connection problems  perhaps all that is needed is a newer hdmi cable  but i haven t bothered  i just hooked it up composite  another thing is i thought the samsung sound bar would be more easily controlled with the same remote as for the tv  once connected it does simply take over as the tv sound  with       and mute controlled by the tv remote with no problem  the trouble is the sound bar power stays on when you turn off the tv  in other words  i thought you d be able to turn everything on and off at once  not the case  or at least i haven t figured it out  i just leave the sound bar on all the time  when you turn on the tv you first hear sound from the tv speakers for about    seconds while everything boots up  and then the sound bar takes over  another thing is there are some oem apps you can t delete  this is a bummer  because it clutters up the home screen with things i won t ever use      
166,5.0 ,                       this was huge but the delivery into the house was awesomely helpful  my son and i were able to follow the simple set up instructions and in no time we were up and running  learning how to use the remote  love the shortcut buttons  and we the smart features when we plug in different devices  dvd and xbox have to share a cable   the only down fall is that there are only two hdmi slots but we re rolling with it  we had a     before  i think  and the     screen is fantastic      
167,2.0 ,                       this is hugely disappointing  i really saved and planned on this for months for a big splurge   i am out nearly   grand and my    year old    inch had a much better picture this one is just and bland and meh  hardly something you shell out nearly   grand for  every now and then you see something that makes you go   hey  that is pretty neat  but for the most part my old    year tv is just better    my biggest complaint is the tv is just too dim  the settings were very hard to find but once i did i set brightness and contrast all the way up   still  in the daytime  it washes out and is hard to see  at night time with all the lights off it is ok  just ok   so now in the winter with sundown by the time you get off work it s usable  but in summer when the sun is up until   pm this tv will just be a very expensive wall ornament   did i mention my    year old tv is better i feel sooo cheated and crushed      
168,5.0 ,                       sharp crisp picture  volume level not that great for watching movies purchased a sound bar   all the smart tv channels  features are ok  not really needed  should have local channels as well  but a great buy for a   in  smart  k tv      
169,5.0 ,                       overall  this is a great value tv  there are definitely some better tvs  but you would need to pay significantly more  this one has really great picture quality  although not the best blacks in a dark scene like an oled  and the picture washes out some when viewing from a sharp angle  i ve seen complaints about light bleed  but i haven t noticed that issue yet  i did  however  constantly lose internet connection    turns out  this is due to the  instant on  feature  once we turned it off  it has been working fine  the instant on feature only makes a small improvement to boot time anyway      
170,5.0 ,                       i got one of these to use as a computer monitor  it works great  the one big problem i do have is we have another samsung tv in the same room for watching tv  when ever you turn one on or off the other tv does the same  yet the rest of the remote features do not control both tv s  i would think there is a setting somewhere that can be changed  for now i just tell alexa to turn of the tv via the tv remote      
171,1.0 ,                       i don t usually write reviews unless they re positive  but i wanted to share what this company has put me through in hopes that it helps at least one person  i bought this tv and loved it for the first   months  then the tv randomly died  i thought it was just an issue with the remote at first  so i put in new batteries and the remote light seemed to be working  of course there s no way to actually see if it was an issue with the remote or the tv itself as the tv doesn t have any manual buttons  i troubleshooted with two different samsung reps and to no avail  they offered to have a service rep come try to fix the tv  i agreed and then about a week later i had to call them to find out when this tech will be coming to my home in the middle of a pandemic  when i call  i find that there s no service centers or techs in my area  so at this point  they issued me a ticket number and began the process of a refund  they also had me fill out papers for the refund to not be issued back to the card i purchased it on  but by direct deposit to my checking account  i hear nothing about when this refund will occur other than the blind faith that it will  another week passes and i call samsung again  they state they need to schedule a day and time for someone to pick up the tv at my home  i thought there were no service centers or techs in my area  but okay  another week later  the tv is finally scheduled to get picked up  the tv gets picked up on the scheduled day and time  a week passes since the tv has been picked up and i ve heard nothing from samsung or been issued my refund  i m not even notified that this tv has been received by samsung until i reach out and ask  additionally  i m not sure where this refund will be issued because every time i call  no one can give me that information  even though i filled out papers for the occurrence of direct deposit   i m always told that case management will call me and provide me with this information  a month later and i have yet to receive a call from samsung ever  let alone samsung case management  it has now been over a month since this process began and i m unsure of if how it will resolve  samsung has the tv in their possession as well as the funds i used to purchase it  ultimately  the lack of communication from samsung is absolutely pathetic  from start to finish  this process was nothing but more work for me  the consumer  because of their defective product  obviously  my original plan was use my refund money to buy a new tv  but it s been so long that i couldn t let samsung hinder my life any more than they already have  dramatic  i know   i m a millennial  needless to say  i will never purchase any product from samsung ever again  i can only hope that i will receive my refund too      
172,4.0 ,                       i bought this tv for my remote apartment  where i don t have internet   so i can t comment on the smart features   but it has a great picture and linking it to a micro usb card reader for viewing gopro videos is great   movies on the dvd player are also a pleasure to watch   the higher definition allows viewing of  k videos   i m not fond of the remote   searching for specific command buttons is a pain   but i have an old remote that i found at goodwill that works great   don t get me wrong  i love the tv and would buy it again      
173,5.0 ,                       i bought this tv as a gift for my sister  i shopped around a few other models  etc   i found this samsung as a excellent value  size  picture quality  and features  at first  when i unboxed and set the tv up  i had problems getting the device to communicate with the router  i feared there was a firmware issue with the tv  i rebooted the tv and router a few times and the issue was resolved  the tv works great  my sister loves it  over all  i recommend this tv because of its quality and value      
174,1.0 ,                       after       hours of troubleshooting samsung finally told me to call amazon as the tv i bought is defective   amazon won t replace it because i bought it from the warehouse  they won t let me buy an exact same model at the same price as a replacement  instead today issued a     credit but not i m not allowed to use it toward purchase of the more expensive replacement tv  usually amazon is fantastic  but i m not impressed this time around      
175,2.0 ,                       i bought this about   weeks ago  it has a  white  space around the top left corner  and along the left side   it is mostly noticeable when there is a black   dark scene     it is not solid black in the upper left corner  or along the left side  when it is evenly dark everywhere else  about   inch circumference in top left corner is the worst   annoying but the box to return tv is gone so dealing with it  the os and included apps worked well the first few weeks  then this week the prime app started acting up  it would not open  i clicked the prime button it would not open so navigated to and selected the prime app and it keeps taking me to the samsung free channels or one of the connected game systems  very annoying but we had like   other apps to pick from so we just moved on    unfortunately  next day     opening the prime app was still an issue  it would not open  and now apple   does not open either  oh wait now hulu doesn t open either  i unplugged tv and waited    seconds  plugged it back in     still none of the apps will open  soooo i went to settings support update    tv up to date  no updates available  then i go into the app settings  tried to delete apple  so i could reinstall    ugh  nope i cant delete it because it was preinstalled  once there however  i decided to click open from the apps settings section  totally unacceptable solution to this problem but that worked  then i went back to the appropriate way of selecting app to open  for whatever reason i am now able to open all apps again  sorry but when i go to use my tv  i want it to just work as it should  i should not have to troubleshoot every time i turn on the tv   weeks in to be able to watch something  so yeah if you have patience and can accept less than perfect functionality and picture quality  but pretty good in fairness  then this is an option  that said  too many unacceptable issues for the prices so i give it   stars  if it would have worked the way it should without requiring me to do a bunch of troubleshooting after   weeks of use  it probably would have received   stars  if the screen was not already messed up in the top left corner and the apps worked without struggle i would have probably given it   stars because when the issues outlined above are not present  it is a pretty good tv  all this said  i would recommend you pay the extra for added warranty if you do purchase this tv because it is too big to return without a reasonable amount of frustration   oh and dont buy it just because it is alexa enabled if you already have echos in the house  totally useless feature to have on the tv if you already have an echo  or many   i got it with alexa thinking i would be able to  easily  sync my echo plus with it    which you can do but there is nothing easy at all about the setup and once it is setup there is a major delay between the tv audio and echo audio   echo is delayed by like       seconds   i have gb internet service with an excellent router   i will say  the speakers in the tv are pretty good so i just use the tv speakers  over all  i was disappointed with this purchase but its good enough not to return  at least not yet updatestill not loving the tv  the app store section is horrible  search ui tries to be smart but fails miserably  half the time you click install on an app it looks like it s going to install and it doesn t the samsung free content is annoying because it goes right to that instead of letting me pick what i want when i first turn on the tv and it s louder than the other apps it s good enough for the sales price i paid but will never pay full price for a samsung anything after the experience i ve had with this tv      
176,5.0 ,                       the tv is great but i had a heck of a time getting it to work my with sonos beam soundbar  after many hours of tech support  i want to share the solution below so others don t have to have a headache with it  very pleased now i am glad to report that it is working now  after various online website and app chat diagnostics reports  i was impatient and called the sonos     number and i believe the tech support person s name was lara  we spent almost    minutes on the call and she carefully had me isolate each separate hdmi device  from my end  i had the sonos beam solely connected to the samsung hdmi e arc input and it worked fine  in this instance  when one lowered the tv volume  instead of  tv speakers  being the icon displayed with the volume changing displayed on the tv screen  the hdmi  receiver  was the icon displayed  and since the only physical device connected at all  via hdmi  then it was the sonos beam  i could clearly and only hear sound from the sonos beam  could change the volume also using the sonos s  app and the tv remote  and no sound was ever dropped in and out  then we connected the google chromecast via another hdmi  and the sonos beam still worked  lastly  we connected the comcast xfinity cable box via another hdmi  and it still worked  mind you  unplugging and replugging the power cords and hdmis for all of these devices had not worked for me before  only when i solely had the samsung tv play video and audio through a native smarttv app  for whatever reason  the order of connecting these devices seemed to have made a difference for me  i wanted to share this with others since this has been a huge pain in the butt  i was about to return one or both products  and none of the other community tech support postings seemed to have a solution posted for the last several months  lastly  before this was resolved  and the beam was only successfully playing music with other synced wifi sonos speakers via spotify  the s  app would not allow me to finish the  tv setup  connection either via hdmi arc nor the optical hdmi adapter  after this was resolved  that s  app  tv setup  option went through automatically  i m a happy camper now  took awhile but wanted to share this possible solution with others       
177,5.0 ,                       i purchased the samsung     model   worked for a day then sound  but no picture   rather than waiting for samsung tech to come look at it  i returned and replaced it with the same model   i just received new one today   will set it up tomorrow and  fingers crossed  it will work i received the replacement model and after   days of use it s working great   beautiful picture and samsung tv has a lot of free channels   very happy with my purchase      
178,2.0 ,                       i was looking to upgrade the tv in my living room  i already own a set of samsung sound towers  which i love  so i figured i d buy a samsung tv to complement them  found a     samsung qled on sale at walmart  even though it initially connected to my wifi with no issues and had bluetooth capabilities  i was unable to get it connected with my sound towers either way  i called samsung customer service for assistance  but they couldn t help me fix the issue  i figured rather than go thru the hassle of returning it  i ll keep it and deal with it as is  about   weeks later  apps started crashing  sound was going in and out  and the tv kept disconnecting from my home network  so i returned it still in search of a tv for my living room  i turned to amazon and found this one  based on many of the reviews  i placed my order  the tv was delivered right on time  and i m excited  while the tv was easy enough to get set up  it has no option to connect to my sound towers via bluetooth nor wifi   excitement gone   but oh well  right  don t want to go through the process of another return  so i m just gonna make this one work out as i go to download a few apps that i like to use for streaming  i realize that there are about    apps that are already preinstalled that i have absolutely no use for  what makes the matter so disgusting is that none of the preinstalled apps can be removed  deleted or uninstalled   now i have    apps that are of no use to me taking up space and memory on a tv that i paid for   not happy at all   we spend hundreds of dollars on these devices only to not have any control over the content or how we use them anymore  and i personally find that quite sickening  the qled that i returned before purchasing this one also came with preloaded apps  but i did have options to remove them and add the apps i wanted  i can t understand how anybody could be happy with any device that is more than halfway loaded with apps that they ll never use and can never remove so  moving on   picture quality is great  but after about   hrs in  same day as delivery   app closes and i m presented with a message saying  having trouble connecting   so after troubleshooting with no resolve  i decided to reset to factory and set up again  i go into settings and the option to reset is greyed out    ok  so i m like  who does that     so now i m looking through to see what options i do have  only to find out that many of the options that were available on the qled that i returned are not available on this tv  i e  software update  broadcasting  tv reset  and some of the picture and sound settings  i have   smaller tvs of different brands  and much  much cheaper that i ve had for years now and i haven t had any problems with any of them  i can t take it  now i m returning this tv  but afraid to buy another one   especially if i can t own it after i purchase it  everything is getting to be like houses and real property now   no matter how much money you put into it  it s never really yours      
179,5.0 ,                       as far as the tv goes  it s great  no complaints  i m only putting in a review because i was terrified of buying a tv online  we all have our own stories  but mine came in perfect condition  and trust me  i was extremely scared to buy online  but under the circumstances was left with no other option  ordered it and it came a few days early  once again  perfect condition  as far as the tv goes  it has beautiful picture and decent sound  overall i have no complaints      
180,5.0 ,                       my only complaint about the tv was the stand had a wider footprint than the     it was replacing  a quick mount on a pedestal stand and all was great the smart features would not synch with my comcast xfinity  the tv refused to recognize the cable input or cable box  so  i essentially have a dumb tv with a cable box remote the remote    sized for a child s hand  a severe paucity of features  instantly replaced with a universal remote      
181,2.0 ,                       brightness was at max settings and much less bright than my original much older      good luck trying to watch anything mid day  you ll only see     of what s happening on the tv when you factor in glare and ambient light resolutions  size and product was fine overall though had to lay    dollars to send back a product that in my opinion isn t ready for purchase  why      
182,3.0 ,                       while the picture is awesome  the tv has several  memory  issues  it forgets setting between power cycles  and apps come and go  after spending    minutes on chat with a samsung rep  i decided  it is what it is   i have purchased only samsung electronics for the past   years  but after this tv  i will be rethinking that  i previously purchased a samsung a   cell phone  and it was a terrible device  but i paid full price here on amazon  so dumping it is not an option  i never imagined i would get a second lemon with this tv  i almost repacked it to send back  but the picture is it s only saving grace  i had removed my roku  as all my streaming service are included as  apps  on this set  the problem is  once they are installed and  signed in  the set forgets their logins and position on on the home screen  what an annoying pain to log in every time you access the app  so  with the roku back on hdmi   the set performs flawlessly  just irritating that i didn t gt      of what i paid for  oh  and tech support says the reason is   wait for it   not all apps are compatible with their sets  what   they re your apps   how could they not be compatible  although  the youtube app works  as advertised  so there must be something to the compatibility issue      
183,5.0 ,                       needed a new tv for the room and man i m glad i got this  it came loaded with channels that you get for free just need a wife connection  hooking up my xbox immediately detected and put the tv into game mode which i can say looks really nice  looks great in a decent lit to dimmer room  remote has voice control which i know for some can be a deal breaker also has bluetooth which is great for connecting wireless headphones  there is a bit of delay when i was gaming not sure if it was internet or whatever but it wasn t unbearable  i did need a chrome cast to connect my macbook to stream couldn t find a easier way to do it  it does have all the apps you need netflix  youtube  hulu      ect  my only cons so far after   months are the sound can be a little low and not filling or surround if your looking for a higher quality maybe invest in a sound bar my model didn t have one but it wasn t a deal break  the viewing angles can be a problem if in a wide room and watching at an angle or having a lot of people over not everyone s going to have the same quality views of the tv  the ports for the hdmi are at a horrible awkward angle makes it hard to connect especially if you have it mounted  the tv also has no on off button so tether your remote or put a tracking device on it  samsung makes quality products if your looking for a tv you couldn t go wrong choosing this     
184,3.0 ,                       reviews about brightness are accurate  very dim and no way to brighten  having issues connecting to my cable box  not sure if it s an issue with the hdmi cable  the hdmi   port  or just my cable provider but will update once i find out  calling my cable provider tomorrow  would love to be able to brighten the picture but don t see any options that allow it      
185,5.0 ,                       prior to this i had purchased an lg smart tv and spent almost   days trying everything possible to get the wifi to connect  i m a fairly tech savvy person and tried everything that was online  videos  etc  finally i returned it and i m happy i did  this samsung tv had easy set up and connected to the wifi instantly  picture is great  only thing i find a little weird is the channel button and volume button on the remote you push up and down instead of having separate buttons for up and down like a typical remote  outside of that it s great so far      
186,4.0 ,                       i received this tv in good condition  set it all up very easily  picture is great  it s a lot to learn and setup to your liking  i had a problem with alexa no working and called samsung   times to correct it  the last technician said this is a new model and they are still working out the problems with it  i am very happy with everything but the alexa app not working without resetting the remote and tv all the time  i will return and update this review if anything changes      
187,4.0 ,                       this seems like a very good value  though i ve had it only a few days   it s our second tv  for the bedroom  and it s the perfect sized screen       for it  the picture quality is   star  as i noted and the price is very fair   didn t think much of the built in samsung smart apps  but i ve rarely found any viewing device s  native  streaming apps to be as good or as dependable as those on an external device  using roku now  only complaint is the size and design of the remote   it is way to tiny and  fiddly   easy to lose and hard to use   i d say  also  the remote  looks like it was designed to win the coveted   snooty  prize  aka the  we are much better than those uncultured americans  award   presented annually in brussels however  i bought this ge big button universal remote control for samsung from jeff https   www amazon com gp product b    hvb   ref ppx yo dt b asin title o   s   ie utf  psc  only ten bucks and it worked immediately    fuggedaboutit   as they say      
188,4.0 ,                       overall  i like this tv  to meet my standards  it did take reconfiguring the brightness  turning off the ambient sensor  and adjusting the sharpness  i m not sure why  but these tvs are initially configured downwards in functionality and quality of picture  it s very low brightness could anger some people  check the settings i did have one problem with an optical cable getting stuck in the tv  samsung  please fix that  luckily  i was able to remove it   it did require a lot of effort  with pliers  if you don t like the soap opera effect  turn down the judder setting  under clarity this is my first fully  smart  tv  it took some getting used to  with all the initial setup  required use of a mobile app  and learning to use the built in apps      
189,4.0 ,                       simply put  not having a button  anywhere  on the unit to physically turn power on off  much less other basic functions  is a crime   sure  most people never use them  but they are useful in a pinch   i d even settle for the  behind the back   buttons  style that is annoying as hell to use  but at least gets the job done the only other complaint i have changing inputs requires too many button pushes  home                          then left right to select       hotkeys  for smart inputs are included  netflix  amazon  samsung   but without any customization i ve seen yet  not much use for anyone who uses hulu over one of the others  for example   and toggling between a cable box and dvd player  or a stream computer input is annoying the picture and sound quality are great   i ve seen better  but not by significant leaps  and none for a better value    instruction manual is a bit lacking  but nowhere near the travesty of many guides out there   stands are clearly labelled  moderately idiot proof  better than the armrests on the chair i ordered a year ago    bezel is gorgeously small   stand prevents forward backward rocking well  even clunking it firmly on the top edge requires a good hit to risk the tv tipping  would give this a     stars if i could  but lack of the physical buttons prevents me from giving it a full    hands down      
190,2.0 ,                       i only buy samsung tvs and this model seems to have big issues   the    inch   series has great features and an even better remote    however  there is a problem with this series of    having big red dots across the screen  see photos    this was the  rd try with this model   the first  ordered from  best buy had the dots as well   so  i returned it and ordered one from amazon which arrived cracked down the middle   i returned that one for what you see in the photos  yep    big red dots   i returned this one and went to best buy and purchased the   series      great picture  great apps  mediocre remote      
191,2.0 ,                       this tv is the ultimate poster child for explaining the  kiss syndrome    keep it simple stupid  it is loaded with so much clutter that you might need a how to operate a tv course  it also comes with a tiny tiny remote that has to interact with a gazillion on  screen  icons to provide service   it s not exactly a turn it on and enjoy set  my          dupont tv provided me more pleasure then this mess   ps   i have   other samsung tv s that are       more enjoyable      
192,1.0 ,                       my husband bought this tv in december       with insurance  as a gift to us  he had to prepare the space for the tv installation and in february we began installing it  we hadn t even removed the protective plastic bars and paper from it yet when it cracked while lifting it to hang on the wall   we called asurion insurance and they did not cover it  neither did samsung  the tv cost us nearly      and the insurance another         why is a tv so fragile that when just lifting it  it cracks in the corner where it is being held  no product like that is worth        we had to purchase a new tv  forget about this one you will be sorry        
193,4.0 ,                       i guess this is common for  k televisions but the initial picture  especially for movies  was nearly unwatchable due to the motion settings  blockbuster movies looked like weird daytime soap operas  so if you get this tv and are dismayed by that  google and youtube are your friend  once you properly tweak the settings the picture is great and film motion looks great  since then the only issue i ve had is that the tv sometimes drops it s wifi connection and it takes some resetting rebooting of the tv to restore connection  but i m not yet sure if that s actually an issue with the tv or our xfinity router      
194,5.0 ,                       after reviewing and deciding the added expense for a oled type screen wasn t worth it i went for this model  its an upgrade from my older    inch tv in the same uhd line  so far it s great  colors are nice  no issues with setup  unboxing  installation  missing pixels etc  my only issue is that is bigger and now catches a little glare  form the window  i doubt any other tv would glare so no knocks about the product  the remove works fine  i do with it had a few more buttons and features  i did like the input button being on the old remotes  this one if found through the menu  i watch a lot of things via usb and the simple remote actually makes that operation take a few more steps   anyway  everything works great  the speaker setup wasn t that hard and i also purchased the surround speakers which work nice as well  happy so far      
195,3.0 ,                       pro took like minutes to unbox tv and have it playing pbs   my kids like curious george tv used our   yr old soundbar automatically the picture quality is ridiculus   i played avatar off plex on max quality   k hevc   mbps  and it rocked price   under      all in awesome tips setup network asap if you plan to do more than watch broadcast tv or dvds consider buying a different remote cons the remote is the size of a large marker and has like    buttons   it is hard to use   it is like dyson made it   form over function my home theatre samsung tv is almost   yrs old  so i had some samsung sneaky smart bar ads and data mining victim experience prior to new tv   let me tell you     samsung has upped their intrusion game   be prepared to accept various huge privacy policies and to create a samsung account if you plan to download even one extra app or even want to use netflix   it is ridiculous i had to block about    keywords in my network router settings to keep all the advertisement to near zero  but still occassionally see a new car ad   my guess is that samsung serves some ads from  rd parties   prob google   get a wireless router of ur own and learn how to filter traffic   you wont be sorry the smart hub is a cluttered flashing mess   dont view if you are prone to siesures   be prepared to live with    apps you will never use   they cant be deleted   be prepared for content overload  it is hard to use   samsung sacrifices customer ease of use to keep their narketing partner apps up front the bottom line is that i only plan to stream netflix and watch my plex server   if you plan to use smart hub a lot  consider other brands      
196,1.0 ,                       we upgraded to a newer samsung for the software   i have impaired hearing and rely on bluetooth headphones to listen while my wife watches with normal audio from the tv speakers   the tv has built in bluetooth but  you have to select one or the other   can t use bluetooth and tv speakers at the same time   in fact you can t use digital audio cable and bluetooth only  one audio output selected in setup   this is worse than the tv we replaced  a samsung that is   years old   sounds like going backwards to me   she likes the newer software so we keep it   guess i will give up watching or maybe install the old tv in the garage      
197,3.0 ,                       i had ordered a    inch samsung smart tv   it was supposed to arrive on monday  august   th   i planned on being home to receive it   i came home yesterday  friday  august   th  after being gone all day   i arrived home at     pm to find my tv in front of my steps  practically laying down flat  in full view of anyone who goes by   i live on a corner   it was obvious what it was by the picture on the box   the bottom of the box was unsealed  so there was no way to pick it up without the tv falling out   i would think that a signature would be required for a      tv   sure glad that it didn t rain i do like the tv   has a beautiful picture      
198,5.0 ,                       i had a    year old samsung     p tv that i d been very happy with and had been perfectly reliable  televisions have gotten so cheap and i simply wanted a more cinematic experience with a larger screen  this tv arrived in perfect condition  on time without delay  perhaps my expectations were a little more modest but i am completely satisfied  i didn t realize the tv would have built in wifi and that i d no longer need my apple tv box  i am does have cable service  just netflix and a home made antenna     and i was extremely impressed at the reception  with the old tv i was constantly moving the antenna to get a channel and some channels i could never get  this thing receives every channel with perfect clarity and that alone was worth the price  i don t expect tv s to have good tuners since everyone streams or has some sort of tv service  except me  i was prepared to be frustrated with setup but it turned out to be very intuitive and actually quite quick  the remote is small with few buttons but is highly ergonomic and also very ergonomic  even my wife  who hates technology  found it straight forward to use and we never resorted to the e manual  lastly  the built in speakers are actually pretty decent for watching normal television  there definitely some surround processing and some delays to add depth and a sound stage  my wife was not happy with me about buying this thing but as soon as she realized how good the reception was  all was instantly forgiven  we ll see if it holds up but right now i am completely satisfied  it was a deal at           
199,1.0 ,                       we had purchased a samsung tv from amazon in      that works beautifully until june        so  when we needed a new tv  we called amazon   it was delivered on june            our grandsons set it up for us and we were thrilled until    weeks later while we were watching it  it went black   we called amazon and followed directions to check it out in a half hour call   they tried  but could not help and sent us to samsung who were supposed to call us back the next day   they did not   so we called them   after another    to    minute call  we were told they would send a serviceman   the estimated that it would be the end of this week or next before someone could come because they were having trouble locating a serviceman  i asked to speak to  manager   that never happened   instead  we received an email with the name of a repair company at least    miles away   we called to try to make an appointment   they could would not give us an appointment  they said they would call us back in a day or two  we are not satisfied      
200,5.0 ,                       amazing value  easy to setup  i use a narrower tv stand so also purchased a center post tv stand that uses the vesa mount on the back of the tv  was it difficult to setup  actually it was super easy  barely an inconvenience  love the fact that the samsung one remote actually synced right up and controls my amazon fire tv just like the native amazon remote  i will say the built in speakers do suck  no bass at all  lol but i expected that so have a soundbar on the way as well      
201,4.0 ,                       picture quality is very good  with some adjustments to be made from factory presets  i can get a very good display quality  good contrast ratios  and nice hdr viewing  sound is decent  while lacking bass  the remote control design and tizen os work as intended  all necessary adjustments just some clicks away  more than three hdmi inputs would have been more sound than incorporating composite inputs in my opinion  overall  a very good smart set  wide viewing angles and not so reflective screen helps too apart from these observations  i was unlucky to get a damaged unit  the lower center of the screen came with a visible spot  apparently from shipping mishandling  but amazon responded quickly  they ordered a pick up of the first set and sent the replacement in a reasonable time i recommend this smart tv      
202,3.0 ,                       it took me forever to choose which tv to purchase   i made the wrong choice wit the tu     and really samsung    k hdr is horrible and dark and the only thing you can do it buy an amazon non  k device   you try to fix the settings and update the firmware and everything is always greyed out and cannot be changed   really disappointed with this tv   i wish i would have looked closer at and lg or even hisense   my friend has a hisense and the picture is perfect and it is must easier to navigate the settings   he paid      less than i did      
203,3.0 ,                       when i purchased this tv i really had no interest in the smart tv features  having my cable box and apple tv connected to my last  dumb  tv had always been sufficient  but i thought i would give the smart feature a try  my internet speed is usually around     mbps  i use ookla regularly to verify  and i don t often have outages  regardless  this tv loses its connection with my wifi almost daily and no amount of troubleshooting via the tv  see photo  will restore it  the only way to get it to reconnect is to physically unplug the tv and plug it back in  i don t know about you  but after i ve settled in to watch a movie or my favorite show  getting back up to unplug and replug the tv is pretty annoying  i ve stopped trying to use the smart features entirely and have gone back to switching between cable box and apple tv bottom line  if you re looking for a tv with a quality  k picture  this one is a good choice for the price point  if you re looking for a smart tv  keep looking      
204,5.0 ,                       purchased a    and    inch for christmas for a family surprise   the set up was very simple and the tv s have been a wonderful improvement compared to our last smart tv   the picture is a vast improvement to our last television and the stock sound was probably the biggest surprise   we haven t had any issues for almost   months after set up  and i waited to write a review   the remote is pretty flimsy  but for   picture quality  i am not going to let that change my rating overall      
205,5.0 ,                       purchased to replace    inch samsung that was a victim of rapid fire power surges during texas ice storm   a little concerned that existing wall mount would not work but there was no problem   have three samsung smart tv s and happy with all of them   this and one other have the smart remotes that i do not like at all   look simple until trying to control other devices or control apps   the multi button samsung remotes or dish remotes work just fine   happy with the samsungs   nice to have all the screens look alike      
206,3.0 ,                       i think the sound quality needs a lot of improvement  i can t understand what the people are saying  to that end i bought a   channel sound bar but it didn t help a great deal   i am exchanging the sound bar for a samsung   channel sound bar   hopefully that will help   but i still think the sound quality of the tv needs improvement so i wouldn t have to go to the expense of a sound bar  the remote control is a challenge to figure out      
207,3.0 ,                              tv and only   hdmi ports    the remote is terrible they took all the buttons off so you have to use the tv s interface or use the voice feature the emanual is worthless    the interface is terrible it take ten more steps to do what you use to do with one button press this thing is like an idiot savant oh i forgot the bloatware on this thing is over the top it also keep forgetting the screen setting every time you change the input am not saying not to buy am saying know what your getting into p s  the legs have two settings so you don t need a table any bigger then     wish i knew that         
208,1.0 ,                       is it possible to give a product less than one star    first off  i will say that i have always been a samsung person   every appliance and electronic device  except my phone  are made by samsung   i have never had a bad experience with any of their products   however  something is horribly wrong with this tv   the one i have is a replacement item    the first one was non functional   this tv was rarely used since its purchase in at the end of june        it was working fine one day  and the next was non functional with lines all over the screen   of course  i was exactly one month outside of amazon s return window  which meant i had to deal with samsung s repair technicians   what a horrible experience that was   basically  a technician shows up  doesn t even look at the tv thoroughly  makes a quick call  and then says  sorry  we cannot help you    don t even get me started about how completely rude and unprofessional the samsung customer service agent was over the phone   i have rarely had a customer service agent try to start arguments with me  and hopefully never will again i am so unhappy with this experience overall  and will likely never purchase a samsung product again   all in all  i suggest staying clear of this tv   there is a reason it s so inexpensive   it s garbage signed a very unhappy samsung customer     
209,2.0 ,                       first off i knew what i was getting hdmi wise when i ordered this tv    hdmi ports is not a lot  i dont see why any tv should come with less than    preferably    but this tv was a good price so i settled for    unforunately my wall mount obstructs hdmi   the port that sits pointing straight out of the back of the tv  so i only have   usable hdmi ports  this tv is replacing a    samsung  d that just burned out after about   years  it had   hdmi ports  so squezing into   hdmi ports is frustrating the remote control is odd  its not a remote control in the traditional sense  its closer to an appletv remote  which i guess is fine  but there is no easy way to switch sources  there is no source button i guess all of my complaints stem from  i just want this tv to be a tv  i need lots of inputs and a way to switch between them  i have no interest in the samsung bloatware that is loaded onto all new tv s these days update  i am downgrading the stars for this  the input select menu is extremely frustrating  it seems to pop up constantly for no reason and is difficult to make go away  i have resorted to using the remote that came with my previous samsung tv  at least that remote has an exit button that will make the pop up menu dissapear  this tv isnt designed to be used with anything other than samsung bloatware it seems      
210,1.0 ,                       it s disgusting to treat your customers like they are cattle to squeeze out every last cent of ad revenue from instead of just making a great product for them protip  add  ads samsung com  and  samsungads com  to your routers block list to get rid of the ads      
211,5.0 ,                       for the price i paid            this is a super awesome tv   very easy to set up  and no faulty pixels  or other typical problems which plague budget large screen tv s   the picture is great and very customizable    except as to brightness   there is no backlight  hence the image is on the darker side and the tv should not be placed in a sunny room   i wish i knew this before getting it because the tv was for a sunny room   after spending a few hours adjusting the settings  the tv looks pretty good      
212,4.0 ,                       overall  i am really happy with this television  simple  elegant  fits the bill and does the job some things that i like   pretty responsive to the remote actions  streaming is seamless  recommended shows against each app is an added advantage  overall  picture  sound  setting etc   are seamlesssome things that i don t like   samsung tv  is pushed too much  for instance that is the first app on the tv along with a shortcut button on remote  however the content on samsung tv  is not that great  so overall i don t like samsung forcing me to watch that  remote could have had couple of other buttons related to input sources  eg  hdmi  hdmi  which would have been really helpful     
213,5.0 ,                       quality looks good to me and set up was easy  for the record  i m a tech savvy enough person who knows the difference between good and garbage  for the price this tv is a champ  reviews that say viewing angle is poor from the sides are crazy  those must be the people who criticize every detail  i could see things fine from every angle  perfect basement tv  or regular tv  for the basement kids room  smart apps work great and they have all the main apps we all subscribe to      
214,4.0 ,                       as many reviewers have pointed out   theres a remote control latency  luckily i primarily won t be using the remote   got my google tv remote to control it   second  yes if you are mounting the      please make sure you got two m    m and two m    mm bolts for the brackets  so if you are using your old one  make sure you for spares lying around   so far no damage  white screen  red dots that some have experienced   i ll give it a week or two and see what happens   the ui is okay i guess  not planning to use any of the assistant features  you pay for what you get and at      it s a great value      
215,1.0 ,                       terrible  roku was much better     
216,5.0 ,                       i saw a lot of negative reviews  most of which complained about the screen going out  mine did this too  i solved this problem by upgrading my hdmi cables  the wrong cables will be overtaxed and your screen will go blank picture quality it fantastic  the features on this t v  are really cool  it s compatible with my samsung phone and samsung sound bar the one draw back is that the screen is pretty shiny   which i m sure contributes to the clarity   it s best to set it up to avoid reflecting lights and or turn them off colors and picture are rich and vivid  the sound from the t v  is okay but don t hold a candle to my sound bar and sub woofer setup great product  no issues      
217,5.0 ,                       this tv was surprisingly easy to set up  i was even able to use the power cord from my older samsung tv  i did however need to go to the store and pick up longer screws for my existing tv wall mount though  the picture quality is great  as is the sound  the remote is simple to use and alexa responds well  although there are some pre loaded apps on the home screen  that i can t figure out yet how to remove  i can add new ones and move them to the front of the list  i would recommend purchasing this tv to my friends      
218,1.0 ,                       after arranging installers  then removing my current flatscreen  then getting this one up on the wall   the screen looked like a spiderweb of cracks  we noticed a small dent at the bottom  but when we turned it on  the entire screen was shattered  such an incredible aggravation and waste of time  apparently this     tv is too fragile to be shipped  i will repurchase it from a big box store locally  we are all so disappointed  it looks like a beautiful flatscreen      
219,1.0 ,                       unfortunately the tv came cracked out of the box  ultimately just a waste of time and now i need to repack it and return it to a ups store    it does appear the screen was cracked exactly where the strap was outside of the box as if someone just tightened it one click too many     
220,5.0 ,                       when i purchased this  i was not sure about the seller  no issues  received in   day s from purchase  no issues using the carrier  tv arrived in good shape  worked as expected  happy thus far with all the experience i needed to replace an ancient tv in the bedroom and this was perfect for that need  happy camper      
221,4.0 ,                       i m not sure the problem could be blamedonth  receiver  but i find the audio of some programs difficult to understand  i don t think it s my problem because most programs  audio is fine but some programs  especially dramatic network programs  have muddy sound that can t be improved with controls on the receiver  i added a sound bar to improve the audio  but that     expense didn t help a bit      
222,5.0 ,                       the new remote and the upgraded features were excellent   using alexa was a disappointment because it does not do much or work well i was not happy with the drab screen display  until i realize you could control much of the output   i raised the color and tint on the setting mode  and changed the pix to dynamic instead of standard   wound up with exactly the picture i wanted      
223,5.0 ,                       pros  price for what you re getting beautiful picture quality great wifi antenna bright picture on dynamic mode  vivid colors hdr is pretty good  the controller is super responsive  it makes typing and browsing super easy cons  game mode makes the screen really dark  i turned game mode off completely    it even made duplicates of moving objects  only an optical audio output  if you want to hook up a stereo system without a controller you re going to have to walk over to turn the volume up and down      
224,5.0 ,                       very happy with this tv  it is my  rd samsung and they keep getting better  smarter  i wanted a second  lower priced tv that would give me a great picture and had bluetooth  there were a couple of others that  suggested  bt in the q a and reviews  but none that actually listed it as a feature  i m sure others had that feature but i wasn t comfortable when it wasn t listed in their product description or manuals we love the tv but the remote can be a challenge for some of us  older  users  since this is my  rd samsung  i can manage it  somewhat  but find it difficult to find common features such as guide or info  not easy to locate without reading the manual  they have packed a ton of features into a minimum number of buttons that are not easy to see in dim light  they redeem themselves by making the integration of our xfinity remote easy      
225,1.0 ,                       so i m sitting here on day    i started the tv  set it up  it worked beautifully  i left for    minutes to grab beer  come back and it s at a blank beige screen  it is literally incapable of resetting itself and i m currently waiting on a technician after using the tv for       minutes  i ve literally never been so disappointed in how badly something performed after i bought it  i never return stuff for the most part  at this point about to just crush the screen and shove it out my window  useless  garbage tv that gets choked up on its own  smart  technology  please don t buy this is you re foolishly expecting to watch play something later that day  or week  apparently       
226,5.0 ,                       i love the depth of field and color on this tv   the sound is very nice but we have attached a bose sound bar and it is really nice   once you figure out how to get to it  not intuitive  the setup and system menu works nicely      
227,5.0 ,                       have had this for   weeks now and i can say it s really nice   to be on the safe side  i also purchased the   year extended warranty   we bought this to replace a hisense h  that was having some issues with starting up   this is quite a bit nicer than the h   in both picture quality and sound  the tv sound is just that   tv sound  not bad  but so much is missing     i added a vizio sound system       on the hdmi arc channel and the sound is outstanding   just wish the remote was a bit smarter since we have a cable box with record capability and have to use the cable remote to access whatever is recorded   that aside  this is quite a nice tv for the price   it arrived well packed  set up quite easily  was ready to go as soon as i plugged it in  and went through the simple setup program   we added the apps that we wanted and that was all it took   we were watching our favorite programs  on britbox  within a half hour      
228,1.0 ,                       this tv arrived aug      no picture by aug      called amazon who referred us to samsung   this tv has inhouse service warranty   samsung said they would be here to fix it aug      on aug    they called to say they would not come   they say tv has to be shipped back to them and received before they would do anything else   bottom line  they say new tv arrival in   weeks   and the new one would not have a new   year warranty but only continue  from date of purchase which was aug      do not buy this tv      
229,3.0 ,                       the tv was defective  i contacted the manufacturer  then contacted amazon   amazon immediately sent a replacement but i am annoyed with its software  the home page is built around bloatware i e   links to paid subscriptions for many online streaming providers the operating system is not exactly intuitive  the quality of the user manuals is uneven   i often have to use third party information  instead samsung customer support   both by phone and by chat   leaves much to be desired  in home repair is non existent  samsung s repair people are indifferentthat being said  the picture is excellent for the price      
230,1.0 ,                       this was a christmas present for my sons  new man cave  unfortunately  i waited until the room was done before unboxing it because the screen was broken and it s too late for me to return it  the box was undamaged and sat untouched until we opened it  when we did there was a tiny pinpoint speck of visible  tactile damage to the screen  when we turned it on the whole display was ruined  there s no way this happened after it was boxed  the damage looks like a single pin prick  no cracks  spider webbing  etc  and it s deep enough to damage the whole image and there s no damage to the box      
231,5.0 ,                       i got this tv to replace a    year old     sharp and i am amazed at the difference  the picture is almost unrealistically detailed in comparison to the older set  some of the reviews that i read about this samsung complained that it wasn t bright enough or that there wasn t enough detail  i m not sure what other tv sets those reviewers were comparing it to  but for me i am very satisfied with the picture quality setting it up was a snap  the on screen menu walked me through it step by step  and i was surfing channels in under    minutes i also love the remote control  there are much fewer buttons on it than what i m used to but it is very intuitive and i also no longer need the extra remote control that came with my cable provider      
232,4.0 ,                       ihe photo was taken minutes after unboxing the product  this television arrived with cracks behind display rendering it unusable  i am unsure if this is due to manufacturing or handling of the tv in the warehouse truck  update  the product works great  the colors really pop  and game mode has a snappy response time for input lag input delay  about    ms   which is important for me as a gamer the thing keeping me from giving this tv   stars is    the incredibly annoying tv show ads that pop up whenever you turn on the tv on the main display  it s      and this is a smart tv  so consumers who are paying for a premium tv should have the option to shut off advertisements  but you aren t given that option with this television  this is really anti consumer and should be a simple fix for such a large company imho      
233,3.0 ,                       this score is based on the overall set up experience and not just the quality of the tv   i ll get straight to it   for a namebrand tv  i was disappointed that it did not come with the screws to use with a mount   really annoying but fine    user manual keeps referencing some quick start up guide for the type of screws i need   i scour the surprisingly few documents included and there was no qsu guide or specific info about type of screws   getting even more annoyed    i scan the q a of the product page and although there were plenty of people that had the same question i did  no one had the mf decency to respond in a helpful way  annoyed turns to pissed off    i call up customer service to ask for the screws specs i need to screw a mount to the back of the un  tu    fxza   the guy tells me m l   screws   i quickly find out that is not true   one look and it is obvious they are way too f ing small   i am really pissed off now   it s bad enough they don t include these screws or specify in the mf manual   now their customer service tells me inaccurate info   really pissed off now    i use the chat feature and message with customer service now   the guy tells me m  x     mm x      mm   finally   that sounds right  right   wrong   they are too short and don t clear the mount   i am raging pissed now by the bs runaround they ve sent me on   i take it upon myself to get several lengths   and finally i found the correct one correct mount screw size  m  x     mm x   mm  also  for some reason  apps won t install if i am connected directly by wire   it has to be connected to the home wifi network in order to install apps   no joke   i only figured this out after reading forums about other people having similar issues the screen quality is good as expected but the hours i wasted trying to set up the tv is unacceptable   thus the low score      
234,1.0 ,                       upper half of picture display had a dark band across it   i spent a good    hours troubleshooting the issue using input from various samsung forums and online tech support   online tech support told me a in home service will be needed   scheduled a home service later in the week   tech told me they would return a week later with part s  needed to make the repair   one week later and techs did not come out   when i called to inquire i was told the tech service had been cancelled as samsung will be issuing me a refund    i called samsung s tech support number where i was the one who had to explain the issue with the tv and the repair  lack thereof  timeline   was placed on hold numerous times and transferred to other another department   whole process took about     hours   followed up with them today on status and they are  still reviewing  the return   i have owned several samsung tvs in my lifetime and all have performed great   this tv was not working correctly right out of the box and samsung support has been stringing me along for nearly two weeks now   i have since purchased a comparable sony that i am very happy with      
235,5.0 ,                       i purchased my first samsung tv on amazon last year        model and loved it s picture quality  ease set up and  its use  ont year later i purchased this one for my bedroom which i use the most  it s a great size for my room size and from time to time i catch myself when watching  admiring its crystal clear picture quality  plus  i like that samsung has a built in tv app to watch programming  i m very pleased with my samsung choice      
236,5.0 ,                       office tv for my mom to have in her living room and it s a beast if you purchased this make sure that the tv stand you use for the tv to be set on to be wide enough make sure it is a least     i believe that it is     in between the legs stand for the tv make sure that you spend the extra    bucks ish to buy a good h dmi     cable so that you get the best out of the display and utilize the  k that this great tv has to offer if you choose to use one of your older h dmi cables laying around the house you are not going to get the picture quality that this tv has to offer     
237,5.0 ,                       this is perfect for my apartment  it s not the most fancy amazing tv from samsung  but it is beautiful and absolutely does the job and i have no complaints especially for the price  the picture is crystal clear  the color is great and the smart capability is spot on  my friend told me it wouldn t work with wifi because it wasn t  g capable  or something   but mines in my living room right above the router and works perfect with no ethernet cord  only issue i had was the cable twisty cable for the tv box has an easy screw handhold on it and since the tv cable port is against the tv you can t screw it in    hopefully there s a cord i can buy for the tv box that doesn t have as big of a screw knob so i can get cable on the tv      
238,5.0 ,                       this is a great  k tv  we upgraded our     samsung tv with this     for christmas  it looks beautiful  is slim  and sets very nicely on a mount above our fireplace  the whole family is now spending more time watching movies and stuff together  maybe this isn t the latest and greatest tv ever made  but for us it looks absolutely incredible  especially with  k content like on amazon prime video  which is free       
239,4.0 ,                       i love this tv picture quality  and it s been a great step up from my old screen  steam link is a great plus too  however  after updating my phone to android     i ve been unable to use most of the highly touted features of this tv  normally  you can install samsung s smartthings app on your phone and use it to control your tv  but it is completely incompatible with the latest official android version  i contacted samsung and a fix won t be out until november  even though they ve had access to the new android os for at least   months now  really disappointed in their software support  and it worries me  its unclear how long i ll actually be able to use this tv  given that maintenance seems to be low priority update  the wifi issue is beyond frustrating and needs to be addressed  anyone who needs wifi for their tv should be cautious purchasing from samsung  it seems like this is a long standing issue that they will refuse to address  i saw comments on samsung s forums dating back to a year ago  so it doesn t seem to be a priority      
240,5.0 ,                       i love this smart tv  it came with netflix and prime buttons on the remote and other apps you can access on the screen   beautiful picture and easy to set up  this weighs    lbs and i couldn t do this alone so a friend unboxed and set it up on a tv stand now for the buts we don t have cable and instead chose to install an antenna pad in the window  the instructions stated to scan channels on the tv and add them to the channel list the samsung e manual had this to say under  antenna   if you have cable  you don t need an antenna  there was no reference that would help us so we then looked under scanning and adding channels which directed us to go to the live tv app but it was nowhere to be found we then did a chat session with samsung help and he simply reiterated the steps in the manual  we replied back  we can t find the live tv app    he then wrote  go to the e manual and ended the session  no  can i help you with anything else   nothing  what a waste of time after almost   hours of frustration and pressing any and all buttons  the live tv app magically appeared and we finally were able to add the channels we needed so the tv by itself is great but don t expect any real help from samsung  they assume their customer is    years old and has more tech experience than they do      
241,5.0 ,                       i got this     tv to replace a five year old     samsung as i wanted a larger picture and noticed the older tv had an issue that one would think was related to slow internet even though i have a high speed plan  i mounted this on a wall  fortunately i had a wall mount already for tvs up to      with the help of one other person i do not have cable tv but have a digital antenna purchased from amazon for      that antenna is pulling in about    channels of free content and samsung actually provides another    or so free english language channels  samsung tv plus  avaialble through an internet connection  so i now have about     channels and via thh digital antenna have the major stations  cbs  nbc and abc  and i have a monthly cable bill of    picture quality is great and you can contol with alexa as well as via a voice button on the remote  tv sound is good but for movies and sports i do use a soundbar for a more intense effect very happy one month in and enjoying the nfl playoffs in a theater like atmosphere      
242,2.0 ,                       i received this tv about   months ago  picture quality is awesome and i m very satisfied with the tv overall  the downside  one day my tv just wouldn t turn on  it was connected to a good power source but still nothing  i called amazon and then they put me through to samsung support  i had to make an appointment to have a tv repairman come out  the soonest appointment was about    days out   not ideal but okay  tv repairman came yesterday    he tried a few things and nada  then said he has to check his truck for a motherboard     minutes later he appeared again and he was fresh out of motherboards  he said someone would call me to reschedule  i asked him  why he thought the motherboard would go so soon after purchasing and he said   who knows how long these tvs have been sitting around in the amazong warehouse  so  yes my tv is new as in it s never been used but how old is the giant fella really  anyway i waited a day and no call  i just called the service center and it s going to be another full   weeks before someone comes back out  no tv during covid is pretty painful    i sure hope the next repair person remembers to bring the motherboard      
243,4.0 ,                       to begin  i love electronics and sit behind an overly expensive computer set up most days as pc gaming is my hobby this tv surpassed all expectations for the price  the colors and the depth on everything was amazing and the movement in movies was butter smooth  i have a nice home theater so i didnt use the tv speakers but for the first day when i got lazy in hooking stuff up  the tv speakers are surprisingly nice and absolutely do able for your standard tv watching  the slimline bezel is nice and overall the ui is easy to navigate and the app store options are superb but   i did have a light bleed issue after the first day  and it seemed to progressively get worse  i am about a month into owning it and it drives me nuts  i finally turned in a ticket to support  who btw have been amazing through this experience and is part of why im going samsung again  they cant fix it blah blh blah so im being offered a full refund for the price i paid via amazon  and i am upgrading to a   inch q   this tv is worth the gamble in hoping you dont get a light bleed or just dealing with it  i cannot deal with it clearly      
244,1.0 ,                       buy the samsung    inch crystal uhd tv at your own risk  mine worked fine for   weeks although the picture wasn t razor sharp  and the dark areas of the image hada tendency to go flat black with no detail  after working for   weeks  however i turned it on  and the screen was blank  an ugly yellowish gray  i calledsamsung customer service  they were very cordial  but after trying all theobvious thing they suggested  like checking the cords and plugs and thebatteries in the remote  they decided i needed a repair technician  theyreferred me to the company that handles their repairs  not samsung  but ussiglobal  i contacted them  and they said the needed parts would be in within    business days  and the technician would call me to set up anappointment  a week went by  and nothing  i called ussi again  and they toldme that   parts were in  but   hadn t shipped yet  and it would be      moredays  that did it  i packed up my brand new worthless tv and shipped it backto amazon and got a complete refund  will not be getting a samsung tvnext time  beware      
245,4.0 ,                       i really wish this television had better software  this television has a great picture and the apps are okay  but the smart hub is terrible  you can connect the television to alexa  through smartthings  but the ability is limited to basically power on off  some inputs  play  and pause  i really wish that you could launch apps and navigate  i also have a tivo connected to this television  the remote and smart hub used to control the tivo but about a month ago that stopped working  even a factory reset did not get the smart hub to even control the tivo again  maybe the most annoying thing is that you actually have to enter the developer mode of the television to set the backlight levels to reasonable maximums and minimums  otherwise  the screen is overall too dark but also causes the backlight to flicker when there is uneven brightness in the image      
246,1.0 ,                       i have owned several samsung tv s over the years and have always been very happy with them  however this one may be the exception  after less than a month of use  the display is now black and unresponsive  that is to say that the status light turns on and off with the remote  and the sound works  however there is no picture including the menus not displaying  while amazon is kind enough to promptly replace the tv  it seems to me that this is a quality control issue on the part of samsung      
247,1.0 ,                       was super excited to start assembling the tv but was soon left annoyed with how the left leg stand won t go in  on inspection  we found a screw inside defective and bent  not allowing the leg to fit in  looks like just a bent screw but unless the leg goes in  how do i set up the tv  went through the cumbersome unpackaging and re packaging process  would have opted for white glove delivery if there was an option but there clearly isn t  paid so much for a horrible exp  terrible quality  started a return   do not recommend      
248,1.0 ,                       i thought this woyld be a good investment but in all honesty  not a good product   its so confusing to configure the tv settings half the time it says that  k isnt compatible with certain devices that run  k  the picture is pretty messed up  showing way to dark even at full brightness and you have to pick between brightness with horrid color saturation or good color saturation with no brightness   not gonna lie  they dropped the ball on this model     
249,1.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          i do not ever take time to write out a review unless something has totally gone wrong  this is one of those cases i am now returning what is the  nd tv   the first one arrived totally damaged  cracks all up and down it  upon taking it out of the box it was quite a surprise to find it in that condition  i returned it via amazon s  nd party service pilot with no problem and they sent a replacement  the replacement arrives and the tv gets mounted and everything is working smoothly for a couple of hours and then the tv shuts totally off on its own  i ran all of the troubleshooting and nothing worked  a technician confirmed that there was internal damage  so now i am waiting to return the  nd one if you can i would highly recommend avoiding using amazon to purchase a tv of this size  it is clear that the proper care in handling them is not observed when in shipping transit seeing that not one  but two tvs had extreme problems of some sort i am less than thrilled with the outcome here      
250,5.0 ,                       delivery came as anticipated   picture quality and functions provide a great tv watching experience on my     tv   i do have a q led     tv  the picture is a little crisper and better  but if i did not have to two i would not be a thought   i enjoy watching tv from both   system functions and options are the same between the two tv s for about     the price   i would buy this tv again  i have yet to be disappointed with my samsung tv s  this is my third led tv from smsung      
251,3.0 ,                       as tv s get cheaper    the components inside do as well  compare any roku tv to using a roku unit and you ll quickly find that your tv has a processor that is horribly slow and glitchy my new samsung is no exception  the smart features are slower than      internet service  simple menu changes take awhile to switch which means jumping from one feature or app to another can be frustrating i d rather have tv s labeled with that information   this tv has very cheap components but is only  xxxx or you can get this tv that operates as it should for  xxx more   i d happily pay more for the quality and frustration free navigation      
252,5.0 ,                       used outdoors  the automatic contrast provides a great picture under all weather conditions  picture is very crisp  colors are great  screen does reflect sunlit shiny surfaces  best picture in evening  used with sound bar  but built in speaker was quite adequate  automatic installation connected to our wifi network  we connected to our indoor dish receiver with a hdmi splitter so living room and deck share same show with great quality  mounted under awning in weather protective shell  will take in during winter      
253,5.0 ,                       that s what just about every program we watch on dish looks like  a live video feed and not a recording  it s hard to describe  but i can tell you once you get the color and brightness the way you prefer it  that s it  right now we just have     p hd  but a few of the shows we watched were in hdr   at  k  and it s just beautiful not much time spent setting it up  we don t have local channels so no time waiting for a channel scan  just select the input and audio source and you are good to go  can t say too much about this because as far as i am concerned there isn t a better flat panel screen made than samsung  just look at a galaxy s series phone sometime and you ll see the same quality there as on this tv  great choice  great picture      
254,1.0 ,                       although the delivery was fast   setting up the tv was easy   however after turning it on  it was disappointing   brand new tv had a vertical blue line from the bottom to the top on the right hand side   i did google searches on the issue and ultimately many people reported this problem to occur at some point after several years   however  this is a brand new tv out of the box   i tried exchanging cable  nothing helps   it is certainly a defective piece second  and strange thing   i register the serial number and the model number at the samsung   it reported my warranty was valid till october            that is   months of warranty instead of   year   it seems to me either product was used or returned and repackaged therefore i am getting a remainder of the unused warranty let s hope these issues are resolved   if  not i will return the tv to the seller   amazon customer service told me to give     days to the seller to resolve the issue after that they will gladly take it over to find resolution edit   seller told me to carry big box to the fedex dropbox location  even i informed them of my old age and requested they inform fedex to pickup   they refused   following was my response   ok  i will try to find someone to help   but i will make sure in future i never ever purchase anything from you first  you shipped the defective product  second  it was clear from the samsung warranty site that samsung can honor only   months of warranty instead of   year  because either it was a used or refurbished product      
255,2.0 ,                       poor picture quality   lacks sharpness        samsung      is far superior      
256,4.0 ,                       i bought this tv one week ago and everything worked well   today it would not let me into my prime app   i did everything that was suggested and still it would not work  i rest my smart hub which did nothing but cause me a headache and then i reset my tv back to the factory settings which also did nothing   i was about to send the tv back to amazon but i figured one more try and it worked   i am still not sure why it wasn t working  i am pretty smart when it comes to tech  so it wasn t something dumb like no internet   i hope it doesn t happen again   other then that the tv is great so far   i am a little worried because of all the bad reviews   i hope they do not come true   overall i would tell others to get it   i think very few things in life today should get five out of five stars because in my opinion that would be perfection and very little is perfect   so far i am happy i bought this tv   will update if i change my mind      
257,3.0 ,                       there are a lot of features that i can t use   i have not been able to figure out any way to get my personal photos as a back ground or use the gallery   it s not that i don t know how it should be done   it s because i have an iphone which currently does not have the needed apps available   the picture quality is pretty good  it did not do so well with my wifi and i have great wifi iit s only   feet from the wifi but still i had to use a port on my router to get it to work well      
258,5.0 ,                       we love this tv  yes it is entry level  the only thing i have found so far is that it is not great in direct sunlight  big deal  dont take it out side    seriously though  it has lots of bells and stuff  nice picture  good sound  lots of input options  for a entry level    inch tv i would say thid will hold its own against all comers      
259,3.0 ,                       i ve had this tv for   months and find it doesn t compare in any features with my previous non smart samsung   several issues  poor sound  picture quality not great  streaming interupts and the worst issue is the voice control whcih doesn t know how to find anything    it s rather worthless  it also won t connect with my echo dots for sound  i m going to hook up my fire tv stick to it  that worked great on my previous samsung   samsung quality has gone down considerably in my opinion   won t be getting another samsung      
260,5.0 ,                       i got more than i needed with this tv  since i don t have an internet connection i don t use the smart features  the picture quality is good  the only cons are the remote  it s very sensitive  the instructions aren t that great  hit the wrong button and it ends up trying to set up the smart features  i m using the av function to attach to my dish network box  then it takes at least     tries to return to the av function  the other con is the stand  very flimsy and light weight  i got another stand  my cat likes to use the top of the tv as a jumping platform to get to higher furniture  after i found the tv leaning forward i got another stand      
261,1.0 ,                       do not buy this tv  the color is very dull and after only having it about   weeks i started noticing a weird green shadow around many of the images on screen  also  the optical cord out option would not recognize my stereo receiver  i ve always trusted samsung products but after this i will look at their competitors for a new tv  very disappointing especially for the money spent on it      
262,3.0 ,                       the picture is actually really good when it s hooked up where there is a satellite box   otherwise  the picture is amazing subpar for sure   however  that probably has little to do with the tv itself   in addition  the sound level leaves a lot to be desired  i have to crank it up almost to the full level  and it s still lacking  imo   but for the price it s a great tv   in addition  it s my first smart tv  and i am not impressed with smart tvs at this point      
263,3.0 ,                       tv works fine   the remote is another matter   first it s too small   how a normal person s fingers are supposed to move around the unmarked buttons  only symbols you have to memorize  i do  not understand   i just couldn t get over it   why is it so small   why aren t things marked   it looks very space age but operationally  it s like a spaceship with no doors or a beer mug without a handle   hate it     
264,3.0 ,                       the tv itself isnt heavy and was easy to set up  the functuality however is frustrating  most of the apps you use  you have to sign up for a samsung account and log in with your samsung account  also  every time it powers back on  you have to reconnect to the wifi manually as appose to it reconnecting on its own  its limited as to what apps you can put on there with minimal hassel  i will not be buying a nother one thats for sure      
265,4.0 ,                       the user manual is huge  and not very easy to follow   the menu could be several pages in bigger type  and it reads like a mini bible the type is so small  also  trying to tie in the optical cable into the tv settings was a little difficult  as the tv would default back to tv speaker  even though i have an hw r    soundbar and subwoofer the very best way to connect a soundbar through this tv is via the bluetooth connection option   after struggling for days trying to control my new samsung soundbar with the new tv remote  i can now adjust the volume of the tv and soundbar simultaneously using the bluetooth option it would be nice to have a cable menu option on the remote for your cable box  as you will still have to use your original cable remote to check the cable program menu      
266,4.0 ,                       first off i did not purchase this tv here  got a better deal through some credit card  amex  offers   now  i have more than a few amazon reviews that you can peruse in case you think this review is in anyway tainted  that said i was very disappointing when i got this set  the tizen os is just a nightmare  difficult to use  non intuitive and so intrusive  the remote is so sensitive that merely brushing it with your hands will make the smart hub kick in and that is a huge issue for me  ymmv   the apps were slow and try as i might i was simply not getting the color i expected  heck my    inch tcl had a better pic and it was a      model i was googling ways to get the most out of this tv and came across a forum post about pairing it to a roku ultra  well all the other tv s i have        and    are all roku so i knew i would love the interface  what i was not expecting was just how better the color processing is on the roku vs the tv   the apps are faster  the color is more vibrant and over all i simply enjoy it much better than the out of the box experience i now feel that this tv suits my needs  the screen size is impressive and now the screen image matches my expectations  funny what a software and hardware change can do  now before you go complaining about having to sp end another hundo on the roku  i already spent       just to get the tv what is another     to get    inches of real estate pumping out an amazing picture for that price  seriously  in my experience everything looks better through the roku ultra vs the tizen interface now let s talk about connecting a pc to it  i have a nuc i hvk and that little powerhouse with it amd vega m chip makes this tv scream  even the less than impressive hdr shines  so in my opinion the limitation of this tv is not the panel itself as i have seen the difference a quality input provides  all in all now that i found the solution i can rate this pc a   stars  if i wasn t petty i would rate it   because with a few minor and non costly adjustments this tv stands out  but i am so it gets   from me     
267,5.0 ,                       i purchased the     version of the samsung crystal uhd tu      pros and cons     mounting was relatively straightforward  like other reviews  i did have to purchase specialized bolts to secure the tv to my existing flat screen mount  fortunately i have a hardware store nearby  and it was easy to find what i needed  i agree with other reviews that the screws need to be a tad longer than what is specified in the owner s manual  i used four m       pitch screws at    mm length  depending on your mount  this may or may not be the proper length for you     once powered up  i found the remote control to be very simple  and surprisingly intuitive  i give the remote   stars for two reasons  the buttons are not back lit or visible at all in the dark  and the remote is small and black which means i lost it three times in one night of viewing     the quality of the graphics are very good  as noted in other reviews  the screen is very reflective which can be bothersome for daytime viewing  i would have included a picture  but the tv behaved like a mirror and i didn t want to post a selfie        the smart features were very intuitive  and highly functional  within minutes i had set up access for youtube  netflix  amazon prime  disney  and hbo max  this was the main reason for me to upgrade from my     samsung screen  which was nearly    yrs old     i plugged in my chromecast  and the tv recognized it and began offering google assistant as a voice command option  in addition to the native alexa and bixby options      i still haven t figured out how to get ambient mode working  it isn t important for me anyway  so i gave up  i may try again in the future out of morbid curiosity     i have a separate sony stereo receiver with bookshelf speakers  i plugged in the optical cable and hdmi  and it worked immediately  the two devices  talk  to each other  so i only need to use the remote that came with the tv overall  i am very happy with this purchase  the interface is now much simpler than what i had before  i m a tech person by trade  so the added complexity i used to deal with didn t bother me  but my wife was not able to operate the tv without my help  with this new setup  she feels much more comfortable operating it on her own      
268,4.0 ,                       we went from a    year old tv to this model  quite a bit has changed      the tv is decent  i hear a lot of reviews about ads popping up  i dont have that  so  perhaps they are complaining about free tv like pluto or amazon prime pros  i like how easy it is to set things up  it auto detects a lot of things  its well packaged and came undamaged  there are a lot of built in options for other services and the menus are easy to navigate  i really do not have any major issues with the tv  it turns on fast too cons  well  the remote is a bit small  thats not really any type of deal breaker though one comment from people is that the screen is not bright  well  our house is not real bright so i do not notice the issue at all  one thing that did trip me up was hooking up to our comcast box  i had a blurry picture when attached by antenna cable from the box to the tv  the answer is to use an hdmi cable from the cable box to the tv  solved that problem right away because the tv is     you will need a decent stand  its not heavy its just the legs are about     apart  so  we were off to walmart at night to pick up a new tv stand  the tv weighs in at about    lbs  not bad  i can pick it up easily to move it around  thats pretty nice since our older one is about     lbs and takes two to move it the screen is not a mat finish so there is some reflection probably in a well lit room  however  as i stated ours is not all that well lit  so not an issue if your looking for a decent tv then you might like this one  once again  i have not had any issues with the tv crashing or having to restart or ads  it runs perfectly fine      
269,5.0 ,                       extremely pleased with this purchase  the clarity is crisp and the display options are many and equally clean looking  it s very bright and came in tip top shape  samsung is the way to go in my opinion  the physical footprint with the legs given is wide but stable      
270,1.0 ,                       i ve purchased many samsung tvs over the past several years with no complaints  recently bought the    inch version of this tv and returned it twice  i thought the first one was just a random defective unit only to discover when i received a replacement  the next one was just as bad with the same issues  are they sending the rejects out because of the rush on electronic devices due to the pandemic or is this particular samsung uhd tu      series model really that bad  first of all the picture is way too dark with no way to make it lighter no matter how many adjustments i tried in the settings  forget watching even with a light on in the room  it never gets brighter secondly  the     samsung tv plus application never stops  downloading content   and when i try to access it to view the channels it crashes and i get an error that says  there was a problem while trying to play the samsung tv plus channel  check your network settings or try again later    see photo  well there is nothing wrong with my network settings and after repeated later attempts it still does not connect i will say that i like the way the feet attach providing a sturdy support vs other brands and the remote is fine  as opposed to the lg magic remote which is ridiculous in my opinion   i really tried to give this samsung tv a chance but unfortunately there are way too many problems  excellent amazon customer service for returns is the only positive thing i can say about this experience      
271,3.0 ,                       i just bought a new house and was looking at efficient ways to furnish it  including several new big screen tvs  so looking at amazon i saw several awesome deals on samsung tvs  they were delivered very quickly and pretty easy to unbox and set up  the instructions were clear  and initially i was pretty jazzed to have gotten a great deal on a solid tv  unfortunately it didn t stay great  i have had to call technical support several times  the smart functionality on this really isn t    smart that is  i have to reset my network every day so it will pick up my internet  which as a strong router signal about ten feet away from the tv  my other tvs pick up the signal fine  but this one is a pain  every time i talk to samsung technical support they tell me to reset the network and insist i shouldn t have to do it again  but every time i turn it off it loses connection  sadly unimpressed  as much with tech support as i am with the tv itself  it seems like that would be a pretty easy thing to make happen  but it seems like this has been a problem consistently for years with samsung  i d love to love the tv  but i d love it a lot better if i could just watch it without jumping through hoops    every day        
272,4.0 ,                       tv is good for the price    i dont like that you can t tune the flesh colors  no option  and that you can only tune the brightness one way    other tvs i ve had gives you the brightness option and the back light option to tune natural light vs picture brightness   but the  k looks great  i d buy again in a pinch      
273,2.0 ,                       this tv has an extremely annoying buzzing issue  anytime the screen is dark for a moment between scenes or a darker scene in the movie  the tv makes a very loud buzzing the buzz can be heard in the next room the issue is not the audio setup  as the tv does this on mute  very poor design  would not recommend buying this television to anyone cannot get in touch with anyone to resolve the issue  save yourself time and a headache  buy something that works      
274,4.0 ,                       ok   so my last tv was a     sony bravia  size might really be different but it s smaller than this one  so now you know how long i ll keep stuff last tv was bought mid to      s as i recollect so the picture is great   the sound is great   the weight of the tv is awesome   setting up the tv was meh   i hate fighting the crap ton of cables and hiding them etc etc etc  but that is endemic to our electronic age ok     my previous rant about the software      well it still stands i hate the software   but after searching online for the users manual i was able to search for what i needed     and well actually  i found that you could attach a keyboard and during that process seen something about holding down the center of the button longer   then i was able to remove stuff       star to   star   still think that the software is horrible      
275,5.0 ,                       we re happy with this tv so far  the remote is a little strange but it s the same remote as the samsung blu ray player we ve had for a while  so we re used to the interface   we had a great delivery experience too      
276,1.0 ,                       i thought a samsung tv produced in      with all the buzzwords  uhd  crystal  etc  would undoubtedly be better than a      off the shelf  big box  store tv which was the same price  imagine my disappointment right out of the box you can tell this was cheaply made  the housing casing frame for the tv is really poorly made  the worst i ve ever seen actually  when plugging a cable in  whether it s an hdmi cable or the optical cable  it becomes apparent  the best way to describe it is like a phone case that s slightly too big for your phone the picture quality is my biggest gripe  i really can t get over how the picture is unquestionably worse than my   year old lg  i d honestly send this back but obviously that s a nightmare i don t want to deal with the remote is garbage  in their quest to make it ergonomic they forgot to make it functional you will be disappointed  there are a million other tvs out there  try to check them out in a store before buying if you can    update   after two months i lowered my rating from   stars to     apps  hulu  netflix  youtube  constantly crash causing the tv to restart itself   the layout format design of scrolling through the functions on the tv has become increasingly irritating  i thought i would get use to it  but instead i m just over it   this tv is absolute garbage   hands down the worst tv i ve ever bought  i will never buy another samsung tv because of it             
277,1.0 ,                       i ve had this tv for a few weeks now  and can say that while i like the physical aspects of the tv and sound bar  picture  audio  form factor   the user experience is flat awful   there is a  sponsored content  section on the main menu that you can t remove   the tv setup includes several non skippable sections that try and consistently fail to recognize attached devices  force you to establish a samsung account  and pre configure your home screen with apps you don t want   the  built in  apps take up about half the available space  and can t be removed  whether or not you actually want any of them   if an hdmi device can t be recognized  the home screen puts up a large banner inviting you to rerun the initial setup again  this banner can t be removed   the remote and app interface is very sluggish at the best of times  and will occasionally bog down to being nearly unresponsive my attempts to rectify some of this with samsung support have been fruitless  using the tv s support menu  i requested a callback  they did call  but only to immediately place me on hold for    minutes before hanging up  samsung com support chat is a series of unhelpful canned responses and not actual support  next step will be to try and schedule an in home appointment  but i hate for that to be necessary      
278,4.0 ,                       i love this tv  the picture is beautiful  i do have two issues i have with this tv though  first is it s a little glitchy  it has trouble staying connected to my wifi occasionally and it will also randomly change to the samsung tv app in the middle of the night and it ends up blaring crappy music that wakes me up  the other issue is i hate the remote  the buttons are so sensitive so with the slightest accidental touch it will leave the app i am using to go to another  not a big deal if it happens occasionally  but this happens to me every day  and it has become pretty annoying      
279,3.0 ,                       ok  the picture quality is good  but navigating the settings is a nightmare  and it comes with only a quick setup instructions  but you really need the whole book which is a whopping     pages to print   believe me you ll need the book to figure out how to get your settings exactly how you want them  i ve never anything more frustrating when it comes to setting up a tv  it s never been this difficult has it good qualities like having samsung tv  most apps you use are on here  the internet is good to use  i ve only clicked through a few websites though   amazon on here  but guess what   try using alexa voice navigation on this and you ll want to throw the remote  i ve opted to just plug in my fire stick  its easier i ve yet to even figure out how to setup regular channels  use to simply be scan for channels  i know its on here somewhere its gonna take a weekend to figure it out   i ll update my review as i figure this thing out  no sense in returning it   just something to keep you busy for the remainder of the year  update soon today is               
280,5.0 ,                       i am so in love with this television and impressed with how far technology has grown  and been incorporated in a way that makes this so convenient  user friendly  and efficient  set up was a breeze via the smartthings app  unlike others  i have no qualms with the remote control battery installation  the picture is beautiful  i think it is super cool that you can set up a photo collage  as it really personalizes this product  along with alexa there to greet you by name  also  every time you tell  her    thank you   she respond and then displays a cute seal one the screen that also says  thank you    i couldn t be more ecstatic  it s also super fast  so if you re also a gamer  this is an ideal purchase to reiterate pros  display  color  ease of use  samsung phone app integration  easy setup  beautiful features  alexa  photo collage  zero lag  sleek design  every app you could desire    i didn t realize how ancient my former smart tv actually is  this one is brilliant  i haven t any issues as of yet  hard to believe so many others did but i hope once they are rectified that they are just as happy as i      
281,1.0 ,                       the screen and picture are top level design  but the frustrating interface is unforgivable  the jumping jolting cursor response and the up to    second lag time when turning the tv or or changing applications is abominable i can t wait to replace this  regrettably  brand new  tv with something that works  it will be a very long time before i  even consider making another samsung purchase      
282,3.0 ,                       after several days with this set  i find that while the set itself is adequate  i cannot say the same for the remote   sure  it is smart enough to assist in the setup of other devices and control them with only one remote   but first you have figure out how it operates   i want to add my experience thus far with alexa inside   she may be inside  but despite over two hours talking to samsung who finally referred me to amazon  she is still  inside    the only voice command i was able to use is  alexa  turn off the tv    that s it  no pause  no lower volume  change channel  etc   ridiculous   my trouble began before i even got the set out of the box   the remote and the  user manual  were right up top  the first things you could remove from the box   so i sat down with the manual and remote  and took the two batteries that were included and attempted to open the back of the remote   fifteen minutes later  with no success on what should have been a very simple task  i resorted to using a thin bladed instrument to part the top from the bottom  and then inserted the batteries   once the set was up and operational  i picked up the remote and attempted to determine what the buttons controlled   in some instances  i felt like you needed the hands of a safecracker to navigate the various menus  esp  when a seemingly logical act brought up a very different result on the screen   i even phoned samsung support  twice  and wasted well over an hour total  dealing with a virtual chat  because you can t speak to a human    the manual itself is almost totally useless  and as a result there are several websites devoted to the samsung remote  not created by samsung  of course   so bottom line  tv set     remote      support         
283,4.0 ,                               update still working  raising rating to     picture quality is outstanding  colors and depth are awesome  draw back is slight blur when things are moving fast  for the price  i ll live with the slight blur  samsung has always been my  go to  and has not changed  cheap tv but high quality          update i received the replacement last week on monday      and have had it in use for almost a week now with no issues  great picture and decent sound  some of the blacks look a little distorted but i would expect that with a model this cheap  cant get much better for the price i have always bought samsung  and will continue to do so  but this tv must have been a dud  i received it monday april  th and today april  th the tv is defective  it worked great with some blurring for the first few hours of being active  in the middle of playing a game the screen went white with pixilated colors  it would not turn off and now after unplugging it it will not turn back on  i reordered a replacement and amazon being the amazing company it is  is sending me a replacement free of charge  i ll leave an update a few days after using the replacement      
284,5.0 ,                       you get what you pay for    i know a few people have complained about this tv   but i love it   of course  i never pay top dollar and buy the latest and greatest because i feel i can do without some of the latest options   i mean  when would i have a need for  k   i use it in my bedroom to watch a few evening shows if my husband has the other television tied up with something i don t care to watch   but overall  it is a great tv   color is great   it bluetoothed to a better speaker setup   it works with alexa   maybe i d have liked a few more options for apps   but overall  it works great with my dish satellite and a bluetooth speaker      
285,5.0 ,                       very nicely designed tv for price  if you setup on included feet like i did  from box took   mins till power on  tv auto setup was just as quick but best to create a samsung web site login  built in samsung smart tv apps  netfilx  etc work fine  remote takes a little adjustment to get used to  i have both a roku and firestick plugged in and the remote controls both via new hdmi standard  this is the third samsung tv in my household and they keep getting better      
286,5.0 ,                       exceptional picture quality  through my years i havelearned the difference between plasma  lcd  and led this is my first lcd and the colors  crispness  and graphics are awesome   the sound is adequate for my living room of    x      larger may want the sound bar      
287,1.0 ,                       the manual offers no help in finding the size bolts that fit the vesa mounting holes in the back of the tv   went to samsung s site and they said that m    mm to   mm were recommended   well   mm m  bolts were not stocked     mm is an unusual length   i bought   m    mm   they do not fit   the tv requires   mm size  any larger will require washers to offset the extra length   i will return to the store and purchase   m    mm bolts with    washers   that should do it   to say i am pi  ed is an understatement   now i have to return to a store where nobody wears a mask and they will not adhere to social distancing   thank you covid    i will update this review after i get the tv installed  but they will not get a   star review   this is intolerable   it has taken me   hours of screwing around that were unnecessary   put the bolt size in the manual and make sure the size is one normally stocked at hardware stores in the us of a   come on samsung you are better than this   although it must happen a lot so my recommendation is m    mm or   mm with washers to offset the depth to prevent over tightening them and breaking something inside that will defeat the warranty   good luck      
288,3.0 ,                       tv worked great for one day  picture was great  lots of ways to adjust the quality that only took a few minutes to figure out  sound was much better than my way older tvs   looked forward to using bluetooth to export sound but it didn t work long enough to get there  remote and software were a definite step down from roku  on my other tvs   on second day i had to log in again    like   times over the course of   hours  unplugged it numerous times  lasted till halftime  had to read the score in the paper  returned it via amazon  very quick  no problem  probably should have taken the replacement option   what s the chance of two lemons  but i was gun shy of samsung at that point  amazon   stars  samsung         
289,5.0 ,                       this was a huge upgrade for me  i ve had a    in vizio for the past   years and pulled the trigger on this    in  k smart tv and wow  what an upgrade  easy to use and set up  syncs with my galaxy seamlessly  very good contrast ratios  bright whites  dark blacks  and good colors  it s not the brightest tv  so if it will get used in a sunny room this may not be the tv for you  it also has a  feature  called global dimming  if there s a bright object on a dark screen then it darkens the rest of the screen for contrast and can make some scenes very dark  not a deal breaker but something to keep in mind      
290,1.0 ,                       do not buy this     it has a horrible remote control  and   it has only an optical audio output jack  no     mm plug audio output for my existing excellent speakers   if you purchase a digital optical converter  the remotes  samsung and fios  no longer control the optical output volume   you have to do that at your speakers   i personally consider it very poor that when you use external speakers  the tv remotes no longer allow any volume control   yet another reason not to buy this samsung i have already invested in a excellent set of powered external speakers  r l  plus woofer  and all i need is a     mm jack  but the samsung tu     unbelievably does not provide this   they have a nice modern optical output  but not any simple     mm jack   so i need a     converter  or new set of optically connected speakers  which are overkill for my office computer room additionally  the samsung tu     remote control is  minimalist  taken to the extreme   even if you use your phone for the tv and samsung  smart things  app   i do not think my phone is acceptable to use as a tv remote for common frequent changes   even if you stream with youtube  as you know  most streaming apps are clumsy on navigation   i expect even a minimalist tv remote to be capable and clear about basic functions  and this samsung tv remote for the crystal uhd tu      series    k uhd hdr smart tv is way  way over the top at being far too minimalist   super tiny   only about    keys total   i will never buy another samsung unless the ad shows a picture of the tv remote and it is  fully functional    unbelievably horrible inadequate remote control design      
291,1.0 ,                       this tv is terrible  it stopped working within three weeks and samsung s customer service department is as helpful as the dmv      
292,4.0 ,                       we have always bought samsung tv s and never had any problems with them   three days in to buying new tv   it was working well   color   picture was very good  sound great etc   i m a little on the fence about the high def picture though   i m not sure if that s the tv or comcast   another family member has a samsung tv   they have direct tv   their high def is super  turned on tv this morning and had some inverted colors on tv   checked settings and nothing had changed   googled to see what this was   contacted samsung tech support   the issue was fixed quickly with a  soft  reset   tech support had me do the following for the inverted color problem  hold power button until tv goes off and comes back on  release power button    problem fixed concern   is a  soft reset  normal for a   day old tv   i don t think so   i ve had to do a soft reset on a samsung cellphone several years back   i had continuous issues after the soft reset   i hope review helps others   hopefully it s an isolated problem      
293,2.0 ,                       picture quality is good after some adjustments  mainly turning off motion smoothing and agressive contrast reduction  this needs to be done independently for every streaming service app most unfortunately  there are unremovable ads on the menu you have to use to navigate the system  the menu is sluggish as a whole  some partner apps are also unremoveable  apple tv  etc   but can at least be removed from the home screen they tried to get too cute with the remote and it is all form and no function  there is a button that pulls up a menu of what should be physical buttons  you have to press it twice to get to the menu of  color buttons  that most apps seem to expect a samsung smart tv to have   i e  green to add amazon prime video movie to watchlist i m tempted to hook a roku stick up to this to bypass all of samsung s aggravating design choices and anti consumer practices  i have a sharp smart tv with built in roku and it is infinitely easier and more enjoyable to use      
294,1.0 ,                       this is supposed to be an awesome  k tv  it s not  it only shows what it wants  it will only let you into netflix or amazon prime if you buy a new subscription  i have a fire stick  but there is no way to tell it to switch input  the manuals are useless  it says hit the home button on the remote  then hit the settings button  but there is no settings button  thinking of donating it to covenant house  and eating what i paid for it  oh  and btw  though i got it in december  samsung no longer supports  and if you hit the button on their sight that says learn more  you end up at an hp support site  i ll go back to isignia or lg      
295,3.0 ,                       the picture quality is great  the physical design is minimal and attractive  the quick set up is terrible  i was pretty much on my own  the manual is in the tv and took me    minutes to find where it was along with the settings  click the home button and using the wheel on the remote scroll left  the setup took over an hour  the next challenge was hooking up my existing samsung sound bar  that was an even better treat  that took me   days to finally get it right  i can t wait to try creating a universal remote      
296,5.0 ,                       so i spent a lot of time researching samsung televisions   i m loyal to the brand and won t buy any other as i truly believe others are inferior   my tv space only allows for up to a     television  so i was comparing both the q  t and this model   i primarily use my tv for gaming via my xbox one   my previous tv was a best buy special and was not a smart tv   my biggest concern was that i wanted something that would be an upgrade in quality to what i had   i went back and forth between this model and the q  t   i ended up buying this one and could not be happier   the  k upscaling on my regular xbox one made games look immensely better   i didn t have to do anything other than enabling gaming mode and it looked great   i anticipate upgrading to the xbox series x  once it s back in stock  to fully utilize the  k experience  but even as is  i can tell a huge difference in the display s overall picture quality   samsung is becoming known for its qled tvs  but i would say that if you re in a similar situation as me  wait for those to come down in price before adopting      
297,5.0 ,                       this tv is awesome  its our first  k and our home having alexa and firetv in other spots really makes this fit in our household if you buy this   no there is not a plastic screen cover to remove  i saw what looked like a plastic pull off protector but youtube searched for if this was the case before i did so   there are videos of people who removed this layer and it completely scraps your tv  do not remove it i dont really love the auto netflix andprime buttons on the controller cuz i accidentally hit them occasionally  but its not a big deal one thing that this whole samsung thing needs is a digital keyboard within an app  signing in to your apps initially for setup is quite daunting without it  but thats not the tvs thing  its samsungssmart app this tv is great  it really is  and the price is awesome especially with the prime member monthly payment option      
298,1.0 ,                       no picture  useless tv  i ve ordered two tv from amazon and both were received broken      
299,1.0 ,                       i am sorry i purchased this tv   the reflection from a window  with blinds  makes it almost impossible to see clearly  also you cannot see anything unless you are right in front of the picture   my favorite viewing spot is no longer my spot   can t see picture at all if you re not right in front   looks like a gray wall from my favorite spot   i m not happy  i hate this tv      
300,3.0 ,                       i generally like samsung s products   however this tv is not fun to use   great picture   yes   however   the tizen interface is the worst   combined with the garbage remote that s ill conceived  with useless buttons and features   and not illuminated for night use  getting through the menus is a giant frustration  returned and got a tcl tv with roku interface      
301,5.0 ,                       what a great deal  excellent picture quality and great features  easy to set up alexa and all streaming apps  got this for screened in porch and could not be happier i am also an audiophile  i purchased a sound bar to install below because most tv s built in speakers are garbage  however  when i started watching it without the bar  i was impressed by the rich bass and dialogue was easy to hear  decided to send back the bar great tv      
302,1.0 ,                       purchased   of these tvs a month apart  most recent purchase i ended up on the phone with amazon and samsung for almost   hours   bottom line  amazon prime app is defective  they cannot get the app to load   basically is one of the main reasons i ordered the tv   completely useless tech support   and you know how much a pain it is to send something like this back once it is up on the wall   all other apps work  will attempt to download roku app which i already have an account and watch amazon prime   according to samsung and amazon  they were well aware of issue  yet let them be sold  unbelievable   poor poor poor failure in every way      
303,3.0 ,                       nice picture  good sound but the smart part of tv is very unfriendly unless you want to watch what is preprogrammed    have spent several days trying to configure and down load apps so i can watch local news  so far no luck  i have   other smart tv and   samsung  this one is beyond frustrating and my husband can not work it at all     yrs experience in it  and still cant get it to program   because of our remote location we have to use internet to watch tv  would also mention that it is heavy compared to my tlc  and will have to buy a console table to set it on as recommended hardware had limited mounting abilities and didn t want it half in front of window  amazon did refund the coast of bracket but currently is setting on floor  the wide stand requires a table       would have been much better to have a center stand      
304,5.0 ,                       the picture is even better than my   series  which i m upset about because  i bought this tv for my sister as a house warming gift also  the remote looks extremely weird  but it s actually very useful  it has a toggle like feature that lets you turn up the volume fast  you can also turn the volume down fast to pretend like you weren t watching it when the wife comes home      
305,1.0 ,                       it is impossible to connect this tv to a comcast cable box   every remote invented has a source button to tell the tv where to go  except this one   i spent an hour on the phone with a samsung rep and he could not get it to connect comcast  he kept asking me to push the source button and i kept telling him there isn t one   i asked for his supervisor and that was a joke  he tired to set up a tech visit but my serial number was rejected so he couldn t schedule it   i have three other samsung tvs and i set them up with comcast in minutes   there is a home button but that never worked   my only option is to return itmy wife grabbed the remote  pushed a button  she has no idea which one and darn if comcast didn t pop up   we now have a nice picture with comcast      
306,4.0 ,                       first off i ve always been a big fan of samsung tv s so read this with a  grain of salt  compared to the     it replaces i d rather have the      but i love the extra    with the      samsung keeps going further down the rat hole with their smart tv arrangement and limited button remote  it makes getting to adjustments more inconvenient then it was in the past  while i think the speak to me remote is a neat idea  their recording tracking everything said is not so neat  if it stayed with the tv i d use it  but it doesn t so i don t  however  their are those of you how don t care if you privacy is given away for free i read a few comprehensive reviews and i d agree with them if this will be a primary tv  if like in my case its a bedroom tv its more then good enough  also  if you are use to samsung s control feature arrangement it still almost the same  and for those of you who know how to think  unlike my w   if   e gads  it easy to figure out in summary  poorly implemented smart feature  great picture of a common tv  simple remote does lots of functions with so few buttons      
307,5.0 ,                       the screen on this tv is unbelievable  you will actually think you are in a movie theatre   the  smart  features are great  so convenient to be able to access all my streaming subscriptions from one remote      
308,4.0 ,                       this is a very good budget tv  which can be completely ad free if  you don t tick the box next to  interest based advertisement service  during the initial setup of the tv  we are using roku on all our home tvs  all four are samsung models   so interactions with the samsung tv remote are minimal the tv design is sleek  although more expensive models tend to look more  futuristic  than this one  the picture quality is really good  the only samsung tv at home that has a slightly better picture is a mu     model   the tv menus load quickly and browsing is easy  the sound is good and can be connected to an external bluetooth speaker  the provided hdmi ports     should be enough to connect a roku other streaming device  a video game console  and perhaps a blu ray player  you could tweak the default settings further to enhance your viewing experience by googling the optimal picture  etc  settings for this model  i personally prefer to set the picture to  dynamic  mode to get brighter colors and better contrast  there is also an  ambient  mode  and there is a button on the remote for it  that has some novel solutions for blending in with your room decor the tv comes preloaded with alexa and bixby  but if you are worried about privacy issues  you can skip activating either of them overall  at this price level  this is a very well made tv and is worth buying if you are on a budget      
309,2.0 ,                       the tv disconnects from wifi when turned off and will not reconnect once turned on   you have to reset the tv by unplugging from the wall for    seconds before turning it back on   i went through the recommended fixes by updating firmware  changing the ip settings  resetting the router ect   the only thing that worked was to unplug every time i turned off the tv   apparently it is a common issue with this tv if you look online   we have a larger version of the older model in our living room with no problems   hopefully you get a good one if you order      
310,2.0 ,                       i had the prior model of this tv   i got this one thinking it d be the same but they made a bunch of dumb design decisions that s made this significantly worse   notably  the remote control is a mess with a big  ambient  button you ll never use now replacing what used to be the source button   we use the source button all the time to switch to apple tv and other devices  but now you need to navigate through a cumbersome interface and menu just to switch to our ps    give us back the source button and ambient mode    this changes your tv to match the color of the light in your room   what    who would ever want a big glowing rectangle to use as what  a night light   this is now the most prominent button on the remote and you ll accidentally hit it all the time turning your tv into a big glowing useless box until you navigate back to tv mode also  they changed the digital audio input on the back   in the previous model it was horizontal to the back so you could plug in a speaker and still have the tv flush against the wall for some unimaginable and dumb reason they moved audio input to the other side of the tv  away from all the other wires making it harder to corral all your wires  and they made it plug in perpendicularly  ie at a tight angle to the back of the tv instead of flush    this makes it really hard to plug anything in and still have it flush with the wall this and other dumb  smart tv  menu designs have made this a real step backwards from the previous model which was just simpler and more intuitive picture is nice  but i think most tvs in this price range look good these days   it s the other things like menu and remote design and port design that makes or breaks the experience  and this model fails the test      
311,5.0 ,                       so  basically it has been around a month now since i got my tv and it works flawlessly  first  i got a dead on arrival tv screen because the ups person was not doing their job correctly from what i saw when they took it out of the truck  contacted amazon and they were an amazing help because they sent the replacement out right away and had the ups person come to my house the next to take the broken tv away  got my replacement tv a day after that and it has been working flawlessly ever since  thanks to the amazing customer service team from amazon for being so understanding  if you are looking for a       inch smart tv then why not go for this one since it has  k hdr quality also  works with the ps  also perfectly fine but i would like to remind you it is not    inch as stated just a little smaller but it s still pretty huge for a bedroom tv      
312,2.0 ,                       constantly loses wifi signal  have had to reset the television   times in the month since it was installed  moved the router across the house so it is only a few feet away and it still is spotty  live tv on any app doesn t work  sometimes it just won t come on at all  and we have to unplug replug it to get it to work  our older samsung across the house has no issues at all connecting this model seems like a bit of a dud      
313,4.0 ,                       this is a decent tv for the money  picture quality is decent enough  and the sound is pretty good  and it even supports bluetooth headphones like airpods  the smart features are great and i like tv plus  and i can have it on a wired network connection to reduce interference  but it also supports wi fi  now for the negatives the remote is awful  the only benefits to it are voice search and not having to point it at the tv  since it s bluetooth  it looks like they tried to copy roku and apple and took away almost all the buttons  you can tell they failed at remote design because the tv displays a tutorial on how to use the remote when you re setting it up  the good news is that this tv is compatible with any recent samsung ir remote  so i bought a more traditional one also    if you play video games on this tv  they look good but make sure you turn game mode on  otherwise the lag is horrendous  unlike my old tv  game mode seems to get turned off every time i put my switch away also  get a tv stand  i use a perlesmith stand  the stupid feet this comes with limit where you can put the tv overall  though  it s a pretty good tv for the money      
314,5.0 ,                       this is a great tv the colors are great  it looks amazing in the living room great complements on the quality and colors  trusted seller     
315,3.0 ,                       the good  great picture  very intuitive remote  lightweight so easy to hang on the all  small bezelthe bad  shipped saying ambient mode would display your own pictures but took   months of begging for them to make it happen on my      iphone  the ugly  the tizen os often does not get apps written until last or never gets themadded note  so after   months i still like the quality of my tv but wished it did not lose connection with the home network when it went into standby mode  when you turn it on  it can t find the network and so you have to hard reboot the tv  not a huge deal but this is        nearly     bottom line  not a bad purchase but i think equivalent tcl s will give you more bang for your buck      
316,1.0 ,                       i got this tv for my husband   he had it a few weeks and the picture had blots on it   he called to get it fixed and the company stated that it was internal and that it was covered by warranty   he waited another week and then called them back and they stated that it was not covered by warranty and he would have to order the part which was an additional     dollars due to he damaged it   here we are in august still no part  they have rescheduled many times    i feel that since he only had the tv a few weeks that the company should of fixed it and not made him pay   do not buy from this company customer service is poor and they don t back up their products   very disappointed       
317,4.0 ,                       first thing i did was watch the marvel universe in  k   awesome   i noticed some motion blur on a fast moving special  effect and at times it seems the picture would become very dark   i toggled a couple settings that were pretty intuitive and it i haven t seen those issues since   i am a bit concerned how sports will play out once covid    is done with us   so far though i have no complaints   for the cost  getting a really good  k picture and plenty of features i feel good about my purchase the only other thing i would say to prospective buyers is that you may need another set of hands to get the tv out of the box and put the stand pieces on   there is almost no assembly but the size makes it a bit difficult to manage alone      
318,5.0 ,                       delivered  january          arrived on time and in perfect condition  i was a little worried about the shipping of such a delicate item  no issues at all setup was easy  did all via my smart phone picture quality and sound are excellent update  february         issue    the remote control sucks  it s so minimalist that its hard to quickly get to the menu features  the up  down  left  right and center buttons are so smooth that its difficult to tell what you re touching without looking at it this remote is definitely not good for older people to navigate without constant frustration issue   before getting this tv  my other tv were made  smart  using chromecast devices  from any phone on my wifi  all tvs could be cast to from and streaming app  now with this tv on the system  some tv chromecast  combos don t show up on various streaming apps  although several of my tvs have streaming apps built into the tv  i was happily chromecasting everything with the addition of this new tv that i m not using with a chromecast  the whole seamless streaming experience is kinda ruined      
319,3.0 ,                       tldr  if you just want to turn on the tv  have it be in control and do whatever it does  you ll be fine  but if you step off the narrow path of samsung centric experience  you are in for a rotten time there is a pitched battle afoot for supreme control of the av experience  and we consumers are the innocent bystanders  watching in horror as what was once a simple activity  say  watching tv  or playing a computer game  becomes yet another bafflingly complex high tech gauntlet to be endured rather than enjoyed   my experience is attempting to make a new htpc  intel nuc  connect via new denon receiver  to this tv   i chose these components because they are reasonably high quality latest technology and thus likely to support all of the hdmi  k standards  and are well reviewed the nature of the problem became apparent immediately  connecting my pc hdmi directly  to the tv resulted in a  recognizing input  screen on the tv  which takes nearly a minute  and fails  then asks you what the input is   because the tv apparently doesn t know pcs   so i dutifully told it  this is a pc on hdmi    and everything looked fine   but every time i rebooted the pc or changed video modes  desktop gaming netflix  the tv wanted to recognize it again and again  despite this setback  i connected it via the denon and marched on  the receiver is a lot better about just coping with whatever signal it gets  so that was a relief   but now the tv part of things got worse  turning the receiver on or off  or switching inputs  sent the tv into fits of  recognizing  the input  which always failed  and now would now and then lead to the dread  no signal  on the tv  which was fixable by unplugging and replugging the hdmi so i started wondering  why does the tv need to recognize the device    it s just a tv  and it should display what it is given  some research suggests that this is all due to samsung s desire to make its tv and oneremote the center of your av world   you can attach a keyboard and mouse to your tv   your tv streams netflix and amazon   your tv streams video from all sorts of other sources of terrible quality and dubious curation  your tv wants to show you mariah carey s holiday special  but in order to do that  it must take control of everything  this would be ok except that  when the samsung engineers devised their strategy for world av domination  they left out the part about how it has to actually work   and it has to work without standing on one leg and holding the antenna just so   which is basically what i m up against by now i was getting that sinking feeling that i ve made a terrible mistake   yes  i could return both the tv and receiver  because amazon is quite generous that way  but    what a pain in the behind  and what a terrible waste  i had yet to call samsung support  because i absolutely hate working my way up the call center hierarchy  and i d read a few things about this problem which concluded with  samsung support was no help at all    so i started frantically researching every samsung forum i could find  and i eventually stumbled across this gem   i am not making this up   using the oneremote  i entered the cheat code mute voluemdown channeldown mute  without giving any feedback  this apparently disables the  recognizing input   samsung completely disavows this hack  and it is not supported   use at your own risk nonetheless  i ve decided to run with this rube goldberg machine i ve been building  but i disabled the tv s internet because i didn t want it getting firmware auto update and deciding that it really didn t support the unsupported cheat code any more  i ve managed to suppress  for now  the occasional instance of  no signal  by programming my logitech harmony to add a   second delay between the power on of the receiver and pc  and the power on of the tv   i m kind of holding my breath  hoping nothing breaks for a while regarding picture quality  which i at first rated rather poorly   my wife and i immediately noticed that the colors were weirdly eye popping on great british bake off on netflix   and when watching pride and prejudice  which she has seen several times  she remarked that the picture seemed all wrong   that s when we found  filmmaker picture mode   which i ll just call  the picture mode that everyone wanted in the first place    once again  the tv is too smart for its own good   why does it need to color correct and resharpen a  k picture that s already been optimized by the creator  after disabling the picture correction  it looks pretty good   but did that disable some great feature i might want like hdr   i don t really know ps  gaming mode is utterly useless to me  it kind of worked at first  but now it just sends the tv into the despairing  no signal  mode   perhaps if i hadn t suppressed the input recognition it would have worked  but     input recognition breaks when connected to a pc   catch    pps  i have tried every high bandwidth hdmi cable connector i could find  including fiber optic and hbaset extender   they are no help in this experience  although the hbaset extender made it worse  probably due to delays in the startup connect sequence i was at one point really tempted by the commercial displays  also samsung  that lack all of the smartness  https   smile amazon com samsung be  t h software speakers lh  bethlgfxgo   if you look at its reviews  you ll see that all the one star reviews are  no smart apps    if you are wanting to do htpc gaming  this is worth checking out first      
320,5.0 ,                       we have   samsung s smart tvs  so i hate that they changed the remote  the sound was not fantastic for our long narrow livingroom  so we did end up buying a sound bar subwoofer  the picture and the color quality is fantastic  it comes with samsung tv which i ve never had before  so it s nice to have some sort of tv aside from hulu  disney   netflix  and prime  as far as the brightness i kept reading and worrying about  this tv has an ambient mode  and in ambient mode the color and picture and brightness are greatly affected because that s the idea of it being a softer darker picture quality  we don t use ambient mode  because we want the usual bright picture quality  we ve watched older tv shows   k tv shows  the kids play the ps  on it  and it s all been great  it has hdmi and av input on the back      
321,3.0 ,                       the picture quality is good with options to get the kind of picture you want  the remote is easy to hold and use  i used to use tv ears with my old tv so my wife could listen to the volume she wanted   this set has no rca out jacks to connect it to   the solution was to get a sound bar  which does put out better sound than the tv speakers  while i connect my wireless headphones to the bluetooth on the tv   i am using roku to get my streaming channels because the tv won t let me put philo into the program list  also the glossy screen picks up glare from lights that are in line with the screen  i have heard this is a common problem with most cheaper sets      
322,5.0 ,                       excellent tv clear picture  easy to use  i don t know what the other reviews were complaining about regarding brightness because it is perfectly bright  the one thing to know is that for the smart features to work  you need a strong and steady wi fi signal  we needed to purchase a wi fi extender in order to get this to work  our router is on a different floor of our average size house and the signal     bars  on a phone  was not strong enough for the tv      
323,4.0 ,                       i have loved samsung tvs in general  my order was returned as it was damaged in transit but i am looking at ordering another one to replace it  my review is not specific to this model because of this samsung has long been my favorite because of the picture quality and easy of use  the remotes have been easy to navigate but with that said i am not familiar with the very clean looking remote of this tv  we use apple kodi streaming boxes on all our tvs even though our newer ones are smart tvs with app availability  we currently have   samsung  tcl  and vizio and the samsung s are far easier to program and a nicer clean interface i have not used the setup app as my other tvs didn t require it but before i knew this one was damaged i did dl it and it does seem fairly easy to navigate i love that tvs now offer  game mode  switching for all hdmi so it s easy to switch between things connected via hdmi  simply turn on the device and the tvs switch to them one problem with too many tvs is the lack of enough hdmi ports  only a few offer more than   so this means an hdmi switcher may be required by people with multiple devices to connect      
324,5.0 ,                           beauty  the sanyo remote is lacking  as usual  the remotes for their     tvs are much better  this tv is connected to a fios dvr  overnight  it had to be rebooted as it defaulted to    i and didn t think the tv was  k  this is actually the reason i bought this tv  it wouldn t even connect to the tv it replaced  the smart set up was a breeze  each app gave access to a code that could be entered on a smart device  not having to enter passwords with a remote is excellent  the picture quality is very nice for the price      
325,5.0 ,                       mind blowing definition and color  i m not techie nor do i watch tv much  but when i sat to finally unwind to watch  peppermint  i felt like i was in the movies  we got the sound bar to create the movie theater bass  i m just  blown how far technology has gone   i have the     it s huge and a perfect fit for our bedroom   the delivery guys were great  what i also loved is you get to pick the time to have your tv delivered colors popped  lots of definition  bassy sound  crystal clear  stunning quality      
326,5.0 ,                       this is a really good tv and i m really not sure why some people didn t like the interface  i thought it was easy  the remote is awesome and simple  i tested this tv in every way i could think of  and i would say it s one of the best especially for the price  gaming has been crystal clear   k videos and movies have been amazing  sports were really good when my internet wasn t acting up  almost no motion blur  the frame rate is impressive  i wouldn t say the best option for competitive gaming but certainly very good for general gaming      
327,3.0 ,                       online purchase snagged me again   i wanted to replace my older plasma tv with this   k  one  i wish i d just kept my old one the good   product arrived promptly  very light to lift  picture quality is ok as long as you re directly in front of the set the bad   the remote is a toy   very cumbersome to always have to go to home by scrolling   the sideways plugs for hdmi and antennae are ridiculously difficult to connect  off center viewing degrades significantly  there are no  analog  audio outputs for feeding audio to my older stereo receiver   i haven t been able to get a digital adapter to work     
328,5.0 ,                       i was not entirely sure whether this tv would be  overwhelming  in size  but it is really a great size for the room and not at all like i installed a drive in theater   i have a bose surround sound system and the optical port and options for using the bose control to run the tv and the sound worked great   watched football and it was like i sitting in the  fan less  stadium   very happy with this purchase and the quality of this tv   hard to beat this for the price at this size      
329,5.0 ,                       i had considered this    inch tv and the qled  i saw the picture at a best buy and thought it to be fantastic  the qled was amazing too but i didn t feel it was worth      more  this picture is so crystal clear i can see the grain of the grass when watching a golf tournament  i love to watch tcm movies   the old movies are so clear with this tv that it seems like the actors are actually in your room  some dislikes   not crazy the way the app bar is shown across the bottom of the screen  they are small and hard to tell which one is highlighted  also i just wish i could get rid of many apps i don t want  but samsung has some  you just can t delete  instructions with the tv were only for installation  hardly any operating instructions on paper  i also thought it was difficult setting up as you have to go online and start a samsung account   i couldn t get the bixby to work for voice so i used alexa which works great  the remote is pretty basic but does a good job  i can use it for xfinity  comcast  but found it easier just to use the comcast remote  and use the samsung remote for apps and controlling my firestick  only other thing is it would have been easier if the tv had a stand with a platform instead of legs  legs are ok but i had to make a new tabletop to accommodate the width of the legs   overall the tv is awesome      
330,1.0 ,                       after initial excitement  i started seeing a white patch  very noticeable  on the right side of the screen  i started feeling like looking through a dirty window   on a    years old lcd tv  which this one was replacing  the picture was better   i am not interested so much in the  smart  features  if i have discomfort watching the picture   in the absence of these  smart  features  i can connect the firestick or a smartphone  i would like to know  what should i connect in the absence of a good picture   some reviews tell how good is the picture on different type of tv technology  oled  is it just another way of saying how bad the picture on this type of tv is  or did picture quality requirements go down      year old lcd tv had better picture  this tv s picture quality did not even get close      
331,3.0 ,                       i have read in other reviews the problems with darkness and have encountered some of that  but not widespread so i am assuming that to be the actual program i am watching  otherwise the clarity of the picture is phenomenal  remote and general smart set up is a bit cumbersome  the included apps are limited and those that are tend to be  well  pathetic  i am constantly resetting the at t app because of slow response or  channel not available  try later  messages  i had a problem with it holding the current time and i have to say samsung s cs was very helpful  but the at t app  as well as mlb are pathetic  i have fire tv sticks and cubes on other tv s in the house and they operate far more smoothly  also a very limited selection of available apps  about to give up and order a new cube for it      
332,1.0 ,                       well let s see  received tv today  set up was easy  picture and sound quality good  however  the screen went blank    minutes in to watching a movie  samsung customer support totally unhelpful and bordering on incompetent  amazon customer support processed a replacement and a pick up of the defective model  they were very helpful  let s see how it works out update  amazon replaced the tv  within six months  it developed some kind of bug that makes it unusable  samsung support couldn t fix the issue  the repair person they sent out could not fix the issue  it is essentially a useless piece of plastic      
333,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       pros     the picture quality is quite good  but nothing that will blow you away     the thin frame looks nice cons     the tv does not get very bright and it s quite reflective  so it s not good for daytime watching     the smart interface software is so bad that it crashes and freezes on a daily basis     the voice control for the remote doesn t even work as you would expect it would  for example  inputting searches on appletv do not work with the voice input     the remote has no backlight and the buttons have no distinguishing features and a few of the buttons are completely useless   for example  there s no button for the tv settings  in order to get to the tv settings you just hit the home button and then click left six times  passing an advertisement every single time  yet i have some completely useless multi color input button and an ambient mode button  both of which i ll never use     the advertisements that pop up when you hit the home button are permanent   that is so annoying  why did i pay to see advertisements every single time i use my tv     the inputs on the back are impossible to use if you wall mount the tv unless you remove the tv from the wall  even for the usb inputs  one of the hdmi ports even points towards the wall so i can t even plug anything into it unless i buy a    degree hdmi cable honestly  i did not expect a tv designed in      to be anywhere near this bad   by far the worst  con  is the smart interface crashing  freezing and updating on a regular basis   i m really hoping this is only due to the fact that this is a brand new tv  but even if that s fixed i would still only be rating this tv as maybe a       as it stands however  i m seriously considering returning this thing because it s so frustrating      
334,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the specs on this are confusing because this amazon page does not correspond to the specs on other websites  for instance it says    fps here but     fps elsewhere  after research the     and larger are     fps  the smaller are    fps  also it notes   hdmi here and   elsewhere  i believe this is also to do with the size of the television you bought but not sure  even when viewing a     or larger tv the compare feature here is still showing for their smaller versions this has lead to a lot of  i didn t know this was    fps when i bought it but i can t tell  because it is actually     if     or larger hope this helps  look up the stats elsewhere besides this the tv is great  the colors are amazing compared to a normal tv but the ru     has a deeper color palette  basically this is the economy version of the ru     but performs very well  it does very well  maybe even the best in it s class for  k  the input lag is very low so this could be used for gaming very easily  the gaming mode actually scores better than the movie picture mode in most reviews  the initial settings will need to be tweaked to run this at it s full potential  just look up online the best setting than your good to go  after being optimized this tv scored a     for  k tv s  pre optimized settings it scored a         
335,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       got it yesterday set it up last night setup was pretty easy   i was a little wary of a couple of things  the details on amazon weren t really clear on whether there was samsung tv plus and also if the t v  was youtube tv app capable   the answer to both questions is yes  they are both available when i looked through the apps during initial setup i couldn t find youtube t v  app  but after i was done with the setup and was surfing through the samsung tv plus channel lineup i decided to check in all apps went to search type in  youtube tv  and bam  there it was downloaded it  which was pretty quick all things considered like internet speeds slowing done due to the  epidemic     i was able to get alexa all setup except tried to use the drop in feature from my cell phone at work today to talk to my wife at home but wouldn t work   not sure what s wrong but i have spent the last   years buying   tv per room in my home in my son s room i have a    in  samsung  k      model  in the living room a      model samsung   in  i think its nu     model number  and now this year this tv for my wife and i s room  i will post some pics later i love the new remote its a lot slimmer than the previous kind and seems to load up apps when you turn it on pretty quick and was nice i setup my commute to work and was able to just ask alexa on the remote how long might drive would be and best way to get there and it got me to work in half the time it usually takes me    i will keep this updated with anything good or bad in the future      
336,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i really like this tv overall and am happy with my purchase  i ran some  k demo videos through the built in youtube app and the  k picture is absolutely beautiful  the one minor gripe is that the blacks aren t truly black  as is the case with all lcd screens  but unless you re going to pony up the money for an oled  that s just the way it s going to be  the sound quality is also quite good from the tv s built in speakers i only have a couple of minor complaints overall about the tv  the first is that i m not really a fan of the modern style  minimalist  remote  call me old fashioned  but i would prefer to have a number pad  especially when using the built in spectrum tv app to watch my cable tv channels  but if it really bothers me that much i assume i could probably buy a universal remote to use with the tvmy other minor complaint is that i don t really like the  stand  that came with the tv  my old samsung tv had a really nice swivel stand that allowed me to turn the tv from side to side  depending on where in the room i was sitting  this tv only has    feet  for a stand  so no swiveling of the tv is really possible  here again  i can probably remedy this by buying an after market universal tv stand that will swivel if i want to overall i am very satisfied with this tv and would definitely recommend it  at under      it s a very good value      
337,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this tv is awesome  thought it had   hdmi ports  but i bought a splitter so that should fix the problem  games and movies look amazing  also  if your soundbar is samsung it will find or request to connect to the tv instantly      
338,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i really love this tv  the size  quality and smart features is just amazing  especially after waiting a long time to upgrade  i hung this tv on a tv console  and that was the most frustrating part for me  so i knocked a star off because it really should have better instructions  i had to do alot of online researching  this tv has vesa mounts which is good   the instructions say      mm size m    i tried a   mm m  screw and it did not work  it turns out that is the length that you need to aim for inside the tv  not the actual screw length  do actual measurements  or take your best guess at it like i did  for the tv bracket that came with the console stand  i had to use a   mm screw to accomodate the width of the bracket  the most frustrating part is that the tv has an irregular shape back and it is not mentioned anywhere  the bottom two vesa screws will need to be longer than the top two screws  i had to use an even longer screw coupled with a spacer under the bracket against the tv  as per the tv console instructions  to get the bottom screws to hold   the screw for that one was    mm and the math was    mm screw      mm spacer      mm then take that distance     mm   you need minimum of   mm inside of tv   gives  mm space for bracket and washer  also note that this tv does not come with any mounting screws or spacers  you should buy a mounting screw kit with various size screws  washers and spacers in addition to your tv bracket console  i wasted a few hours on a weekend on figuring this out so hopefully my review helps at least one person  also  if you plan to mount on a tv console  make sure that it can support your tv  after i bought this tv  i realized that my current console only supported up to    and i bought a      i had to wait an additional   weeks with my tv on the floor while the new tv stand was being shipped  and then i had to build it  sigh  this was a project and that was an unexpected expense for me  it was worth it at the end though i also purchased the    inch  and that one does have a flat and not curved irregular back   i really love this tv too  another note   for amazon video  on occasion i would see a  something went wrong  message  to fix this issue  i had to do a hard reboot by holding the power button for    seconds  if you have any issues with apps such as amazon  hulu  netflix  etc   in the settings  there is also an option to  reinstall  each app if needed      
339,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i used to own the samsung mu     but in february it fell and the screen cracked  so when i was looking for a new tv i saw this one but it didn t have many reviews at the time nor positive ones  but i took a chance and i love the tv  the bezels are thinner and the picture is actually pretty good  they also have all the apps that i needed and use  i know some people have said it s too dark sometimes but i don t really have that problem day time or night  you can always switch the picture to dynamic anyways  overall it s great and i m glad i bought it      
340,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       purchased the samsung   series tu          after un packing i found that the     i purchased was actual      how s that  the box is only     there no way with the foam protection the tv could be     see pictures and video  this is a scam i need my money or a     samsung tv     
341,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       good tv     
342,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       for the money  this tv really hard to beat what most excited me about this tv is the sound  according to samsung  this tv has woofers  which should help out with lower frequencies that have long been a weak spot of flat screen tvs  having had the tv for a few days  i can confirm that it produces sound that i have never heard from a flat screen tv before  don t expect it to shake your walls with strong low bass  but it s definitely an improvement to previous models  the lowest frequencies i can hear from it are somewhere in the      hz range picture quality is excellent  i get the impression that it is slightly improved compared to last year s already excellent offerings  although i don t have any equipment to measure this objectively  the tv can produce vibrant colors  gets very bright  and produces great contrast  and the settings allow you to adjust this to your liking  some distortion of the colors when viewed at an angle is inherent in the technology  but even at wide angles  i wouldn t call it bothersome the one thing about the tv that isn t great is thesoftware  the youtube app stops playing video about once a day  long pressing the back button will exit it  after which it can be restarted  the app will also show ads even when logged in to an account with a subscription to remove ads  the tv restarts every once in a while and shows contv  which often displays violence and can take a minute or so to navigate away from the software can also be slow and unresponsive at times  particularly immediately after turning on the tv  apps also take a while to load  this being the case when the tv is new does not bode well for the performance in the future when apps will undoubtedly be more demanding of course  you don t have to use the provided apps or menu bar if you just want to watch regular tv or if you run your software on an external device plugged into one of the tv s ports aside from the software problems  this is a great tv for not a lot of money  i am sure better picture quality  more processing power  and more hdmi ports can be had if you re willing to spend more  but for the money  this tv might very well be the best one out there if you already have a recent model  is it worth upgrading  compared to last year s ru      this tv definitely has better sound  i think the picture is ever so slightly better  but you get fewer hdmi ports    instead of    and my impression is that software runs less smoothly  overall  i would keep using the ru     unless you really want the improved sound  compared to older or lower specced models that already have slower processors and fewer hdmi ports  upgrading to the tu     is definitely worth it rated four stars to save my fifth star for a future tv with a faster processor and at least   ports  other than that  this tv is excellent and i don t hesitate to recommend it
