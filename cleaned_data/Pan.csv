0,5.0,                       this is a great pan   love it   cooks great and real easy clean up     
1,1.0,                       very disappointing  not non stick  i fried an egg and on purpose did not use any butter or non sick spray  the egg stuck and left a mark  i would not recommend this pan  it s pretty  but the maker has lied about the non stick      
2,4.0,                       love it except for the fact that the bottom is convex so juice and or oil flows to the outside and the middle has no liquid      
3,5.0,                       i use this pan to prepare food for my baby  it s a great size  complete non stick and easy to clean  it heats up quickly  the handle looks like wood  but actually it s plastic or rubber  so it s more durable than i expected      
4,1.0,                       after using this product for basically    days we had to throw it awayi would definitely look for something else it should last longer and basically burned the coding     
5,5.0,                       i really like this pan  the first time i cooked with it i cooked on too hot of heat  be careful you don t need as much heat as you would think  as i need other pots or pans i will buy more of this product  only problem i cannot find a top to fit it  maybe i should ve given it a three instead of a four clean up easy     
6,3.0,                       first of all  misleading ad  this is made in china  not switzerland   i wish i had researched it a bit more carefully before purchasing   as for the pan itself  it s a nice size   the handle has a really weird feel   it looks like fake wood and has an oddly soft yet firm texture   i m not sure how the handle will hold up over time        
7,5.0,                       bought as a gift for my mother  these are great pans for the price  my mother loves them  super easy to clean and very non stick      
8,1.0,                       would put zero star if i could  this is definitely not a non stick pan  sprayed oil to pan to cook fried eggs a couple of times  fried eggs stuck to pan both times and pan left two long scratch marks on my glasstop stove  pan is not what it advertises  completely regretting purchase and will never buy from this brand again      
9,5.0,                       not expensive but worth every penny   works as advertised  in a world where companies tell you what ever you want to hear to take your money   this company delivers on its promises   i am very happy      
10,5.0,                       this is my  st pan of this kind  i m very pleased  i m not sure i would go with light colored wood  because any grease splatter will seep into the wood handle  but whatever as far as a nonstick  it definitely is  and the heat distribution is great  everything cooks super evenly  seems durable  not much to say  when my other large nonstick dies i m gonna get a large one of these      
11,5.0,                       definitely a none stick pan which is great many say none stick but after a few use everything sticks but not with this one  been using for some months and it s my go to when cooking   so easy to clean a little water and a few rubs and its good to go      
12,3.0,                       this is a great pan for use on other than an induction cook top   whether the plate on the bottom  or the material used to make the pan  it does not work well on induction   it cooks very slowly   had to turn the burner up to medium   medium high to cook an egg   if the pan gets moved at all  the burner turns itself off  leaving the food cooking to stop   i returned this one and a larger version that i purchased to amazon   that said  the non stick coating works perfectly and i absolutely loved the the handle   if you cook on anything but induction  this is a great pan   just not good for induction      
13,1.0,                       used it a few times now its warped     
14,5.0,                       this pan is exactly what we were looking for  well made  perfect size  high sides  non stick  and easy to clean   what more could you ask for      
15,5.0,                       after a poor experience with an expensive  kitchen specialty mall store omelet pan  i tried this one   surely such an inexpensive pan couldn t do the job boy  was i surprised  pleasantly   this pan is solid  thick  and smooth   much more value than many higher priced utensils   seriously  i cleaned the pan the first three times with a paper towel   period   it s amazing i m not kidding about the brick like texture   i closed my eyes and ran my fingers over the inner surface   brick   how it manages to be so fabulously non stick i simply cannot explain   i just love it only one small complaint  the care advisory is printed on the backside label in white type on orange background   the paragraphs almost disappear   and it s about   point  small print   magnifying glass type   so to the packaging designers  a big fail buy the frying pan anyway      
16,4.0,                       i spent weeks researching to find a pan that s light and non stick as well as durable  it is very hard to find i like this one but still were in trial phase to see what it can do  the handle i do not trust very well not to break  since the first one that shipped to me was already broken so be aware when you re transporting the food in it  at this stage it is wearing well and performing well cooks evenly fry s well and i m enjoying the easy to clean feature  the people complaining probably beat up there kitchenware i do not  i am careful not to use the wrong utensils etc  i will update what i see how it is in a few months     
17,5.0,                       the     skillet is fabulous   it is a deep skillet and the soft touch handle makes carrying the skillet so comfortable      
18,5.0,                       strong   you have to cure it before use to get optimum cooking results from this pan      
19,5.0,                       love this pan   used it once today   it was amazing      
20,5.0,                       the heat distribution is amazing  very easy to clean and is very attractive      
21,5.0,                       i like the heftiness of this pan   it is also super easy to clean      
22,5.0,                       it s my favorite frying pan  love it      
23,5.0,                       what a fantastic skillet     sticking  just rub on some cooking oil after it s been used   cleaned     
24,5.0,                       best frying pan   ever  i highly recommend it        
25,1.0,                       i first bought an     one  which is great  non stick  easy to clean and everything you could ask for however this      one is very different than my previous one  even if it s non stick eventually  things stick at first even with a lot of oil  i have to scratch them with a silicon spatula  my guess is that the heat distribution is not evenlythe other problem is that when the pan is heating on low medium heat  it makes a cracking sound  which is scary  i ve never heard such a thing from an empty  new and cold warm pan  the noise keeps coming  i don t know what is wrong with this item  but it certainly shouldn t have passes a quality checkit s too bad that i already used the item  so i don t know if they d accept a return  i don t recommend this product as a cracking sound is the last thing you expect from a pan     
26,5.0,                       i purchased the    inch skillet  received it yesterday and cooked a meal in it later in the day  no care instructions or any other information were included with it  i googled  carote care instructions     found little available for this particular brand  only generic information i washed it in hot soapy water  dried and spread a thin coat of oil over the interior  and let it heat on a medium low gas flame for about   minutes in order to season it a bit later  i cooked a taco ground beef rice dinner in it and clean up was a breeze  after drying  i applied another thin coat of oil and put it away until next time  so far  so good      
27,2.0,                       bought    on ten dollar special  followed cleaning and oil instructions but  while it looks nice and the handle stays cool  it is not non stick and does perform worse than the standard smooth teflon coated pans i have   smooth coatings generally have less surface area so this rugged  granite  coating does not live up to the marketing hype  sorry  returning this one to avoid swiss holes in my budget      
28,5.0,                       used it today for the first time burnt the food a little bit my bad not the pan i was worried will it stick to the pan let it sit in water for only a few mins and rubbed with a sponge and wow nice and clean so far i am impresse  i cook every day this will be my go to pan i will update this in a few weeks but so far very impressed how easy it was to clean      
29,5.0,                       great product   cooks evenly and clean up is easy     
30,4.0,                       have to remember  to use lower heat     
31,5.0,                       great non stop skillet   wish it was also oven broiler proof      
32,5.0,                       so i needed to replace an old teflon non stick pan  i spent a couple of minutes checking out the new non stick coated pans  this one had very good reviews and was the perfect size for eggs and omelets  i went ahead and pulled the trigger and am glad i did so  when making eggs omelets i always throw in a bit of butter to grease the pan  with the old teflon pan i would sometimes get spots that stuck  that is not at all the case with this pan  nothing sticks to it  it is always very easy to flip your eggs  the pan performs as good as it looks  if you are looking for a small frying pan i highly recommend this one      
33,5.0,                       i love how its non stick even it has the stone texture  i tried to cook eggs without oil and it didnt stick      
34,5.0,                       this is a great pan especially for the price  i can t think of any reason not to heartily recommend it if you re in the market for a small pan for grilled sandwiches  etc       
35,5.0,                       this is the only pan i use and love it easy to clean and nothing sticks in it     
36,5.0,                       nice pan and lid but the turner is more like a wooden spatula  not really a turner        
37,5.0,                       i like this  it works great for me  stuff doesn t stick   it is easy to clean  some things i do use oil for but others i don t      
38,2.0,                       i don t know what  to tell you  just got the pan and it s got a scorch mark on it  not liking this  about to cancel my next couple of orders        
39,5.0,                       replaced my daughters old pan with this one  she tells me it makes crispy things crispy      
40,5.0,                       worked as stated  i did season first as per instructions  cooked   poached eggs  didn t stick and easily cleaned      
41,5.0,                       i love this pan so much that i hand wash it immediately after every time i make scrambled eggs even though i m pretty sure it s dishwasher safe  i have lectured the entire house about never using metal on my baby  it s the best pan  the weight  the feel  the way things don t stick without the crappy teflon  i want to buy each piece from this collection as i have the money      
42,5.0,                       really non stick   great for just about anything   made omelet with cheese   goodies   it slid out of pan easily  love it   recommend highly  easy clean up too     
43,5.0,                       looking for a good nonstick pan and finally found one  great price  really sturdy and so far nothing sticks  i like the stone look and already purchased another larger one for the wife who absolutely loves it  seasoned pan before first use and no longer put under cold water immediately after using has helped retain coating      
44,5.0,                       i have used this daily for maybe six months   cleans up easily   cooks great  i do not use mine on high heat as someones review stated it shortened the lifetime of the pan      
45,5.0,                       i have a nice stainless steel set but was looking for a non stick option  this one goes above and beyond  it feels like a cast iron  but works like a non stick  eggs are perfect in this pan  very easy to clean  you can even get away with throwing it in the dishwasher  my only qualm with this pan is that the handle is not real wood but a silicon wood look design  all of this at an amazing price point  thinking about replacing my whole stainless steel set for these       
46,5.0,                       i like everything about it      
47,5.0,                       ok so far i like them     
48,2.0,                       non stick surface blackens and food sticks to the pan     
49,5.0,                       great pan   heats well   cooks evenly   sturdy   cleans well with a damp paper tower   great price      
50,5.0,                       bought the small frying pan and liked it so much bought the larger one  they  are safe to cook with and nothing sticks      
51,4.0,                       i i haven t had a a chance to use these pans much but so far i love them nothing sticks       
52,5.0,                       just the right size     
53,5.0,                       love this small pan   got one for my    year old mom to   wish the lid was available also   going to buy the whole set too      
54,5.0,                       first thing in the morning i make oatmeal  or eggs or veggies  the non stick treatment of the pan is perfect      
55,5.0,                       love it  it s cheap and so face so easy to clean  i ve only used it once but i almost like it better than cast iron      
56,5.0,                       my husband needed a new egg pan  he loves this  non stick and easy peasy to clean      
57,5.0,                       heavy construction so the heat distribution is good   cooks evenly and the non stick feature works very well   when cooking eggs a bit of oil really keeps them sliding   surface has a rougher texture than i m used to in a non stick but it works really well   i am considering purchasing another one in another size with a glass lid so i can steam items as well      
58,5.0,                       love  love  love these pans  i brought   that s how much i love these pans  i found these pans from a youtuber lol  now i can what all the hupe was all about  there easy to clean  cooks evenly and nothing stinks to the pan  i always wash them by hand and never put in the dishwasher  to preserve the life of the pans longer  i will update if anything changes  i highly doubt  i will      
59,3.0,                       the non stick quality degraded fairly quickly after only a few months    but not terribly  pan is still in working order  as it never warped and the coating never flaked  i can still use it for many applications  i e  frying      
60,1.0,                       the pan looks nice and and the handle feels good but it ends there  used it for the first time this morning to make some scrambled eggs and it didn t come out too well  first  the pan sticks  i used about     tablespoons of olive oil and the eggs still stuck  second  the handle started to turn yellow right where it touches the pan and it started to  burn  because there was a distinct rubbery smell  third  it was difficult to clean because of the  rough  granite the pan is made out of  returning this product      
61,5.0,                       before i bought it i couldn t believe it  i couldn t believe it  i couldn t believe it  i couldn t believe it  i couldn t believe it after i tried it i couldn t believe it  i couldn t believe it  i couldn t believe it  i couldn t believe it  i couldn t believe it it is the best frying pan skillet   get a thousand         
62,5.0,                       the pan is probably one of the very best o have ever purchased      
63,5.0,                       i absolutely love this non stick  easy to clean pan   in fact  i m so happy with it that i bought the     the     and the wok        
64,5.0,                       so far really impressed how non stick and appears good quality and looks good      
65,5.0,                       a very good small skillet   cooked thoroughly and was pleased with how evenly the heat was distributed   would definitely recommend this     
66,5.0,                       i like it alot  if i should have to get another one  it will be this one  very easy to clean      
67,5.0,                       i ve been using this plan for half a year now and so far it s awesome  nothing really stick to it when i cook  easy to clean  don t have to scrub hard  love      
68,5.0,                       perfect for cooking and clean up    i m very happy with my purchase      
69,5.0,                       this pan is great  nothing sticks  i use just a small amount of butter  my eggs glide right off  easy clean up as well  i am going to purchase more      
70,5.0,                       i ve been using this pan for almost a year   it s my  go to  pan most of the time   still in great shape   you will not regret this purchase   i plan to buy a larger one      
71,5.0,                       my go to pan for cooking  perfect for frying an egg  hamburger etc for a quick meal for one  it s light and conducts heat perfectly      
72,5.0,                       i have tried many fry pans  most lose their non stick ability sooner or later  finally i found the carote frying pan brand  absolutely the best i ve come across  i liked it so much i went back to amazon and bought the     version  beautifully made  though that s irrelevant  i m going to look into buying their whole line  and  though not cheap  considerably less expensive than some      
73,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          just amazing buy it   look the video and you ll understand jeje     
74,4.0,                       it s heavier than i thought it would be     
75,5.0,                       best pan i have had     
76,5.0,                       this is such a good skillet  it is a fraction of the cost of more expensive items and yet it is durable  easy to clean  and cooks evenly and effectively  also  the handle is coated in silicon  which means i don t need a glove or pot holder to move it when cooking      
77,5.0,                       amazing   i almost never write reviews but i seriously love this pan  like many i m trying to eat healthier and switched to using egg whites and spray pam  my attempts at this in my old pan were a disaster   my husband even questioned what the heck i had done   this pan is a breeze   the attached picture is right after cooking no cleaning   as you can see  it all slides out   the only drawback is size i can t really think what else you would cook in such a small pan   but i don t care because i can make healthy eggs now      
78,5.0,                       best small fry pan ever   easy to clean  wipes clean or just a bit of hot water and your done  uses minimal fat for cooking  the handleis comforting and heat resistant  worth the money      
79,5.0,                       this is the best fry pan i have ever owned  cooks great and cleans up so easy      
80,5.0,                       i bought this out of desperation  tired of fighting the cast iron skillets i bought to replace some extremely expensive german made pans that started to stick and burn food  it was inexpensive  and i thought  why not best decision  best pan  ever  it distributes heat evenly  i have a convection stovetop   doesn t stick even when i put no oil  and cleans like a dream  it s light  too  what a difference with the cast iron pan   love it  buying the bigger one  too      
81,5.0,                       some of the bad reviews made me hesitate then i remembered that i can always return it  very non stick no bitter or oil and eggs slide right across it virtually no clean up  did exactly as i hoped it would      
82,5.0,                       this is great for eggs  super easy to clean  great buy for my money     
83,5.0,                       love these  i had purchased the larger one and loved it so much i bought these smaller ones  i got rid of all teflon pans  the material on these just  feels  different  food cooks well and clean up is a breeze  these are my favorite pans  i hope they hold up over time      
84,5.0,                       i was amazed to seee that it actually is a non stick pan when i used it  the surface appearance throws you off with what seemingly is a rough surface though it s really actually smooth   works superb  the handle is just an extra bonus   the wood is made well and sturdy   i actually now prefer this kind of pan and will be purchasing more in the future  definitely recommend update  just bought a  nd one   the    inch  and i was amazed at how huge it is  not just in circumference but also the height is a bit taller than others i ve used  the quality cannot be beat      
85,5.0,                       i truly enjoy cooking with stone cookware      
86,5.0,                       couldn t be more pleased  i like to test a pan by cooking omelettes and the    inch pan passed with flying colors  love the handles too  i ll be buying a set for the kids this christmas      
87,5.0,                       this is a great pan  i love the style and design   i would buy a whole set if they had them in different sizes      
88,5.0,                       heats nicely  cooks better than just about everything we ve had  and cleanup is no problem  including cheese melt      
89,5.0,                       great  doesn t stick  made scrambled eggs and nothing left in pan   great buy      
90,5.0,                       the handle just fits in your hand and stays cool while cooking   it really is non stick and a breeze to clean      
91,5.0,                       my sister is very happy with this frying pan  it heats up fast with low setting  very easy to clean  she uses it a lot for cooking   has not tarnish or burn      
92,1.0,                       they cook great but even after several cleanings they put out  soot   as if you cooked in your fireplace  you put the pan down on a dishcloth after you ve washed it and dryed it and there is a residue of soot on the dishcloth  or your hand  or your counter top      
93,4.0,                       the non stick pan is super good and nothing will tick  it is hefty and substantial  the handle had burn marks after first use and after several uses was burnt and flacking      
94,5.0,                       love it  i want a larger version now      
95,3.0,                       handle had a small piece missing     
96,2.0,                       used daily for eggs  it is not what i would call  nonstick    the eggs must be soaked and then scraped off with a plastic scraper   heats well  but the clean up negates anything positive i could say   odd considering the top reviews note that it can simply be wiped clean   i suppose what can you expect for only          
97,5.0,                       great pan    takes a little longer to heat up  but i love it    nothing sticks   i pot a little unsalted butter in it  and nothing sticks    at  all best pan ever      
98,5.0,                       my new favorite pan  so light and easy to clean with the non stick granite coating  really like the wood grain handle as well      
99,5.0,                       so got these for the wife for x mas she really likes     
100,5.0,                       it does a great job of frying and is very easy to clean   i am about to buy it again in a larger size      
101,5.0,                       this a very well balanced pan on the stove  the handle is a joy to use  and the pan cleans with just water in a snap      
102,5.0,                       love the skillet and the price was great   easy clean and even heat distribution      
103,5.0,                       terrific pan  i use it almost exclusively  nothing has stuck or burned on  i wash and dry it after each use and take care to keep the surface from sharp objects  great investment   well worth the money      
104,5.0,                       i love these pans  i ordered the   different sizes  i use the largest and middle the most  i followed the directions to season the pans  they are non stick and easy to clean  i love there are no rivets in the pan that are hard to clean  recommend do not heat over medium heat  i find it gets too hot and things burn if you do  i have a ceramic flat stove top  they are so easy to clean i have not put them in the dishwasher  i have had them about a month  use them a lot      
105,1.0,                       food does stick     
106,5.0,                       non stick and strong     
107,5.0,                       i love my pan  it is fantastic  i learned to cook on a lower setting  but it retains heat well  i turn it off before my food is done and it finishes  cooking  there is no need to preheat before use as it heats  up quickly  i plan to buy  a larger skillet  the price is fair for the quality      
108,5.0,                       i just threw out a couple of teflon coated pans that had become scratched   not healthy to use and replaced them with a couple of these  they seem to be very sturdy   with good  attractive construction  only time will tell how well these endure over the long hall      
109,5.0,                       easy clean fast cooking no burning no sticking gorgeous set one con  handles get hot  o we all awesome set      
110,5.0,                       i was a little concerned seeing the surface but it is a great non stick pan  i did the break in procedure and the first time i used it wasn t impressed but after running it through the dishwasher its worked a lot better then  nd time would recommend and buy again     
111,1.0,                       finish is peeling off after    days  no longer usable for fear of ingesting finish  terrible     
112,5.0,                       i got rid of all of my other pans because this one s my favorite     
113,5.0,                       pan fried steaks come out perfect  best pan i have      
114,5.0,                       this is the  nd carote frying pan i have bought   like because while super easy to clean is is not scratched by plastic utensils   heavy enough to spread heat well  but not so heavy i can t lift it with one hand when full  an issue with cast iron pans    beats teflon pans hands down      
115,3.0,                       this frying was wonderful until the small amount of oil or butter you use keeps sweeping through the bottom onto the stove top making a burned mess on top  this happens in the same small spot on the bottom  this is the first frying pan i have ever used that nothing sticks to it even after     months  the finish is still like new  i followed directions for use and have never used high or even medium heat  somewhere in the process of sealing the finish failed that is why i gave it   stars  love the frying pan otherwise      
116,5.0,                       i ve only used the pan twice  but it is very nice   cleans easily      
117,5.0,                       used it a couple times already  i m loving it  since it s a different brand than i was looking for i thought i might not like it  it s a great purchase      
118,5.0,                       great pan   great for cooking eggs   super easy to clean     
119,5.0,                       so far so good       
120,5.0,                       i ve owned a lot of non stick pans in my life   this is the best  leagues better than any other  when i bought it i thought the handle was wood  it is not  it is some type of siliconized plastic  the handle cleans easily and is supposed to take     degrees f  just to name a few   i ve owned farberware  calphalon  t fal  cuisinart  oxo  the stupid green ceramic eco pan that lasted one use before it began to  stick   usually i get       months out of a pan before it s ruined  usually by a family member accidentally scratching it with the point of a knife   but the coatings on all of the other pans i ve owned seem  soft  and after a few months use  the surface has changed  water doesn t bead up on them   this coating is superior  i use it     times a day  and its just like the first time i used it  i also own a bunch of cast iron pans  but they are not very non stick when cooking acidic foods like tomatoes and tomatillos  this pan is  and i love it  it was on sale for     when i bought it  i did not get paid for this review      
121,2.0,                       ok for cooking but the handle material has to be made up of a heath resisting material different from the one it comes with     
122,5.0,                       just started used my frypan set and so far so good   delivers on all promises  i haven t put them on the dishwasher yet  i really like the way they look and they aren t heavy to handle but not flimsey  the handles not only don t get hot but they re easy to grip  i d recommend them for a low cost  solid cookware product     
123,2.0,                       the only positive thing about this non stick pan is that it s beautiful and affordable  my brand new pan  which i seasoned prior to use as suggested on the box  is not non stick at all  right off the bat eggs stick to the pan  a waste of money as i now have to buy another pan      
124,5.0,                       i bought this pan based on the reviews on amazon and found it to be exactly what they claimed   best pan ever      
125,5.0,                       i had gotten this a few months back  and it s a great basic pan  i use it to fry some eggs with a little bit of oil  and it doesn t stick at after months of frequent use  i highly recommend      
126,4.0,                       i was looking for something that performed some what similar to cast iron but with less maintenance  and it filled that need  not quite cast iron but a lot easier to clean      
127,5.0,                       best non stick pan i have ever owned   priced well      
128,5.0,                       nice to cook with  and easy to clean      
129,5.0,                       i love this pan   great quality        non stick     
130,5.0,                       this is the best skillet i have ever had  there is nothing i don t like about it      
131,1.0,                       terrible pan  do not buy  used it for a short time and coating rubs off on your finger   contacted seller for refund or replacement and got the run around  would be a zero star if that was a rating      
132,5.0,                       great product  super easy to clean and looks very nice as well  as long as you don t cook at super high temperatures  this looks like it will hold up nicely      
133,1.0,                       it is very dangerous to use this product   after using this frying pan for   months  one day when i was cooking  the lid of the frying pan just started to crack  all glass   with no reason   glass was not cold or anything like that   the frying pan and lid top on   was on the stove in the kitchen all day before use   be careful       
134,5.0,                       wow  really non stick  very comfortable handle  great looking      
135,4.0,                       food does stick     
136,5.0,                       this pan is sturdy  non stick and does not buckle with heat  the wooden handle feels right in my hand without wobble  i have been searching for a non stick that doesn t disappoint and i believe i found it      
137,5.0,                       easy to clean  cooks everything evenly from steaks to eggs      
138,5.0,                       great product and great price      
139,5.0,                       my girlfriend s old pan was warped and didn t heat well  this is a great pan  flat bottom  good anti stick  great handle     
140,4.0,                       i had a pan simiilar and loved it so i wanted to get another  in case  my original went bad  i am single and this is the perfect size and i love it      
141,5.0,                       i use a small amount of oil when cooking   easy cleanup   i really like it      
142,5.0,                       this is my go to pan  heats evenly  cleans up well  and has a distinctive look      
143,1.0,                       this is not a non stick pan  returning      
144,5.0,                       this is a great frying pan   the surface is durable  the heat is distributed evenly and cooks food well   i have had many other brands that just don t compare   all now in the garbage and this is the only brand i kept   i have     in each size      
145,5.0,                       over the years  i ve used many other nonstick pans with traditional nonstick coatings  even though i used nylon and wooden utensils  kept heat at medium temperatures  and stored the pans carefully  the cooking surfaces of these pans soon were damaged and discolored  the nonstick feature of the pans deteriorated far too soon  as well  the  carote   inch skillet is a perfect size for cooking smaller amounts of food   an omlet for one  a single burger  a couple slices of bacon for a blt  cut slices in half  the granite coating is holding up quite well  the pan is well built  i am very satisfied with this purchase     
146,5.0,                       for the money  this is as good as it gets  its easy to use and clean  evenly heated  and sturdy      
147,5.0,                       love  love  love this pan   heats evenly  cooks well  and  cleans up quickly      
148,1.0,                       this is what happened when i cleaned it  black dust coming off from the bottom and from the inside of the pan    seriously disgusting and probably toxic     
149,4.0,                       easy clean and well made  requires a little higher burner temperature setting to start cooking  no regrets      
150,1.0,                       can t hold on handles when u try to remove from my gas stove  tooooo hot      
151,5.0,                       love this pan  absolutely the best frying pan i have owned  won t use any other one  totally non stick and super easy to clean  eggs are cooked beautifully      
152,4.0,                       perfect little pan  does two eggs with no problem  slides right out of the pan on to the plate  just a quick wipe to clean it  love this pan      
153,5.0,                       absolute best purchase    i cannot recommend this pan enough and will absolutely be buying any and all for the set  everything cooks evenly and does not stick  it cleans so easy      
154,4.0,                       just received my new fry pan  it really is non stick  it is made very well easy wipe to clean  will follow up after use for a while  these ceramic pans all seem to work well when new  but this make has impressed me thus far shipping was slow  they are pushing the european pots from switzerland but they are made in china after several months of use i must say i love this pan   it is truly non stick cleans easily and still looks like new  i put th pan under the broiler  have done so before to briefly cook the top of the ritta  this time it was to near the broiler and it burned  i contacted the seller to find out how to get a replacement handle  no response  i know it has warranty and i have had it for about   months  very disappointed in seller      
155,3.0,                       so the only reason that i didn t give this a higher rating was because i had assumed that the inside of the pan itself was going to be smooth  i am not familiar with cooking with granite cookware   when i got it the inside was a little rough and slight abrasive   it reminded me of a cast iron skillet   it cooks really well but i kind of thought it was going to be something simple that didn t take as much care      
156,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have used this pan for about two months  i like it very much    inch is great size for breakfast  but i use it for all meals  it is cute  nonstick  safe and cool handle  comfortable  and heat up rapidly  by the way  i don t put it in dishwasher  it is just too easy to clean up by handwashing  sharing a picture of pan fried dumpling     
157,5.0,                       its a very good nonstick pan  i am using it for few days for eggs and absolutely no sticking easy to clean      
158,5.0,                       actually non stick without butter or oil  i did the oil as they suggest after washing the pan the  st time  but sofar food comes right off  priced fair      
159,5.0,                       i like it     
160,1.0,                       very poor sense of use     
161,1.0,                       horrible  used   time for a steak and cheese and the handle fell off trying to pick it up and snapped  food went all over the place  never buy this garbage      
162,5.0,                       i absolutely love this pan  it does everything it advertised  well built  non stick and great product      
163,5.0,                       i use for eggs and it s great     
164,5.0,                         eggs and a dash of milk  no spray or oil or butter  etc  love this pan  seriously is the best and it is truly nonstick   amazing  anything in the pan will wipe right out or really it just falls out        
165,3.0,                       i basically like this pan but there is a crack forming on the handle from the pan part outward after only a few week s use  that will definitely cut short the life of this pan      
166,5.0,                       love these pans   non stick and clean up beautifully     
167,5.0,                       i love this pan    it s quite beautiful  very light weight and incredibly non stick  the sides come up a bit higher than your average pan  a feature i like   so happy i chose this one      
168,2.0,                       i had first written a glowing review based on its overall appearance and look  before having used it  i pretty much cook myself daily for dinner an omelette which is more like a spanish tortilla than omelette  i e   made with egg whites and i mix inside all kinds of veggies and rice  so what i do  i flip it over  because it is thick  i don t fold it  i had been doing that with my old skillet which gave me no trouble but had started flaking on the outside something awful  and i made the mistake of throwing it away when i received this one  i tried every trick in the book and then some  but the  non stick  is not working  that is  i flip the omelette over with no trouble  but the final stage  which should be quick  always invariably sticks in the center  so i guess it s the skillet s fault  because come on  i have been cooking these tortillas daily over a decade or more  first with teflon and then stoneware skillets  and never a problem  problems started with this particular skillet  driving me crazy and frustrated  wherei should sit down to enjoy my meal in peace  so i ordered another brand skillet yesterday and hope to have better luck  or else i will have to change the menu         
169,3.0,                       this pan is of fairly light construction and mine soon warped upward in the middle  i like the coating  in the future i will spend a little more and buy a pan made thicker  especially on the bottom      
170,5.0,                       it seemed rough and i didn t expect it to be non stick   to my surprise it is actually non stick and even an only egg white omlette doesn t stick   it cooks evenly and is easy to maintain   i even like the feel of the handle   overall i am very satisfied      
171,5.0,                       works great  one time had minor sticking that came right off      
172,5.0,                       i ve had this pan almost four months   it looks as good as new   i use this pan for frying eggs mostly   it works wonderfully   does not stick and cleans up very easily      
173,5.0,                       i have two different sizes and love them both  this larger one with the glass lid is deep enough for a whole family meal  the glass lid has a hole for stem to escape which makes it great for steaming vegetables      
174,5.0,                       after reading negative reviews from people alleging they experienced problems with the non stick feature  i have found no problems whatsoever  the pan works absolutely great i ve cooked eggs  omelettes and chicken tenders in the three days since i ve had this pan  there is zero problem cleaning it afterwards  and if you heat properly  and add some oil or butter  there is no issues or problems with the non stick  also the heat is evenly dispersed  heats evenly and cooks very fast  update  oil or butter is optional as it still is non stick without  i would highly recommend this pan      
175,5.0,                       it cooks and cleans up really well   i do wish it was dishwasher safe   it is much lighter than it looks      
176,4.0,                       good pan it still has food stick to it but if you put a little oil it doesn t really stick any more     
177,5.0,                       this pan is amazing  i bought   to see and wow  now i m buying the entire line l  the handle is so smooth and the pan itself is super non stick     
178,5.0,                       i really like these pans  if you do as the instructions say  nothing sticks to them and they are super easy to clean  i got this set for my mom and i might get another set for myself      
179,1.0,                       garbage  i want my        back  i threw out  i am not using chinese made trash to cook food in      
180,5.0,                       good     
181,5.0,                       i would buy again        
182,4.0,                       not   stars cuz it came with a small chip on the edge but it still works fantastic  great purchase even with the chip      
183,4.0,                       this might be the best pan i have ever used   in fact i plan on buying more of them   they are so evenly heated and breakable  cooking is easier      
184,5.0,                       eggs for instance  if you use high heat and don t use a bit of oil butter spray then you may get some sticking  it cleans up very easy  but if you re making an omelet and hoping you can flip the thing without using some grease  prepare to be disappointed  i have never bought a so called  nonstick  item that truly can be used without some oil to have sticky things just slide out of the pan   that being said  this pan is super high quality  i didn t expect something this nice for the price  it s my every day egg pan  and i also use it for heating up small batches of food that i don t want to microwave   good quality for the price  small but useful heavy duty pan  i like it      
185,2.0,                       didn t work for me      
186,5.0,                       i luv these pans     
187,5.0,                       this pan is great for eggs  pancakes  grilled cheese  or sauteing veggies or anything else for one   it cleans easily and so far haven t had any issues with scratching  it s a solid  heavier  not cast iron heavy    will look to replace my next size up pan with this if it s available in the size needed      
188,5.0,                       i bought this for my spouse who  needed it   and by that i mean i accidentally burned the crap out of the oxo teflon     pan and need to replace it so he could effortlessly make scrambled eggs again  he struggles with the stainless steel set we have and wanted something easier to clean than the cast iron  it is the easiest to clean of all the pans i ve ever encountered in my entire life i got the     with the glass lid and am so pleased with it  it takes a couple minutes for it to preheat  longer than my stainless steel  and about the same amount of time as my cast iron  but that s no bother  my spouse does not preheat it and it still serves his purposes  but i wanted to see if i could brown some meat on it  hence the preheating and it was effective it appears to be very well made  i think we ll be holding onto it for years to come  it s also quite nice to look at      
189,5.0,                       such a great little fry pan  i use it every morning for my eggs and it works perfect      
190,2.0,                       this worked great for about a month or two then the non stick coating completely wore down  pan is borderline unusable now  do not purchase  spend extra money for a better pan     
191,5.0,                       my favorite pan by far  i love it  it cooks food nicely and the non stick is really great  i like how the handles feel  no  they re not wood  it says what they are in the description for this brand  i am now buying more of this brand because i love this one      
192,5.0,                       outstanding product  works great  looks great      
193,5.0,                       i ve had this pan for a while now  and it is absolutely aces  i followed the instructions on the label to season it when i first got it  and it has performed like a dream  first time i ve ever cooked eggs in a pan and just been able to tilt them out onto the plate  i ve followed the care instructions to the letter  and it hasn t let me down yet  would definitely recommend      
194,5.0,                       product excellent     
195,5.0,                       amazing pan  buying more      
196,5.0,                       i like this pan for cooking  much better than the one where the food sticks and is hard to clean      
197,5.0,                       when you first see and feel this pan  you ll doubt it can easily release your food  but it does  eggs come out as easily as they do on teflon  i especially like it because  a  i m not eating teflon  b  it s heavy enough to fully balance on the burner even when empty  and c  it s a breeze to clean  great price  too      
198,5.0,                       loveeeeeee this  nothing sticks to this pan     
199,5.0,                       i bought one for my son in law and he raved about it so bought one for my son for his birthday   they are both happy with these pans   now i m going to buy one for my husband and i      
200,5.0,                       i love that i can cook a hold breakfast with one pan       
201,5.0,                       easy to cleangreat small nonstick pan     
202,5.0,                       the ease of stirring my dish without it sticking  i made a scramble that was golden on the bottom and tasted great     
203,5.0,                       we use it almost everyday  sometimes multiple times a day  it heats evenly and cleaning is easy  use for stir fry   sauteing  browning  an everyday kitchen stable  the wooden handle is sturdy and doesn t get hot  the pan is eco friendly      
204,5.0,                       i only have pans  so far  but i ll probably be getting more  they ve become my daily goto skillets  the only drawback for some people would be the low     degree oven usage  but on top  they re the best i ve bought      
205,5.0,                       really easy to cleanfood doesn t stick but if it does it comes off really easy     
206,5.0,                       i tried one of those  as seen on tv  copper  nonstick  pans  within two weeks the copper pan had food stick to it worse than any other pan in the house  not so with the granite pan  i did my homework and found a pan that everyone seemed to agree is actually nonstick  it s      true  i don t do crazy things like placing caramel or cheese in the pan by itself  but i do make scrambled eggs with cheese  the cheese that came in contact with the pan came right out   i personally use butter in the pan for flavor  but i m  pretty sure the pan would still be nonstick without it  i recommend for anyone whose tired of scraping frying pans and for those who got suckered into buying an  as seen on tv  frying pan      
207,1.0,                       terrible     good stuck right from the get go   i thought it would be like on tv nothing would stick   boy were we wrong eggs stick all over the bottom unless we use pan spray   terrible pan   don t waste your money      
208,1.0,                       the only thing that doesn t stick is cold oil     
209,1.0,                       read carefully     the grey stone speckled coating is from switzerland    but otherwise it s made in china           
210,5.0,                       i had a bit of hesitation cooking eggs in this pan   solely based on reviews from other purchasers  firstly  the pan does not have a completely smooth surface which i have not experienced as problematic in any way  secondly  this pan is terrific for cooking eggs        
211,4.0,                       i never had a stone egg pan before this one   i bought it because it said it would work with induction  but it doesn t   i still have two regular burners  so it s fine   however   buyer beware      
212,4.0,                       expected it to be a bit bigger  but it works beautifully and truly non stick which makes my cooking so much easier      
213,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          should ve gotten one of these so much sooner  makes cooking so easy when you don t have to scrape stuff off every time definitely put a little bit of butter or oil in it at the beginning of cooking with it just to give it the extra advantage      
214,5.0,                       these are great  beautiful looking and well made  they aren t light and cheap  but sturdy and not overly heavy like cast iron   the only part i m not liking is they are turning brown on the inside bottom  which could be normal from cooking in them but they are really new and to be discoloring already is kind of strange   great non stick surface   nothing sticks  nothing      
215,5.0,                       great price  very durable     
216,3.0,                       please with the design but for the money i paid  i expected it to come without chips and half painted handles  debating on whether or not to send it back  yes  its usable but this should not have passed quality check      
217,5.0,                       this is the best pan ever  i rarely leave reviews but i had to come tell the rest of yall this is worth every penny  definitely will be purchasing more      
218,5.0,                       the nonstick surface works great  and i like the handles  they are comfortable to hold and don t get hot   only used a couple of days so time will tell     
219,5.0,                       beautiful to look at  comfortable handle  with stone non stick which has proven to be long lasting and the best in my experience  be sure to season the nonstick surface regularly by rubbing few drops of oil into the pan before use      
220,1.0,                       black residue is coming off the pan even after multiple washes and scrubs  this is a brand new pan even after heating oil as recommended there is still black residue  see pic the pic is probably the fifth piece of tissue how is this safe      
221,5.0,                       best no stick frying pan i have ever owned  my green coated pans were wearing out so i was looking for something new  so after reading many pan reviews i tried this carote grey granite coated     frying pan and really glad i did  cooks food well  browns chicken just right  made grilled cheese and clean up was fast and easy  seems to be well made and handle has a nice sturdy feel to it  i cleaned it with a sponge and hot water with dish detergent  don t use any abrasive scrubbers and coating should last for years  plan on buying more of these carote pans  highly recommended            
222,5.0,                       key is don t use too much heat  this pan distributes heat evenly and is good quality     
223,1.0,                       looks and feels really cheap  handle is bad and already change the color from the heat      
224,1.0,                       i have one same brand that i love but this one smells funny   i think its the handle plastic smell   i wouldn t buy again     
225,2.0,                       i would not call this a non stick pan  it is only non stick if you smother the pan in butter or oil   there is a rough texture to the pan  after some use  the handle that touches the metal part of the pan is turning brown from the heat and bubbling  junk      
226,5.0,                       very good  high quality      
227,5.0,                       in an earlier review  i panned the manual which was written only in chinese  after using this skillet several times  i am totally delighted and highly recommend it      
228,5.0,                       i bought this pan to replace our sadly worn out berndes pan   i love berndes but with   of us at home and   who cook daily  we needed a pan that could withstand over use and use by people who are not gentle with cookware  i wanted a pan that would not stick  could be cleaned while still hot  i mean  who has time to wait   and yet cook well   evenly and slowly  this pan does all that  i read many reviews in selecting it  we like it so much that i am buying the next size up too      
229,5.0,                       best cookware ever   heat evenly distributed  cleans up in a breeze   i literally  wipe the pan with a paper towel  which cleans off any residue from food   i want an entire set of this cookware      
230,5.0,                       really like it    it s a great product        
231,1.0,                       a fail non stick pan      
232,5.0,                       best pan ever  do yourself a favor and buy it  oh and i love the silicone handle      
233,5.0,                       i love it and i would buy more at this valuesend coupons     
234,5.0,                       had one for    years and nearly daily use caused coating to wear but pan still useful  i bought a replacement pan and very pleased  excellent heat distribution  doesn t warp  easy to clean      
235,5.0,                       we like the pan  it cooks well and cleans well      
236,4.0,                       it is non stick  but not teflon coated  i didn t have any complaints for the first month and a half  i made steaks in it like i always do  but this time     on my induction cooktop was too high and it burnt  not seared  my steaks  the inside of the pan is discolored because of it  i just made an omelette in it though  and nothing stuck      
237,5.0,                       what we have here is a premium piece of stone cookware  the second you unearth it from its packaging  if you care a whit about craftsmanship  you will be tempted to embrace it like your strong   stoic firstborn babe  get one of these sturdy zeniths of industrial design and two well seasoned cast irons  and your stovetop is set for life  this robust pan is exceptionally easy to clean   no sticking   and free of discoloration  no carcinogenic nastiness that we know of  very difficult scorch  though  of course if you really put your mind to it  you can  the only time i saw it take permanent damage was when it was left on an burner turned to max for approximately    min  even still  it was usable afterward   there s been no problem with quality of use it is somewhat convex   someone pointed that out with ire  oil pools in a little moat around the center  but the island is still close to sea level subject to flooding  i haven t found any pans like this that aren t that way  but maybe there s some secret utopia of perfectly flat pans known only to advance chefs inducted into the holy order of non convex cookware  frankly  i haven t been looking for this  so maybe it s more common than i think  either way  the pan isn t so convex that it s challenging to cook with  it cooks perfect eggs if you act as the brains of the partnership  it does still require you to do some of the thinking  but the bright side is that you aren t out of a job yet treat this splendidly crafted little pan with proper care   you shan t go wanting edit  it s been brutally scorched   times due to inane misuse and is still fully functional  the pan is very impressive  the cook  arguably less so  when this weary trooper is laid to rest under a little stoneware tombstone in the backyard  i will order   more just like it  there s no need to get any other sort of egg pan ever again  probably      
238,4.0,                       i ve had this    pan   months and it has to have butter or oil to be non stick  like all other pans that don t last  maybe i ve done something to it  never used spray oils or over heated the pan  unless washing it after i use it while it s still warm  i ll be trying yet another brand      
239,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          doesn t work for induction  i would return except i don t want to go out to return it in a pandemic      
240,3.0,                       not as smooth as regular non stick and we are having food sticking to pan      
241,5.0,                       i stopped buying teflon years ago and have struggled to find a pan that i could fry eggs in for my husband  it seems like they all start out fairly well but over time the eggs stick and tear up when trying to flip them  this pan worked very well and will only be used for eggs  we ll see how it holds up over time      
242,5.0,                       easy to use and clean     
243,3.0,                       don t expect this to be any more non stick than other other pan   spray it heavy with non stick oil or it sticks      
244,5.0,                       when i received this pan i wasn t sure that we would like it because it seemed too rough textured to cook eggs in however  after using it for a couple of weeks now  it s our favorite egg pan we simply use a little butter and eggs release perfectly  every time it is a reasonable price and shipping was fast      
245,5.0,                       excellent pan  so easy to clean  lightweight for arthritic hand      
246,5.0,                       wxcellent     
247,5.0,                       i needed a smaller fry pan with a lid  the pan is heavy  i only use it once or twice a week but good so far      
248,1.0,                       this pan is not non stick    even if i add oil of some type  stuff still sticks  i bought because it supposedly doesn t have all those bad chemicals that are on regular nonstick skillets  and i wanted nonstick  but i sure didn t get that part        
249,5.0,                       it did exactly what the website described it would perform after the proper treatment was applied  very little amount of oil needed to cook egg and breakfast meat  it did good job  good pricing for the size of the pan      
250,5.0,                       i d give this pan more stars if i could   it s very attractive  it s a good weight   cooks great      
251,4.0,                       i have learned to only give   star reviews for non stick pans because i have yet to buy one that doesn t start peeling within   to   months   i do all the up keep  and follow all the directions  but it still starts to bubble off   but this one  months in  is going strong   non stick and no peeling  but we ll keep a eye on it      
252,5.0,                       this is the best non stick pan  very easy to clean  i bought the     i will be buying another one in a larger size      
253,5.0,                       love this pan   the heat distribution  the super easy clean and it looks great too      
254,4.0,                       so far ggod eggs every morning come nicely  omelets same way  wipe it clean with dish towell  nice pan      
255,2.0,                       i really like the look and weight of this pan but it is not non stick   the price wasn t bad but i have had to purchase a real non stick pan as originally planned   will be donating this one to charity      
256,5.0,                       used several non stick pans but this one works     
257,5.0,                       high quality and beautiful     
258,5.0,                       this skillet is a great size for everyday use  breakfast  lunch  and dinner too bad it doesn t come with a lid      
259,5.0,                       pan is amazing  super easy clean up and the nonstick is great with no worries of teflon poisoning  great quality and craftsmanship  i m going to purchase the rest of my pots and pans from here      
260,5.0,                       awesome pan   eggs do not stick it      
261,1.0,                       the big surprise  disappointment  with this frying pan was the texture  it is billed as non stock and while that may be more or less true the rough surface is disturbing   food does adhere more than with a true smooth surface  and oil butter does not distribute as well as with smooth surfaces   we will pursue michelangelo brand items in the future  for the price  we find their performance and true non stick surface much better      
262,5.0,                       i was very surprised at the the performance of thisfrying pan  it s so easy to use to cook veggies  omelets  and bacon to name a few foods  the heat is not all centered in the middle  of the pan  therefore  all the food is cooked not just the middle and clean up is a breeze      
263,5.0,                       what a great product  a couple of months in and there is not a single scratch  even the bottom is still shiny  now i want a bigger one but didn t see one that is wither affordable or had good reviews as this one      
264,5.0,                       there were no instructions for cleaning   the food sticks even when i use oil and spray   it is awful   what a waste      
265,1.0,                       very disappointed  i ordered this item for my daughter because i loved it son much  it was delivered and i didn t open the box because i knew what it was  today i gave it to her and the item had no handle attached  i m not happy that i have to drive to another town to pick the item up and return it      
266,5.0,                       i love the gorgeous wood handle that makes it look expensive and it s comfortable to handle  love it      
267,1.0,                       scrambled two eggs and as soon as they hit the pan    i knew this was not a true nonstick pan   had to  soak  with hot water to release scraps that stuck     
268,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i don t know why they would send me an obviously bent misshapen defective pan  it s completely useless  will be returning it  what a waste of my time  the shipping box was in perfect condition      
269,5.0,                       so far my daughter loves this pan and her husband hasn t been able to destroy the finish  it seems to be as tough as they claim      
270,1.0,                       update after   weeks cooking eggs they stick  tried with oil and still they stick  wish i had ordered another brand     
271,4.0,                       it s actually pretty good  but i m finding the bottom is burning  not sure if it just the size of the pan only being   inches and my gas burner hitting the wrong spots      
272,1.0,                       i have requested for replacement and really hope the  nd one comes fine  but want to let buyers know that  when i initially opened the package and as i was washing the pan for the first time with soft sponge to prep for use  i felt   scratches dents on the pan s surface  please be cautious to check  fyi too that the pan came in a box with only a plastic bag around it without any care instruction or anything else      
273,3.0,                       to the left is my cats food dish  to the right is this tiny frying pan i ordered  i thought it was a full size pan but was surprised to see how small it was  it looks and feels nice though      
274,5.0,                       too small     
275,5.0,                       used it for the first time to seer halibut  no oils  no stick  wiped clean      
276,5.0,                       i absolutely love this pan  i follow directions and it cook the best eggs i ve ever had  i m going to be using it for a lot of things thank you very much     
277,3.0,                       you must use some type of oil  you can not just crack an egg and fry it like it says  i tried after following the directions but still sticks      
278,5.0,                       i have only used this pen a few times but so far it is working great     
279,1.0,                       when i first got it  it was okay   needed a decent amount of oil to cook eggs without sticking  but got the job done now a little over a month and change  the eggs stick as if i was using cast iron pan also  it doesn t look as clean anymore   looks dirtier than a non stick pan i had over   years even though i cleaned it properly i would highly recommend that you look for something else      
280,5.0,                       had this for a few weeks and so far it a fantastic fry pan  it is very easy to clean      
281,5.0,                       i really like this frying pan  nothing stick and is so easy to clean      
282,5.0,                       water does not even stick when you wash it  no need to dry  amazing pan and i figured it would just be average    i use it over all our higher end pans and skillets     
283,2.0,                       not induction compatible  had to return it      
284,4.0,                       good pan  does well to cook and easy to clean  but seems to not be flat     
285,4.0,                       nice size pan and very light  the wood handle looks really cool  too  i noticed a few scratches in the surface after opening  but didn t bother sending back  it hasn t impacted the cooking at all pan cleans up easily and is just as non stick as those poisonous non stick black pans      
286,5.0,                       best non stick frying pan ever a little oil in the pan and off you gocleanup is a breeze     
287,4.0,                       i really love it  it is beautiful and functional   it cooks wonderfully  great for eggs  pancakes etc  glad i purchased it   it is truly non stick and cleans up easily      
288,3.0,                       things do stick to surface     
289,5.0,                       non stick and easy to clean   very satisfied with this pan        
290,5.0,                       great for a quick sear on a particularly stringy calf muscle      
291,2.0,                       i m not a fan of class action lawsuits  but seriously  one should be brought against every company claiming that their pans are non stick  i m convinced that they use silicone facsimiles of fried eggs in those ads where they turn the pan sideways and the egg just slides right out  i ve tried copper  now this  and virtually every other one making these claims and they re all bogus  my beloved le creuset iron pan remains the closest thing to actually being non stick  the one i have has wooden handle and i just checked and apparently it s no longer made  my sympathies      
292,3.0,                       the pan works great and is a good deal for the price  my only issue is on my gas stove the flame hits the plastic handle and is causing the base of the handle to fail  its not really melting but small bits pop off if it gets too hot leaving the handle loose and pitted  i think it would work better on an electric range or a small gas range      
293,2.0,                       i have good quality nylon sponges  cleaning this pan destroys the sponge in no time  never had this experience before with any other nonstick pan  besides that  the nonstick property is below average so i had to return this      
294,1.0,                       i wanted to like this pan because it s pretty  but it isn t non stick  not worth it  sorry      
295,5.0,                       this pan is perfect for me  it cleans up so easily and absolutely nothing sticks  i plan on getting more in different sizes      
296,2.0,                       nice pan for gas or electric stove  solid aluminum   does not  work on induction cook tops as advertised disappointed      
297,5.0,                       so far i really like this pan only used it a few times ut it so far works perfectly very nice looking aesthetically i recommend it and will get more       
298,5.0,                       great     
299,5.0,                       wonderful product  i can t believe i waited do long to buy it  durable food cooks quickly because of even heat distribution   i ll be buying the other sizes too      
300,5.0,                       i love this pan   totally easy clean up  distributes heat very well  good weight  easy grip cool handle      
301,5.0,                       it is very good pan to cook things does not stick      
302,5.0,                       awesome pans in many different sizes  pretty to display in your kitchen  i own a food cart and they are used for many hours all day and night and still look brand new     
303,1.0,                       this pan was perfect when i bought it in september   it is now december and it is no longer nonstick   and i am using nonstick spray and food still sticks   burns   i have to scrape it clean   i am so disappointed       
304,5.0,                       several uses  i like it      
305,1.0,                       ok  i get it  teflon is bad for you  probably not good for the environment  but i have not found a suitable  non stick  equivalent to teflon  i mean  i love my cast iron  but that s not for every application  i was hopeful about this brand  and had intended to buy a set  thought i d start with just one pan and see what i thought  thoroughly disappointed first  i was very surprised that it isn t smooth  little white dots are a texture  but i moved on  the first couple of uses it seem to work just fine   fried an egg over medium heat no stick no residue nothing  but after the first few uses  it s poor quality quickly became apparent  the handle isn t wood but plastic and rapidly discolored  after about    to    uses it is now no longer any kind of non stick  i called this now full stick  what you see in the image is a couple of scrambled eggs cooked in some oil over medium heat   soaked pan in soapy hot water for four hours  this will require significant scrubbing  does not just wipe out   i am done here  the search continues      
306,5.0,                       excellent quality   do not be fooled by a chinese knockoff    this was less expensive and      better   will definitely buy additional sizes and highly recommend      
307,5.0,                       skillet or pan is easy to use and surprisingly light weight for it s design  some small pans that get good heat distribution are too heavy to use comfortably  this pan is light weight and produces good results it eliminates my concerns using it on my glass stove top  the handle being heat resistant is nice feature too  when i can throw my omelet in the oven in the same pan to keep eggs warm or to just finish melting cheese i cannot complain about my cookware  it is my go to pan for small frying on my stovetop      
308,5.0,                       i love the cooking in the pans  make sure you do the oil distribution before the first use  makes a huge difference  love how nice these are too      
309,5.0,                       love it     
310,5.0,                       great pan  had no issues     
311,1.0,                       does not work on my induction stove as indicated     
312,1.0,                       used every morning to cook eggs for breakfast  really liked the quality and weight of the pan  but non stick stopped working after   months of daily use  going back to kitchenaid teflon pan      
313,5.0,                       easy to use     
314,5.0,                       a nice non stick small frying pan   the handle stays cool   i ve used it about a month   so far  so good      
315,5.0,                       was as described      
316,5.0,                       love this pan    ordered the whole set as my husband loved it as well   so easy to clean  him  very even cooking surfaces  me      
317,5.0,                       awesome pans  i m super happy with the quality and ease of cleaning  we shall see how they test time but so far i m very pleased      
318,2.0,                       i really wanted to like this pan  i liked everything they claimed in their ad  however  after using it for awhile  it has ceased to be non stick  the outside surface is smoother than the rough inside surface  even with butter or oil  eggs stick to it  i only ever cook on low to medium heat so that s not the issue  i use no metal utensils with it  disappointed  must find another pan        
319,1.0,                       does not work on our induction cooktop      
320,5.0,                       we were on the lookout for a ceramic non stick pan for cooking indian dishes  paratha  chilla  omelette etc    this pan is perfect and is super easy to clean  i was surprised to see that you can prepare eggs on this even without a drop of oil   ghee   butter  this is a must for every kitchen      
321,5.0,                       this is our second pan it is well designed  easy to clean and lasts much longer than conventional teflon coated pans      
322,4.0,                       we had bought the smaller version quite a few months ago and we liked it  great size  cooks evenly  cleans up easily  worth the money  the four stars reflect the short time we have used the pan  we shall see how long it lasts     
323,5.0,                       i have two granite skillets and they are by far the best   nothing sticks   they are absolutely flat ensuring even heat distribution   because nothing sticks  they clean up with little or no effort      
324,4.0,                       this little saute pan surprised me with it s quality  heavy and non stick solid handle too      
325,5.0,                       love it  had to go on a special diet that would not allow any oil whatsoever w cooking so this pan came in very handy  just w a little broth   meat nothing stuck   very easy to clean   my whole family uses it so much i need another one  thumbs up for sure   value   price is spot on      
326,5.0,                       for the first week of use   it is amazing  however due to my experience of all kinda of work and pans  the honeymoon passed by pretty fast i will update few months later with my regular use      
327,5.0,                       this is a great non stick pan with excellent weight and heat distribution   it makes the most perfect grilled cheese sandwiches and eggs slide right out      
328,4.0,                       works well but does require some spray coating prior to use      
329,5.0,                       glad i purchased     
330,5.0,                    s per recomendado   f cil de lavar y nada se le pega me encanto           
331,5.0,                       guys this is the best cooking equipment around  can t burn anything  outstanding       
332,5.0,                       soft stay cool wooden handles and non stick coating not only make them functional  but they are also very stylish      
333,5.0,                       this pan is interesting  i ve never had one with a wooden handle before   but the handle is very comfortable and doesn t get hot   the pan is non stick and works well   it needs a little time to heat up first  then it cooks fast and evenly   i may get myself another size      
334,1.0,                       this is our  eggs only  pan and it works great  cleans very easily  i have to watch the handle because i have a gas stove and have already discolored it a tad where it connects to the pan      
335,1.0,                       missing product     
336,1.0,                       this pan is described as non stick  it is not a non stick  i used the skillet six times over three weeks to cook eggs  sliced ham  and a hamburger patty  i followed the directions that came with and found that i had to scrub it hard  each time with a soft sponge made for skillets such as this one  after six times of hand washing it there are spots inside that won t come out  plus  the bottom and exterior sides are stained and and the stains won t come clean  as i said  i followed the directions for cleaning  too  and i gave up  oh  and i almost forgot  the wooden handle is now loose where it attaches to the body of the pan  in my opinion this product is another example of european trash      
337,5.0,                       item exactly as described  even better quality than expected      
338,5.0,                       right when i got this i put it to the test day after day cooking every meal i ate  for a small size it s easy to get heat distributed all over for even cooking  and when you are finished it s just a matter of wetting the pan and wiping it down unless you put something really sticky on it my only complaint is that the wood handle is visibly burning and charring the more you cook  so you will see it turn blacker over time all in all  for the price and convenience i would continually purchase this and each larger sized pan from this brand  you can t go wrong here     
339,5.0,                       i purchased this pan specifically for cooking eggs  it works perfectly  i seasoned the frying pan per the directions when i got it  i often cook with no oil in pan and it just wipes clean  i will buy this brand again next time i need anoter frying pan  excellent quality  it looks great  and works flawlessly         
340,5.0,                       i highly recommend this product   i try to use my carote     pan every time i need to cook using my stovetop  i love the sturdiness of it and the wooden handle      
341,5.0,                       i wanted this small fry pan primarily for frying eggs in the morning   my old  non stick  pan had begun to stick  so i tried this one   it has worked beautifully   i just use a small amount of oil and it works like a charm   am considering buying the larger sizes as well      
342,5.0,                       just as advertised     
343,5.0,                       love these pans   i bought them for our rv and thinking about getting a couple for home   i think they cook better than my expensive pans  sooooo easy to clean      
344,5.0,                       we ve only had this pan for a few weeks but it s working beautifully on our electric stove   it probably helps that we are being extremely careful with it  highest burner setting we use is    out of      always have oil or something in the pan while it s heating up  allow it to cool fully before washing   food doesn t stick and cleanup is a breeze   i am hoping the dark grey speckled exterior will not discolor and handle will remain firmly in place  issues we have had with previous pans   time will tell        
345,5.0,                       these are the best pans i ve ever used  you don t have to worry that you re going to make the non stick coating come off because of the material it s made from  totally worth spending a little more  definitely get what you pay for      
346,5.0,                       took a chance on this pan as i never seen it anywhere  not on television  not in anyone s house  etc  i am happy that i did  this is everything and then some  it is classy for a pan  i want to buy a set  heats evenly and quickly  made my sausages fry with a crispy edge  scrambled eggs to perfection      
347,2.0,                       eggs stuck even with oil   once heated  handle emitted a plastic burning smell that turned the handle yellow   i noticed after washing it  it started blistering and cracking on underside of handle  smell from burning really detracts  if i m not ingesting something poisonous i sure am inhaling it   will be returning   i expect more for the price i paid      
348,5.0,                       this pan heats quickly and cooks evenly  clean up is super easy  i will be purchasing additional sizes      
349,5.0,                       non stick  very easy to clean  durable and very nice appearance      
350,1.0,                       it is non stick for food but not for oil  first use  i could not get the oil off after thorough cleaning  thought of a second try  used it and could not clean the oil off  returned as there is a chance of food contamination thanks to the stuck oil it was probably a defective one      
351,1.0,                       i ve only had this pan about two months and it s already sticking horribly     
352,5.0,                       love the quality and thickness of the metal  it feels solid and lightweight  the handle stays cool to the touch  will buy again     
353,4.0,                       did scrambled eggs without sprays or oils   didn t stick   the only issue i have is that the handle was loose upon delivery      
354,5.0,                       everything about the carote skillet i really like  its really easy to clean  it s  fantastic   thanks       
355,5.0,                       love this pan     
356,5.0,                       this is the best of all the cooking pans i have had  it is attractive  well constructed  the handle won t come loose and is heat proof  everything i have ever cooked or burned in this pan came off without a hitch  after months of use the pan is still like new  higher priced pans can t compete      
357,3.0,                       not non stick pan  at first use i cooked with some oil and was good  next day i cooked without oil and eggs sticked i now only cook with oil  food sticks a little bit but its kinda easy to clean after  would recommend some other pan for real non stick oil free cooking     
358,5.0,                       better than i thought it would be  not flimsy at all  easy clean      
359,1.0,                       product stopped being non stick within a week  bottom all scratched after one week use on glass top range     
360,5.0,                       no complaints  this frying pan works great     
361,5.0,                       so far this has been the best nonstick frying pan we have bought   great heat distribution  easy to clean and for my money a great value   that said  i have a       inch carote pan skillet that quickly became not quite so great as the cooking surface turned brown    after just a few months of use    that said  i have replaced it with another       inch skillet from carote with the hope that the discoloration  was a fluke      
362,5.0,                       recently i have been making lots of omelettes with fresh eggs from my chickens and i wasn t sure i d like this pan  or that it would work ok considering the low price point  but i decided to try it  and i love it  makes a great cheese cracker  and a great omelette  it is a bit too bumpy for a good crepe  so i wouldn t use it for that  but excellent for omelettes  it does pop when it is cooling  but so far there has been no damage to the material  and it washes easily  it looks very cute as well      
363,5.0,                       this little skillet is awesome  it heats evenly  and clean up is a breeze  will buy the next size up next      
364,5.0,                       i like this heat distribution     
365,5.0,                       i love this pan  i originally bought it to start alternating my breakfast and  on occasion  having an egg for breakfast instead of cereal which has been my go to breakfast for years  i have used it a lot since then and i m very pleased with it  eggs and other food cook more quickly in it than they do in my other  copper pan  it s also extremely durable and i don t have to worry about using it on a hot stove as i do with my other pan it s also very easy to clean  no matter what i occasionally burn into it  my other pan has a coating  that wears off  that i have to be very careful cleaning  not so with this pan  whatever it s mad eof makes it easy to clean but if you do have to scrub a little you can do so without worrying about scraping the non stick coating off  this pan doesn t have a non stick coating  it just doesn t stick      
366,5.0,                       very easy to clean and love the sizes      
367,1.0,                       says suitable for induction but that is untrue  had to return      
368,5.0,                       good product  does what is said     
369,3.0,                       the pan is wonderfully put together   however  non stick   no  it sticks  a lot i ve used nothing then has to used butter and olive oil to get it to not stick  unfortunately not perfect not great  just ok but the pan is really nicely put together  that i do like      
370,5.0,                       after is seasoned it per the clear instruction    i made a spaghetti sauce  it never stuck and the meat in the sauce never burned  simmered perfectly  and clean up was a breeze   it s pricy but worth it big time    this pan will be an outstanding generational pan      
371,1.0,                       it is nothinglike nonstick  i used this pan for the first time this morning and tried with eggs  it sticks totally like    year old pan  so disappointed       
372,5.0,                       i needed a little pan for frying an egg  wow  great pan  love the feel  fantastic surface  doesn t stick and easy to clean  loved it so much  i bought a larger one      
373,5.0,                       exactly as promoted  super non stick and easy to clean  bonus that it s oven safe to     degrees      
374,5.0,                       great pan love it     
375,5.0,                       perfect for frying a few eggs  good non stick surface      
376,5.0,                       literally the best pan i ve had in years  the price was so affordable and worth it  and so far everything i ve cooked in it has come out the perfect temperature and amazingly good quality  no sticking or burned food at all  and it is super easy to clean as well  also it looks so nice  love the design      
377,1.0,                       this pan is advertised as being induction capable  this item is not induction capable  tried this on my duxtop counter unit multiple times  my duxtop uint was giving me error codes and shutting down within   seconds   i am giving this item one star for false adverting      
378,5.0,                       love it just don t stack with other pans i put a towel between them still going strong     
379,5.0,                       this pan takes a little longer to heat up because it s thick  but it heats very easily  nothing sticks to it  and it cleans quickly  i would highly recommend this and will be buying the larger pan as well      
380,5.0,                       awesome pan for the money   read other reviews   who cares about slight discoloring of the handle  if that even happens   keep stove top at medium or below and you won t have a problem with this pan   i m using a gas range and haven t had any issues with the pan whatsoever   i ve used it for two months now  still looks like new   if someone says they use their burner on med or below and they have issues with warping  peeling or anything else  they probably have the wrong gas fitting in their stove   probably running a natural gas fitting while burning with propane   much hotter than medium or lower on a stove setup properly      
381,5.0,                       i was looking for an easy clean smaller pan to make grilled cheese sandwich or scrambled eggs  this pan has exceeded all my expectations  heats quickly  cooks evenly and cleaning it is a five second task   i absolutely love it and can t recommend highly enough      
382,5.0,                       appears to be top quality     
383,5.0,                       its easy to use   clean and store away     
384,5.0,                       works amazing     
385,5.0,                       great pan  something about the texture makes it very easy to clean  especially when making pancakes      
386,4.0,                       great nonstick pan  heavy  handle stays cool  only prob  insert says dishwasher not recommended  that keeps me from full enjoyment of a good skillet      
387,5.0,                       i love this pan so very much  i make eggs on it every morning  eggs do not stick to it at all  i can just wipe it clean when i m done  it s so simple  i read reviews and was hesitant  as some reviewers stated that that eggs stuck to it  i think they may have not heated it correctly  because i ve had absolutely no issues  makes great eggs with just a light spray of oil  i deserved this pan and you do too      
388,5.0,                       i just started using this pan and i m glad that i purchased it  it s got great weight and the size is perfect for when i make breakfast or any meal of the day for my family of four  the non stick skillet makes everything from eggs to hashbrowns from getting stuck and burning on the bottom of the pan  non stick pans will never last forever  but you have to always find the best value for the longest lasting pan  great purchase      
389,5.0,                       these are great for inexpensive pans      
390,5.0,                       i love these pans   so easy to cool with and clean   i purchased several as gifts too      
391,5.0,                       great non stick pan   easy to clean   excellent heat distribution   food cooks faster   love this    inch pan      
392,5.0,                       the best pan  truly non stick     
393,5.0,                       fits into my selection of pans     
394,5.0,                       good next generation nonstick pan and even heat distribution on induction cook top      
395,5.0,                       best pan i ve had to date and heats evenly throughout with easy cleanup     
396,5.0,                       the best pan i ever had and i have a lot in last    years ranging between     and          
397,5.0,                       the right size for cooking   jumbo eggs      
398,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          these skillets and sauce pans perform as advertised   non stick   easy clean up   i followed the instructions with a little oil or butter in the pan as it warms up   you can see by the video i posted that the fried egg slides around easily   very easy to clean up  i hand wash them  i bought   of them in different sizes  they look great in my kitchen  my only criticism is that i need a skillet larger than the largest offered and also sauce pans larger than   qt   i had to keep my stainless steel sauce pans and a huge nasty teflon pan for big jobs         
399,5.0,                       love the quality of the product  excellent heat distribution  non toxic and non stick  it s a great set  the next test will be how long they last but they seem very durable      
400,5.0,                       i wanted a small frying pan that was easy to use  clean and didn t need to heat up the kitchen to use   it is the perfect size for me to cook a single serving      
401,5.0,                       i ve never tried a pan with this kind of coating  usually preferring stainless steel  but i thought i d give it a try  so far it s been perfect  it cleans up well  it has a nice weight and heats evenly  and i love the handle one thing that i hate in a frying pan is if the bottom isn t flat  which is what happens to all the cheap ones  so far so good on this one   i use it on a glass topped stove and it s dead flat still  at one point i was frying some chicken and got called away for about    minutes  during which the oil burned off  the pan got very hot and the kitchen filled with smoke  stupid me  i know   cleaning up afterward was still a breeze  a little soak in soapy water and the black came right off  pan still looks like new  and still dead flat      
402,5.0,                       the handle on this pan is amazing  extremely comfortable to hold and gives off the appearance of real wood  the pan heats up nicely and is perfect for browning meats     
403,1.0,                       worked great for the first couple of weeks  only use the pan for making scrambled eggs for the kiddies  eggs now stick to the pan like glue  first time using this type of pan and followed all the instructions  would not recommend      
404,5.0,                       so far i have been really careful with this pan  cooking with moderate to medium heat  and i really like this pan      
405,5.0,                       when you feel bottom of this pan it s  textured so i thought it might not be   non stick   to the contrary chefs of the world  the pan is not only non stick but you don t need oil or butter except for flavoring if you prefer  love big wooden handle and weight of pan  love it      
406,1.0,                       would like to resolve this problem  my husband wanted the small fry pan but we cannot get it to heat on the induction as it was advertised   the company has been very good but unable to communicate properly that it was the small pan only and the new one they sent also does not heat on the induction as it was advrtised  only the small fry pan has the problem      
407,4.0,                       i love the looks of the pan  but it is not as non stick as it claims  the surface is textured  so occasionally my egg sticks to the pan  i will continue to use the pan  but i probably would not choose it again      
408,5.0,                       durable and lightweight  easy cleaning     
409,5.0,                       perfect for fish or steak cooking due to the tick pan bottom and holding the equal spread of the heat  very good kitchen addition      
410,5.0,                       a two hundred dollar non stick pan needs oil  butter  or something to keep anything truly non stick  no exception here  so far  this pan is working great after everyday use for a month  no warps  no sticking  and if you have gas you ll have good even cooking  not so much with electric burners  as with most non stick  try to avoid high heat for prolonged times  heat your pan first  use evoo or butter  put your food in the pan and don t move it around until it cooks a little  then flip and so on  i  ve bought     cuisinart non stick pans and they last about   years  so we ll see how this granite stone pan holds up over time      
411,3.0,                       the pan was easy to clean but the surface isn t that smooth  food seems to stick to the surface and makes it difficult to flip food nice weight to the pan      
412,5.0,                       i really like this pan  it s covered with rock  is that right  foods taste better  one reason might be you don t need to put the heat on full blast as with other non stick pans  medium heat is all you need because it heats well all over  and fast  you are forced to treat it with respect because when you wash it  you can t scrub the suds off hard with bare hands  the surface being  gritty   also  you know  with other standard non stick pans  if you like to rinse the pan before putting in the oil  the water always remains so the oil splatters  well  with this rock pan  you shake it and every drop of water comes off  and when you fry something  you don t need to put in as much oil  of course the main thing is how long this pan will last  but i am happy with it now for the main reason that foods just taste better  i made korean scallion pork flour  pancake  on it  and it came out far better than on a standard non stick pan      
413,5.0,                       this is my   go to  pan for all my small meals   it s a heavy pan  and easy to clean   wish i had this a long time ago          
414,5.0,                       love it  no stick and easy to clean     
415,5.0,                       we use this on our induction  great small pan to whip up breakfast      
416,1.0,                       we bought this skillet less than   months ago  and we really liked this  use it daily to scramble eggs   but today the handle started chipping   very disappointing given the short time we had it      
417,5.0,                       nice product  works well      
418,1.0,                    fatl no me gusto para nada el aceite se le filtra entre el mango y el mismo saten se pone todo pegajoso y se puso amarillo         
419,5.0,                       love this pan  very good heat distribution  super easy clean up      
420,5.0,                       does the job and easy to clean  there is no downside so far      
421,5.0,                       i like the thickness  it heats evenly and the nonstick works great so far  i m careful with the utensils i use with nonstick  will have to wait and see how it holds up long term but so far i really like it      
422,5.0,                       love this product      
423,5.0,                       very good     
424,1.0,                       don t buy this pan if you want non stick  i followed the instructions and my eggs got stuck  i had have multiple pans so of different materials  so is not luck of experience  if u are willing to put a ton of butter and oil this is your pan     
425,1.0,                       this product         got pock marks in it about two months after we received it  we ordered a lid         for it about four weeks after we ordered it  so we are out about        in addition to the ruptures on the pans surface it always looked dirty  i m very disappointed and wouldn t buy a product again from that manufacturer      
426,5.0,                       it s a wonderful fry pan  heats evenly  non stick  heavy duty  thicker than comparable granite stone cookware   cleans easily   wooden handle is solid and sharp looking  nice heavy bottom  great pan      
427,5.0,                       this is the best skillet we have ever owned  great to cook with  easy to clean  absolutely a five star product      
428,5.0,                       i was skeptical of the quality because of the low price but turned out to be amazing      
429,5.0,                       i love it  my favorite egg pan     
430,5.0,                       i love these pans  very cute and sturdy  easy to clean  i have them in multiple sizes      
431,5.0,                       this is an outstanding pan and an outstanding brand for the price  this is the second pan of this brand that i ve bought  the other pan is a smaller one  food does not stick to this pan  it heats evenly  easy clean up  i love it      
432,5.0,                       these are the two pans i use daily   they are excellent  but follow the suggestions about how to use them   they are great at low and medium temps   those are the two i use   using a dab of oil is recommended   do it they are also terrific with the lids on   i often use them to prepare both fish  meat and vegetables with a dab of liquid and closed lid these pans clean up with a little water and a cloth to clear any matter left      
433,5.0,                       my    year old mom diddn t like it s looks  so se gave it to her lesbian neighbor in the original box making clear that it was  a re gift   she loved it        
434,3.0,                       no longer had nonstick qualities after a couple of uses     
435,4.0,                       this     skillet is nice   the only thing   make it   b better   would b a lid with it

449,5.0,                       this little   inch skillet is truly non stick   i ve cooked scrambled eggs and cornbread in it so far   i like the bakelite handle  too   the price was great  too      
450,3.0,                       great cooking utility but coating is not great  used it around    times and now it started absorbing color from the food i cook and will not go off      
451,1.0,                       why do you say it works on induction when it does not   didn t work on mine   take that wording off it  otherwise  for a normal stove top it is a nice pan      
452,5.0,                       very pretty skillet   great size as most of my stainless steel cookware are also    in diameter we ll see how it holds up long term but so far loving the design and cleaning convenience      
453,1.0,                       i bought this pan because of the title from switzerland  and when i received it it says made in china  i guess the coating is from switzerland  very misleading      
454,3.0,                       followed instructions for prepping the product first use revealed some issues  wooden handle scorched immediately  which raises the question  why wood   looks nice but burns also  when cooking eggs  one side much hotter than the other      
455,5.0,                       love the size  sides high enough to be able to use for one dish meals for        
456,5.0,                       their is nothing not to love about this pan  except it does not wash itself   i m buying the set     
457,5.0,                       i love this product line  i have all of the skillets and need to buy the pots next  i don t have a sticking problem in this pan at all      
458,1.0,                       i ve been using this for   months  only for eggs a few times a week cleaning is very difficult  the coating along the rim on bottom inside is gone  worn down just by using plastic pan scrapers to clean pan      
459,3.0,                       i order the wrong side  but kept it because it s perfect for making a single egg  and lays even in the stove  i have problems with oils running to the edges of the pan  however not with this one     
460,5.0,                       we absolutely love this frying pan  i can t say enough about how much we like it   i especially love it for omelets  already told several people and they bought it too      
461,2.0,                       the pan came to us with a clear dent in the side   i ll not be able to use a lid on this pan  i won t be returning it however because i just hate going through the process of it all   the pan is great other than the damage done to it      
462,2.0,                       used for frying eggs        
463,5.0,                       super easy to clean and durable      
464,5.0,                       sits on the burner right   nice pan for the money     
465,5.0,                       it works very well and is easy to clean      
466,5.0,                       great nonstick pan  not as heavy as a cast iron skillet  but a little more weighted then a light aluminum pan  absolutely nothing sticks inside of these pans and they look great as well  would love to have a whole set of these  and there is no coating that will peel off eventually as so many high end nonstick cookware does  which is so much more healthy and safe absolutely love the pan      
467,4.0,                       i m not      sure how non stick this is  the texture on the inside of the pan is not smooth and i think that s what confuses me  is the food sticking or is it just the textured pan  i haven t used it more than a handful of times  i think i like it but will have to try it with different foods to see how it holds up  i do love the handle  it doesn t get hot and it looks nice      
468,5.0,                       i was looking for a small fry pan  something that could do   eggs or a piece of chicken  cure the pan before use    it heats up nicely  cooks evenly and is easy to clean  might buy another pan in a different size  happy with this purchase      
469,5.0,                       love it  it s not heavy and eggs don t stick   great fir making tortillas  better than a cast iron or stainless steel pan      
470,1.0,                       i own other brands of similar nonstick frypans that are great  this frypan is terrible   it is not nonstick   i wash it over and over   and when i wipe it it gives off black on the dish wiper     the company only gives    days to return   i am stuck with a lousy product      
471,4.0,                       the pot is so amazing the quality is very good      
472,5.0,                       i love this pan  i can use it for everything and the clean up is fast and easy i ve used it lime    times and it s still going strong  no scratches  it s really the only pan i use in my kitchen now       
473,4.0,                       started out good but has gone down hill fast     
474,5.0,                       this pan is excellent   easy to clean  it never burns and is truly a nonstick pan  i use it just about everyday and no problem   you must follow the instructions after each use  use mild dish detergent to clean  and once dry rub a little oil in the pan  this keeps it to stay nonstick  and use non metal utensils   it heats up quick  i ve  baked  fried  boiled and months later it s still nonstick  i love this frying pan  best investment in a frying pan i ve ever made      
475,5.0,                       i bought the   inch pan to try it before buying a whole set and it has passed the egg test with flying colors  over crowded thr pan with   eggs over medium heat  threw a lid on for a minute and no jokes  flipped them with no issues     had   over easy eggs  definitely looking into getting an entire set      
476,5.0,                       if you take proper care of her  she will be the best pan in your kitchen artillery      
477,3.0,                       i cooked egg s in this pan twice and they stuck to the pan each time  i tried a little oil and they stuck to the pan  the pan is very roughly sprayed with ceramic  it s almost like you want to take sandpaper to it to make it smooth  the pan cooks well if you don t mind scraping all of the stuck stuff out to clean it  i was disappointed with it because i wanted a pan that would not stick  i will not buy this pan again      
478,5.0,                       but   pretty good   i rub the steak with a little olive oil then cook over medium high heat   maybe a little less than medium high           
479,5.0,                       non stick  easy to clean   good price compared to local big box that tried to sell it to me at  x the price     
480,2.0,                       nice pan initially  non stick quickly became stick  we still use it but need lots of pam  amazon should group this pan with pam     
481,5.0,                       absolutely the best nonstick pan i ve ever used  i also think it s the least expensive nonstick pan i ve ever bought  if i could give it more stars i would      
482,5.0,                       great quality  used it for several months and often with oil  still remains non stick     
483,3.0,                       i loved this pan for a year  up to very recently  now all the nonstick coating is gone and my food gets burnt all the time from sticking to the pan  also heat doesn t get equally distributed anymore  so i have to buy a new set of frying pan now which is annoying  but if you are looking for a cheap  functioning pan for short term  this is a great one      
484,5.0,                       this did not come with a lid  i had to order a universal lid separately      
485,3.0,                       ummm    not sure if it is a good thing that it heats up fast  ive used this only   times on low heat and its already burned      
486,5.0,                       heats well  cleans easily  and handle stays cool     
487,5.0,                       i brought the pan because of the price   wanted to see how good it was   i fell in love    everything they say it can do  it does   easy clean up   gets hot evenly  and fast   i am going to purchase the rest  because of the performance of this one pan      
488,5.0,                       good     
489,5.0,                       bought for its non stick properties just for frying eggs  cooks them to perfection      
490,5.0,                       i hesitated momentarily but then decided to try it   so glad i did  it s now my favorite pan      
491,5.0,                       i love these coated pan i ve used several brand and i really enjoy this one for the easier grip on the handle  to clean these you just wipe them out with a small bit of soap with little effort  you can use less oil in these pans as food doesn t get stuck  also perfect price for something that will last a good amount of time with good minimal care      
492,5.0,                       this is phenomenal  i live it  i ordered   more pots and pans  and the craftsmanship is excellent   my kitchen noe has a new set of pa s     
493,5.0,                       i bought this and the pot with lid  i think it s great  non stick works great with eggs and other foods  easy to clean by hand washing it with gentle sponge or cloth don t use these or any other non stick pan with high heat  for high heat use cast iron or stainless steel  use these on low to medium heat also don t put any non stick pans in dishwasher   hand wash them and they will last longer and stay in great condition      
494,2.0,                       good model  but too small for me     
495,4.0,                       the only downside is the handle is a little loose and these are hand wash only  i would purchase again      
496,5.0,                       this is the best looking and best performing non stick pan ever   literally   months of daily use and nothing has stuck to it ever      
497,5.0,                       the pan is wonderful  it is a tad heavy and so if you are weak avoid it  i fried salmon in olive oil on medium and no stick or burns  yummm      
498,5.0,                       i love this pan  gives a great sear on my steaks  very easy to clean too      
499,5.0,                       i don t use this to sear food   that s what cast iron is for  this is a great pan for the price      
500,5.0,                       very sturdy and no stick  great for everyday use like fried eggs and meats  easy to wash off      
501,5.0,                       i m disappointed that the product does not include the lid  i don t see a lid to be purchased separately  i liked it as i used it immediately  it cleaned well   but how do i get a lid now      
502,5.0,                       nice purchase   pan is small and sturdy   good looking pan also      
503,1.0,                       worst non stick pan i ve ever bought  i got it yesterday and tried it for the first time this morning  my eggs did not slide out of the pan like it does in the pictures  instead of over medium i ended up with scrambled because they were stuck to the pan  false advertising all the way this pan is stick not non stick  so far it looks like a waste of money      
504,5.0,                       second pan from this company   i bought one just for omelets   i love how it cooks  cleans and looks   great value     
505,5.0,                       very sturdy and does not stick my food      
506,5.0,                       i purchased this skillet on may           i have used it at least once a day since i received it  i mostly prepare eggs in it  it does a great job  it heats evenly  cleans up great and the handle is very comfortable to hold  i only hand wash it as it stated in the care directions and i don t use any metal spatulas on it  it still looks new  i would like to have a larger size skillet just like it      
507,5.0,                       i love this pan  even heat distribution  non stick  great for one person      
508,5.0,                       my family s favorite pan  excellent quality  the wooden handle is always cool even when the pan is hot      
509,5.0,                         months non stop frying including cheese and eggs no sticking  cooked evenly

512,5.0,                       wonderful little frying pan  so sturdy and easy to clean      
513,5.0,                       this is the best pan i ever owned non stick and the easiest pan to clean you can just wipe out most stuff or just give a light rinse     
514,1.0,                       my new granite  non stick  pan arrived yesterday  couldn t wait to fry a couple eggs this morning this product was a miserable failure  it s not possible to have been a greater disappointment      
515,4.0,                       i ve made eggs and grilled sandwiches so far and it works perfectly  non stick  easy cleanup  and the wood handle is so comfortable      
516,5.0,                       i use it for two eggs   that s what i bought it for i ve never experienced the  stone  anti stick surface before  but it works well the fake wood handle is cheesy   they could have done better artistically  but it s functional      
517,5.0,                       so good     
518,5.0,                       great pan  very good value as well  happy with my purchase      
519,5.0,                       this is the best plan i have ever used  the only thing i would pay attention to is that be careful cutting or scrapping anything on the surface  it scratches easy and wears off the finish also  when you cook  cook on low medium settings  so you don t destroy the pan      
520,5.0,                       perfect size for making     egg omelet      
521,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i used it and liked it a lot   the pot is just perfect      
522,5.0,                       i ve had this pan for a week or so now and i loveeee it   i ve made scrambled eggs every morning and didn t have to spend    minutes scrubbing egg off my pan   i d      buy this again       
523,5.0,                       solid pan  so good  in fact  i bought another just so i can do multiple large frying simultaneously if needed  easy to clean  durable  and reliable      
524,5.0,                       been using it for a couple months now and i love it  the nonstick is still nonsticking  it is a good size for cooking large meals  the handle doesn t get hot  what more could one want for that price point  it s incredible      
525,5.0,                       love           
526,5.0,                       it works really well  good price  we bought two and love them      
527,5.0,                       it heat perfectly and food do not stick  easy to clean     
528,5.0,                       the heat is evenly distributed in this frypan  it is the best frypan i have bought in a long time      
529,4.0,                       this is a great product overall  the problem is i have an induction stove  this skillet takes forever to cook on induction  which i don t like   however  everything comes out great  so  it s a love hate relationship  highly recommend for those who don t have induction  and somewhat recommend for those who do  as long as you re patient   very good quality  and extremely easy to clean  no sticking whatsover      
530,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift to my brother   he absolutley loves it      
531,5.0,                       love it  true no stick      
532,5.0,                       love this pan  all descriptions are right on point  best non stick pan i ve ever had      
533,5.0,                       i love these pans  i started with trying one and have been adding to my collection ever since  i see a lot of knock off products in stores   they look the same as these but are a completely different quality and material  these are great  long lasting  and keep heat in the pan      
534,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                       obviamente que para el primer uso necesita un poco de aceite  en este caso tiene     teaspoon de aceite de oliva y como pueden ver no se pega nada  en un futuro cuando el sart n est  curtido no se necesitar  grasa de ning n tipo           
535,1.0,                       the non stick coating isn t really non stick  unless i have a defective one      
536,1.0,                       no non stick   anything fried sticks to the pan   like fried eggs   i don t recommend this pan if you need something non stick      
537,5.0,                       cool  i really liked the supper pan         
538,4.0,                       have only used the small pan so far but after   uses making eggs the handle is already showing signs of discoloration      
539,5.0,                       i like it      
540,1.0,                       used pan regularly for last few months  pan looks and performs great at first  we use only silicone and bamboo utensils in the pan  not a scratch to be found but we already noticed foods sticking to pan even with the use of oil or butter      
541,3.0,                       food items stick to pan  i know my way around the kitchen  it s always better to use low heat when preparing food unless you are braising  even at low heat eggs  pancakes etc stick  these pans are best suited for campfire cooking in my opinion n     
542,5.0,                       great looking pan for morning eggs  a quality product with a good feel to it      
543,2.0,                       when i cook eggs in it they stick like a suction cup  if you put a quarter stick of butter then cook eggs you have a better chance they wont stick but they still do     
544,5.0,                       this is the greatest skillet i ve ever owned  my cooking has improved because it s absolutely non stick and so easy to use  i barely need butter  fantastic value  i recommend the whole set        
545,4.0,                       we bought the     fry pan and noticed you must use a setting of   or   to brown food  to cook scrambled eggs you need a setting of    the pan must have weak magnets   our induction cook top is a bosch      
546,5.0,                       this is exactly what i was looking for  non sticky   sturdy and   heat efficient      
547,1.0,                       bought this  seasoned it as the instructions said  worked alright for the first couple of times  now is very difficult to clean and everything sticks to it      
548,5.0,                       love it  soooo easy to clean     
549,1.0,                       ignore any review on here that s under a few months  within several months this pan will no longer be non stick  even worse it will lose its non stick coating exposing you to the chemicals from which the pan is made  made in china   i emailed the company to ask if it was still safe to use and received no response   this tells you everything you need to know    about both the pan and the company selling this      
550,2.0,                       barely non stick  just go to homegoods  better pans at lower prices      
551,5.0,                       this pan is great  none of my food has stuck to it  one day i burnt a little food far there and it turned brown but just slid off like nothing  worth the money      
552,5.0,                       unlike that lying  chef  daniel green s pans  these are actually non stick      
553,4.0,                       second pan from this maker  i m sure it will perform as good as the first  however  i m not happy with the substituted  turner  that i received  the one in the item page is nicer      
554,5.0,                       my wife and i have some sort of egg egg whites turkey sausage bacon every morning  our pan was very old so i thought i d give this one a try   she has been so happy with this pan  as am i  even heat distribution and a breeze to clean  we will purchase more in different sizes      
555,2.0,                       after a week of use i m unclear how other reviewers state this is non stick  i ve cooked an egg without any oil and it not only sticks but burns to the surface  i ve cooked eggs with oil and it sticks to the pan at any nook where there isn t any oil  quality pan  yes  even though the first use a bad smell emanated that i isolated to be the glue between the handle and the pan itself  could i have a bad pan  am i so conditioned to teflon pans that are far superior for non stick that i don t appreciate this unique pan  i don t know  i m disappointed      
556,4.0,                       great pan so far  only thing is i wish it came with a lid  luckily we have another pan that came with a lid that fits this pan  heats quickly and evenly      
557,5.0,                       one of the best pans i have ever cooked with  does not stick  and remember to use low heat is best   great company     
558,5.0,                       i just have to say that i wish i d found this pan years ago  it continues to be non stick and super easy to clean up  if i could give it higher than   stars i would      
559,5.0,                       great product  i love this pan       
560,5.0,                       oh i just love this pan for my eggs in the morning   it does not stick and they slide right out of the pan   great size too     
561,5.0,                       this is the best saute pan i ve ever had   i use olive oil cooking spray  more for taste than to make sure food doesn t stick   it distributes heat evenly so your food is cooked just right on all sides   it washes like a dream   loved it so much i bought the    in  pan      
562,5.0,                       this pan is amazing   they heat very well  even on an electric stove   and nothing sticks  so its super easy to clean      
563,5.0,                       i purchased this pan specifically for eggs    and whether it be over easy or scrambled  this is an amazing non stick pan  highly recommend      
564,4.0,                       like the pan so far  looks cool  does take a long time to heat up to cooking temperature on an electric stove      
565,1.0,                       warninghandle cracks within a week when you contact customer service they will keep promising you a replacement but will never send it      
566,5.0,                       cooks so well and cleans up so easily  i will buy another     
567,5.0,                       wow this great pan  light  cute combination of colors  no sticky use all days more than expect      
568,5.0,                       great pan so far   love the handle   hope it holds up over the long run      
569,5.0,                       i am pleased with this purchase  i wish i can give them    stars but i can only give them five  the quality is amazing  the cleaning process is easy and the cooking  you need to get one of these so you can taste the difference      
570,5.0,                       i love this pan  it is well made and cooks food perfectly  it looks amazing too  it only requires minimal oil in the pan for food to not stick   eggs cook beautifully  btw   the only downside is that it needs to be hand washed  but honestly  it s such a great addition to my kitchen that i don t mind it at all  i will always have this brand pots and pans in my kitchen from now on  buy it  you won t regret it      
571,5.0,                       for this price this ended up being way better than expected  very solid feel with the handle connection  non stick properties are better than i thought given the texture of the pan  all in all i will buy this again      
572,1.0,                       it is not nonstick     
573,5.0,                       this pretty  light weight yet sturdy pan   it reminds me of cooking with cast iron   doesn t scratch  so far nothing sticks   highly recommend this pan   teflon scratches so easily and quickly start sticking  this pan does not  at least so far   i cook at a small assisted living center  that is were i first encountered this brand of pan   loved it so much  i bought the small fry pan and the    quart sauce pan for myself   excellent quality  excellent price      
574,5.0,                       i have had it for   months now and it is still in perfectly new condition  this makes it the best nonstick frying pan i have ever had  my electric stove top only goes up to about     f degrees  but this temp still quickly kills all other frying pans  not this one it is still granite and the is not even discolored yet update           still in perfect condition  looks like new accept a lot of oil and cooking residue but the granite coating is still perfect  best frying pan i have ever had      
575,5.0,                       finally  a really good skillet  no problems with anything sticking and so very easy to clean  i have already ordered another in a different size      
576,5.0,                       i had already one carote pan   smaller size and because i like it so much  i decided to get a bigger one definitely   non stick  great quality  the handle is wooden and never gets hot   well spent money for something which is enjoyable in the kitchen  makes cooking more fun      
577,5.0,                       it was so impressive i bought one size larger        after a few days of use     
578,5.0,                       written by my brother non stick and cheap  perfect for omelettes  stir fry  deep fry and perfect if you are an individual who is just making a small dish and doesn t want to use a huge ass pan       
579,5.0,                       so far non stick after two weeks of use  hopefully it ll remain like this unlike other stone pans which loose their non stick ability after some time its definitely the most beautiful pan i own      
580,5.0,                       i ordered a smaller one previously and loved it  so i ordered the larger one  it s my go to pan whenever i need to saute anything  easy to use and extremely easy to clean

584,5.0,                       this is a very good product and i recommend others to buy it      
585,5.0,                       this pan is very good  i haven t had any trouble with food sticking although i doubt that melted cheese would just slide right out     
586,5.0,                       it looks great   light and deep   nonstick is amazing  but who cares  it s cheap and i love the whole set   don t put aluminum in you dishwasher  ever      
587,5.0,                       truly non stick and easy to clean also very attractive and well made      
588,5.0,                       i like the handle wood  it s heating up quickly      
589,5.0,                       finally a fry pan that doesn t stick as promised   we absolutely love this pan   a little tiny bit of butter and eggs slide out effortlessly every time   i am tossing all my other fry pans and purchasing more of these  they re that good   i highly recommend it      
590,5.0,                       best pan ever     
591,5.0,                       perfect size for a few eggs  easy to clean     
592,5.0,                       this is the perfect pan  used it for eggs and making omelets  cheese didn t even stick to the pan  so easy to clean      
593,3.0,                       was a fantastic pan till the non stick coating was gone  followed directions that came with it and it still lost its non stick which was the only reason i bought it     
594,5.0,                       this is a really good nonstick pan  it s a solid but not too heavy and the non stick coating is pretty durable and easy to clean  i use the pan every day and only after a year or so it started to discolor a little bit and took a little more work to clean up  so i got another one and it s been just as good      
595,4.0,                       this really works  i was very skeptical but i have done scrambled eggs and mince meat for shepherds pie and nothing stuck to the pan  i didnt give   stars because i haven t tested the longevity  but so far so good        
596,5.0,                       this pan is great  it cooks better and cleans better  than any pan i ve ever had       
597,3.0,                       i ve only used this a few times and the handle is already discolored where it attaches to the pan  it s a nice looking pan  i m a little confused as to why the outside has a smoother finish than the inside  i ll use it a bit more to see how the non stick holds up  i ll probably send it back because of the discolored handle though      
598,5.0,                       the handle is made of some synthetic material that feels wonderful and never gets hot   i highly recommend this skillet      
599,5.0,                       for the first time in my life     i cooked a perfect egg  you must use very low heat  i followed directions and seasoned as directed  we will see  i just received it yesterday      
600,5.0,                       bought   and    inch   arrived fast and in great shape   used both skillets several times and great heat distribution  easy to clean   i am very happy with this purchase      
601,5.0,                       i fry an egg almost every morning for breakfast   on the weekend my wife likes to make omelets   i seasoned this pan per the instructions and it s quite simply amazing   after a week of use i asked my wife if she wanted me to buy a set  she said no and then   days later ordered the bigger one   i m    years old and have used a lot of frying pans  this is simply the best pan i ve ever used      
602,5.0,                       really love this pan  like the advertisement says    does not stick      
603,5.0,                       the product is as stated in the ad and a real bargain  bill c    fl     
604,1.0,                       after agreeing to replace defective pan  crack in the handle where pan is attached  they did not do so   in fact   they ignored email reminding them that they had promised to replace as soon as stock was replenished due to covid    delays   save your money and buy something else   yes  the pans are beautiful and easy to clean  but are defective      
605,5.0,                       best pan ever  have been using it for a month or so and i am      satisfied  not even a little oil is needed to have perfect fried eggs or pancakes  recommended       
606,5.0,                       if you want a great pan at a great price  look no further  been wanting to upgrade my set for a while but didn t want to break the bank so i settled in this  and have since bought about every size available  do it      
607,5.0,                       i typically buy teflon coated pans but i got tired of the coating coming off and the thin pans not heating evenly   i tried this pan and so far   after a few months   i love it   it is great to cook with  heats evenly  and nothing sticks to it   to clean it i simply run it under warm water and wipe with a wet paper towel   i plan to buy more      
608,5.0,                       i was concerned when i saw the ratings about roughness inside the pan   mine was slightly rough inside  but it didnt  seem to have any negative impact on the cooking for cleaning  i love the pans      
609,5.0,                       bought this to replace a non stick pan that was no longer non stick   this is an awesome pan   nothing sticks  clean up is so quick  even if it s a cheesy dish    and the handle stays cool   it is deeper than i thought it would be which was just an added bonus      
610,4.0,                       it was something if not nothing  this pan   when it arrived  i was concerned as it did not include any inserts  product information  or packaging   only a thin plastic bag   and there was no padding in the amazon box that turned out to be a ok   yes  it did the pan is functional   it cooks things   sometimes i use the pan to cook eggs   i eat turkey bacon almost every morning   and this pan sure knows how to help with that   thank you pan   someone started calling it  the grey s  pan  because they enjoy believing there are aliens in outer space   and this pan is grey with white acne colored speckles  so maybe the  the grey s  pan  is going through puberty   it would make sense  hanging out on my oven all day i guess   i don t judge i have also cooked ground beef for tacos in  the grey s  pan   as well as various delectable chicken dishes i will keep you appraised as to whether  the grey s  pan  has anything to say for it his her them s  self thank you  the grey s  pan    you re the best      
611,5.0,                       it does what it s supposed to do  it s a little heavy

621,5.0,                       i was looking for something that was not teflon to cook scrambled eggs that wasn t a pain to clean   this works great and is a neat looking product as well

630,4.0,                       i ve been using this pan almost every day since july    this year  sauteeing stuff with butter or oil  over time  i ve noticed that at certain light angles the pan develops this brownish coloured patina that won t disappear  moreover  the even heating of the pan negligibly degraded as i can see the top portion of it would heat faster than the one near the handle      
631,5.0,                       great product  i bought to bring camping to use on my hot plate electric burner  made eggs and bacon did not stick easy cleanup  i made hot dogs as well  i recommend

633,5.0,                       i use this pan to cook everyday  it easy to heat it up  and keeps food warm long enough the height is not too low and too deep  just right in the middle size i cook with steak  fry veggies   saut  all kinks of meal the surface of the pan is like the rocky  which can heat the foods temperature quickly  and keep the foods warm for a longer time  i love it  thanks a lot      
634,3.0,                       the pan was a fine non stick pan but after putting it in the dishwasher once  the bottom of the pan started leaving marks on our white cabinets  we had to return it      
635,3.0,                       good for frying eggs easy to clean

640,5.0,                       i love it  non stick and so easily to clean      
641,5.0,                       nice little pan for frying the occasional egg  i don t use any oil with this pan and it s very easy to clean  i will note that the handle which appears to be wood is in fact plastic but i have no quam with that      
642,5.0,                       this carote frying pan skillet has exceeded my expectations  it is deep and the base covers my     electric grid well  the pan has adequate weight  with excellent heat distribution and retention  yes  so far it is nonstick  i followed the manufacturer s instructions for  seasoning   i hand wash it  too  the handle is to love  it is smooth  easy to grip  and ergonomically designed      
643,4.0,                       great pan   family loves the heat distribution and the non stick   the only thing   and this isn t affecting the performance  the handle   which is beautiful     is getting these yellow stains   and they won t wash out     
644,5.0,                       i love this pan  i use it at least once a day  the only thing not desirable is not being dishwasher safe  that s just my laziness  i plan on getting some different sized ones in the near future      
645,5.0,                       best pans i ve ever used  period   no more scrubbing pans to death after cooking  this is truly non stick   i d pay double for these      
646,5.0,                       i bought this frying pan a couple months ago  i use it often and i like this purchase very little oil is needed for frying and nothing burns  it is easy to clean      
647,5.0,                       non stick for sure      
648,1.0,                       misleading description  after receiving on  cardboard directions says made in china have not used yet  trying to decide if i will return it insteadi definitely would not have purchase if i had known     
649,5.0,                       needed to replace a couple of non stick pans that were worn out  did some research before buying these  after getting these and putting just a very small amount of oil on them the first time we used them  they have performed perfectly  we don t use any oil in them now  and everything just slides off cleanly  cleanup is just a quick sponge off and they are ready to go  can t imaging better pans      
650,1.0,                       not a good buy  handles are made of ceramic not made of wood and are hot unlike advertised  everything sticks to bottom  even if i do what the instruction say with oil  i oiled before i cooked and after washing  they are made in china which i read made in germany  not made of granite  just all around hate these pans   pots      
651,5.0,                       i love this pan  this is the most nonstick egg pan i ve ever found  i cook eggs almost everyday and this pan has cooked them perfectly every time  i d love to get the larger ones when i can afford them because they are just the best pans  easy to clean  the handles are beautiful  and they don t scratch up my glass cook top      
652,2.0,                       update  the non stick is no longer non stick  there is discoloration in the pan and things are sticking now  also on the     pan the handle cracked and a piece fell off  for these reasons i changed my review to a   star original  so far so good  i purchased these to replace my crappy gotham steel copper pans these seem to be way better quality  they feel nice and so far nothing is sticking as of right now  these seem to work  let s hope they will last      
653,5.0,                       love my pan  i use it every morning for my eggs  perfect size   weight and cooks evenly      
654,5.0,                       it s very nice quality and love the wood look handle     
655,5.0,                       i have used it for scrambled eggs  making burgers and stir frying vegetables  i thought at first that the finish was a bit rough but it cooks everything well and cleans up nicely       
656,5.0,                       very decently priced      
657,5.0,                       great pan  couldn t asked for more  ordered already the second one        
658,5.0,                       i liked everything about this pan not one negative thing about it get this pan         
659,5.0,                       very good you have to wash it and then you have to cure it and after that it is easy to clean i have a gas stove so it can hold up to the heat     
660,5.0,                       i have bought so may cookware sets that do not compare to carote product at all  this has been the best cooking pan i have purchased in my entire adult life hands down  wow  i will keep purchasing the rest of these      
661,1.0,                       takes a little but to clean each time  not great nonstick     
662,3.0,                       the reason i gave this skillet a   rating is the fact that it cannot be used in an oven over     degree unless you want to distort the handles making the pans unuseable     
663,5.0,                       excellent pan  i had tried the copper pans and ozeri which were good but ended up not being as durable under a bit higher heat when needed  this pan has held up beautifully and even under higher heat or if i ve left it on the stove a bit too long in preheating shows no warping or other problems  definitely worth the money and an excellent pan at any price  also bought     pan      
664,5.0,                       the pan lives up to all its claims     
665,5.0,                       love this pan so i bought the   piece set    they are easy to clean love the size of the pans        
666,5.0,                       perfect for three egg omlettes with all sorts of added goodies      
667,5.0,                       i have been using t fal for years and got dis inchanted with them  they are okay but i wanted a new pan  my hubby has come down with a cancer and needs to eat many times a day just to keep his weight up   this pan serves me just fine as i can cook in it and clean it quickly for the next time  not only that but i personally love the  feel  of it  slightly heavy  good handle  the pan itself is thich and heats well on my stove   and i love the look of it as well as how good it performs      
668,4.0,                       i like the pan has some depth so i can put in more stuff  surface is not smooth by design so if you like smooth surface  you will probable not like it      
669,5.0,                       i virtually never write reviews of items i ve bought  but this little psingle an is so great that i feel compelled to give it a shout out   it is the perfect size for making an individual omelet  scrambled eggs or other portion   the nonstick surface is so pronounced that it only takes a slight spray of oil and that same surface makes it a breeze to clean   your food will slide right off the pan like on demos on television  but this is real   it s small and attractive enough to sit out on the top of the stove if you are lacking in storage space   cooking is even on the small cooking surface   truly a great little pan      
670,5.0,                       so far so good         
671,4.0,                       this is a great little frying pan and has been good for scrambled and fried eggs   we were looking for an alternative to our all clad set because the small frying pan in that set doesn t cleanup well with eggs   this little pan does the job by cooking quickly and evenly  then is a breeze to cleanup   the inside of the pan feels slightly abrasive but that hasn t impacted how the eggs release from the pan or cleanup   it is also cheap enough where longevity isn t a huge concern because it can be easily replaced if needed      
672,5.0,                       i love my carote   inch non stick omelet pan  it s perfect for individual   and   egg omelets  if anything sticks to it  i haven t found it yet      
673,5.0,                       love this product and after   months i ordered different sizes to make a set      
674,5.0,                       works great and easy to clean      
675,5.0,                       i bought the    pan a year ago  i needed something for an induction cook top  and decided i needed   of these excellent pans   the pan heats up super fast on the induction cook top  they have a nice thick bottom that distributes heat evenly  nothing sticks to the granite coating   the handle is very comfortable to hold   highly recommended          
676,4.0,                       used to own t fal for so many years  this is heavier pan compare to the ones i used to have  however  it cooks very well  good non stick pan  i m very happy to have it      
677,5.0,                       i liked the way they cleanup  they cook great      
678,5.0,                       i am astounded with how much i love this pan  i am definitely buying a second one and recommending this to everyone  what a great price on top of it all  still cant believe how well it cooks and it cleans so easily  you will not be disappointed with this pan  it s wonderful      
679,5.0,                       i bought a couple of these for my parents  and they love them     
680,3.0,                       bought two of these back in april  an   in one and they used to have a   in one my   in one got the most use  it worked super well for first couple of months  nothing ever stuck to it  i only used silicon spatulas and hand washedthen today  in november so   months later  i go to cook eggs  cooked three eggs  i think i yielded   egg and the rest stuck to the bottom of the pan  it s a shame but it s going in the trash now  a nonstick pan that sticks has no use for me     
681,3.0,                       i love the handle that does not get hot   i am having trouble getting use to the rough texture of the inside pan however it seems that what your cooking is coming out good  i may just need more time to get use to a pan that cooks differently and has a rough surface      
682,5.0,                       the best pan i ever bought   really nonstick  beautiful wood handle  great looking too      
683,5.0,                       best pan i have purchased so far  i want to get the other pieces  cheese doesn t stick either      
684,5.0,                       good quality  even heat distribution     
685,5.0,                       since i got this pan i stoped using all my other pans as this one performs better then all the other more expensive pans i have  great buy         
686,4.0,                       great     
687,5.0,                       i ve only had this frying for a few days  but so far i m loving it  i ve done fried chicken  omelets  pancakes and and a stir fry with this pan and so far it s been great  i m definitely thinking i ll buy a second one      
688,5.0,                       sadly i had to replace my go to non stick pan as it decided to start sticking  but i m happy i purchased this one as a replacement  it s perfect  great price  easy to clean      
689,5.0,                       we have had this for   months or so   works perfectly so far      
690,5.0,                       i like everything about this small frying pan      
691,5.0,                       it does all that it say it does  i have cooked different thinks on it no extra oil at all  and i looks and feels like it s going to last

693,5.0,                       love this pan  i bought it to cook eggs in  cooks very well  eggs do not stick  very happy with my purchase      
694,5.0,                       i have been using this for a few months and love it  it s non stick quality is amazing  fry an egg with little to no oil and it just slides out only problem  it yellows over time      
695,5.0,                       best skillet i ve ever purchased     i ve bought some really expensive ones  see now they offer the whole set yay  i will be buying       
696,5.0,                       this pan is beautiful  functional and absolutely a must have in the kitchen  it is non stick  going on   months now  and washes so easily  fortunately  i told my family about this pan and got some other sizes for christmas         
697,1.0,                       everything worked great for a short time  really liked it  unfortunately the love affair only lasted   months when it started sticking badly  now   short months later it s in the trash bin      
698,5.0,                       easy to clean and non stick      
699,5.0,                       loved the color of pan  the texture of coating is weird but it is fantastic nonstick surface  highly recommended by myself   coating heats and cleans easy     
700,5.0,                       this is a great pan we use it to make eggs sloppy joe s brown hamburger meat  this pan also cleans up very nice lol we do is clean it with water and a paper towel  sometimes we will use soap and a scotch brite dobie which doesn t scratch the surface  we definitely will be buying more of these pans      
701,1.0,                       purchased this because it says it works on induction cooktop  while it is a nice looking pan and cute small size  it does not work on induction cooktop      
702,5.0,                       i love this pan  it is exactly like the description and i couldn t be happier  the size is perfect to make   eggs or more without sticking  i want an entire set  that s how much i like this pan  buy it      
703,5.0,                       these pans are awesome   well made too      
704,5.0,                       great egg pan  easy to flip  and as no utensil will ever come in contact with it s surface i do believe it will last quite a while      
705,5.0,                       we were looking for an    non stick pan but didn t see the smaller ozeri in this size so we ordered this one after comparing it with other brands and reading the reviews   this  like the ozeri  has a very slippery coating   although we ve used it less than a handful of times it heats evenly and quickly   like the ozeri  the surface of the pan has a textured feel to it   it is not smooth as glass  but it cleans up easily the handle is comfortable and has an ergonomic feel to it   we re very happy with it      
706,5.0,                       i bought a different pan and was extremely disappointed with it  i am happy with this pan      
707,5.0,                       i can t talk enough about this pan  oddly  enough    i can cook myself eggs  and clean the pan in about   minutes  i never use butter or oil as a means of non stick anymore  just flavor  if i want it i will be looking to purchase more variations of this pan down the road  my only issue is that i can t machine wash it  but the thing is so easy to clean  it s a non issue      
708,5.0,                       this pan is awesome   way better than that red copper junk   i only need to use medium heat and it heats fast and well   never had to use high heat yet   compared to red copper  i had to put high heat and it takes forever      
709,5.0,                       good quality super handle     
710,5.0,                       have had this pan for about a month now and have used it to fry and scramble eggs and to fry fish  i use a minimum of fat and nothing sticks  easy clean up      
711,5.0,                       i am    years old and have had a lot of experience with cookware over the years  first i bought a small frypan to try it out  i like the small one for scrambling eggs because there are no screws to continually clean afterwards  inside is totally smooth  awesome is all i can say  so i bought this larger frypan and donated my old one  the instructions for cookware always matter  cook on medium heat  i choose to hand wash which is so simple because nothing sticks to it  ever      
712,4.0,                       will update this over time   week in  for the most part i like them  they seem well made and are definitely easy to clean  another reviewer mentioned the inside discolored and i kept an eye out for that  based off their picture i ve determined it was burned oil  i was able to wash mine off with soap  i do see a problem with the handles discoloring due to the heat of my gas stove  i ve attempted to keep the handle away from the stove as much as possible but one discolored the first day and there s nothing i can do about it  i do like the ease of washing off anything stuck on  i ve only dealt with breakfast stuff so far so i haven t seen how it will hold up with meats  it takes a while to figure out the best way to cook eggs to keep it from sticking  for my stove it needs to be med low flame  any higher it sticks any lower it doesn t cook evenly and falls apart when i try to flip  it took approximately     attempts to get it right  most of the time the egg hasn t stuck but even when it stuck pretty bad it just required a little extra work to clean it  i do worry about the possibility of chipping the inside  my largest skillet arrived with a ding already  since the bottom of these skillets have a metal area that isn t flush to the skillet you have to be very careful if you have to store these inside each other  i ve used a silicone mat to protect them but would have loved if i didn t have to do this  my only big con and this is more of with the non stick industry in general i spent a lot of time trying to find skillets that were safe and didn t use any chemicals in their non stick properties  i thought this did but i m not super sure as other people have stated it does still use chemical coating  i was hopeful that by going with the stone style cookware that chemicals could be avoided but after many hours looking into all the top brands who say they don t use chemicals i found various would admit they do  i don t know if that is the case with this brand but i hope it s safe overall my pros outweigh my conspro is non stickeasy to cleanheats up much faster so flame can be lowerreally prettylightweightcons handle discolors really easy when near heatinside seems like it might chip easilycannot easily be stacked inside each otherthere is a slight pooling that happens around the center  wish they were completely flat      
713,5.0,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
714,5.0,                       oh my gosh  i love this pan  it s light weight but yet feels substantial  it doesn t teeter totter on the range and is completely non stick  amazing bonus is it looks attractive to  weird thing to like but my kids often leave the pan out and i hate an ugly pan on the stove  i m buying a bigger one to use as well      
715,5.0,                       such great quality i love it so easy to cleanthis is my second purchase from this brandgreat heat distribution i definitely recommend it     
716,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband when the small fry pan in our set starting having issues with food sticking  i looked for independent reviews and this was rated right up there with much more expensive pans  my husband has used it many times now and is so pleased with it  everything cooks evenly  food slides right out and clean up is a breeze      
717,5.0,                       this pan was great small for some eggs but it s works good     
718,5.0,                       love this pan       
719,5.0,                       the perfect skillet  absolutely no sticking  incredibly easy clean      
720,1.0,                       about a month later and food sticks to it now      
721,1.0,                       i bought this same pan three times in the past    months  the first two were excellent but were unfortunately damaged when left empty on the stove with heat on  i bought the third pan expecting the same quality product  but when the pan arrived  i noticed that the color was lighter and the surface felt rougher  used it today to cook eggs with a little oil  and eggs stuck to the pan pretty bad  quite disappointing      
722,5.0,                       it s better than any other frying pan i ever had  i love it      
723,5.0,                       ive been using the copper pans an i liked everything about them especially nonstick and i love the cast iron pans i have too  but i meeded a lighter pan with a heavy bottom    sounds funny but its true an i wanted nonstick so i got the best of both worlds a great pan that like a combo of both an i plan on getting an entire set  one of the best investments          
724,5.0,                       i started off buying two skillets just to see how they performed  within a month  i started ordering other pieces to replace all of our stovetop cookware   it distributes heat better than any other nonstick or stainless pan i have ever used   super easy to clean and we have had nothing stick   we have cooked fried eggs  omelets  salmon  pancakes and a variety of other things and literally  nothing sticks   it s also heavier than most non stick pans  which i think will make it even more durable  i have used it from low heat to medium high  high heat for a few minutes  and it performs well for all  over the years i have had stainless  cast iron  ceramic and many other  some high end  sets but this is what both my husband and i reach for now no matter what we cook      
725,5.0,                       i wanted a frying pan small enough to do a perfect omlett   worked out for a lot more foods  non stick and all the claims are true  great price      
726,5.0,                       just about nothing sticks to this thing  and if it does it washes off easily  if you take care of this pan  it will be your best friend      
727,5.0,                    mis mascotas encontraron el paquete antes que yo y lo destrozaron completamente  pero el sart n quedo intacto y sin ray n alguno  es muy bonito y resistente        
728,5.0,                       my husband got the   inch skillet for me as a gift  i like it dough i added this skillet as well   it ckeans easily and the non stick seems to last if you follow the directions on the package      
729,5.0,                       i needed a small skillet for eggs because my old one was just worn out  this skillet works perfectly  the surface is truly nonstick  the handle stays cool  and i like that it s deep enough for omelets      
730,5.0,                       i love this pan   i hesitate to say it s easy to clean because it s not a smooth  teflon  finish     so i am careful to clean it vigorously but not use anything abrasive     
731,5.0,                       my husband and i both love this little pan   there are only the two of us in the household and it is the perfect size   no sticking and so far  no chipping of the surface      
732,5.0,                       the quality is great for the price  it cooks eggs nicely  i spray with a little bit of cooking spray and they slide right off the pan  i really like this pan      
733,5.0,                       besides the point  that this is the prettiest pan i have ever seen and the unbeatable price  this pan is absolutely great  i will most definitely buy all the other sizes too  it is super easy to clean  cooks evenly  gets hot super fast  the handle feels great and it s not heavy at all  it has just the right weight to it and the handle is super smooth and soft  my husband could not even tell that the handle isn t real wood at first  it s a very high quality pan that everyone should have in their kitchen  absolutely gets   stars from me highly recommend        
734,5.0,                       awesome pan        
735,5.0,                       i wanted a mid size skillet for eggs and smaller items   this one is the perfect size and really easy to clean with very good heat distribution   time will tell how long the coating lasts  i use wooden utensils to cook with so hopefully quite a while   for now  very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to others      
736,5.0,                       everything i asked for in a skillet   worth every penny   i ve used it about a month no oil needed  nothing sticks      
737,5.0,                       this pan passed the fried egg challenge  doesn t stick and slides right off  great price too      
738,5.0,                       i ve tried about   different non stick pans over    years   almost all work great for a month  this one works great as well but the construction impresses me   it is great for clean up and cooks evenly  i guess i ll have to write another one in six months or so  the price is right for experimentingif you want to try      
739,5.0,                       i really like the feel of this fry pan   a large wooden handle makes it easy to grip and the size is great for eggs      
740,5.0,                       great product  already planning to buy a bigger one   i have    kids  cooking         and     not worried about them messing it up      
741,5.0,                       i like that the non stick is holding up and that it s easy to clean  it s a little heavy when holding with one hand      
742,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          washed with mild detergent and hot water as directed then tried a fried egg  no oil basically burned and stuck to bottom not impressed      
743,5.0,                       best frying pans i have ever owned   reading the instructions the pans require seasoning   i my surprise the iron stone actually absorb the canola oil  lots of it  i have had zero issues with the cook top but they are not dish washer safe  the bottom corroded over night in the dish washer  it took hours of polishing to remove the rust   don t put them in the dish washer  one wipe cleanup      
744,5.0,                       love this pan   we plan on buying more larger ones   great clean up   great cooking      
745,5.0,                       used on an induction cooktop and functions perfectly so far  about   weeks  it perfectly meets both my needs and expectations for it been using it for   months now and it is even better than my original expectations      
746,1.0,                       handle was loose immediately upon unpacking and when we tried to tighten it  the handle fell off completely   whomever packed the box did a nice job but obviously disregarded the loose handle and packed it up anyway      
747,5.0,                       this pan has blown me away  i ve only had it a few months but it made cooking on an electric stove almost fun again  very very impressed     
748,5.0,                       fantastic product     must keep the temperatures low        
749,3.0,                       it s  scratched on the pan when i receive it  little disappointed      
750,5.0,                       i mostly use this pan for eggs and omelettes  heat distribution is great  the nonstick surface is the best i ve seen  cleanup is a breeze  i have   other pans from this manufacturer  a     and a       the design of the handles is very nice  no rivets which makes the cleaning easier than pans with riveted handles      
751,5.0,                       this frying pan is fantastic  the best purchase i ever made  cooking  cleanup and the price is a pure delight      
752,5.0,                       best non stick surface i ve used yet      
753,5.0,                       i love this pan   it s better than i expected   it s very easy to clean and heats evenly      
754,5.0,                       finally a pot that is truly nonstick and stays that way after cooking various foods in it      
755,5.0,                       i love my new skillet its durable easy clean up and beautiful  i m really happy i bought this      
756,1.0,                       cute pans but not the best quality      
757,5.0,                       it is a great frying pan  it cooks without sticking and is very easy to wash  i love and probably will be buying more  i need some larger pans      
758,4.0,                       this is a terrific pan needs only minimal drops of oil  cleans easy nothing sticks    suggestions     don t let oil sit in pan over night  all pans get a sticky residue that won t come off if you leave oil sit in pans     don t put in dishwasher pans last longer if gently washed by hand     not for high heat  pan will discolor and get a yellowish goldish tone from high heat that will not come off excellent pan with care cooks evenly and very well one of my favorite pans      
759,3.0,                       it doesn t work on induction  i cooked with it and it kept going to error after   minutes  i read another review having this issue but not until after i used  it  apparently in the middle there is an area not properly sealed for induction  disappointed       
760,5.0,                       looks good  cooks good  foods slide like on a skating rink     
761,5.0,                       great  great pan  use it mainly for my eggs  no stickiness and super easy to clean     
762,5.0,                       well built  strong handle  thick coated aluminum  looks great and cooks better     
763,5.0,                       great pan and cleaned up easily     
764,1.0,                       the touted non stick coating didn t last more than a few weeks   the frying arrived without any  protective packing  product sleeve or brand advertisements   including cleaning instructions for protecting the advertised  special  non stick surface  which vanished after several weeks of use   what you end up with is a well made frying pan that requires soaking after each use to remove cooking oil  butter or fried food particles firmly stuck to the surface as if it were super glue   recommend purchasing another brand that actually has a non stick surface      
765,5.0,                       i got the   inch  it s soo good  works great super easy to clean and i love the handle  wished the bigger sizes were more affordable     
766,5.0,                       best i never been       
767,4.0,                       the family is enjoying the cooking easel   my    year old grandson wants one for christmas he likes making omelettes     
768,5.0,                       i found these pans while i was looking for ones similar in white  i wasn t stoked on the color but so glad i decided to purchase them  they are beautiful   they heat up so fast  i m really going to enjoy cooking with these  i bought   different types the deep frying pan  a regular frying pan and a pot and i will be buying more sizes to complete my set      
769,4.0,                       i like wood handles     
770,5.0,                       it s price is more than what i had planned to spend  but i will keep it      
771,5.0,                       it is great  i use it on induction burner      
772,2.0,                       pan was purchased less than     year ago and one day the entire non stick coating stopped working properly  i started noting black char marks and food started sticking  i reached out to customer support  they asked for my invoice and told me  thanks for your response  we well received the item picture and order details and refer this inquiry to our colleague who is handling the amazon us orders to reply to you  been   weeks since this correspondence  i have followed up twice to check on the status and have not received any response i genuinely wanted to reuse this pan because during first few months it was hands down the best budget non stick pan on amazon  however  until the looming question is resolved one can only speculate what went wrong  if the pan was from a faulty batch or if this is expected wear and tear with this pan if heavily used  irrespective i expect customer service to not ghost their customers  especially when they are still under the warranty period      
773,5.0,                       i absolutely love this pan  it is bigger than i anticipated it to be  but it does perform as advertised  i will buy more products from this company      
774,5.0,                       very happy with the product so far      
775,5.0,                       i love the non stick and it looks beautiful and easy to clean  i want them all       
776,5.0,                       works great     
777,5.0,                       another item i needed an in between size for the little jobs for one person  i like the texture of this pan  the way it cooks so evenly and the easy clean up   nothing sticks to it which is a plus as well   and what is even better  when i cook an egg over easy the yolk doesn t break   now  either that is the skill of the cook or the ease with which the pan provides in sliding the spatula easily under the egg      
778,5.0,                       in my    years of home cooking  i have never come across such a long lasting product  after a long period of usage  it still looks brand new   of course i strictly follow cleaning instructions   when you cook and nothing sticks to the pan  i relive this moment everytime i cook using this pan  go for it  you will be a happier cook      
779,5.0,                       love my pan   best ever   price is right and it cooks evenly  easy to clean and love the handle       
780,5.0,                       i love this pan  it is the best one i have ever owned      
781,5.0,                       i was skeptical of the cheap price  i bought this and their saucepan  i was reluctant to buy new pans because my other one from a different brand didn t last long  the reviews were amazing so i gave it a shot  it is almost impossible to stick anything to these pans which is weird because they have a rough texture you would think anything would stick to  would definitely buy in the future  but i may never have to  i can t say i recommend these in the over due to the silicone handles  the manufacturer said up to     degrees  but mine discolored after my first oven usage  not a deal breaker for me      
782,5.0,                       i followed the directions for prepping before use  i don t often  do   this pan is fantastic  i m making perfect omelets every morning  great even heat distribution      
783,5.0,                       so i was getting tired of scraping pans after frying eggs  so i tried this one   i read the reviews and glad i did  the coating is rough which defies logic as to why the eggs slide out so easily   highly recommended    i m buying every size      
784,2.0,                       this pan was great for about a year but the non stick coating wore down very quickly after that  we never touched it with metal  only the soft side of the sponge  it s basically unusable now after    months  for that reason i would not recommend      
785,5.0,                       i really like this stone pan as i use nuwave cooking serface that needs stainless steel  everything i ve cooked in it so far good     
786,5.0,                       not only works well  it is beautiful      
787,4.0,                         stars because food actually sticks to the pot  other than that  i m still very pleased   sturdy  easy to clean  great looking set of pots      
788,5.0,                    llego a tiempo        
789,5.0,                       very sturdy   know cause i was hit with this on the head when i came home late  good thing there were no eggs on it      
790,5.0,                       it seems to cook hotter than most skillet so i use a lower setting once heated up  fried eggs seem to crisp up on edges and does not seem to cook with oil well  at least with fried eggs      
791,5.0,                       these are great  the nonstick actually is nonstick  things seems to cook evenly and they are very easy to clean      
792,5.0,                       these fry pans have wonderful heft and excellent nonstick quality   i love the wooden handles that stay cool to touch      
793,5.0,                       we love this pan  it cooks things very well and evenly  nothing sticks      
794,5.0,                       i was searching  for a long time to get the best one and this is it   the pan has got the heavy base which is ideal for cooking  i would blindly recommend it     
795,5.0,                       the best frying pans i have ever used   i add a spray of cooking spray and probably don t even need that   clean up is a breeze      
796,5.0,                       works as expected  just the right size for us        
797,5.0,                       i love this pan  i ve been using it for the last few weeks and it s the perfect nonstick pan  i will only buy this brand for now on      
798,5.0,                       i love how easy it is to keep clean  no notches on the inside for the handle      
799,3.0,                       it was pretty good for the first year  but lately it s not doing the non stick thing  even with plenty of oil  i m going to bite the bullet and buy a carbon steel now        
800,5.0,                       everything cooking     
801,5.0,                       i m using this pan almost everyday and it s just so great  i m so happy with this pan      
802,5.0,                       love these light weight pans  so easy to clean  nice nonstick pans      
803,3.0,                       wanted a    inch diameter pan so that my glass lids could fit on it  but actual dimenstions are off  its about       inch when measuring the inside boundary of the pan  its about       inch when considering thickness of the pan  my    inch glass lids go inside the pan instead of covering it      
804,5.0,                       really good pan  i get compliments very often  it has just the right size for cooking for one and heats evenly without anything sticking to it      
805,5.0,                       works great     
806,5.0,                       loved everything about this set      
807,5.0,                       i love this pan   truly non stick  easy to clean  perfect size for a variety of cooking and such a beautiful pan   i bought one for my daughter  who cooks with it daily and also gave it a big thumbs up   i will be buying more in other sizes        
808,5.0,                    me encant    muy buen tama o        
809,3.0,                       i purchased this pan with the duxtop induction cooktop  and i was quite disappointed to find out the pan did not work with the device   i specifically chose this pan because of the description touting that it was induction capable   as i only have the one device to try the induction compatibility on  that is the basis for the reduction in the rating with that being said  in order to give a fair judgment of the product  i decided to use it on my coil electrical burner and my glass cooktop   the pan performed well in my tests   i cooked some fajita steak and an egg and neither item stuck to the pan   it was easy to clean and has proven durable in its first two days of use the results of the pan performance leave me upset that it will not work for the intention it was purchased  but i will keep the pan for other cooking appliances      
810,5.0,                       i love these pans   i now have     they are the easiest to clean i have ever used      
811,2.0,                       i had a similar pan that i was trying to replace  i m disappointed with this pan compared to what i had previously   it s quite heavy  finish seems rough  the outside of the pan has a nice smooth finish   takes a long time to heat up  just not what i was looking for      
812,5.0,                       nonstick nature of this product exceptional   pleasure to cook with and very easy to clean      
813,5.0,                       this pan is everything it promised to be   probably the best heat distribution and easiest to clean pan i ve ever had   we ve had it for a month and use it daily   i definitely recommend this pan      
814,5.0,                       nice skillet for money  ended up buying  nd one      
815,5.0,                       great handel  steady in your hand  great for seniors      
816,5.0,                       it is truly non stick   handle stays cool  i will be ordering the other sizes      
817,5.0,                       beautiful and a great price when you find an attractive pan  there are always special rules  this one says don t over heat  that can be confusing for a pan  but it is better than  don t use vegetable oil   i usually cook with margarine or oil in the bottom anyway  i would imagine it is just because whatever oil you line it with  it will burn if left without food in it this is so attractive with the wood grain handle and the very solid coating  i don t mind making sure to put a bit of oil in the bottom every so often after washing      
818,3.0,                       this is a great pan and the handle is comfortable  the handle is also flammable  it s getting discolored  and sometimes smokes    near the connection point even though we never use it over more than medium heat  we still use it just have to be careful  the non stick surface is great      
819,5.0,                       they are great have   of them     
820,5.0,                       it was just delivered a few days ago  so we ve only used it a few times  but  so far it has been so much better than our old one  very easy to clean  and cooks eggs nicely  so far     so good    stars      
821,5.0,                       exactly what i was looking for  a pan to cook eggs that they don t stick too  another great benefit is that the handle isn t attached through the pan but on the outside  so one less place for things to stick to  they need to point thst out in their marketing better  not alot of pans are designed this well      
822,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          at first i was really turned off when i saw that the handle was made of plastic faux wood and the instructions were all in chinese  but i have come to love this pan because the plastic handle makes it dishwasher safe  also the non stick is the best i ve ever had  bacon and eggs don t stick at all  i made a video of the awesomeness      
823,3.0,                       let me start by saying that if you want to make an omelette  forget it with this pan  eggs aren t great either  i bought this pan specifically to replace my favorite teflon pan that i used to make omelettes  it is not even remotely in the same non stick league as a good teflon pan  the sides are too steep to be conducive for easily flipping things either  the reviews were wrong in my case  in that regard this pan is a total fail  but  it s a great saute pan for random cooking  veggies etc  i like it  and i ll keep it  but still looking for another pan        
824,5.0,                       i love this pan  eggs don t stick to the pan      
825,1.0,                       inside worn to base in   months      
826,5.0,                       very non stick surface  and being a quality pan  it was of a thicker metal than cheap pans  so things heated up evenly  an egg just slips around on the surface  i m very satisfied with the pan      
827,5.0,                       i love this little fry pan  it heats evenly and gets hot quickly  it is so easy to clean  i wish all my pans were made of this material  a great buy and price      
828,2.0,                       this non stick pan is awesome when it comes to cooking  however  the  wooden styled  handle is not wood  which i knew and was fine with  and was burned the first time i used it due only to heat distribution  poor design  will be returning  possibly a good throne around pan for the kitchen but not worth the money      
829,5.0,                       there isn t anything about this skillet i don t like   i am replacing my cookware i ve had for    years with the carote pieces   right now i have four carote cookware pieces  two with lids and i am very happy with the carote brand      
830,5.0,                       this is our third piece  and we are very satisfied with them  thanks      
831,5.0,                       amazing pot and pan set  my wife and i have been looking for a very very long time for a nice set  we finally found that set in these pans  so we ordered the entire set of    pans  different orders of course  my wife and i could not be happier      
832,4.0,                       good quality  and nonstick  pretty wooden handle  deeper than i thought which is great      
833,5.0,                       the pan is a great buy  light weight and durable      
834,5.0,                       works just as i hoped it would     
835,5.0,                       i just used it for the first time  it s light weight  my omelet slid right off the pan  clean up was a breeze   the pan looks like it belongs in a cabin in the woods  which is a different look for my kitchen   the only reason i didn t give it   stars is because i have no idea how it will hold up      
836,1.0,                       the nonstick coating disappeared real quickly with low use      
837,3.0,                             
838,5.0,                       these are great pans easy to clean  i m buying more     
839,5.0,                       cooks evenly  cleans easily      
840,5.0,                       the style is very nice  heavy pan cleaning is easy     
841,5.0,                       this pan is so pretty and great for cooking without oil  skinless chicken thighs cooked beautifully here  it might wear off and get sticky again after months of heavy use like the other pans   but for now my life is lighter and easier  so happy with it       
842,5.0,                       awesome pan for frying or anything you d use a skillet for  i cook daily but i don t have a lot of expensive name brands in my kitchen  this is by far one of the best pans i own  it s sturdy but not overly heavy  it looks nice and it washes up like a dream  definitely recommend      
843,1.0,                       eggs stick to pan even with butter in the pan      
844,5.0,                       i love the carote line of pans  this is the third pan from carote i purchased  wonderful quality and excellent value for price  i am very happy with carote line of products      
845,5.0,                       very sturdy pan   excellent heat distribution   cooks wonderfully   easy to clean surface   the catch with these pans is how long the surface lasts  but so far so good   this is an excellent pan for the price and very pleased with the performance      
846,5.0,                       i like it  want buy a bigger one     
847,5.0,                       we eat eggs almost every day and now my kids are making fried eggs and scrambled eggs on their own  i wanted an easy to clean non stick pan for them to use  this pan is beautiful and the handle feels great when you hold it  easy to cook in and even easier to clean  have sent it to gifts to others already      
848,5.0,                       i really like this pan      
849,3.0,                       i used it a couple of times now   not bad so far  one thing is that the pot material seems not so great   but the price talks      
850,5.0,                       good product     
851,5.0,                       my favorite frying pan  non stick and easy to clean      
852,5.0,                       i bought this but i was slightly hesitant to buy it since i normally go to stores and check it thoroughly  a little bit of oil would be used but i used this for meat  rice and it doesn t even stick to the pan at all  it s so easy to clean up after as well  i think it s worth the price        
853,5.0,                       like     
854,1.0,                       i have another brand  it is different  it is not nonstick  the pan layer is coarse yet outside has shinny smooth coating  i cook egg and is difficult to cook with less oil  so i use it with more oil         
855,5.0,                       it gets quite hot which facilitates preparations  so far it has worked quite well although it is also careful like teflon  the handle is obviously worn in the part near the fire  it is like the only detail  but i liked it a lot      
856,5.0,                       this is a nice  well made  sturdy little pan  i started with the   inch to see if i liked it enough to buy a bigger one  i think i ll be getting the bigger one soon  it s a breeze to cook on and to clean up  best if used over medium heat  you shouldn t be cooking eggs on high heat anyway  so far  everything has come out perfect and the handle stays nice and cool to the touch  nice flat bottom  no if only my jenky burners were level      
857,5.0,                       i like the size  handle and weight      
858,4.0,                       quality cookware is usually most expensive  this piece was everything i was looking for  shipping was fast      
859,1.0,                       had to send back   my induction stovetop didn t recognize it so it was useless      
860,5.0,                       can t believe that it doesn t stick  if i find out that it does stick after a few uses  i will do a second review      
861,5.0,                       it is larger than expected for a    inch skillet but the product is great   cooks beautifully and cleans up easily and quickly   a bit heavy but would definitely recommend  this product      
862,5.0,                       a great product  better than hoped     
863,5.0,                       love it  cleans easy  nothing sticks     
864,3.0,                       it claims to be nonstick but it s simply not true  even with oil or cooking spray i have to keep scraping the bottom to keep it from sticking      
865,5.0,                       i love the fact you only cook on a medium heat at most and it cooks your food evenly and perfect  as long as you pay attention to how to clean it and only use a little olive oil it is the bomb    i wish they made an entire set i would buy it in a second      
866,5.0,                       ohhhhhh my goodness  new favorite pan by far  so easy to cook with  distributes heat well  you can honestly tell a difference in the food  very easy to clean  nothing seems to truly stick to it so far  definitely planning to buy more of these  and am likely going to swap out my other old pans for this brand  i m not usually excited about these things  but i m excited about this  definitely more than satisfied  please buy      
867,5.0,                       wife loves it      
868,5.0,                       i like it  hope it holds up      
869,5.0,                       so far so good  all indications are that it s going to last but that s what we thought about another pan we bought  we ll try to update in   months      
870,5.0,                       we have always struggled to find a good quality pan for a good price  we finally found one  we always struggled to make eggs due to the eggs always sticking in the pans  we finally found a pan that works  we will be buying more of these  bigger sizes   nice to finally find a pan that is safe to use  cooks evenly  and is easy to clean      
871,5.0,                       very good  not sticky at all      
872,5.0,                       product was as described  non stick  have been using it for while mainly for cooking egg  works well      
873,5.0,                       our old egg pans had worn out so i purchased this as replacement   so far it works great   the eggs do not stick  a little butter  and cleans up very easy   winner so far   test will be to see how long it lasts      
874,5.0,                       i was very skeptical when i got this pan and it didn t have some kind of coating on it similar to teflon  i was sure it was not going to be nonstick  wow was i wrong  this pan is incredible  just follow the instructions and nothing sticks to this pan is is so easy to clean i m going to buy a whole set of them if i can find a set best nonstick pan i have ever owned  the thing that s really great about this pan is it does not have a coating on it  all my teflon pans eventually start shedding little particles of teflon into the food which is very scary  this pan is completely made out of the nonstick material so there s nothing to peel off  you can wipe it clean with a paper towel it s wonderful      
875,5.0,                       this pan is pretty and works great  nothing sticks to it  wish i got the cover to go with it   i would definitely buy more from them      
876,5.0,                       i purchased this pan about a month ago and have pretty much used it on a daily basis   i really love it and wish the company offered a few more sizes   i would definitely purchase more   the pan does not stick  i usually put a tiny bit of olive oil in the pan and wipe it around before using and nothing sticks   eggs cook perfectly   the pan is also very easy to clean   i am hoping the pan will hold up with continued use   i feel like it is so much better than the toxic teflon pans that only last a very short time   i highly recommend       
877,4.0,                       when cooking for one its the right size for just about everyithing  it looks good  it cooks good and it cleans up beautifully from frying potatoes to cooking eggs  it can all be done on the beatiful littel fry pan      
878,5.0,                       i loved it   it s light yet it feels very sturdy  been cooking eggs with little to none oil and they slide  also love the design and color  would buy this again  very easy to clean   don t scrub it      
879,5.0,                       easy to clean  heats evenly  thick on the bottom  so i won t warp   nice handle that will never get hot  it looks wooden  but it s not  which i think its better        
880,5.0,                       i ve had many frying pans over the years and this is the best i ve ever had  it s sturdy  handle stays cool and price is very reasonable   am planning on getting several more pieces      
881,5.0,                       nice to use  i like that you don t need to use oil  it is a nice heavy skillet      
882,5.0,                       you should add a section here for indestructibility    in a fit of rage i threw this pan onto hard tiles  as hard as i could  and only the bolt broke      
883,5.0,                       best bye in a long time       
884,1.0,                       got this for an induction stove  worked the first time and never again  no idea why but all my other induction skillets have no issues  it was a great nonstick skillet the first time i used it so if you don t have induction im sure this will be fine for you      
885,5.0,                       good business value vs money     
886,5.0,                       this frying pan is all you need heat is evenly distributed  easy to clean and non  stick one con doesn t  have a lid i had one that fit perfectly        
887,1.0,                       it had some kind of dark brown flecks in the finish and it was exactly the opposite of a non stick pan  i was intending to make an omelette and ended up dumping it in the sink      
888,4.0,                       it was so easy to clean great pan to use with an induction burner stove     
889,1.0,                       this pan is rough  nside        it does not cook on my induction cook top  waste of money      
890,5.0,                       had never used this type of pan before  but am still loving it after    mos of regular use  hoping it holds up  seems like it should         
891,5.0,                       as soon as i received this pan i followed directions and coated the pan with oil and heated it for   minutes to make a coating  next day i made egg omelet and it was a pleasure to have the eggs slide off the onto my plate in one piece   i am hoping this granite type pan lasts longer than my lat one from another manufacturer      
892,5.0,                       my family and i cook a lot of eggs and vegetables so we are very wary of nonstick pans because they typically don t last or once you start cooking vegetables on them the eggs start sticking buuuuuut this pan is great    we make potatoes in it and then through eggs in after and literally nothing sticks   totally recommend this nonstick pan  also  it happens to be pretty good looking so that s a nice plus when it sits on our stove for days     
893,1.0,                       great little pan for my morning eggs  never more than low med heat   in less than a month  the eggs started to stick   it s still easy to wipe clean  but some of the egg sticks to the pan   annoying   do not recommend  spend a little more to get a better pan      
894,1.0,                       handle cracked tight off     
895,5.0,                       i was looking for a smaller fry pan than what i had been using to make scrambled eggs  our pan is really large  heavy  and cumbersome  so i wanted something smaller that would be lighter to use and easy to clean  reading through all the positive reviews  i decided to buy this one and i am really glad i did  i love that it doesn t have the toxic teflon coating  yet it is still surprisingly easy to clean  it is made really well and the price was very inexpensive  great little pan        
896,5.0,                       i ve been using this pan for a month and i like it very much so far  i make eggs in it and they don t stick      
897,5.0,                       the carote pans are by far the best pans i have ever had  they are super easy to clean and cook in  they just wipe right out  i would recommend these to anyone  i love them    my first purchase was a   piece set  i loved them so much i purchased more sizes  i got these for my camper  but we are using them in our home now too      
898,1.0,                       i ve used this pan for less than a year and the non stick surface has faded  i contacted carote support through their website  i sent images of my pan and the team told me to expect an email from the us team  it s been over a month since then and i haven t heard from either team despite multiple email follow ups  as per the description on amazon  they say they provide    month warranty and should send a replacement pan  but it looks like they re either ignoring my claim outright or waiting for    months to get over so my warranty is voided      
899,5.0,                       this frying pan is very great  it looks so beautiful that handle feeling is very good  i cooked some bacon  wiped out the pan with paper towel  and then i cooked two scrambled eggs  it worked wonderfully  non stick at all  the eggs literally slid out of the pan onto my plate  this pan is also very easy to clean  the food residue flakes off under the water power alone  it s amazing  i believe i will also buy this series products in the future      
900,5.0,                       i love this little pan  i ve used it to scramble eggs with cheese  the surface does feel rough  but the non stick property is perfect  it s also the cutest pan i ve ever owned  the way the handle is attached is unique and beautiful      
901,5.0,                       it is great  definitely highly recommended  it distributes the heat very well and so easy to clean

904,5.0,                       most of my cooking is done in cast iron  however cooking eggs needs a nonstick  reviews were not wrong  best nonstick skillet i have ever had  i m thinking i just might need a larger size for tricky foods that stick to my cast iron skillet      
905,5.0,                       this is really easy to clean and so far nothing stuck  i had it about four months and i use non metal cookware with it

910,5.0,                       shopping for skillets is a lot like shopping for pain relief  there are waaaay too many to find the type you need  and the only way to know is to get it home   try it i had some very specific things i looked for  this little skillet met them all   affordability  i can t remember how many cheap skillets i ve bought   tossed because it s a crapshoot every time  i m always the loser  i won t even look at  celebrity name cookware   or anything else i d need a bank loan for  this skillet is on the low side of the middle cooking area  skillets are measured by the top open area  this is not at all important  what is important is the bottom flat surface area   the actual cooking surface  most skillets are         less than what they say it is  your     pan has an    surface  this skillet has high  straight walls      surface durability  i am never going to drive a truck over my skillet  i m also not going to beat it with a hammer  so i m not sure what s  the point of telling me this info  it feels well made  nothing loose  nothing flimsy  that s all i care about non stick   without extra effort by me  i m never going to place a bag of wrapped candy in my pan  i m never going to burn cheese in it  either  why would i  this skillet has a nice   stoned  surface that i seasoned before first use  so far  everything still slides around like it should  that s what i m looking for  a skillet to cook food in  not a science projecti love this    pan so much that i ordered the     one  i think these skillets will be the last ones  i ll ever need   this is   must have  cookware      
911,4.0,                       i really love it  it is beautiful and functional  it cooks wonderfully  great for eggs  stirfry chinese vegtable with meat  but just don t know how long time it will keep good quality glad i purchased it  it is truly non stick and cleans up easily also non stick is no chemicals on surface      
912,4.0,                       for the first couple of months it was great  now it is not as good as before  and it s not easy to clean  as you have to  clean it gently  not to damage the pan  i bought another pot from this company and it is much better  but still  not easy to clean      
913,5.0,                       i ve only used it a few times but already love it  it is making cooking so much easier since the food really isn t sticking to the pan      
914,5.0,                       amazing     
915,5.0,                       i never expected this to be      nonstick  the texture is a little rough but it cleans so easily no matter what gets stuck  i ve burnt cheese on it and with hot water and a little soap  it came right off  very nice product would highly recommend      
916,4.0,                       very impressive  very good non sticky surface  good for all types of cooking  easy to clean      
917,5.0,                       very easy to use   non sticky at all  used for a month still like new      
918,5.0,                       my husband wants to use  metal spatulas    they last great for about a year for him   if it was just me they would last a lot longer        
919,5.0,                       it did what it was supposed to do   i followed the instructions on how to prepare the pan for use  and it actually did not stick to the pan while cooking   bottom of pan seemed to evenly heat  so not necessary to shift pan back and forth on burner to evenly cook food      
920,4.0,                       like     
921,5.0,                       so far i love this skillet  i ve been using it for a week and it has been great  i have just about worn out my calphalon and started shopping  this was a better price and had good reviews so figured i d try it out  glad i did  hubby tried it and told me to buy another one in the bigger size  for me  that says it all      
922,2.0,                       hey guys i ve had this pan a couple months   trying to use the advertised   mo warranty  because after   mo of light use  food is sticking fairly materially ordered a set of all clad pans to replace   decided to go namebrand after trying this one      will see how they stand by their warranty      
923,5.0,                       best pan i have ever used  nothing sticks to it   not even super glue   ok    im kidding about the glue thing  dont try it      but no food sticks to this pan  easy to clean      
924,1.0,                       after using the pan for   months  the pan became hard to clean  even though we use oil to cook in it   the non stick surface has worn out  wasted money on this pan  extremely disappointed      
925,5.0,                       have had two of these for several months and they have been fantastic   easy to clean doesn t stick and they look great   love them      
926,3.0,                       the heat distribution of this skillet is really good but it s only non stick if you spray it  which defeats the purpose of non stick  over all it s a good pan and i do like the coating  just wish it were truly non stick      
927,5.0,                       the smooth wood handle feels good in the hand  very easy to clean  which im super happy about  and it heats food evenly       
928,4.0,                       these pans work really well and clean up very easily  the only thing i ve found is that if i burn something in the pan  i m no a chef   it does seem to cause a slight discoloration to the pan which looks permanent  not terrible though      
929,5.0,                       i don t cook often  but was fed up with not having any reasonable cookware for frying things up when needed  this has been great for eggs  dumplings  sausages  etc  without any real hassle while cleaning the way my stainless steel stuff would cause me      
930,5.0,                    es facil de usar  y muy practica   no se pega la comida y tiene  muy buen peso y tamano y es de muy buen material         
931,1.0,                       so although this seems like a great pan  the center is raised like it s out of round upon delivery  all oil collects around the edges leaving the middle dry  so it cook unevenly  not sure how often i will even use this now that i ve tried it and it is past the return date      
932,5.0,                       amazing no stick pan first try was pancakes for me no oil or butter on pan  able to flip without a problem     
933,5.0,                       i purchased this after getting a calphalon   pc set   well i m keeping this pan and also getting a larger of this same pan and returning the calphalon  pans  the calphalon pan sets burn my food too easily and also the bottom of those pans also burn  plus it is hard to clean them whereas these carote pans are easy to clean inside and outside  even burn marks on the bottom come off quickly and easily   i would recommend to anyone looking for a good non stick pan  especially for eggs  i have made an omelet  in the    pan twice  so far  and it comes out better than i have ever done before   the omelet looks like a professional omelet      
934,1.0,                       just received this product  upon the first use i noticed a strong and foul smell  the coating on the handle can t handle the heat and turned a yellow color  the burning of the handle is what caused the smell  disappointed because i liked everything else about the pan      
935,5.0,                       it is great right now  some people have experienced performance degradation after a time of use   right now  it is the best performance i have experienced excellent non stick qualities      
936,5.0,                       these pans are nice  wow no sticking  i use them very single day  clean up is a breeze  they look brand new     worth the money        
937,5.0,                       outstanding pans  best purchase yet of non stick cookware      
938,5.0,                       these were a gift for my son   he said he likes the pans very much and that they made a huge difference compared to his old pans      
939,5.0,                       i love how these pans cook evenly  thank you     
940,5.0,                       perfect for omelettes  maybe grilled cheese  smaller than i thought  great quality      
941,5.0,                       needed to discard my teflon and black coated pans because they are super unhealthy  decided to try these pants and love them  easy to clean  nonstick  things just cook better on them  the handle does not get hot and on top of that they are actually good looking pants  people come over when the cooking and ask about them all the time  i m sure that just through my recommended at least five has been sold  highly recommend     
942,5.0,                       i was looking for alternative for wok because i make large amount of chinese chicken and beef dish that need flat surface to cook meat   from review  i decided to get this one since heat distribution is similar to wok   yes  it does job done  heat distribution is   i can cook chicken the way i want to  soft and crispy   it s very easy to clean and very light  so much better than other none stick frying pan      
943,1.0,                       i would have given a rave review for this skillet  it was one of the best i ever used  but after just   months the wood handle has started cracking  i don t know how much longer i will be able to use it  and it s too expensive to re buy every few months  very disappointing      
944,5.0,                       this pan for the price is well above my expectations     the handle is wood  sturdy smooth and not hot while cooking  my eggs cooked to perfection  with even heat  no sticking and had an authentic taste of the spices and oil i used in the pan     omg i intend to buy a couple more of these well made  well price     glad i stumbled on a true bargain      
945,5.0,                       i ordered this pan a week ago  i am so pleased with it that i ordered a second one  it heats quickly and evenly on my induction stove  it is very easy to clean  i love the wooden style handle  the lid from an old used up pan fits perfectly   the price can t be beat   i thought it might be flimsy but it has a nice weight and won t warp like my old pan that was flimsy by comparison      
946,5.0,                       i m a daily user of this pan   all i can say is that it s the best pan i ever owned   it s probably not for you if you can t take care of anything or follow instructions though   but i have had no issues      
947,4.0,                       pan is large yet light weight  non stick surface works well with eggs only problem is my pan has defects shown in the photos   double check yours upon delivery     
948,1.0,                       so this seems to be anything but a non stick pan  every time i ve made pancakes  which should be a prominent thing for non stick pans  the pancake is like glued to the actual pan  resulting in my scraping it off the pan leaving behind an excess amount of cooked pancake batter on the pan      
949,1.0,                       the frying pan was great but on may   the handle fell off and i might ve used it    times for eggs only because the eggs came out perfect but i m disappointed about the handle falling off     
950,3.0,                       i like the body of the pan itself  it is non stick  sturdy and easy to clean  the handle is awful  it does not seem to be built to tolerate heat and it not only became quickly discolored at the base  but gives off a strange chemical smell when it gets too hot even now  almost a year after purchasing      
951,5.0,                       great pan to make a sauce      
952,5.0,                       flipping eggs without a spatula   so far nothing is sticking to this pan  i do carefully clean it  just dish soap and a rag  my dad was so impressed wit it he had me order one for my mom      
953,5.0,                         year update    this pan is awesome  i use it daily for eggs and breakfast meat  as long as you are gentle with the cleaning and don t use metal utensils to cook with this pan is made to last   i was so satisfied with the   inch pan i also bought the    inch pan as well   definitely recommended       
954,5.0,                       awesome pan     
955,3.0,                       just received  it  very sturdy and looks well made  however i have no idea about its care as the instructions were in  chinese        
956,5.0,                       so far this pan is great  i have ordered several more replacing my old teflon pans  heavier but not to heavey  easy to clean  time will tell how they hold up      
957,5.0,                       we use this pan almost daily  it seems to heat food evenly and is superbly non stick      
958,5.0,                       great size for family meals     
959,5.0,                       very good product
