0,5.0,                       fantastic for tracking your running or biking  really great for tracking and improving run times and pace as well  the heart rate sensor isn t the most accurate thing while working out  but i didn t get it for that so no big deal to me really  at rest the heart rate monitor seems pretty close to a good ol  pulse count  sleep tracking is a little wonky as well  sometimes the sleep times don t match up with reality  and there s a catagory for rem sleep  but i ve had this watch for   months and never got a reading on it  maybe i m sleeping wrong and not ever actually getting any rem sleep      
1,5.0,                       very resourceful  using for cross countryseason  able to connect with team  set goals   challenges     
2,5.0,                       i bought this watch a month ago to track my heart rate   cardio while biking and playing pickleball  i am not a techi guru and i wanted something simple  i can track everything with two buttons before i start my exercise  after my workout i can sync it to my phone and i get a complete view of my heart rate  i think the step count is way more accurate than the fitbit i had  plus  i get notifications when i get a text  an email or if someone is calling me  it even tracks my sleep patterns  and i charge once a week with a simple charging cable  no battery to remove  could not be happier with the watch      
3,5.0,                       love this watch  it has everything i need on it  at first i was worried that i wouldn t like the bluetooth function  so it can send alerts from my phone   but honestly  it is so handy  i love that i can workout anywhere with it because of its lap and lap pace features      
4,1.0,                       this product worked for exactly   days  when the battery was down to about        i put it on the charger for the night  not only did it not charge but it drained the remainder of the battery charge and would not re charge  i contacted fitbit customer service and they were of little help and will replace only the instrument itself  i would still need to buy the charger etc    which would be an additional cost to me      
5,1.0,                       i had my forerunner    for   months  then it un sync d from my phone  i had to sync it back by resetting all the stored information  less than    days with the watch  it no longer holds a charge i look at  your orders on my amazon profile and the last day to return the product was weeks ago  however  amazon has a support feature to connect me to an  expert   their word not mine    i connect and am sent to a call center somewhere  the person asks my name and that s it  i heard lots of noise in the background but no one is talking to me  after a few hello s   i hang up after     years of running  i only wanted to get my heart rate  well  that was too much to ask  i will continue using my reliable app on my phone garmin and amazon  you both let me down on this one  i am only out     so it is not a huge lost but i will be more skeptical with future purchases      
6,1.0,                       i was planning to this watch for monitoring my pulse during workouts  the readings are erratic and completely irrelevant  i can feel my heartbeat going up  but that is not recorded at all or is delayed by several minutes  sometimes it shows a very high heartbeat just prior to exercise  i tried wearing it at different locations on my wrist  but that didn t help  also  the program is awkward  in short  a waste of money      
7,1.0,                       ive had the watch for   months   recently the watch have been disconnecting with my samsung phone  ive had to delete the pairing and reset the watch and delete the records from garmin app on my phone  which was a real disappointment cause i had a lot of  stats  i was able to pair it again  but it disconnected once again  now the watch cant pair with my phone at all   its pretty useless now with the garmin app      
8,5.0,                       i like this watch a lot  i seem to have an issue with the sleep tracker  i thought it would automatically know when i was sleeping but i guess not  for example when i take a nap it shows my heart rate drop into my sleeping heart rate but it s not measured as me sleeping  so idk  but if it know when i plan on sleeping and is scheduled it records it fine  but if i sleep past my predicted time it doesn t count it as sleep but for all other purposes i love it  it works great for my runs  walks  and my cycling  i have not had it long but i m already quite attached to it great battery life  it lasts for days  i ve never run it dead yet but i ve gone a few days without charging it at all      
9,2.0,                       was not as advertised  my wife is a runner and use it for workouts but it doesn t track these as it advertised  she is not pleased with it  she fights with it and she know prefers not to wear it instead of fighting with it  we ve had garmens before and not these problems it is disappointing      
10,4.0,                       tracks your work outs  steps  calories  sleeping  heart rate  sync to your phone and get notifications  battery lasts up to   days before you have to charge it  also  it s waterproof  i personally don t wear it to bed because i sleep at weird angles and it cuts off the circulation in my arm  plus  i don t know if it s the watch or me  but it doesn t track my sleeping patterns well  sometimes it will say that i slept between   and    hours when i sleep less than   every night  do i sleep with my eyes open  anyway  great watch  i love it      
11,5.0,                       watch is exactly what i needed  heart rate  gps  step counter  multi activity function and a few more features i do not use  text call notifications  a weather   the app available for iphones is such an easy and low maintenance way of keeping track of marathon ultra training and mountain biking  holds a charge for about   days  with gps activated for activity about       minutes a day  definitely a satisfied customer      
12,5.0,                       the product basically works providing a breakthrough on pricing on a gps heart rate monitor  the mileage reported seems to have a systematic error at a rate of reading about     miles longer every    miles     error   i am satisfied with it  i heard the more expensive ones are more accurate      
13,5.0,                       this is a fantastic gps watch  i bought it to track my miles while running  so i could leave my phone at home  it s obviously great for that but it does so much  pair it with your phone and the app keeps track of everything  sleep  steps  calories burned  and so much more  it does everything i need it to and then some  love       
14,4.0,                       this watch is a great motivator  i get out there even when i don t feel like it  however the watch band is poor  very poor  it is silicone and held on to the watch body with screws  the screws pull through the soft silicone  it has happened twice now and i m not rough on the watch  in fact i rarely take it off  i am ordering an oem nylon band to see if it is better  love the watch  dislike the band  poor engineering     
15,5.0,                       great watch  for a hobby runner  this has all the features i needed  the different sport modes  outdoor run  indoor run  bike  cardio  walk  are well designed for any activity i would need  it connects quickly to the gps and has been very accurate so far  at times it can take a bit of time to synch to the garmin connect app  but overall it works fairly quickly  battery life is good  and the large number of wrist holes is perfect for any size      
16,4.0,                       the goodbuilt in heart beat rate monitor  very clear black and white display  great  low economical price at about    for refurbished unit  good sleep tracking  even better running activity tracking with more stats than you re likely to know what to do with for a beginner  waterproof  almost good enough for swimming the badgps graph results are very spotty for swimming  this is a      model that cannot be software upgraded very much and is not compatible with garmin s new eco system of free apps  this is arguably the greatest deal breaker for me  the fact you cannot enjoy the new free apps  it is as if garmin decided to abandon or kill the sales for the forerunner    by dropping support for it via software upgrades  it is also possible that its small amount of ram  chipset and older cpu simply can t handle more modern apps      
17,5.0,                       i ve only had it a few days  so i haven t worked with all the features yet this watch has great display and it doesn t look huge on my wrist like some others i ve tried  i love that it vibrates when i hit a mile marker my one complaint is that i would like it to be able to display the time and my mileage at the same time  that way i can cut my workout short if i need to so i can get ready for work on time i look forward to using it for intervals      
18,4.0,                       a nice tool overall  it keeps track of all the basic activities you do during the day  sleep quality  walking  inactivity period  calories burned        it s very user friendly when you want to record your outdoor activities  but lacks the possibility to customize the list of preset activities or to use it as a simple stopwatch to record laps and times it s useful to use it in conjunction to garming connect and strava to set personal goals and keep your motivation going as a semi professional runner it has all the basic functionality you need and be totally satisfied      
19,2.0,                       this watch has the basic useful features for runners trying to track and improve their results   but  none of those features work properly   in fact  this watch is almost useless   i m quite disappointed of garmin and will not favor their products next round i can go into details  but i went back to check the reviews and found that many are saying the same thing and explain this well   i have no clue how it averages     stars   perhaps a large portion of them is crappy      
20,5.0,                       this watch does everything i need in a smart fitness watch at about     of the cost of an apple watch  the functionality is not nearly as good as the apple watch  but did i mention that it s only     the price  i was going to get the apple watch  but instead i got five of these garmins for the same price  i love a good deal the fit is comfortable  i wear it snug on my wrist to ensure the heart rate monitor is fully engaged  the health data is just as useful as what other fitness watchers offer  and will migrate across most major platforms to allow other apps to use the data as well  don t expect to respond to text messages without your phone  as the watch doesn t do that  you ll need to physically use the phone for that the garmin forerunner    does  however  do the following quite well it tells the time it monitors your pulse it counts your steps it tracks your runs exercise it monitors your sleep it shows recent texts emails it displays caller id and allows remote answering it reflects calorie burn statistics it pairs with weather apps it makes coffee in the morning if you re looking for a smart fitness watch that does all the above  get yourself a garmin forerunner    and a starbucks card and go live your best life  recommended      
21,1.0,                       i had the watch for   months and the band broke  it is a weird band too so it is not easy to replace  there are some custom screws on it   pretty pricey watch product to have a very flimsy and cheap band on it  you can get cheap products for less money follow up after garmin sent me a new band   i waited a few weeks for a replacement band from garmin at no cost  they only had one color available and it took weeks to get the new band  pretty poor service  i put the new band on and it broke as well after two months  this is a custom band so you cannot replace it with a quality band easily  i suggest another product due to the poorly designed wrist band it comes with      
22,4.0,                       was looking to replace a timex gps watch for running that was several years old  have used this for over a month  the gps function is great compared to my old watch   finds signal quickly and never drops  although almost always sunny when i ve run   the only major miss is that when it buzzes at the end of a mile  it only displays your time for that mile and not total time elapsed   so you have to wait several seconds to see total time again i ve never worn a step counter and was excited about that function on this watch  but it s been inaccurate many times   a few times i ve walked several blocks without it recording any steps  maybe it s user error  but i would not recommend this watch if that function is a priority for you overall good simple gps watch   accurate and easy to read while running      
23,5.0,                       this watch is perfect for my fitness uses  i use it for my runs and for my cardio workouts at the gym  it downloads everything right to my strava as well  i also like that it tracks my sleep  great watch for the price without all the extra bells and whistle s that i do not need  it s also my favorite color      
24,4.0,                       love it  it does all i could ever ask for  quick charge  and i get days worth of runs out of it  however  during half marathon training it did need to be charged more often  but still lasted me anywhere from   to   runs depending on time spend and how long gps was being used  the worst thing  and it may be my phone not the watch  is pairing and keeping it paired with my phone  keeping the text and phone call notifications off helps with battery life immensely      
25,2.0,                       if a hrm is not accurate it throws off all   s associated w  your workout   i ve come to realize strapless and  transdermal light measurements are not up to speed for accuracy   i returned my first low budget and sprung over      thinking i got what i paid for previously   my    year old pulsar strap still is more accurate than the modern day gadgets   i was trying to get away from my strap but looks like i m just gonna upgrade at     the cost if anyone has a good strapless under       please pass on info   thanks     
26,5.0,                       so far i love it   tracks my mileage even on horse back  easy to use and that was imperative for me as i have a short attention span with technology   wish it had a swimming option though      
27,5.0,                       i love this watch  it syncs easily to my phone  it s easy to operate  it gives me lots of data that i can actually use to improve my health  it syncs with other apps  it s durable    i never take it off  so different from the three fitbit  s i tried      
28,3.0,                       i tried this both on a marked running trail and also the track i love the heartrate monitor feature but the pace is unreliable when i used it to run     miles on a     m track  the     miles recorded about       m past the finish line  i compared it to my friend s garmin f    and his     miles ended exactly on the finish line  due to the error in estimating distance  my pace per mile was much slower than actual  i returned this watch as the most important variable for training and races for me is pace  not heartrate  my old garmin f   was very accurate in pace distance      
29,3.0,                       the strap that keeps the band from flailing around broke after less than a year  so now i have to either give up on the watch or be constantly annoyed at it  which is frustrating  i cannot think of any good reason why it would break  there was no undue stress on it otherwise it was a pretty good watch  i got it to track runs and it performed decently at that  except for a few times when it couldn t get a gps lock for some reason  oh and it was also quite bad at tracking steps as it sometimes somehow interpreted my    minutes of commuting per day as walking  my car is not that bad  c mon      
30,1.0,                       bought this watch june   th  mileage was never accurate  now the watch is frozen and does not work august   th  return window closed july   th      
31,5.0,                       this is my third smart watch  the first was a garmin vivosmart hr   which i had for four years  was an ok watch  the second was a less expensive watch with decent reviews on amazon  i returned that watch after a month of trying to get it to work properly  the app for the watch was poor and after reinstalling the app a few times and completely resetting the watch  i decided enough and returned  this new garmin works right out of the box  the application works well and the watch took a couple of days to get used to  but i am very pleased with the overall experience  i ride     miles a week in   plus events   my only concern is the accuracy of the milage  i have used map my ride in the past and when i have compared the two after the exact same ride  garmin app shows i have ridden almost     farther  plus burned     fewer calories  i know the calorie burn is an estimate  so i m not overly concerned  and i try and ride an additional mile to make up for the difference      
32,5.0,                       i bought this for my    yr old daughter  who like many others in the same age bracket  image is very important    i am happy to report she is very happy with the product and has been wearing it every since   it is waterproof  and while she cannot respond via the watch  she can look at messages notifications much easier than on her phone  so while it is a work out watch  it also does much of the same thing as the much higher priced options      
33,5.0,                       best watch i ve ever owned   battery lasts me   days if i m not using the gps  much more durable than an apple watch or the galaxy watch  waterproof and excellent performance   this is the second forerunner    i ve bought  i only replaced my first one bc it got ran over by a car lol       recommend        
34,2.0,                       i had high hopes for this wrist heart rate gps unit   i am a runner of over    years   i  have used quite a few heart rate monitors and this one is the least accurate   i have a resting heart rate of    that has been confirmed by holter monitor and multiple chest strap heart rate monitors   this garmin gave me a resting heart rate over and over again at    bpm to    bpm   i used it s gps on a bike ride and a couple of runs in conjunction with my iphone gps along a route i have tracked with my car odometer and my iphone many times and in   miles the gps from the garmin was just under   tenths of a mile short of what i know to be an accurate distance   that would put the gps from this unit off by over a mile in a marathon i would have given it a   star rating but it is easy to read and the buttons for me were easy to use not recommending this product   will be returning      
35,4.0,                       i refer to this watch as  baby s first garmin    i wanted something simple to track my pace and mileage when i run and this does just that  also fun to see your total steps and heart rate  etc  throughout the day  don t know how accurate the sleep portion is but fun to take a look at that  too  overall  this watch does what it says    note   does not sync with iphone for music control etc  that part was disappointing but my own fault for not realizing  in general  this watch opens the gateway to garmin products  and about a year later  i m eyeing some way fancier versions      
36,2.0,                       loved this watch     while it worked  it did everything i wanted it to do  the gps function was awesome for bike rides  running  hiking etc and the heart rate monitor worked well for the most part to help me with my fitness goals then it just suddenly stopped working a month after the warranty expired  i couldn t initially return it but to garmin customer service s credit and with the fact i had a similar issue with a different model less than a year prior  they shipped me a replacement the replacement worked well  but again failed approx     months later three garmin watches in just over three years  think i ve finally learned my lesson  never again garmin         
37,1.0,                       my forerunner    has top right button stuck after   years usage  after contact garmin they offer me out of warranty replacement for     plus shipping tax  the replacement item only have   days warranty so it s not worth fixing   i did a search and it seems the issue is pretty common so be aware before you purchase it  just to compare my   years vivoactive still works fine      
38,1.0,                       stopped acquiring satellite signal anywhere after only   months  hard reset and the problem persists plus it refuses to pair with any device now  garmin software is horrible and gives contradictory instructions  zero support from garmin  what a trash product  will never buy a product from this company again      
39,5.0,                       love the product for its durability and functionality  the watch didn t come with directions but i was able to look up how to do  run walk mode the main reason for purchasing   the app is fairly easy to use  i am very satisfied with my purchase      
40,5.0,                       super lightweight  battery last for about     days  i leave it on when i shower  swim  workout  sleep  everything  and when i do take it off  i take it off for an hour to charge and then we are good to go   great for exactly what i need it to do  only annoying thing is that when you get a text it notifies you of every single text that is unread on your phone  really love the simplicity of this  great buy      
41,5.0,                       this turned out to be a great watch for a    year old boy  the band is a little big but not bad he started running this year   loves having data for this distance  routes    pace  we needed a watch with standalone gps that could connect to the computer instead of a cell phone  the garmin forerunner    works perfectly  he s used it daily  as a wristwatch   for recording exercise  for four months now without any problems      
42,1.0,                       this product was returned within the week weeks ago  i used ups  the product was scanned from the amazon return page image provided      
43,4.0,                       i bought this watch in june        in march      it just stopped working  i sent back to garmin to replace or repair  as they said it was eligible for  i received a credit for         i called them and they said i did not sent it back correctly even though i used their rma  to send back so no deal   no watch after writing my review  i contacted garmin by email a second time  they contacted me and they are going to replace my watch  so i added a star to my review      
44,5.0,                       i think this watch is clunky and unattractive   having said that  i can t stop wearing it   i love running with it   keeping an eye on my heart rate  clocking my laps and pace on runs  and seeing notifications and texts that come in on my smartphone   i rely on this watch so much that i can t stop wearing it   i know the more expensive model looks neater  but i just couldn t justify spending more   it runs out of juice in     days  depending on data usage   i m confident it will work just fine for a whole marathon  since i just ran    miles with it and it only went down two bars after i completed the run   i take it off at night  though  since i get a pinkened area on the skin underneath the pulse detector if i wear it constantly      
45,5.0,                       i bought this device to replace a much older model that finally quit working  the new design is easy to read and the functions are still in the same place as the old one  that made it very easy to get used to  it seems to be pretty accurate and it is very lightweight      
46,4.0,                       i had the forerunner    for almost   months  i m very happy with the battery life  lasting   weeks for daily activities  i m not sure about the accuracy of the distance  since it gives me about    miles for       steps  it is consistent though  i keep it on for bathing and no problems  overall i m very happy with this tracker      
47,4.0,                       this is a great watch for what my husband uses it for  he runs and hikes a lot so this is a great way for him to not have to carry his phone  the gps does loose signal on occasion  but it is nothing too crazy or out of ordinary for all trackers      
48,5.0,                       i wasn t looking to spend this much on a watch  but i m so glad i did  best gps watch i ve ever had  it picks up location relatively quickly and very accurately tracks mileage and speed  this watch s battery life is great   when new   keeping in mind that i used it only on runs am not to track steps throughout the day  the battery lasted a solid two weeks before it needed a charge  it charges quickly and holds the charge well  great product  would reccomend      
49,5.0,                       i am an    year old walker with a pacemaker  before the watch  i could only guess my milage by checking my route on google maps  solved  my concern for my heart rate is obvious but since i covered my distances without laboring i was confident i was well under my max rate  at first my rate seemed abnormally high so checking the manual pdf i found the watch was too low on my wrist  after moving it two fingers from the wrist bone then everything then became normal  the only thing i didn t care for or want was my sleep results  i changed my sleep time to zero and it disappeared  great  overall now after a weeks use i know my route distances and i can the mix them up to provide some variety and enable me to meet my goals and advance my pace and distances without fear      
50,5.0,                       with the    there is very little need for anything else  ive been running for years and had the     before this one  i loved my     but this is a great improvement   tracks my heart rate all the time   bluetooth connectivity to my phone lets me sync without a pc  and tracks my runs great   if you only run  this is the watch for you   if you want to track swimming or skiing then by the more advanced version      
51,3.0,                       we didn t keep the watch long enough to really give it a good review  we returned it because it wasn t touchscreen and i didn t realize that when i purchased it      
52,5.0,                       i am using it for bicycle rides  although i have dedicated bicycle computer and often use both at the same time  i always opted to upload my ride to strava com from a watch  because gps is incredibly accurate and i got heart rate at the same time  giving me better power effort calculation from strava definitely the best bicycle accessory i bought and it is also used for walks and hikes  counts my steps  etc      
53,1.0,                       i bought this watch for my wife for christmas  she is a nurse so it s important that she can check her messages on the fly being on her feet all day  it only took   months before it stops connecting to the blue tooth which kind of defeats the purpose of a smart watch      
54,2.0,                       perfectly fine as a fitness tracker and treadmill watch   but the hr function is marginal at best when running outdoors   athletes who depend on accurate hr data should stick with the hr chest strap until garmin fine tune their optical wrist based monitors      
55,4.0,                       this is the watch to have  i use it mostly for cardio and sleep tracking  i love it and would highly recommend it     
56,2.0,                       loved it until it no longer turned on  it lasted   year and   months  unfortunately just past it s one year warranty period  my primary use was for running and the convenience of it s message notifications  i would occasionally swim with it      
57,1.0,                       i purchased this watch abput   weeks ago i bought it primarily to use while i bike  i also wore it on a trip to disney and the beach it worked great when i got it  i bought a few different color bands and faces to keep it fun after our trip to disney it sat on my vanity for a week or two and the battery died i put on the charger and nothing   checked all the connections  nothing  not charging  not powering up  i left it hooked up all night in hopes that the battery was just so drained that it needed alot of time to gain some juice   this morning  nothing it s dead   to late to return    i really liked this watch  i going to  try to contact the manufacturer   but who wants to deal with all that  just want a reliable watch that works every time you need it to      
58,4.0,                       i need something that shows the little gps map of where i was  not just a calculation of how many miiles i ran  i also wanted it for hiking when off the grid  so it just wasn t what i needed it is very comfortable  which was something i was looking for      
59,3.0,                       i was looking for a basic gps watch to track runs   not much more than time and distance  which this does a great job at my biggest complaint is it takes so long to get a gps lock  most days it s     minutes if i ve been using it regularly  but if i don t use it for a week or so it s taken up to    minutes  forcing a sync from the app helps a little  but not always      
60,5.0,                       i bought this watch as i wanted a basic gps watch and i wanted the live watch feature  this watch is good for the beginner gps watch wearer or the beginner athlete  but it s also great for people like me  who just want the basics and don t want to get bogged down by a million features  i use it primarily for running  but i do use it for cross training  a lot of biking  as well  it can be a little inaccurate sometimes  generally anywhere from     to     off for running  indoor and outdoor   i compared it to other garmins that my friends wear and theirs were the same  my only complaint is it doesn t track mileage for outdoor biking  i probably need an accessory for it  we ll see how i like it when i start training for a tri  overall  i like it and i m glad i bought it  i would definitely recommend this watch      
61,4.0,                       i would definitely recommend this model the bpm tracking is very accurate once  warmed up    if you re not keeping the watch to your wrist all day  i d recommend to start wearing it     mn before any cardio or workout sessionthis watch is very very light  and the green model turns out to be quite good looking syncing it to the app on your smartphone is a must as it easily let you navigate through history of runs and details      
62,2.0,                       i bought my garmin    in december       and i loved it  it tracked my runs and allowed me to control spotify without pulling out my phone mid run  i loved the text alerts since i have a tendency to lose my phone in my backpack    people could actually reach me  i didn t mind the look  kind of reminded me of the old calculator watches  but then things started going wrong  the eyelets on the band started breaking  so i had to wear the watch looser and looser  the watch would suddenly drop the connection to my phone and be unable to get it back for months  then suddenly be connected again  the sounds would stay on even if i manually turned them off  and finally  yesterday  it up and died mid swim  even though it s water resistant to   m  now i m stuck trying to find another brand or model  hopefully one that will last longer than a year and a half before becoming e waste      
63,1.0,                       i bought the garmin chest strap to monitor my hr while road biking and linked it to my     garmin gps unit  i also bought the forerunner watch to monitor my hr while engaging in other sports in and out of the gym   what a disaster    the hr on the watch has a huge lag and you only see the display when you push a button with your opposite hand  this means that you can never properly measure your  peak  rate in real time as by the time it shows up on the watch display  your heart is  already in recovery mode    it s also clunky   but i don t care about the esthetics  just wanted a reliable hr monitor display like i had with my timex triathlon watch   chestband  unfortunately timex stopped manufacturing this watch  i regret having given mine to my daughter so i could have sent this garmin back for a refund      
64,4.0,                       i like it a lot and that says a lot because i am hard to please  the watch is comfortable unlike many out there  the battery lasts about     days which is again good and unlike apple watch or other competitors  it provides all the functionality i need  i use it to monitor my heart rate  my workout time  and to receive text message updates from my phone  i definitely recommend this product      
65,5.0,                       this is my first running watch and i could not be happier   it tracks all you statistic in an easy format to understand   heart rate  distance  your route  speed overall and mile splits  cadence  you name it and it seems to do it   the app you put on your phone or computer is awesome also   it comes set up and ready to go   i received mine on a friday and ran a   k on saturday morning   sure has made running more efficient and fun also   but it is a computer so expect a few computer glitches every now and then   had to do a restart once as it froze up during recharging   also could not load the garmin connect app on my computer when i first tried  but as usual just  you tube  the problem and you can always find the fixes   all in all  this is a lot of watch for the price   my son is a personal trainer and he says it is one of the most popular watches liked by his clients      
66,3.0,                       i ve had this one day  it was easy to figure out and connect to smartphone through the garmin connect app  unfortunately  the online information is misleading about step counter  it will show up on the app only and  requires either leaving bluetooth on or turning it on for syncing  which is not convenient to have to look at phone to see the number of steps   step counter does not show up on the watch s screen  which is the main feature i wanted  i will return this for a watch that has this feature      
67,2.0,                       this watch is just ok  it doesn t automatically track your sleep  you have to enter your normal sleep and awake times  not convenient for a rotating shift worker  also sometimes it won t track your workouts  so that is very inaccurate if you want to use it as a fitness watch  it seems to track steps accordingly as well as heart rate      
68,1.0,                       well  received this august         worked great for   months  once i figured out how to use it as it comes with no instruction manuel  now  the only correct reading it gives  is time of day       
69,5.0,                       i run marathons  and i recently bought garmin forerunner    to replace the old forerunner     that i had for    years  today i ran    miles with my running partner  and my watch used only     of its battery s life  while my running partner s watch that is an apple watch  used     of its battery s life   that means i can run two marathons with only one charge  but my friend s watch  battery s life   can not last in a full marathon  my new watch so far has given me everything i need during my run  and the overall information i receive from it are very useful      
70,5.0,                       i upgraded from the    to the     i like that it tracks my sleep and heart rate   really like that it automatically transfers the data to garmin connect and i no longer have to do it manually   nice upgrade  looks great  i use it for running and cycling      
71,5.0,                       very impressed   the level of accuracy was much better than the fitbit i had previously   it was much more user friendly that the samsung gear i had tried temporarily   the information available on the app or the web were more than i probably needed   the web version has a map with a  ball   that moves over the route you ran   fun to watch   also like the charging cord   i don t think i am hard on cords inlets but my fitbit quit charging after   months   i don t see how i could mess this up      
72,5.0,                       i have given this watch a five star review because this is an excellent fitness watch  it looks sleek and sporty i chose the wild lime green  and wear it day and night  and does exactly what i need it to do   accurate heart rate  distance on runs or bike rides  speed  calories burned  etc  it s very easy to use but still has lots of great features   today while driving the screen suddenly went blank  when i got home and tried to charge it  nothing  i followed online directions for soft and hard reset   nothing  i contacted garmin and immediately the customer service rep was able to diagnose a  display hardware failure   i have had the watch for    months    months past the   year warranty  thankfully garmin replaced the watch but unfortunately they charged me      while i appreciate being given a significant discount  my previous garmin forerunner lasted   years and still works  while technically garmin is certainly within their rights to not even give me anything at all  as a customer having an expensive product like this only last for    months  and then paying anything at all for its replacement or repair  doesn t build brand loyalty  i like it so much i paid for the new one but i m disappointed that was the offer from the company  i would have liked the product to have either been repaired or replaced at no cost  a recognition from the company that it should still work less than a year and a half      
73,5.0,                       great watch for the price point  not a hard core workout person anymore  just wanted basic accurate tracking and it delivers for my runs and biking      
74,4.0,                           update review      months later my original review was inaccurate as i jumped to conclusions saying the watch face was cracked but forgotten i had put a glass screen protector on and it was the protector that was cracked  not the watch face  so if you buy this watch spend the extra    and get a screen protector  its a lot cheaper to replace them than the watch face     original review    i ve had this watch for exactly    days and the glass display screen broke  worn it non stop and only taken off to recharge  i would highly recommend getting the protection plan  since amazon will only accept returns up to    days after purchase it looks like i will need to pay to have garmin customer service repair other then that it s a great watch  i believe it tracks everything fairly accurate  the gps is spot on  along with the heart rate monitor  i would reccomend this watch to anyone who is beginning running or biking      
75,2.0,                       this unit replaced my  st gen apple watch  which i gave to my spouse who s more into sports   a few things not covered by other reviewers   the glass is anything but oleophobic  as a matter of fact  even cheapest glass on regular watches collect less fingerprints than this one  this glass specimen is so bad that it s hard to see through at times   hr error filtering is noticeably worse than  st gen apple watch  you can wear apple watch somewhat loosely around your wrist and still get accurate hr readings  with garmin  you have to wear it tight  or your readings will be all over the place   to see any non rt data  you have to run the app on your phone   there s no way to use this watch as a standalone navigation device  as it does not display your coordinates   backlight has   settings   off  and  nukelar   you can use it as a flashlight at night   contrary to some reviews  the display is not e ink or  like e ink   it s an old fashioned lcd personally  i returned mine and for     extra got an apple watch    no regrets      
76,5.0,                       like the different modes no   fluff   here    even a plain black screen for the apps  and not even touch screen but the apps are close to the truth   it does what it says it does  and i don t have to worry about sweat affecting it sfor   i can even swimi in it without sorry      
77,5.0,                       it s simple enough to use if all you want to do is track your mileage or pace  which is mostly what i do   but has a lot of easy  cool features like measuring your sleep habits and time   it syncs effortlessly to the garmin connect app  which is intuitive and clutter free   the heart rate monitor also seems pretty accurate   i know my resting pulse and i know what my pulse usually is when i run  and the heart monitor consistently reports the same rates  i bought one for my son and he loves it too      
78,3.0,                       great battery life  nice size  i have large wrists so a big square watch is what i wanted   comfortable   stars because it took a few minutes to read hr when sweating   isn t that exactly when you would need the hr to be accurate      
79,5.0,                       i love this watch   no frills  and very useful  doesn t stay synced to phone but that is not huge for me  i love to upload my activities daily and track progress  recommend      
80,5.0,                       my son loves it  purchase the warranty  it works great unless someone steps on it because they left it laying on the steps      
81,3.0,                       good evening  i bought this garmin  however i have a problem with the charger because is different that the correct charger so i cant use my garmin please help because i think you must have to change me that thanks      
82,3.0,                       things were going well for the first       months then the face of the watch detached today at the driving range   i liked the information this watch provided  especially when synched with the garmin connect app   unfortunately i previously had a fitbit hr and went through three in about    months  all repaired and finally reimbursed under warranty  and now the product i replaced the fitbit with just fell apart   not sure the two products i bought are robust enough to withstand much more than walking  running and cycling   this product came apart under the shock of hitting golf balls   i never buy warranties  but luckily i  purchased one for the garmin   it probably is still covered under the manufacturer s warranty   will call them tomorrow and let you know how they handle this just a follow up to what i wrote above   i had to report the damaged tracker via e mail   the next day i was contacted via e mail by a garmin representative asking for a photo of the damage   i attached the same picture used here   i was then given instructions to mail it back  at my cost  which i did on the   st of october   they did keep me appraised of the progress and on november   th  i did receive a completely new watch in the mail  complete with a new charge cord  they told me to return only the watch so now i have two cords    so in regards to fixing replacing a broken tracker  as i am now wearing my fifth in about    months  fitbit who shipped a new unit even before they received the old one back  at their cost  and provided phone support has garmin beat other thoughts about this tracker that beat my old tracker s  is the length of time between having to charge it and its waterproof characteristics   i doubt it is rated for it  but i forgot to remove it this week while diving in belize  and did a    foot dive and the watch appears fine      
83,5.0,                       my high schooler loves this for track and cross county   she likes how easy it is to use and how she can track her sleep   she s been trying to increase the quality of her runs and sleep more and feels this watch offers both to help her      
84,3.0,                       i initially liked the watch  it s great to head out without needing my phone for tracking  it tracks my route well  and is comfortable on my small    wrist  the problem i have is that when i get home the auto sync with my phone almost never happens and i often have to uninstall and reinstall the app on my phone  i also at one point had to allow complete control of my phone system before it would sync  then i had to go into the permissions to turn off access to all my other apps  too much effort involved  it s sitting in a drawer and i am back to using my fitbit versa lite     
85,3.0,                       i wish that the screen was a little bigger   it has several modes for walking running and cardio work outs   i have not figured out how to see the heart rate function while i am working out   it does display minutes  and distance while i am active and using the watch   the heart rate is available as a stat when i down load my event onto my coputer     the is little documentation in the user s manual      
86,5.0,                       i have had this tracker for a week   already love it   i had a fitbit for years   their app has become trash so i looked for something else   got an amazefit bip   don t wast your money on that   this garmin is keeping my step count perfectly   i would walk     miles with the others and get credit for   miles   drove me crazy   this thing has been giving me full credit for a      mile walk in my building back and forth in a long hallway   i do that   times a day and it is working perfectly   it givems me credit for all my steps   i know how many steps and count my laps   i am so happy with this right now   so far every walk has been close if not exact   i don t even know how to deal with it   haha   should have spent my money on this long ago         
87,5.0,                       i tried two other devices  the yamay smart match and the fitbit versa    as an avid runner  logged    miles a week for years and now about        neither was accurate for mileage on the road or on the treadmill  i nearly lost faith when i finally purchased a garmin     the watch is very very close to being perfect for distance calculations  steps  and metrics monitoring such as heart rates  for a runner there are a number of different data tables that will help you get back into it if you fall behind on activity or diet  this is a great watch for a great price and i would buy three more if i could  highly recommend      
88,5.0,                       i ve had this for   weeks   it has a lot of nice features  is easy to set up and use  and is comfortable   the battery life on mine while using it almost daily for gps tracking for running walking is at least a week which is great  and it charges pretty fast   the app itself provides a ton of information for heart rate  sleep  gps  altitude  speed  etc   i do find the gps to be slightly off  but it s not enough for me to really care about      
89,4.0,                       i have had this watch for about   years now  very durable and works as advertised  the only downside id say is i dont think step counter is entirely accurate  i have walked on treadmills with it and it doesn t always seem to accumulate steps  i can go   mile on a treadmill and it will sometimes only add         steps to my daily total  a mile should generally be around      steps  it seems good for regular walking or running   the gps function is pretty accurate you can record an activity and then look at it later on the app or web page and it will show your route and give a few other basic metrics like speed  time etcanother odd thing i have seen i have had the watch reset itself a few times and so all step counters and activity minutes for the day are lost i have worn the watch in the ocean  swimming pools  showers and saunas and it  held up well  the battery life is pretty good too with minimal gps usage would last about   days   i have needed to contact garmin twice for small issues and their support is excellent  i just ordered a     music and will be trading in this watch to garmin     
90,1.0,                       as a heart monitoring device during exercise  this watch is useless   heart rate readings are very erratic  actually showing a declining heart rate while activity increases and continuing to show hr decline even after     minutes of running hard   garmin sent a replacement watch but it refuses to refund money because watch was purchased through amazon and amazon s return policy is    days  if purchased direct from garmin the refund policy is   year   my first and last garmin purchase      
91,4.0,                       for reference  i run       miles per week   i train and race with this watch  and have owned it for over a month   bottom line  i think this is plenty of watch for training and racing  and i don t think the extra features in the     are worth the price difference  i would buy this again based on my experience so far   i was reluctant to make this purchase because i have previously only used  dumb  watches to track my total time and splits  this was the cheapest option i could find that had the features i thought i needed things i like  on roads  the distance is close enough to be useful  the pace  usually  adjusts fairly quickly  battery life has never been an issue  but i charge it about an hour every     days  you re able to adjust semi customize  up to   via the iphone app  screens of data  through the app  this is fairly quick so it s something you can adjust before a workout or race if you find that necessary  the heart rate monitor seems reasonably accurate  note  i had to update the firmware on the watch and soft reset the watch before this was the case   i like the data the iphone app captures that i can review later things i don t like  in the woods or anywhere with quick turns  switchbacks  etc  this thing is totally worthless for distance pace  i can t speak to it with the same authority  but i m guessing it s a similar issues in cities with tall buildings  for me in wooded trails  it misses roughly   mile per   miles  when i said pace  usually  adjusts quickly  there are exceptions to that  sometimes  somewhat unexpectedly  pace doesn t instantly jump   it changes slowly and keeps ramping up after you ve already backed off  separately  almost always if you change directions  i e  a turnaround or sharp turn   the pace goes bonkers thinking you slowed way down as you retrace your steps  there is no  second  reading on the standard digital  time of day  clock face  or i haven t figured out how to get it to show up yet   i didn t realize how much i use that in daily life until it was missing  i haven t figured out how to access other watch features while in the middle of a workout  i e  you have to end the run to back out of the run screen  things i thought i would like that i haven t used at all  i thought i would like the feature where you can build custom workouts and then the watch will keep track of your splits based on that workout template  it proved to take too much time to set up so i find myself saying  that is cool  but not doing it surprise feature  i think this technically isn t on a list of compatible devices for the sleep feature  and it doesn t seem to track rem sleep  however  it does track  light  and  deep  as well as movement and total sleep time  i didn t expect to use it at all  but i find myself looking at this every morning      
92,5.0,                       got this for my girlfriend and she loves it  it is very diverse with what it can do  amazing battery life  she charges it every   weeks   works well with other equiment  we have probes for our horse that will tell the watch the horses vitals and such      
93,5.0,                       i had a fitbit charge hr for two years  actually two of them because the first one fell apart and so did the second one  so i was looking for something that was more durable  and staying away from fitbit due to their tendency to fall apart   after scouring the internet and reading many reviews  i decided to try the garmin forerunner     as i ve only had it for a week  i cannot speak to its long term durability  but i ve outlined comparisons of many features of the forerunner to the charge hr comfort  the fitbit was cumbersome and often times uncomfortable  especially under long sleeves  i was surprised at how soft and supple the band of the forerunner was and how i nearly forgot i was wearing it bluetooth connection  i ve found that the bluetooth connection for the forerunner is stronger than the charge hr  it syncs way faster than the fitbit alarm  being able to set the alarm right on the forerunner  as opposed to using the app to set the alarm and than sync it for the charge hr  is a really nice feature  it s quicker to set an alarm gps  i really love this feature on the forerunner  i have found that it is pretty accurate and it doesn t take too long to locate the gps  charge hr doesn t have this feature  which i found frustrating  especially considering similar price points   when i m trying to gauge an accurate distance for running  i ve gone on three runs since i got the forerunner less than a week ago and i feel as though it is accurate in regards to this battery life  the charge hr lasted on average   days until it needed to be charged  i got the forerunner last saturday  only charged it to three bars  out of four   and it is now friday    days later  and i ve used the gps   times for short       minute intervals  and the forerunner still has   bars of battery life  this feature is so amazing  i hated having to charge the fitbit so often garmin connect vs  fitbit app  i feel like the garmin app has so many more features than fitbit overall  i am super impressed with the forerunner     it seems superior to fitbit charge hr  especially since it is in a similar price point range  the forerunner    is perfect for a person who casually runs and wants other fitness data  a more avid runner may want some more features to better track their runner  but forerunner does the job for me  run roughly   to   times per week and work out   to   times per week   i haven t checked the waterproofness of the forerunner  but one of my runs was in the rain and it held up great      
94,4.0,                       i purchased this watch primarily as a gps and to track my steps when i exercise  i really like the features that come with the device  however it is overly complex for what i need  i don t need the weather  notifications  etc i also don t like how bulky and ugly the watch is  fitbit is much more attractive  and i wish they would provide something similar      
95,4.0,                       pretty nice watch overall for the price   run and bike tracking works just fine   sleep tracker doesn t work well for me   i have   dogs that get me up for   minutes in the middle of the night to go out  and the sleep tracker resets when i climb out of bed and go to the back door   according to this thing  i haven t had more than   hours sleep in months nice that you can have an analog face with the date showing   excellent battery life    days or so without using gps    having phone notifications is a plus  too minor beef   watch band de glued from watch after just a couple months   while garmin replaced it for free  the replacement took    days to get here   i bought a compatible watch band in the interim  they were able to ship overnight   and i like the aftermarket one better anyway      
96,4.0,                       a couple months back  after more than   years of service  my trusty garmin forerunner    bit the dust   in need of a new watch to help record my workouts  i surveyed the field of new fitness watches and activity trackers and settled on a pebble   hr   i loved the relatively sleek design of the pebble and the customizable watch faces  but the companion app lacked a lot of basic features and less than two weeks after receiving mine  pebble announced their acquisition by fitbit along with a statement indicating they could not promise the watch would remain functional in the future   so  back went the pebble  and i ordered up this garmin forerunner     fr    as a replacement   after living with it for about a month  here s how it stacks up hardwareoverall the hardware is acceptable  although far from stylish   i do have a couple of quibbles though   the  analog  face  isn t completely terrible  but the  digital  face is ugly   the digital time readout is legible  but the giant bluetooth connection indicator and battery status stick out like a sore thumb   my pebble offered a much more elegant face  along with dozens of other options  that was able to show a digital time display along with the current weather  current hr  and current step total   it would be nice to see something more along those lines offered here   another minor complaint is with the wrist strap   while plenty comfortable for      wear  the diagonal line texture seems to trap chlorine and soap residue and requires a thorough scrubbing every few days   i m also disappointed to see that it s connected to the watch via two star head screws   when the strap inevitably fails  i ll have to hope garmin has replacements available   a standard watch strap would have been much preferred here workoutsi have had the chance to try the fr   out across a varied set of workouts including swims  indoor treadmill runs  and outdoor runs   when outdoors the gps tracking is as accurate as my phone s gps   i compared measured workout distances between the fr   and mapmyrun and found the total distance measured to be extremely close   the heart rate accuracy provided by the wrist strap is good  much better than what i saw on the pebble  but it s slower to react to changes than the wahoo chest strap i compared it against   given an additional      seconds to respond to a change in effort  it seemed to      bpm compared to the chest strap about     of the time   if that error bothers you  you can pair it with an ant  chest strap during workouts instead  like the wahoo tickr or any recent garmin strap  activity trackingthe fr   seems to count steps fairly accurately   it does a pretty good job of rejecting random arm movements that otherwise inflate step counts   while i generally find the distance calculation based on pedometer step counts to be laughably inaccurate  i was reasonably impressed at how close the total calculated distance to the actual distance on a treadmill run   while i wouldn t necessarily rely on this to measure out mile splits  it s close enough for casual distance guesstimation the sleep tracking works quite well and is automatic   i find it logs my actual sleep and wake times within about        minutes of when i actually fall asleep and it does a good job of rejecting time spent reading in bed   the sleep tracking graphs breakdown sleep into light and deep sleep periods  although  without knowing how these periods are calculated it s hard to read too much into these  as well as movement levels   i ll be very interested to monitor my sleep levels over time  hours and quality  to see how my general feeling of wellness changes as the amount of quality sleep time i m getting varies it s hard to comment on the accuracy of calorie tracking without access to a physiology lab   the calories burned are tracked  and it s kind of useful to look at the trend over time   i wouldn t rely on the number of calories burned as reported by the watch to be super accurate though  if  say you re monitoring caloric input output  notificationswhen connected with my phone  the notifications are usable   text messages and phone calls  and other notifications if i desire  buzz through to the watch face   it s enough to know there s something that may require my attention and a glance at the screen provides enough of a summary to decide if i need to pull out my phone or deal with the notification later   while i have found getting these alerts on my wrist pretty useful  this particular feature falls short of what the pebble offered   there s no queue or timeline for reviewing notifications as there is on the pebble and i find i miss the ability to simply scroll back through previous alerts battery lifethe forerunner    s battery life is outstanding   i get between   and    days between charges  and a full charge takes only a few hours   this is much better than i expected and ensures i only miss a few hours of activity monitoring per month   given the time of year  i ve been doing most of my running indoors so i ve made light use of the gps  i expect as the weather warms up and i do more outside running with the gps on  i ll lose a couple of days of battery life  but i expect i should still make it a week or so between charges app websitei ve used garmin s connect website to log my swims and runs for years now  so most of the experience there is familiar   the website provides access to my workout history so i can compare runs and swims against previous efforts and see improvements over time   now that i have the fr    i get access to my sleep  all day heart rate  and activity tracking data there as well   the app for my android phone is decent   it can be a little confusing navigating through the various screens  but overall  all of the information i would care to look at is available  often presented in easy to digest charts and graphs final thoughtsoverall i find the fr   to be an excellent activity tracker and workout companion  but only a mediocre smartwatch   a few tweaks to the software allowing for some nicer watch face options and a better interface for dealing with notifications would make this a five star device   still  even with these shortcomings  i find myself wearing it      and imagine it will be on my wrist for a few years reliably logging my activity until my next upgrade      
97,4.0,                       i have had this watch for quite a while now and really love it   it is my first smartwatch and i did a lot of research before i bought it   i like that it is very flat against my wrist and has a very comfortable wristband with a standard watch closure that should fit any wrist   i have small wrists so this was really important to me   the display is great and easy to use   i tend to use the run tracker   and combined with strava i get a map of my daily run which i like   the heart rate sensor works well and i love getting this data   sleep tracking is great too   i like that i can change my music with it   which was an important feature   the one kind of quirky this is that it loses the connection to my phone from time to time   i turn off the watch to reset it and that seems to help   not sure it is is a watch problem or a phone problem   i got a white band and it has cleaned up easily so far no matter what i have gotten on it   i am pleased with the price and quality of this watch   and how easy it is to use once you get the hang of it   i did get a  rd party screen cover that works great      
98,1.0,                       this watch doesn t consistently sync my workouts  in the middle of the night it synced my rides from yesterday  so my phone thinks i worked out at     am and it won t let me change the date  it doesn t matter if i tell the watch or the phone to initiate the sync it doesn t work  and the support forums and google results are filled with years of people complaining about these same problems  it s a low quality product      
99,4.0,                       i m a       mile a week runner and on a budget   been using this gps watch for   weeks and works great   although its water resistant upto    meters  it does not have a swim function   however everyone that provided reviews use the cardio function for swimming and it works  great design and functionality   app is easy to use      
100,5.0,                       no dislikes  using with a polar heart rate strap  but this wrist hr seems to work pretty well  pretty good value for features compared to more expensive watches  using garmin connect to review  update  have been using it  for maybe   weeks  still fine      
101,3.0,                       this is my third garmin watch and i must say the technology has improved over the years   my previous  still working      does not have the features this watch offers and is a little more cumbersome to use   the bluetooth connectivity makes the setup of this watch super easy and the posted reviews are correct about satellite connectivity   it is basically immediate once outside and i don t seem to lose connectivity as i sometimes did with the older watch   the square face is something new and different and i do like the analog watch feature   i would recommend this product without reservations update           i am now reducing the number of stars to      for this watch   the heart rate monitor is not so great  it constantly reads low heart rate during my runs and the vibration to alert me is very annoying   i have been unable to determine any adjustment to make this go away   i don t think it s capturing my pulse rate even though i have it positioned in the recommended location   i have gone back to my     model for now         
102,1.0,                       resting heart rate is incorrect  outside temperature reading is incorrect  pretty disappointed in this device since these are two very basic functions  i bought a garmin forerunner    because i have used the garmin alpha with tt   and tt   collars for several years and been very happy with them  will probably end up returning this forerunner         
103,5.0,                       love this watch  got it to replace my vivofit hr  i like this even more  getting older needed a bigger watch face  this fits the bill and checks off every box      
104,5.0,                       i bought this for running  and it works great for that  but it s also a nice watch   i never remove it   i only have to charge it once or twice a week  so i sleep with it on   it s waterproof  do i can swim and shower with it   it dismisses phone calls without having to pick up your phone   great all around watch      
105,5.0,                       love this garmin forerunner  it has motivated me to get my mile times down and is perfect for keeping track of runs and prs  plus  the app is easy to use and has so many different features  i have not tried the sleep tracking feature yet  but will have to in the near future  great watch for a great price  definitely recommend to the average distance runner looking to improve times      
106,1.0,                       i will return my watch because it shows the wrong date  on garmin s website  i found that they are aware of the issue but  due to the age of the device we have determined we will not fix this issue   i m no coding expert but this seems like an easy fix that garmin is unwilling to do  disappointing      
107,1.0,                       this watch broke after only a few months of use   i tried to get my money back but could not and called garmon   they say they will replace the watch if i mail it back at my expense   we will see if the replacement watch works for longer than the original      
108,1.0,                       it has a good presentation but that is all  the heart rate measure at maximum effort is less than half in spite of you put tight on you wrist  the gps is slooooow and every time gives a different distance on the same route don t waste your money with this watch      
109,5.0,                       love this fitness watch    it gives you your time  distance and pace even if your running indoors and if you do cardio it keeps track of your heart rate   it will give you notifications and tell you who is calling if your phone rings and it automatically updates itself   it gives you a calendar and keeps all your workout history   i started to buy another timex because that is what i had before  but this watch is more than worth the extra money        
110,1.0,                       have not even had this watch one month and am already having significant issues  screens froze twice while out for my run and the device did not sync   tried soft reset   no improvement   tried hard reset   now i have nothing but a blank screen   went to the garmin website to try and troubleshoot hoping to find a live chat option   couldn t find one   spending a saturday trying to figure out how to fix this lemon   if any other users had similar issues and were able to get them resolved would appreciate some guidance      
111,5.0,                       this is my  th garmin watch and i love it  it is stylish and works very well and accurately  i don t do heavy workouts like i did years ago and needed something for everyday simple workouts and step counting  this is perfect  if you are a serious athlete and want all the bells and whistles for tracking your workouts with splits and whatnot  i would recommend another watch  but if you re like me now  older with some arthritis and aches as residuals from my youthful days  then this watch would be perfect for you  it has an actual gps tracking so when you re outdoors for your exercises you can track your actual distance  time and cardiac pace  it has a mode that when your at the gym and can t use the gps  you can still track what you are doing on the treadmill  bike  elliptical or whatever  it is waterproof  but i don t wear it for swimming as it doesn t count laps like my garmin swim watch does  but i could wear it in the water and not be afraid of damage  i highly recommend as an alternative to some of the other  fitness trackers  out there these days      
112,3.0,                       let me start with what iove  this has a monochrome non touch screen  why do i love this  the low power draw allows the time to always be displayed like a normal watch  i hate how you have to flip your arm to get a normal smart watch to display  i leave the bluetooth off and the battery lasts even longer  i have not done a test to see how many days this lasts as a watch  but it is a long time i bought this to replace my garmin      this will pair with the garmin chest strap  however  i have found the wrist based heart rate to be accurate enough for my purposes there are a couple of things that i find really frustrating  i like that the screen is not touch screen in that i suspect the use of side buttons over a touch screen must save battery life  however  i hate that the menus can only be scrolled through one direction due to one button being dedicated to the strolling  perhaps another button on the right side in the next version would solve the problem  up  down  and select it bugs me that the countdown timer only goes with   minute increments      
113,5.0,                       this baby has a very soft band that is so comfortable  i no longer have to run with my phone to keep track of my pace or distance and it never takes more than   seconds to find my gps location wherever i may be  there are a few handy in run features like virtual pacer and lap tracking which are useful for me  and with heart rate monitoring it calculates your vo  max doesn t do a good job with sleep tracking as a fitbit alta hr because it doesn t give rem sleep and sometimes the awake time is off but not bad overall and not the primary reason i bought it      
114,5.0,                       i recently upgraded as i needed something with a little more options and in addition to track my heart rate which was the primary reason for buying this product  i absolutely love it and it does everything that i currently need for my fitness goals      
115,1.0,                       it was great while it worked    which was about   months  i initially purchased to use on runs  however  after a couple months the heart rate monitor is completely inaccurate  initially it was very accurate   during runs it seriously underestimates my heart rate to the point it is comical  which sucks  bc i base my pace on my heart rate   or it takes several minutes after i stop running for the heart rate monitor to catch up and give me the somewhat correct feedback  it tracks distance ok  and can be set for intervals      
116,4.0,                       i bought this to track my runs way back in             years later i thought i d finally give my review  i would give it   stars  but the wrist based heart monitor is pretty worthless  it keeps track of my distances well  it has proven reliable in picking up a satellite signal  it has resisted water  and it still functions great  even after i took a fall that broke the screen  i use it for road and trail running and could t be happier  and  let s face it  the garmin app is fantastic  great watch at a great price point      
117,5.0,                       previously had a forerunner     which i loved  but the screen died and garmin could no longer replace  the    doesn t have quite as many features for runners as the      but i enjoy the sleep tracking and the in wrist heart monitor  it also still pairs with my chest strap heart monitor which is great  i do wish it were more responsive to pace changes  it takes a little time to catch up  but overall a great product      
118,5.0,                       very masculine and sporty  but works great    it is simple and practical  have everything i want  and the capability to turn off the features i don t want      
119,5.0,                       at first  i didn t think it would be as good as the pebble watch  but it has gone beyond what i wanted   i love that i can use it to track the distance and time as i walk my dogs   it also lets me know when i get a text or a phone call  which i used to miss until i got the pebble watch   that s why i got this garmin watch   to be alerted to my texts and calls   and the weather screen is nice      
120,5.0,                       bought for my son who runs cross country and track and needs to keep track of mileage and pace   he loves it  tracks mileage and paces him  great for his training  easy to set up and use  he constantly wears it  comfortable  study adjustable band as well      
121,4.0,                       it s not for high level training as it s a fairly simple fitness tracker  but it has more features than comparable fitbits in the same price range  namely built in gps  this is the least expensive watch i ve found from an established brand that has built in gps  which similar fitbits don t offer  meaning you don t have to carry your phone around while you re exercising for tracking  which is vital for us strava users  i wouldn t even consider a watch without gps  when i walk run  it shows pace  distance  and time  and when i cycle it shows speed  distance  and time  and i can track my routes as well  the one issue i have had with it is the buttons are directly across from each other  meaning sometimes when i try to press one button  i accidentally press the button on the opposite side  but with practice i am getting better at operating it  but that s a very minor issue  because overall i like it very much  there is a reason so many websites have awarded this the best value fitness tracker      
122,3.0,                       great tracker  does track steps but not accurately   i wear it regularly and the band popped off randomly after about   weeks      
123,5.0,                       works great with gps tracking and uploads data to the garmin connect app  it has a cycling mode but it doesn t calculate calories burned accurately for cycling but in fairness  it wasn t designed primarily for cycling      
124,5.0,                       i bought this watch for my wife  she is very pleased with the information it provides while she runs  the gps seems to be very accurate as does the pace  the distance reading does not seem to be very accurate when on a treadmill  but that s not what you re really buying this far  she was skeptical about getting the white band  but after a month or so of regular use  there is no discoloration  the band is extremely comfortable too      
125,4.0,                       i am enjoying my new garmin forerunner    way more than i thought i would  first  i wear watches  switching out every day or so  so the idea of wearing one watch day in  day out is not appealing  but this watch has charmed me with it s functionality  notice i didn t say looks  with it s b w screen and blocky shape  it s not attractive  but i didn t buy it for looks  i bought it for running four easy to see buttons control everything  and in an intuitive manner  i bought this as a running watch  but i m wearing it constantly  the sleep info seems a bit wonky  but since that s a bonus feature  i still have room to be pleasantly surprised  it paired easily with my android powered watch and it s smart watch functionality is impressive  with the info delivered in an efficient manner in summation  using this watch is easy and the information is useful  at the current price point  this is a steal  but if you want a flashy garmin watch  you re going to have to go up level      
126,5.0,                       this is the next level up from the cost effective fitness trackers  the embedded gps does wonders as it tracks the distance accurately compared to the lower end models  it is  x the cost but it is worth it  the band feels great      
127,4.0,                       love the gps  really wish you could change the font of notifications from your phone  it s so big you can t read much of any text or message      
128,4.0,                       this watch has some great features for training   i love the intervals feature  and reporting that you get from the watch   it s very easy to use and navigate   it provides great stats so we can report back to my daughter s coach what she has run on days we aren t with him      
129,5.0,                       delivered via usps on a sunday   the item works better than described   when paired with the garmin connect you get very nice mapping as well as a history of your daily activities  heart rate  steps  etc   the gps connection is much faster than my older garmin   and so far the battery seems to last well  only     down after   days and over     hours running      
130,5.0,                       this watch was cheaper on amazon than anywhere else  surprise  surprise  and as for the actual watch it does exactly what i wanted  it tells me how far i have run and what my pace is in that moment  it has smart watch features  i e  text messaging but i wouldn t care if it didn t  i love the app that it syncs with once i am home  i like seeing the additional details from my runs  also loving that the app syncs with mfp  overall a great watch with a great app to support it  so happy i got this      
131,5.0,                       this watch is the perfect size  i have very small wrists but this feels nice and snug and the watch face doesn t seem too large  this watch is very easy to use and displays my notifications clearly  really like that i can see any notification that i get on my phone on the watch      
132,1.0,                       i ve had garmin     and     monitors before and they were pretty good  this one is a total fail in my opinion  first and foremost it simply won t accurately measure pulse  i can count my pulse at     and the watch will report anything from    to     or so  same throughout the aerobic and anaerobic ranges  that makes the watch useless to me  on top of that  it just doesn t provide anything really useful other than average heart rate  not your high and low in real time during a workout   gonna have to return it and go back to my dependable  clunky timex      
133,4.0,                       its great except that the metric system doesnt work for this phone  i set my watch to pace me in min km     but it reverts to mins mile  so  distance is in km  that works ok       but my pace is given to me min mile  i checked online for fixes  but it looks like this is a firmware problem  so if you are metric like me  you may want to give this watch a pass     other than that it works great i have decided to keep it and just learn to read my pace in mins mile        so i am not too bothered  got shipped on time      
134,4.0,                       after looking at a number of options for a watch  i settled on this one  i love apple products  but could not afford a      watch  i feel like the garmin does exactly what i need it to do  i have to say it is nice to get my texts and email to the watch  i never thought i would like that feature  but i do  my reason for giving   stars  is that it doesn t always stay connected to my phone  i ve had to  delete  the watch and reinstall it a few times on my phone  minor issue  but manageable      
135,1.0,                       i have had so many issues with the garmin watch  when i use an activity tracker  i have a       chance it will register accurately  i have a half acre of land i push mow  it tells me i only walk about       steps  my other watch tells me anywhere from      plus  my phone tells me the same  i have started the walking activity and i have to constantly check that the distance is registered  if not i have to restart  for the price  it is not worth it  you could pay less and find a watch that is ten times better      
136,1.0,                       update  my first watch had to be replaced  conveniently just after the    day return window closed  i ve had the replacement for less than   weeks  and with this one  it sporadically stops recording data  a long chat session with garmin support revealed that    there is a latency delay with their servers but some of the data will probably show up eventually  and    the watch stopped recording at  am and they don t know why  according to them  it shouldn t happen again  i m not convinced i don t need all the bells and whistles that come with this watch  the pacing function is pretty useless with limited configurability  but i paid a premium to get a good gps watch that syncs with mapmyrun and myfitnesspal so that i can track my various routes and maintain data over time  for that  it works well when it works but now i m stuck with a watch that only works when it feels like it           original review           i like it just fine     but it stopped working after   weeks  just past the    day return window   problem  could no longer connect to charge  connection wasn t connecting  after long chat and troubleshooting with support  they offered to exchange it for a working model    other quibbles  steps are way way off  i calibrated my steps and double checked several times  but before i even get out of bed in the morning it will say i ve done over      steps    which suggests it s not the step calibration that s off  but something wrong with the device itself  also  it only integrates with myfitnesspal  which sucks if you have an extensive record on some other platform  and have prepaid a year s membership  although garmin is replacing the device  the experience has been so poor that i would prefer to have gotten a refund so that i could buy another brand of watch      
137,5.0,                       i am fairly new to running    months or so  and bought this watch because i wanted to track my progress and possibly train for some races  and was sick of having to carry my phone when i ran  i didn t want complex analytics or a ton of features  i just wanted to track my sleep  miles  pace  etc  it does all of those things well and i am super satisfied  it s very simple to use and i love the limelight color strap  i only have to charge it every couple of weeks  i am now training for a half marathon and it s still hitting the spot  the only thing i am a little suspicious about is sleep tracking  i have a baby and am up a lot at night with him and often the amount of time garmin tells me i slept don t make sense  but whatever  i m not mad because i love everything else about it      
138,1.0,                       i loved this watch     unfortunately after wearing it less than    days the face of the watch fell off  while i was laying on the couch   i checked the return option and i had a    day window only   this was a lot of money to spend for a watch that fell apart at less than   months         
139,4.0,                       i ve used this watch sporadically for running and sleep monitoring for the past   years  recently  the heart rate monitoring has gotten stuck at a certain number    won t go higher but does climb down    so there s that feature scuppered  but i m an amateur if occasional runner with basic needs    distance and time  as well as pace and splits     and the loss of consistent hr monitoring is not a big deal  the gps works and the data uploads to my phone and to strava  so i m happy      
140,2.0,                       it may be just me cause it had good reviews but i sent it back    wrist band too small for me     was hard for me to program    just meh  for me     
141,3.0,                       it s nice but feels like a      piece of technology  my main reason to buy it was for the gps to track runs biking etc and it works well for that  in terms of syncing with your phone and showing notifications or using as an alarm clock  it s like having a ti    calculator and it s ugly to wear all the time  good for runs only      
142,5.0,                       i ve had mine a few weeks now and it s been great  i needed an upgrade after being frustrated with one of those cheap black arm band step counters  i wanted fitness tracking and was seriously considering an iwatch  then i came across the forerunner    which was a quarter the price of the iwatch and had all the capabilities i needed without the frills  i was worried that the    would be too big  but was pleasantly surprised that it has a form factor very similar to the iwatch  it s a little thicker than i d like but it doesn t bother me  i wear it daily as a watch  battery life is about   days with normal use the display is always on and easy to read  pairs with my iphone to display texts and alerts in clear to read text  the    syncs with the garmin connect app which keeps track of my activities and statistics  i like that i can plot out my heart rate during my activities  i also use it with the garmin basecamp program on my mac to download my bike routes and vehicle drives  very happy with the    so far and have no regrets about not getting one of the more expensive forerunners      
143,5.0,                       i love this thing  i have had one for about    months  and i just purchased one for a friend  i like that it does everything i want it to  receive texts  track activity  in a compact non flashy package  very easy to use  as all garmin products seem to be      
144,5.0,                       if you re looking for a simpler smart watch that also tracks fitness this is the watch for you  easy set up  easy use and great interchangeable bands      
145,5.0,                       consumer reports has rated this product very high  after returning several fit bits i thought i world break down and try this forerunner  it is great  it paired right up with my ipad and my android phone  it is way more accurate then the fit bit  display is good  price is very reasonable      
146,3.0,                       i bought this device for my wife last christmas because her fitbit had to be charged every night  well    the battery life on this device is great  the notifications work great as well  it goes off before my phone does when someone calls but it does not do a good job at keeping track of my steps  my wife didn t like this device and i am now using it and it never has the same number of steps on the device and garmin connect  i am not sure how that works because it gets the information from the device there are many things that i love about it  the sleep tracking seems to be great  if it is correct   the battery life is awesome and its comfortable but it doesn t do the one thing it should do the best  i have tried syncing with the computer and have done several hard resets all with the same end result  if you want to compete with others in a step challenge i don t recommend this device     
147,5.0,                       it s my first running watch so i haven t  tried any others out there yet but i love this one  the app works really good too and provides useful information like your heart rate and sleeping pattern schedule  thumbs up  it s garmin  it s a good watch      
148,4.0,                       overall this is great  my son saved his money for this  he had used it for swim  running  and an alarm clock  he will also use it for mountain bike club season and road biking  i m thinking of getting one for me   i love that he can get texts on it  he can t text back but he knows if i he needs to stop and grab his phone to call or text back  great watch for a great price      
149,5.0,                       i did quite a bit of research when deciding which activity based watch to buy  i run about       miles per week and wanted something that could boost my training stats beyond what i can receive exclusively for an app  the garman forerunner    seemed like a perfect fit and a justifiable price  i can verify this is true  i ve had mine for a week and have used it to track about   different activities  the battery life is still half full  the app needed to go along with this watch is also incredibly useful  it works in conjunction with my strava and myfitnesspal apps to keep my training and diet on track  it helps to monitor my sleep  count my steps  and track my heart rate  i m not sure how well it will do in water because i m afraid to try it  just in case  but this watch is everything i was hoping it would be  i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality  first time training watch      
150,5.0,                       i am a long time runner   however i don t like watches with tons of bells and whistles   i want fast gps signal  accurate mileage  speed etc   the forerunner    has it all   have used it for a week now and love it  accurate and super fast gps signal  i live in nyc so sometimes gps can take a few mins due to buildings but not with this watch  this watch does have a lot of nice extras like sleep  heart monitor  steps etc   if you want those features   for the price this is excellent value   also for those of us with smaller wrists  it is not clunky   super light and syncs like a dream i used to own polar s but their usb breaks after a week  they never sync easily  their alerts are horrible etc   will never buy again  polar is a ripoff who can t catch up with the times        
151,2.0,                       this thing went all blue screen on me after a year and wouldnt stop yelling at me to move no matter how much i told it to f    off   i d give it   or   stars otherwise  its a gps that tracks your heart rate  thats all it needs to be  the sleep tracking feature on any of these things is a joke  so are the step trackers and move alarms  but hey  if it helps a middle aged woman feel like she s actually done something today  why not      
152,1.0,                       headline says it all checking this instrument against other heart monitors  its off by    beats per min checking against cpap sleep monitor  its off by      this product should be removedfrom market  i have multible garmin product an their excellent  im sorry i wasted so much time with this product  i see why they only give    day return    their shortest time on any product  it takes    days to figure out your only going to get bad onfo   across the board  jim     
153,3.0,                       this is a great product to run with but saddened that it doesn t have a setting for hiit workouts or some form of boot camp workouts   if you want to run or bike it is fine but would choose another product if i could if i were to purchase again      
154,4.0,                       i ve originally bought this watch only to track my workouts  mainly interested in gps part for running biking  this is my first tracker of this type  so i don t have much to compare to for the price  this ended up being a great tool   gps is super helpful  nice to have the map of your work out and a bunch of associated stats   the interface is simple and easy to use   waterproof feature works  battery lasts a good amount of time  usually a week or a bit under  depending on type of use  especially gps  and recharges quickly  i ve ended up using this as a watch  for time      which i wasn t planning on originally  heartrate  as long as there s understanding that this type of measurement isn t super accurate  it is still great to have for comparative purposes  i haven t tried adding on chest meter or anything   running inside   steps   not sure how accurate these are  lately for treadmill running i ve been getting shorter distance estimate than what treadmill is showing   app is pretty good and has decent stats for running  riding and general existingone gripe i have is that the watch isn t able to receive texts  weather  etc from my phone for some reason  i ve re uploaded the app and still have issue here   overall  this is a great fitness watch  would buy again  but hopefully not too soon      
155,3.0,                       the watch is a typical garmin product  functional with poor aesthetics  one thing that bothers me is the gap between the edges and screen  dirt   sea salt gathers in there  i don t know what is the screen material but its impossible to keep it clean  the strap also catches lint  the hr sensor shows about   to    beats lower  other than these issue its quite durable fitness watch with a good battery life      
156,1.0,                       ok so i had an older garmin before treating myself to this upgrade  the older one wasn t the best for keeping track of your pace accurately but at least it kept track of my heart rate accurately  this new garmin sucks       if i could give it less than   stars i would  the heart rate monitor is      off  i know this because i ve been on machines that keep track of it as well and the machine will say my heart rate is      which i know to be true because i ll be dying and this garmin says my heart rate is     it s extremely frustrating when you re trying to keep track of your progress and calories burned and your stupid watch basically says you re being a lazy couch potato when in reality your sweating your  balls  off  i don t recommend this product if you re an active person who is looking to keep track of your heart rate accurately      
157,4.0,                       this is a great fitness watch and i wear it all day long as well  the battery life is good and it s clear when it s time to charge it up  it s waterproof so i never have to worry about exercising in the rain  it is irritating that the watch will randomly update and i have to plug it into my computer to get the home screen back  i also find that the step counter is wildly off when i go hiking and don t have it in activity mode  i did a   mile hike with some friends and my watch told me i had only walked       miles worth of steps  if you want to focus on step counting  this is not the watch for you      
158,5.0,                       i love this watch  i wear it daily  i ve had it for a few months  i use it mainly for exercise  but having it connected to my phone has been nice  i would buy it again  it was a great price for all that it does      
159,5.0,                       pretty accurate but sometimes took a while to connect get gps  just turn on a couple min before run  great for your first garmin      
160,5.0,                       i purchased this after being really disappointed in the forerunner        i wanted a watch to track me on the tread mill  on distance runs half marathons  and something i could wear around the city and into the office and still look normal  unlike its predecessors  the    lends itself to this  it does a nice job on runs with pace and distance  accurate gps  let s you customize the data fields you see during runs as well as cool interval training modes      
161,3.0,                       i was excited to have an alternative to a chest strap heart rate monitor  after two months of light use  garmin    heart rate monitor became grossly inaccurate  troubleshooting with garmin s help advice not effective  gps distance data is accurate  judged by the myriad of other uses observing the same deficit   it appears that wrist heart rate monitor technology not yet worth buying      
162,4.0,                       this is a surprisingly comfortable watch  the interface and functionality are fairly straight forward  however  i did have to look for an online tutorial to accurately set the time the mileage can be set in kilometers or miles which is helpful the watch comes with a usb cord that has a clip that attaches to the watch  there is no outlet adapter included overall  good buy if you re not looking for a complicated and expensive watch to measure your physical activities      
163,2.0,                       i bought this as an upgrade to my old garmin hr  because it included an actual gps feature  it s a decent watch in itself  has good battery for the week  and i to like the bluetooth alerts when paired to my smartphone  but the acvtivity tracker features are horrible  the move move bar cleared motivational features are basically non functional   alerting you to move when you re already moving  or clearing when you sit down  it alerts  goal reached      times a day when i am nowhere near my step goal  i haven t measured the heartrate tracking feature against an actual bp device  but i m assuming it is inaccurate as well      
164,5.0,                       very user friendly   my husband loves it   you do not have to have your phone with you for it to sync up      
165,1.0,                       i loved this watch  the color is beautiful and it was great tracking all the necessities for health without being over stimulated like w an apple watch  i wanted the basics plus a little more but not the extent of an apple watch  as much as i would tell you to buy this watch  don t  and i only say that bc after two years this watch died on me  i tried everything to get the watch to turn on but nothing worked  it is dead  useless and now my kid plays w it as a toy  do not buy unless you want to buy a new one every couple of years         
166,5.0,                       i just started running a lot more and have joined a couple running groups  i soon realized that i really needed my own running watch to help track my pace  distance  time  etc  but i also didn t want to spend       for all the bells and whistles  i ve been completely satisfied with the garmin forerunner     it s comfortable to wear  easily connects to the garmin connect app on my smart phone  and provides more than enough data to track my workouts and progress  at around      it s still not exactly cheap  but it s not bad at all for everything you get  it doesn t have a touch screen and maybe isn t as sleek as the pricier watches  but it does everything i want it to  i don t really use it for tracking my sleep or other daily habits  so i can t comment about that  but i imagine it does a great job with those tasks too      
167,1.0,                       i originally bought this watch in january       i primarily used it for running  especially for mid to long distance outdoor and indoor running and as an everday use watch for work  i work in the hospital setting   i loved the simplicity of this watch and the ease of cleaning the watch after every day use  i recently wore this watch on a river float and it was only submerged intermittently in less than  ft of water  after i noticed the screen was shorting out and there was condensation inside the watch  i m very disappointed that this watch failed after less than   years of use and that the guaranteed water resistance was not true  due to the fact that the watch is more than a year old  i am not eligible for any refund or replacement  which is disappointing that a watch this expensive is only good for less than   years      
168,3.0,                       i really liked the watch  it was easy to use and had everything one would expect from a running watch  time  distance  speed  calories burned  heart rate  etc  the problem is the heart rate monitor does not function properly  it s sporadic  and oftentimes will not pick up your heart rate  i had to shut the watch off a few times just to get it to reset  i returned one watch because of this problem and got another  but i had the same problem with the second watch too  so if someone is looking for a reliable heart rate monitor  i would not recommend this watch  everything else  however  functioned properly      
169,1.0,                       we purchased this for our son  a high school track athlete  the date on the display is wrong and can t be reset on the device as the device receives the date from a satellite  the garmin website said   we ve identified an issue with this product that causes the date to be wrong after the gps rollover on april  th        however  all functions not dependent on date and or time will continue to work normally  due to the age of the device we have determined we will not fix this issue what does that mean for my garmin o  the date determined by the gps will be wrongo  position  velocity  navigation  and all other functionality not dependent on date and or time will continue to work normallywhat is gps week rollover the gps satellite system communicates the date via a week number that is limited to      weeks  about    years   on april  th       the week numbers broadcast by the satellites will  rollover  to zero  if gps receivers don t account for this rollover in their software  it will calculate the wrong date and or time      
170,1.0,                       the absolute worst manual in the history of manuals  and no help to be had  again  save you yourself a lot of frustration and buy something else  mine is going back      
171,5.0,                       i have missed my running watch and this was a good buy for me  i had an old forerunner    but it wouldn t connect to gps anymore so i upgraded  this watch is super light  easy to use  and i can vary my running work out without needing to connect it to my phone or computer  i would recommend it      
172,1.0,                       i ve had this watch for   months  i loved it when i received it  it worked perfectly up until this last month  now the time gets off periodically  it no longer receives notifications from my phone at all  this morning it randomly went off telling me i d met my daily goal when it was     am and i d only done     steps  i m so disappointed  i ve done all of the updates  i ve unpaired and repaired with my phone  i ve shut it down completely a few times but nothing helps  its so unreliable at this point that it isn t worth wearing  i spent      on this watch and expected it to last for more than   months  don t waste your money      
173,5.0,                       great watch for working out  gives all functions you need  has limitations on functions you will never use such as garmin pay etc  if you want a watch to calculate your route  miles  split times heart rate etc and be able to download to your phone it s all here      
174,3.0,                       we had purchased   of these in about a   year timeframe    for each member of the family  we all loved the watch  we range from a d  college runner to lifting  spartans and an occasional runner  the   huge problem we had is that we had was that all but   died at about    months  this also went for my youngest garmin vivosmart  garmin or amazon did replace all of them but that was very disappointing that they are not built for longevity      
175,5.0,                       this watch is amazing  i love garmin s and i love that you do not have to run with your phone for mileage  the watch dings every mile to tell you your pace and how shows how far you have gone  the watch also calculates your resting heart rate  this is great for runners to see  also  it does your vo  max  this is important because you can see your oxygen intake getting better  it has great functions and it is not overwhelming  i like this watch because it still bluetooth to my phone for text and calls  it send me a notification  i can not answer via watch  but it is nice to have  like i said  i do not need a big fancy watch for my running  it stays charged for a long time as well  i run about       miles per week and this watch can last a week of running before charging  i am super happy with this watch as an athlete     
176,4.0,                       first of all i had an issue with being sent a garmin forerunner    without a charger and it wouldnt turn on even after i got a replacement charger  amazon was great and sent me a replacement charger  i then returned that garmin and got a replacement    pros  gps picks up fast  mileage for runs seems accurate outdoors  indoors isn t as accurate as just watching the treadmill  good basic interface   optionscons  no music from     knew that going into it  wrist heart rate measurements are slow to update  i was wearing a chest strap and the     chest strap showed      while the watch still had me in the    s on a        effort run  eventually it caught up but if quick heart rate measurements are important to you i suggest you grab a chest hrm if you need a no frills watch that gives you a few text messages via bluetooth and use it for pacing  intervals it does a decent enough job at it  it is very convenient to run a workout with the watch for pacing vs carrying my smartphone on the run i m happy with my purchase and amazon s support      
177,2.0,                       i had a hard time getting the watch to sync with my phone   i had to reconnect it a couple of times before it would work   even then  it wasn t solid   one time  it wiped out some of the data on the phone when i reconnected it   i paid extra for the name brand so i wouldn t have to deal with that kind of nonsense   i ended up returning the watch      
178,5.0,                       i ve own apple watches since      and i was never pleased   i purchased the garmin forerunner    and i am totally amazed on how long the battery last before needing charged  i am so glad i made the switch to garmin in       this is perfect for tracking steps   workouts   sleep  stats will sync to my fitness pal and my personal gyms app  i love this watch  plus the bands are cheap to switch out if you want a change of color        
179,5.0,                       i ordered this to replace my samsung gear s  watch that i was trying to use to track my running  i couldnt get accurate measurements with any of the apps i installed  the forerunner    is accurate and the connect app is easy to use  the watch is lighter than the samsung gear s  and has a longer battery life  it is not as flashy but it is much more functional for running pros  accurate  lightweight  good battery life  much cheapercons  not touchscreen  display isn t customizable   the charger is unique to the watch  not usb c      
180,1.0,                       it worked great for three months  after that it died  it would turn on for short spells  but refused to hold a charge  even though the battery showered it was full and it has been plugged in for hours  it s a shame  because it was my favorite smart watch until then    the gps worked beautifully      
181,1.0,                       i bought this for my husband the beginning of august for his birthday and the watch face already broke  i had paid extra for the warranty and apparently it doesn t cover external damage and they gave us the run around and suggested we try the manufacture warranty  so why did i spend money on an extra warranty      
182,1.0,                       i bought it to monitor my sleep patterns  the instructions were no help  and i couldn t find a tutorial on the web  more importantly  it won t link to either my iphone or my pc  if i push the right buttons  though  it does tell time      
183,4.0,                       while the forerunner    is not set up to track swimming laps  i tested it in an indoor pool to get a feel for how it would measure my  steps  swimming results       yd freestyle counted    steps      yd breaststroke counted    stepspower walking in the pool was pretty accurate   i did five different     yd  power walks        ft   which totaled      steps  or      ft  steps   my normal step is     ft  steps      
184,1.0,                       i purchased this watch and planned to use it on my long runs on the weekend  the first weekend everything was great  paired it to my phone no problem and the pace feature worked well  i was looking for a watch to show my current pace so i can stay consistent on my long run  i turned the watch off after   day with two battery bars left and by the next weekend it was dead  i fully charged it  turned it off and when i went to turn it on the following weekend   dead  it appears this thing can t hold a charge  then i finally got to run with it again and the pace must have been changed to something other than how many minutes per mile  frustrating  went to go into the app to change it and it had unpaired  i have not spent hours trying to repair this thing to my phone and still cannot  i have done all their troubleshooting suggestions and some  but to no avail  i will call garmin tomorrow and see what happens  once i talk to support if i can get this up and running again i will revise my review because when it worked i really liked it      
185,1.0,                       this is not high on ux  i had to look up the manual on their website and even that didn t help a lot  i ve kinda stumbled my way into figuring it out but not totally  all i want to know is my heart rate  zones  while running  i don t wear this all day  just when i run  i bought a chest strap monitor as well to pair for greater accuracy  the watch recognises the chest monitor but then when i click on outdoor exercise  it says  wait  and then stays on that for    minutes  i ve lost any interest in the watch at that point   i can t get the heart rate screen to stay on  so it s more of a distraction than asset to my workout  i should just return the darn thing since i can t use it      
186,5.0,                       great watch  i love how it is simple but gets important things  heart rate  run and bike stats  time  and i can access the info with my phone  the gps works great  i don t need my fitbit anymore  as it tracks my steps as well  i m ordering some more wristbands to change the look  mine is black  which i love      
187,5.0,                       i have been using this watch for a few weeks now and am very pleased with it   i wanted this watch primarily for the gps function while running  and i have been pleasantly surprised by the consistency with which it reports my mileage   i walked the same route on three consecutive days to see if the watch reported the same distance  and the watch indicated i had reached the one mile mark within ten or so yards each day   when i finish a run or a walk and sync my watch with my phone  i m able to view my route on my phone  along with my pace and a color coded indicator of the faster and slower portions of my run i also bought one for my dad  who enjoys tech y things  and to encourage him to stay active in his retirement    i have the teal band and i bought my father the watch with the black band   the band is comfortable  although it is sometimes challenging to fasten and unfasten it   i guess the idea is that garmin wants you to keep it on     but i have not used the watch for sleep tracking because i don t want to wear a watch while i m sleeping      
188,5.0,                       i have been using the forerunner since january and love it pros fast tracking  it doesnt take more than a minute usually to grab a satellite  of all my hiking data it has only incorrectly tracked once and quickly corrected battery is fantastic  lasts for days even with   bar very minimalist  not frills with this watch that can distract you like an apple watch cons its not that pretty  i know thats a low hanging fruit but its a little bulky and just overall doesnt look great not enough default activities  no hiking or swimming options  this can be corrected using the site and changing the activity type hr  this is a little tough  it can be sensitive  hanging your hand out your car window  lawn mowers and bikes can all raise your hr with vibrations  when i go to the gym  it has trouble getting an accurate hr for a cardio workout when you hands are not by your side  this makes using a stair climber hard to track hr  sometimes there is a bit of a delay on the treadmill as well hand placement  as mentioned above  hand placement is key  pushing a lawn mower  forget those steps  using the stair climber  forget those steps as well overall i love it though  i can track trails using just my watch and don t need to pair it with bluetooth unlike other devices  the battery lasts forever  it provides an accurate pace while running  this takes some calibration at first with treadmills   for the price you really wont get better      
189,5.0,                       so simple to use  nothing fancy  just tracks what i want  battery does go down kind of fast though but not a real problem  would certainly purchase it again      
190,5.0,                       the garmin forerunner    worked great for me  at first   i ve had it for a month and loved everything about it until i started having an allergic reaction to the band  i ve read that silicone allergies are really rare but i ve tried the band on both wrists and it happened on both wrists  no new soaps  perfumes  or anything  i called garmin and they were awesome working with me to find a different garmin product that wouldn t have a silicone band  i m sad to trade in the garmin forerunner    for a different one with a leather band but it s what was needed  even though i m not keeping the forerunner     it was a great product and the company was wonderful to work with      
191,5.0,                       simply simple  my desire to track my runs and control my music from my wrist were my priorities  there are watches that can do a lot more out there  but this is easy to use  accurate  tracks my steps  heart rate  and does just what i bought it for  i d buy this again without hesitation if i lost my watch  and it syncs all my runs to my nike  app i ve used since i began running      
192,3.0,                       along with in built gps and wrist based heart monitor  i bought this watch for its looks  i wanted it to be able to wear it in the office and dont look like its a sports watch  the gps and heart based monitors are accurate as stated by many others  the reason i gave   stars and returned the watch is because of the time it took to start the gps  for first   weeks  everything worked fine  then  gps started taking more than   minutes to turn on  i called garmin support and they helped to reset the gps  it worked fine for a couple of days and started being problematic again  it took more the    minutes to turn the gps on once  thanks to amazon s return policy  i was able to return it after a month      
193,1.0,                       i ve had this watch for a little over a year  in the past   months it frequently freezes up and becomes completely useless   usually this happens after my run when i switch over to the walking setting  not only does it usually take     minutes to recapture the gps signal  it often completely seizes up and won t work at all   today i held my breath  as i do now whenever i try to use this watch  and turned it on to capture the gps signal for my walk  yay  it worked    mile into my walk  it buzzed showing me i had completed my first interval  a lot of time passed and i realized that i should be hitting mile    i looked at my watch and found that it was not tracking  nope  it turned the track feature off  i looked in the history and found that my last recorded activity was yesterday   great  between the freezing up  the ransomware attack that made the app unusable and now knowing that if the watch feels like not tracking  it ll just stop  i m done   i will be switching over to another gps tracker  i m tired of being infuriated and holding my breath that my watch is going to do what it s supposed to do      
194,5.0,                       so i really like this watch   i had fitbits before and they are held together with pins which eventually get stripped out and the band s no longer stay on  i had to return it  so i was looking for something like this garmin watch that has screws instead of pins to hold the band on   it s great i love this watch and all its features  the app is really easy to use too  i have small wrists and this fits perfectly and snug  i d highly recommend it  i especially love it for the my steps  heart monitor and sleep tracking  you can also purchase different colored bands  thanks garmin        
195,1.0,                       this device refuses to pair with my android  connected once and then lost connection and will no longer connect to phone  pretty much just a watch with no pairing ability  for the next two months i uploaded data directly from the usb to my laptop  now garmin connect no longer detects the device  save your money and get a suunto      
196,2.0,                       the watch shows the wrong date and time  there is an auto setting for time that is supposed to sync the date and time with satellites  but it doesn t work correctly  using auto results in the date being set for tomorrow and the time to some other time zone there is a manual setting  but it only works for time  so now the time is correct but the date is still tomorrow      
197,5.0,                       wanted something to track how many miles i walk at work and heart rate  this is perfect  i ve tried so many fitbits  don t bother with them  they re trash  and a few jawbones as well  but the garmin is the best one i ve ever owned  i like that i can see notifications from my phone on the watch itself  but rarely ever turn it on  i thought about getting an apple watch to have everything this does  and more  but decided on the garmin because it seems to stand the test of time  i did a lot of research before purchasing this and recommend that you do the same  it s not touch screen  has buttons on both sides  and is a black and white screen rather than a colored one  garmins are also supposed to be more accurate than fitbits  etc  i had to buy some screen protectors for it  but this thing has managed to survive everything i put it through at work  i would definitely recommend it update  may     i still own this watch and still love it  it has stood the test of time  i had a very physically demanding job when i bought this  lifting heavy items  constantly on my feet  and also would have to climb into and fix equipment  proud to say this watch endured all of that for   plus years   and i m pretty hard on it  can t recommend it enough      
198,5.0,                       my only gripe is that it doesn t have a timer incorporated  but definitely better than google and fitbit having access to my info     
199,5.0,                       it s a fantastic and easy to use gps watch  one small glitch i ve seen is that it says the satalite system should automatically correct the date  however  the date has always been   day off otherwise  the mileage is extremely accurate  and there are some cool features for tracking prs for mile   k    k              and longest run      
200,1.0,                       this is the last letter i wrote to garmin via their repair center in their website  dear garmin i would like some advice on how to best replace repair my forerunner     i purchased my watch just over a year ago  december       i had it replaced in july      and it has now stopped working again i want to add that i really enjoy the functionality of this watch  when it worked   but the fact that it seems to have a six month lifespan is disappointing to say the least      
201,1.0,                       this failed after one year of daily use  very disappointing  replaced it with a digital watch that was less than         
202,5.0,                       i love it  reading my daily activity made me see how inactive i was with a desk bound job since getting it i realized i had to move more and have started walking   doing circuit training day about  and have done    walks or circuits in feb   which is one every   days   which im really happy with its great to be able to save the times  distances   calories burnt etc  to compare and its amazing to see how quickly improvement comes i started walking for    minutes at a medium pace   are now doing    at a brisk pace and doing   circuits instead of   and the forerunner definitely keeps me on track and motivates me to go harder  its great     
203,4.0,                       what i looked for from forerunner    was long battery life       hours gps time   bluetooth and reasonably fast gps initiation  forerunner    met all of these  i just had a     hour day hike the other day and the power indicator showed only        of   bars remaining  power consumption  it most likely meets    hour gps power supply garmin s advertised  it is also easy to connect and upload data to garmin connect via bluetooth from my phone  except that the upload time seems long  like   min   for a     hour data however my main complaints are the overall design of it  flimsy build  ugly fonts and formats of digital display  for example  the date sunday           would simply become  sun     it looks to me garmin wanted it out to market as soon as main features done  everything else just cheaply made to meet minimum standard  i want to give     stars but had to settle for        
204,4.0,                       i am a recreational runner  going for     mile runs a few times a week  i was tired of carrying my phone to track mileage  but am not a typical  watch  wearer  i love this watch    it s lightweight and comfortable  i use it to track all runs  walks  and mountain bike rides  i find it motivating to try and reach my weekly goals the only feature that i don t find super accurate is the sleep tracking  there have been some nights of insomnia  in which i ve read for an hour or two  and the watch records it as sleep  i stopped wearing it at night  since i found it to be uncomfortable to sleep with      
205,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband but then started using it for myself along with the app  i ve trying to get back into working out post baby so it s been an amazing tool to have  it s has basically all the features of an apple watch that i would use for half the price      
206,3.0,                       i like the fit of this watch a lot  i have very small wrists so i was concerned this would be too big but the band adjusts nicely for small wrists and the face isn t too bulky  the battery lasts several weeks even if i ve used the gps mode  i don t think that the step counter or calorie counter is very accurate  when i compare it to my iphone the phone always has many more steps counted  assuming i ve had them both on me for the time period that i m comparing   the calorie counter also doesn t seem to be very accurate  specifically in the cardio workout mode  i use this mainly for running and i do think the gps function is fairly accurate so for my purposes it works okay  but if you re looking for a very accurate step calorie counter you may want to consider one of the nicer versions      
207,4.0,                       the watch does a decent job of tracking distance  pace  time  heart rate for my runs and biking   it does not have a multisport modality  it has the capability of estimating distance running indoors without a device on the shoe   it does not seem to give altitude in real time  but after the data is downloaded to garmin connect  the altitude can be viewed      
208,1.0,                       i had this watch for about   months when i realized it would stop calculating my steps during the day   when i realized this i started checking it more often to see if it was accurate   based on how many miles i know i walked or ran   i troubleshooted it with their  help center  they told me all i would need to do is update it   well when i ran the update  it made it worse    i told them about it and they sent me this confusing email about how i should pay to send my clearly defective product back to them   i have all the original packaging and have never used this watch in any manner in which it was not intended for   i am currently pregnant and barely used it for any type of intensive workouts that i had planned on using it for when i purchased it   i actually have several friends who have this same watch and have had to send theirs back as well   don t waste your money        
209,5.0,                       this is my first running watch and i really enjoy it  great for the price  sometimes it takes a while to connect to gps  but i always try to get it started way before i start my run  sometimes the hr tracker is a little off but that s expected  everything else works great      
210,5.0,                       i wanted a watch to track my steps and heart rate   i started with an inexpensive     purchase   while i liked it  it was not accurate   my friend had a garmin and highly recommended it   after looking at all of them and the prices  i went with one of their least expensive  the forerunner      i love it   it is so accurate  so comfortable and has so many extra features that i didnt know i would care about  like telling me when someone was calling my phone  news alerts  in depth analysis of my walks    i dont know if it s always the  sale  price of     or just for prime members  but it is worth more than the price      
211,2.0,                       the main reason i bought this watch was to track my heart rate while running  tested it out on a  mile run and through the entire   miles it recorded my heart rate for maybe    seconds tops  the rest of the time it displayed      i measured my pulse manually and the     was definitely not right  the other features seem to work fine  it synced up to the app  with the inaccurate hr  and the gps tracked just fine  but i could get that for free from my phone  so this watch offers no advantage over a free smart phone tracker app      
212,4.0,                       gps works well  good battery life   connects well to my phone  i haven t tried all the features yet  heart rate monitor is not accurate  watch reads lower than my actual heart beat  confirmed by two other methods   but meets my need   good value unless you really require high precision heart monitor   replaced my fitbit surge  which with    months had issues with touch screen ultimately not working      
213,5.0,                       this is the best fitness watch for value i have had  it s nothing fancy like the smartwatches so there s no calling or messaging but you can have the watch show you who is calling and even answer it but the call is routed to your phone  for texts  it will show who is texting you  have to sync contacts  and what the message is which is great  however  allowing this will deplete the battery usually within two days i m at half a battery with the smart notifications on  text and calls   otherwise  the watch will last almost two weeks fully charged  this watch was intended for fitness focus but has some great smartwatch features  the gps can be slow to sync up but usually it s at the most a mjnute  the application is fantastic and you can even join group challenges from people all over  such as who is waking the most  etc   you can track the following activities walk  gps tracking run outdoor   gps tracking run indoor  stationary no gps tracking bikecardiofeatures analong or digital clock displayweather and forcast with precip chance humidity and temperature heart rate with average resting and activenotifications  smart from your phone so texts and missed calls and also any fitness goal stats step counter with distance countercalories burned with resting and activefitness activity log that shows your recent activities  tracked walks runs bike etc overall  i highly recommend you try out this watch when on sale  otherwise  for the full price you are better off with a smartwach  great for testing to see if you want more of a fitness watch or a smartwatch without breaking the bank      
214,3.0,                       i mainly bought this watch to record steps and mileage when hiking   the gps is quite functional   for those purposes it works well   if you are looking for an accurate heart rate and sleep monitor  this  is not  the device to buy   tends to be erratic and inconsistent   for that reason  this watch gets   stars instead of a higher rating   a product should not be marketed until thoroughly tested and all of its features work as advertised      
215,5.0,                       i just upgraded to this watch from my garmin forerunner     w that i had for six years  it served me well  but just started glitching  i chose to stick with garmin due to the long lifespan and the fact that they re known for running watches i like this watch a lot  the gps is accurate  and it updates my pace very quickly mid run  it also has various goals  like longest run  fastest  k  etc  the wrist band is very comfortable and and can adjust to many sizes  i ll primarily use it for gps while i run bike  but it has lots of other cool features   it can connect to your phone which allows you to program it to send notifications  connect to the weather  and link to music  if you want to skip to the next song using the watch  for example   i personally don t need all that  because if i have my phone in my pocket  i don t need it on my wrist i d definitely recommend this to anyone who s looking for a simple running watch that is good quality and has some smartwatch characteristics      
216,1.0,                       i ve had this watch for about    months  and in that time it worked quite well  we had a perfect relationship  i would look at it  and it would tell me the time  my heart rate  and how far i d gone using my old trusty  chevrolegs   however  this watch decided to quit on me  and one day just shut off and wouldn t turn back on or charge  i cannot with good conscience endorse such a miserable quitting pos that refuses to even turn on after such a short lifespan  so it gets the   star treatment p s   garmin customer service tells me they can charge me    dollars for a replacement  but that s all they will do      
217,5.0,                       i really like this fitness tracker and it is a great bang for your buck  it tracks everything i need it to and it syncs with my ww app so i can get my fitness points logged in daily without even doing anything      
218,2.0,                       if you are looking to track heartrate  get something with a chest strap   i knew it would not be as good as what you get with a chest strap  but at least thought it would be in the ballpark  like within    bpm   sometimes  it is off by over    beats and it is not remotely consistent   sometimes it works almost as well as my watch with a strap  sometimes it is a little off and sometimes waaaay off so there is really no way to even calibrate it to yourself   nice looking and watch features are good  but if you are looking for a vaguely reliable hr monitor  get something else      
219,5.0,                       bought as a gift for the wife   she likes the fact that the band is adjustable to fit larger to small wrists   use with the free app to track workouts   battery life is great   locks on to gps quickly   has a heart monitor that reads from the wrist   over all i would say it is a real good fitness tracker      
220,1.0,                       the watch takes too long and is too difficult to turn on  it doesn t allow for the date to be set  it is stuck on  sun     either when synced via bluetooth to my phone nor when connected to gps  per the manual  and it takes far too long to acquire a gps satellite  very disappointing  it s going back      
221,5.0,                       got this as extra motivation to keep up new habits   i have to say its been great seeing results over weeks   months  maybe the only drawback is finding other people that also use garmin for their activities but there are enough  rd party apps out there that will pull this data if you re looking to go head to head against others using fitbits etc      
222,4.0,                       i use this watch only for running  i run     miles a day    days a week  this watch is easy to use and read   my only complaint is that the calorie count seems totally random   for instance  i ran     miles today  and the watch told me i d burned     calories   i slowly walked two miles the other day with my kids  and the watch told me i d burned     calories  i ran a fast  k  and the watch told me i d burned     calories   you get the picture   i am more interested in mileage and time  and those features seem to work well   but it would be nice if the calorie feature worked      
223,4.0,                       it helps me a lot to manage my goals and not to get fooled by my feelings or impressions  when you start as runner sometimes at the middle of your training you could say to yourself   oh that s enough for today  but then you watch the distance you ve achieved  watch your heart rate monitor and you can make some adjustments to your running to make it last a little bit more and work better      
224,4.0,                       primary use is cardio  walking   cycling setup is a little tricky at first  but becomes easier with use the metrics provided encourage you to push harder   achieve fitness goals   my only dislike is the band  it s a little thin   rubbery getting on wrist a thicker band would be ideal cheers      
225,5.0,                       best fitness watch  it has so many different functions  easy to use  should definitely have one     
226,5.0,                       this is a great watch for almost any activity  i use it while running  walking  hiking  and biking and it works great  i have used this forerunner for a year and it continues to perform and i am pretty rough on it  it also works great with garmin s connect site and under armours app  my fitness pal      
227,5.0,                       was looking for a watch to track only what i wanted which was running and walking  my water intake and my weight  i already have a phone so when i run i don t want a phone ringing or texting  no music and i wear the farming watch to keep track of my steps  i love the app which allows me to only keep track of what i want and close the stuff i don t care about  the app and watch were super super easy to set up  they are easy to use as well  they don t have any extras which i love  basic  my husband has bought me the          apple watch and i hated it  too much to deal with      
228,1.0,                       i researched a bit before before replacing my old  tired and trusted polar  as most present models within a reasonable price range receive appalling user reviews i decided on this one as it appeared to be one of the  lesser bad  wrong decision  this thing sucks  as does its software and consumer support   wont link  wont work  money thrown away      
229,3.0,                       i only rate this watch as ok  it is great for tracking my heart rate with an attached chest strap  and the gps works well enough  the battery lasts about     days which is great  but the negative  the intensity minutes don t work at all  i can receive minutes for walking around in my kitchen  but hit interval training for    minutes gives me no vigorous minutes counted  also  it will not log any exercise minutes unless i have my heart rate over      so no normal workouts get logged as intensity minutes  i contacted garmin support  and they said this is normal  they were of no help  also the resting heart rate figures are completely inaccurate i recommends  this watch only for it s basic functions  gps  heart rate with strap  and steps  for anything else  i would look elsewhere      
230,4.0,                       since you can get these for around       they re a great gps watch for the price  i m old school on gps watches  being a  retired  excessive marathoner and trail runner  i ve had garmins since they first came out  i tended to use the bulkier but more accurate forerunners  i m still on a    xt for running use because it s more accurate than newer units and it includes bread crumb mapping  which is key when you want to follow your patch back in unfamiliar territory  or pre load a trail   this little unit doesn t do any of that  but it s still a great one because it s got much better visibility and it s a lot easier to use  if you just want to count steps  get some heart rate info  and log running or biking workouts    plus get a text message or two  then this is an excellent gps watch at that price point      
231,1.0,                          does not come with paper copy of the user manual  must get online   bought as an ant  compatible hr monitor to use with peloton bike  it paired one time and seemed to work great for that first ride   i ve had multiple pairing issues ever since and have been unable to get it to reconnect and pair with the bike   i read the user manual and followed troubleshooting advice on both garmin and peloton websites   very disappointed because otherwise  it was a very nice watch      
232,5.0,                       great for running  our son is able to effectively track his mileage  route and time his runs with this watch  he likes that it is not bulky but does the job      
233,1.0,                       very dissatisfied with this watch  it will connect with the app but it won t sync at all about half the time  and i don t think it s because of the app  especially since after one year the app has been updated several times  the other issue i have is with the heart rate monitor which sometimes it just doesn t work  it will get stuck at around    and no matter the intensity of my exercise it still won t change  i tried all the tips to improve the accuracy but without success  it s not worth paying all this money for the quality  and last year it was about      if i remember correctly      
234,5.0,                       highly recommended  at first i ordered a cheaper product and what a waste that was  i should have just bought this from the beginning  well worth the money  the mileage is accurate  i compared it with a running app on my phone and markers on the trail  the heart rate seems accurate compared to other devices i ve used  very easy to use and read  everything i was looking for to track my workouts     
235,1.0,                       i bought my first forerunner    in january      from amazon  a few weeks after purchase  and after amazon s return window had closed  i received a cryptic message on the watch   setting time by gps   and then the watch simply stopped working  garmin tech support concluded that the watch had failed a software upgrade  and sent me a new one  about   months after receiving my new watch  the watch face fell off  garmin sent me a refurbished watch  it s now november        a few days ago i once again received that cryptic message   setting time by gps   followed by a diagnostics screen  and once again the watch simply stopped working  tech support was friendly and helpful  but baffled  and strongly encouraged me to simply upgrade to a different forerunner unit  specifically a forerunner      at a     discount  since the forerunner     is a more expensive watch  the cost to me would still be       about what my original watch cost  i declined  so tech support agreed to send me   as a courtesy   another refurbished forerunner     but warned me that that was the last time garmin would send me a replacement watch i love most garmin products  mainly gps receivers  and had high hopes for this watch  but it keeps letting me down  i wonder if anyone else has had as many problems as me      
236,1.0,                       this is a classic case of fool me once  shame on you   i own a garmin forerunner     it works  but it s flaky  so i decided to get a new watch  plus i needed a watch that i could use for interval training  i read several good reviews of this watch  it had the features i needed for a good price  so i decided to give garmin another shot apparently the reviewers got the watches that actually work i plugged in the watch into a wall charger to charge it as soon as i got it     hours later  nada  the watch wasn t charging and it wouldn t power on  someone on a garmin forum suggested plugging it into a laptop to get it going  this worked to get the watch to turn on and charge  but neither the mac os nor the garmin express software could find the watch  this meant i couldn t sync the watch or install the update i couldn t tell you if it works well on runs since i couldn t get past the basics of charging syncing updating i m returning it today and i will never purchase a garmin product ever again  what a hassle      
237,5.0,                       another good garmin product  but with several issues issue      heart rate monitoring accuracy is unfortunately hit or miss   running with my forerunner    my heart rate is not accurate  it is usually       bpm low   compared to my forerunner    with a garmin chest strap my history on my regular     mile run is quite different   on a treadmill my forerunner      chest strap compares closely to a professional heart rate monitor with a cuff  the difference is nearly always less than   bpm  the model    difference is      bpm lower than the professional hrm   i have also run wearing both the     with garmin chest strap  and the    on the same runs and have seen those same differences issue      battery life is quite short  usually about   days with an hour run each day is about the limit before it s recharge time  this is in sharp contrast to my forerunner    which can easily go      days with a one hour run each day and     weeks with no running   the best i can get from the    with no runs is maybe     days issue       the forerunner    is far more fragile than the      the first day i wore it i somehow chipped the side of the case  two weeks later while running i caught my toe on a raised piece of sidewalk and took a tumble   while i wasn t hurt  the band snapped and the watch face was damaged  suffering a crack across the screen and a chunk broken out of the corner of the display when it landed about    feet away   it still functions but the gps uptake time has greatly increased so in summary  the    is good but the screen is easily damaged   the model    has a wide bezel to protect the screen while the model    does not  this leaves the model    screen completely unprotected if you take a fall  the heart rate is inaccurate by at least       but it does have a wide range of functions and the gps seams accurate   a what i won t do is wear it as my day to day watch  as i do with my older model      the    is pretty expensive and just too easy to damage for daily use update   may     my garmin    has pretty much given up   today  during my morning run i noticed that the screen is now only half visible  the other half is completely black  and both the gps and bluetooth seem to have quit as well   i can only assume that the fall i had in late january caused severe damage internally and now the watch is done   i ve reverted to using my garmin    with chest strap  the model    is now wiped out  i won t replace it this review needs an update   like some others i had some issues  most were caused by a fall that chipped the screen and caused functional problems   i called garmin and explained i had damaged the watch and garmin replaced it at no charge   the replacement looked new and  functioned properly   during my conversation it s the garmin representative he gave me some hints to get the best from it  i detail these below because i had never seen them elsewhere     heart rate monitor responds poorly  often  sticking  at some obviously wrong count  i e  showing   bpm when i m running an   min pace and my hr should be about          slow incorrect response doing intervals and other similar response problems there were problems with the initial gps uptake at new locations as well so i called garmin support and talked with a very helpful tech savvy guy who was able to cure all of the complaints in just a few minutes first  make sure the  garmin connect  app is on your phone  bluetooth is enabled and the fr   and phone are paired   wait until they sync   next fully charge the watch then shutdown the watch by holding the top left button on the watch until  shutdown  is displayed then select yes and the watch will shutdown and the screen will blank shutdown fully powers off the watch  now leave it powered off for at least    hours then take it outside where you have a clear view of the eastern sky and press the same button used to shutdown the watch briefly  this and the    hour shutdown will have the watch restart all of its os components  reconnect all gps components and reset clocking as well as doing some internal house keeping by clearing out stale files and freeing up operating memory   all this is kind of like rebooting windows  cures a bunch of problems now that the watch has been restarted and settled down  go wash you re hands  especially the place on your wrist where the back of the watch will be  also clean the back of the watch as well   now go for a run  you ll probably find that the problems you had before are gone   that s how it was with my watch   now it s my habit to reboot before every run and the last six months have been completely trouble free      
238,5.0,                       bought this to replace my vivoactive that died on me after    months      this one is much more affordable  so far so good although it doesn t have the same bells and whistles of the vivoactive   easy pairing with garmin connect on my samsung note     i ve had this for a week and i still have   bars on battery life before i need to charge  gotta love prime shipping as i was lost without my garmin        
239,2.0,                       i went to the doctor and my heart rate according to their machine was     the watch said      and my heart rate according to the watch is rarely below      i had a friend let me use his fitbit and it also read my heart rate at between    and    while this watch was still saying over      later in the day when i wasnt doing any strenuous activity it said that i was at      and the only reason i knew that was because the watch said i had reached my intensity minutes for the entire week after only wearing it for half a day  now after only   days it says i am at     intensity minutes which is screwing with my calories in out for the day in the garmin app on my phone  i will be returning  the only reason i gave this   stars instead of one is because the gps was very accurate for my morning walk     
240,3.0,                       i purchased an apple watch primarily for running and discovered it s not very well suited to that purpose   so i thought i d try the well priced garmin      it s much better as a pure running watch  but still has a few shortcomings that make me hesitant to switch pros i love the form factor   it s easy to read  light and easy to wear and battery life is excellent  several days vs  maybe    hours with apple watch    the band is stretchy  so you can put it on snugly and still be comfortable  which can be good if you find your watch feels too loose after you get warmed up during your workout wrist heart rate monitor works well   i love having average and max heart rate   i like to check my heart rate after a particularly difficult interval or hill climb  i like being able to see graphs of heart rate over the course of a run  more below  gps seems reasonably accurate   it also did not take too long to acquire satellites at the beginning of a run the watch makes lots of data available  both during run  values displayed are configurable   yay   and after via garmin connect  including heart rate vs  pace and heart rate vs  elevation  price was very reasonable cons you can t download custom workouts from garmin connect to the watch   you can only create simple interval workouts on the watch with identical repeats of one effort interval followed by one recovery interval   it s not possible to do a ladder or mix different distances for your effort laps   don t even think of trying to start     intervals every      or      minutes  though you can put a      or      rest between intervals and that works great  if that s what you re into    when i complained about the lack of interval diversity to a running buddy  he said  you can create those workouts on garmin connect and download them to the watch    that s true for other garmin models  but not the     switching units between miles  for long runs  and km  for track workouts  requires about a million button presses   also  it requires you to use km  although i suspect most people think of their track work in terms of meters  not kilometers   so if you want to run      s  you either run     miles  not the same  or     km  the same  but not how i m used to thinking of it    also  i m not sure what the implications are for garmin connect when you change your units on the watch   ideally  i d even be able to see my     splits  for example  after i run      intervals  but this is not possible either   garmin connect will only show your lap splits and your lap distance can only be one mile or one km  using garmin connect requires a bluetooth connection to a smartphone   there s no wifi   i don t really need to look at my workout on my tiny phone screen  especially since the watch itself shows a pretty good summary   i d much rather look at it in a browser on my pc   but to do that  first i have to make a bluetooth connection with my phone   seems like an extra step i d rather avoid by syncing via wifi   also  a few times the watch has had difficulty establishing the bluetooth connection with the phone   i ve never experienced that problem with the apple watch nits  ui for interval workouts takes some getting used to   i ve found myself running without having the lap timer started   i ve also had trouble figuring out how to restart an interval workout after a pause  hey  i needed a bathroom break    i ve pressed the lap button and the pause button on the opposite side simultaneously by accident multiple times   i put this as a nit because i like to assume that i ll get used to it  although i m not sure i ever managed to remember all the button functions on my old timex ironman   especially when i m in the middle of a grueling workout   some better usability testing may have been helpful here  i had to turn autopause off because i didn t have confidence in it   it seemed too quick to pause and too slow to restart   after i recommenced running for       meters and looked at the watch only to see it still had not started  i turned autopause off permanently  when i do my track workouts  according to the garmin  i usually end up having to run a few extra strides beyond where i started to complete my interval distance   this happened whether i had my units set to miles or km   i ve only tried the watch during multiple workouts on the same pretty old track  though  so i haven t really explored this nit summaryas disappointed as i am in the apple watch as a running watch  i m not switching to the garmin until they address at least the first two items under cons above   i feel certain the cons i mention above are purely in the software  so hopefully they ll enhance some of those capabilities in a future update   if not  maybe garmin needs to release a forerunner    that handles those features better   the higher end garmins may already cover those complaints  but they re too expensive for a running watch and not sufficiently capable for a smart watch      
241,4.0,                       after extensive research about different running watch and fitness tracker manufacturers and models  i wore the garmin forerunner    and the fitbit charge   on the same wrist for several days and conducted a detailed comparative analysis of their data  think spreadsheets with multiple tabs and graphs   the metrics i looked at included daily resting heart rate  steps  calories  distance  and sleep  i also examined activity data  i e   distance  average heart rate  average pace  and calories during my runs and dog walks at the end of the day  the two fitness trackers gave fairly consistent data  with variance usually at or below     an acceptable margin all things considered  however  after this experience  and despite loving the forerunner    s built in gps  which the charge   lacks   i chose to go with the fitbit for three reasons    the fitbit has more frequent heart rate sampling    the sensors measure it every   seconds while resting  compared to what appeared to be measurements every minute    for the garmin  i realized this because i noticed that the fitbit s green leds were always on  but they were frequently off  not flashing  on the garmin and would only come on periodically  presumably this is to save battery life on the forerunner practically speaking  this meant that stats over a longer period of time  such as average heart rate during a    minute run  or resting heart rate for the day  were fairly comparable between the two  but if i wanted to get my current heart rate at a glance  the fitbit was usually spot on as soon as i looked at the device  whereas the garmin was sometimes    bpm too high or too low   i am fairly in tune with my resting heart rate so know the fitbit was accurate in these cases and the garmin was off    especially because once the garmin told me it was    bpm  and i know my resting heart rate is more in the high   s  once the forerunner realized i was trying to look at heart rate data  it would start flashing its leds and the number would then either decrease or increase to pretty much match what the fitbit was showing me from the get go  this is a minor issue that wouldn t compromise the integrity of heart rate data in the long run    after all  relative trends over time are what these sorts of devices are best for    but i got annoyed by seeing incorrect numbers and having to wait       seconds for the forerunner to adjust    the forerunner s sleep tracking wasn t as accurate as the fitbit  i think this comes down to an issue of sensor sensitivity and or how algorithms interpret the sensor data on the back end  basically  the forerunner was consistently telling me that i was getting anywhere from       minutes more sleep than the fitbit every night  i have a good sense of knowing how i feel with n hours of sleep  and i think the forerunner was overestimating further evidence for this hypothesis is that one night  i got up around   a m  to go to the bathroom and check on my dog  the next morning  this few minutes of  awake  time and the steps i took were reflected in my fitbit data  but not the garmin data  basically  the forerunner somehow missed that i woke up  got out of bed and walked to the bathroom down the hall  walked to the living room  and walked back to bed  the missing steps are not important to me  but how did the device not catch on to the fact that i was awake  surely it should ve picked up on that based on my heart rate and movement    the garmin s step counting was overzealous  the forerunner    consistently told me i was doing more steps per day than the charge    sometimes only by         steps but other times by         steps  that s an almost     margin if you re aiming for        steps per day i m guessing one reason for this is that the fitbit allows you to adjust settings in the app for wear on your dominant vs  non dominant wrist  the former resulting in algorithms that err on the side of excluding movements that may not be steps  garmin s devices do not appear to have this setting  meaning they are probably overcounting by interpreting some non step movements as steps    i m a fairly petite person            lbs  and the forerunner    was a bit too big for my taste  the screen s length pretty much occupied the entirety of my wrist width  and it was pretty thick too  i occasionally had trouble pulling my sleeves up if my clothes were fitted  such as with long sleeved base layers    which i would wear while running  precisely when i wanted to see the watch  obviously an issue of preference  but i found it mildly annoying in conclusion  i would say that none of these is a deal breaker if what you really want out of the forerunner is a decent gps running watch  its built in gps is truly wonderful  the auto lap feature is super convenient  and the customizable data fields for workouts are fantastically brilliant  it s uber functional without any superfluous or overly complicated frills  and i especially love that it has the day of the week and date shown on its always on display  battery life is competitive  especially for a gps watch  however  when push comes to shove  i personally prefer more reliable data  i couldn t keep using it and raising an eyebrow every time the information the device gave me didn t match what i know about my own body      
242,2.0,                       i would not buy this particular heart rate monitor again   if i buy another one in the near future it will have a chest band monitor  transmitter   that said  the news is not all bad bad news  the heart rate monitor  when using the  on board  wrist measurement has been inaccurate and unreliable for me   at first it was inaccurate  reading as much as     low  compared to taking my pulse for   s then multiplying by  x    that improved  for a while  by keeping the battery fully charged  i d put it on the charger whenever the battery indicator had less than four bars  nearly every night    then it stopped being reliable  it wouldn t even read my heart rate   i put the monitor above my wrist bone as recommended in the instructions   i put it right at my wrist joint  i put it on my other arm  in both locations   some times it would read  other times it wouldn t   because of this  average heart rate  was often wildly low   oh  and i thought perhaps the hair on my arm was interfering  so i used my clippers to trim my hair where the monitor goes   performance was unimproved i now have it synched to the chest strap monitor  transmitter from my old garmin   we ll see how long that will work good news  i am not an elite athlete so i need only some basic functions  heart rate  distance  time  pace   this monitor provides many many more features  some of which i like and now use   i like that it can separate running  cycling  and cardio   i like that it reports resting  average  momentary  current and maximum heart rate   i like that garmin connect can report v   max  but why not for cardio exercise      
243,1.0,                       read the reviews before purchasing this watch   mostly hit and miss so i was skeptical   the gps tracking on this watch is just horrible   it shows me running way off the beaten path  sometimes hundreds of yards from the trail road   the hr monitor is good at taking resting pulse and that s about it   the watch is not good at transferring data and takes forever to find satellites before your activity   don t waste your money      
244,5.0,                       training for a marathon   it s fantastic   i get continuous distance and time reading and  every mile with a vibration  my minutes for that mile   i can also save each run s results  again  by mile    absolutely love it      
245,2.0,                       i bought the garmin    primarily as a heart rate monitor   i wanted a monitor that looked like a watch  didn t want to deal with the fitbit type screens   the garmin is a nice looking watch  looks a little like the apple watch   i used a polar heart rate monitor for many years but got tired of dealing with the chest strap so i did alot of research and settled on the garmin      this is a roundabout way of saying i am very familiar with tracking my heart rate been using the garmin    for about   months now and use it often   it s pretty good in everything except heart rate accuracy   with that  it s pretty bad   if it was off by a certain amount each time  i could sort of estimate what the rate really is by adding something to the number to get in the ballpark   but  it s wildly inconsistent to the point of almost uselessness   there are times when my heart is beating strongly during strenuous exercise and the garmin shows a resting number   other times  it ll be off but within an acceptable range   other times  it ll be reasonably accurate   if working out at the gym  i can use one of machine monitors to compare the garmin   before you ask  i m familiar with how to maintain a monitor  i clean it regularly   the polar ones i used trained me well aside from looking good   it holds a charge pretty well   i get at least a few days between charges   it has other nice features   but  if you re looking for an accurate heart rate monitor  i don t think this is the answer      
246,5.0,                       i didn t really buy it to track my sleeping but i love the way it tracks my steps and that i can use it indoor on my elliptical  i have an old heart rate monitor chest band that it actually connect to   very pleased so far      
247,5.0,                       i already have one and love it  bought one for my teenager  he loves it  and it has him motivated to move more in his day  we even set up family challenges where we all compete for steps  a fun watch for sure  accurate  really comfortable band that you can easily wear while sleeping      
248,5.0,                       my former garmin died after about    years  and the same model was super expensive   this garmin    is so compact  and super easy to use   has all the same features  plus a couple i didn t expect   buy it  you ll love it      
249,5.0,                       this provides what i needed in an exercise watch  it keeps track of my heart rate  this is important to me as i m recovering from a heart attack  it measures my walks accurately mileage wise  there are some features that i do not use such as the run tracker  i am not a runner  there are features that i am gradually finding  the features i wanted  i have found and they work great      
250,5.0,                       i used to use an old timex ironman for my timing runs  my peers all switched to gps watches  well  my only regret was waiting so long to buy one  this one does all i need  very happy with my purchase      
251,5.0,                       i bought this for myself to keep track of how many miles i walk   i also then connected garmin connet to strava to keep track of my activity with my friends   this device is easy to use   it is very accurate because it has a gps   so much better than just tracking steps   you can use it with a lot of activies   this is made well   the band is super comfortable   definitely a good find for      this is must have      
252,5.0,                       i absolutely love this watch and fitness tracker  the garmin app is amazingly easy to navigate and the gps is amazingly accurate  i bought it for the gps  the fact that it is waterproof and for the easy to read screen  i am delighted with this product  still haven t received the square trade protection plan i paid for  they say i have but i have not received it  not happy about that      
253,1.0,                       my daughter and son in law have this watch and love it  so i was excited to get mine   i think i got a lemon   i can be out walking and it will flash  move     my pace is about a      min mile  so i am moving at a reasonable pace    if i m at the grocery store  no steps are logged because my arm isn t swinging   at the gym  i can be jogging on the treadmill and it will show my heart rate at   bpm   i will then measure my heart rate on the treadmill and it will tell me i m at       all i can say about my garmin is that it accurately tells time   none of the other features on my watch are reliable    i typically don t sleep with it on  so i m unsure about it s sleep tracking features    very  very disappointed      
254,5.0,                       before i bought this watch  i researched for months many different running watches before i made my decision  i kept coming back to this watch  but was delaying due to the negative reviews  let me tell you who this watch is isn t for  sidenote i ve had an apple watch before and i absolutely hated it  people think when they get the watch they will use it to call text but come on  the screen is so small anyways  i d get irritated and never use it for those features  the one feature i did like  the sleep tracker  i never used because the watch would die like every day and i d have to charge it at night in order to use it the next day  super irritating  also  mileage was always off when running  like  off by a lot and i could probably have fixed this  but was too lazy to and felt like that shouldn t happen with an apple watch the garmin watch is meant for a runner  if you aren t such a serious runner maybe running     miles then i m sure you can get away with something else but the main reason i needed a watch was to track my mileage and timing only during my daily runs and races  i average around    miles per week and so holding my phone while running just wasn t cutting it  i am a millennial and like my technology but i didn t need a damn watch to do all these special features that i had at my disposal before but never used  this was one of the negative comments i kept seeing  how this watch was simple  well  i just need it to tell me my distance accurately so that s what it s for  bonus points that it also gives hr continuously and tracks your sleep so to me it s amazing  also without a touchscreen i don t have to worry about accidentally hitting a button  it s easy and that s all i need  also i only have to charge it like weekly not even that if i actually waited for it to die which i never do  that is huge for me especially after having the apple watch  it is gps acquired and i ve run with it on a track and multiple races so i know it s definitely accurate  had this watch since january and have had no issues  love when you re done running you can sync the phone easily to come up in the app so you can see everything even in more details  one thing i will address is the pacing  people say the average pace pr mile is slow and takes a while to catch up  while this may be the case  this does not bother me one bit because i ve been running for so long i have my pacing down  i m looking at the time like oh  at      minutes i am hitting     at   i should be at      for example  i always know what my mile time is going to be around and it s always at that time so this doesn t bother me at all  in summary  while the watch screen may not be like super fancy looking  i ve been over the apple watch since i got it and this watch literally does what it s supposed to  accurately give you your running distance and time      
255,5.0,                       i have had my garmin forerunner    watch for about   months now and have been using almost daily  i m a high school cross country runner and i got this watch for the running season  it has been a great watch for tracking runs  workouts and i have probably ran around     mile so far with it  i have found that the battery life for the forerunner    has been exceptionally great and i could go about   days using it with activity s of around   hour on one charge  subject to vary depending on how much it is used   when i got done with my running season i only used my watch for the time  using no activities  and i was very surprised that the battery lasted about    days or more days  it s really nice to have a watch that doesn t need to be charged all the time  i would recommend getting the garmin forerunner    for people that are wanting a simple watch for a cheaper price      
256,2.0,                       pros the watch seems to be pretty accurate for tracking distances looks niceeasy to get set up and usecons already had connection issues and had to reset it to adjust settingsheart rate monitor is very inaccurate   it even shows a heart rate when it s laying on my counter top at this point i wish i had shopped around a little moreupdate after   calls to garmin i still can t get it working properly  will return and would not recommend     
257,4.0,                       update  garmin customer support replaced my watch that wasn t syncing properly  and i love it now  also  the garmin app has been updated since i originally wrote this review  and the new version is much nicer to use garmin has been making gps devices for runners for a long time  and that shows in the forerunner  the forerunner    lets you do things you d expect on an advanced running gps  like customize the screens you see during your run with any of roughly a dozen different stats  things like distance  pace  average pace  time  etc  and it can manage things like interval workouts  the device is small  for a gps watch   and comfortable to wear the forerunner    is a runner s gps  and with my background as a college runner  i appreciated all of the features it offered  still  it has room for improvement  i had a very difficult time getting it to sync properly with my phone  and ultimately had to do a factory reset on the gps before it would sync properly  the garmin connect phone app did not feel polished  and i still occasionally get notifications that bluetooth sync failed  although it works again after reconnecting   if garmin would update their software to fix the bluetooth syncing problems  my review would be   stars the good    syncs to garmin connect app   website     customizable screens in run mode   see any stat wherever you want     support for interval training     supports most phone notifications  text  call  calendar  etc      small  comfortable  lightweight     you can go back to look at run history on the watch the bad    had trouble getting bluetooth activity sync to work   fixed   see update     garmin connect app   website have some sync problems  and aren t that easy to use   fixed   see update      
258,4.0,                       says avg resting heart rate is     heart rate has never been lower than    so this average seems to be way off steps off by about     per hundred steps  checked this after wearing the watch for a few days  walked     steps and watch showed    steps  not sure if it gets better or worse percentage wise with more steps  seems like it would be worse syncs to phone but app then says no data for any activity or health   performance or anything else  like it syncs a blank  online web site not any better even when i hooked watch up through usb cable to upload data to site date will not change even after having walked for an hour with the gps activated  rebooted watch and it said acquiring date and time by gps but comes back to the same wrong date and time  can set time manually but not date   instruction for watch not very in depth  had to find independent videos online for in depth operation and use of features likely going to return this watch at        i think more of the advertised features should work better than they do and some do not work at all   update to previous review  i exchanged the first watch for another forerunner     the replacement watch functions as advertised and all bugs of previous watch are now non issues with new unit  amazon made the exchange process ridiculously easy and efficient which i suppose is why they are so successful  received replacement   days after i opted for the exchange   i was offered options of speaking to a tech rep  exchange or refund  fortunately i chose exchange      
259,5.0,                       this is our  rd one to purchase  this one was a christmas gift for our son  he loves it  his sisters each have one for cross country and they all use theirs during swim practice  it motivates them all and they have a little competition amongst themselves for steps and miles per day      
260,4.0,                       i bought two of these watches to replace a set of forerunner   s that my wife and i have used for over   years  the long life of the   s really pushed me towards the     the only problems we had with the   s were a band replacement and eventually poor battery life  this was the killer  our new   s arrived and one of them had defect on the screen     star   otherwise  both watches worked fine  since another reviewer had mentioned a screen defect that got worse over time  i decided to exchange the watch  amazon promptly handled this exchange  the new watch did not have any noticeable screen defect i replaced the band on my watch  i got the green band originally  the quality of the band was fine  but there was something i didn t expect  i bought this watch intending to use it as a running watch only  however  i ve grown to like the smart watch features and the day tracking stuff  i bought a more subdued band to fit in better with my daily attire this watch really is great  in fact  it s almost too great for the price point  the only feature missing is a swim tracking mode  i feel like this was omitted not because of hardware constraints  but rather to give some people a reason to go with a higher end model run tracking accuracy is spot on  i run with several folks who have different  more expensive models  and all of our data lines up perfectly garmin connect continues to be great  i like the android app and the website overall  i happily recommend the forerunner         
261,2.0,                       i have been a die hard garmin fan  but i am so disappointed  my first garmin forerunner lasted for     years  second one lasted   years  and my most recent garmin s band broke after   months  i will have to buy a new band  and install it   quality just doesn t seem to be as important as it used to be   what a rip off update  that garmin just stopped working  amazon replaced it  and the band on the new one broke in two months  i take good care of my belongingings  thoroughly disappointed again     
262,5.0,                       love my watch  use for every workout  great for gps tracking my run  easy to read and use   wish it would automatically sync to my phone    but not a deal breaker  i just manually sync my workouts at the end of the day   i am a small petite female and the face of the watch doesn t overwhelm my wrist      
263,3.0,                       this watch is ok  it works  you can do some things with it but i used to have a pebble and the level of functionality here is unreasonably low it s an electronic display   why not have the ability to change watchfaces it can receive notifications   why not have the ability to send canned replys it runs various programs   who not allow the installation of othersto me this seems as though garmin is simply using this as a way to get you to buy their more expensive products when they could actually add this to this model     
264,5.0,                       wear it all of the time  even in the pool syncs right up to phone  and gives all of the data      
265,4.0,                       my favorite feature is the  clothes pin  adapter to the charger  on the other hand  the proprietary connectors tend to get misplaced  leaving you without the option of some other industry standard usb connector  that you have lying around   products like fitbit have the same issue  even across their own product line  but with  imo  inferior contacts on their physical interface additionally  on my particular android  i had to not pair the watch using normal bluetooth   it only worked if i paired it through the garmin connect app   i have other devices that have this quirk  so i didn t waste a lot of time there i will use it for running  though i m primarily a cyclist and use a garmin     edge  i use garmin connect and strava  but the forerunner    makes it possible to log workouts  without taking an hrm chest strap and phone along on the run  i have found it to be a good value      
266,5.0,                       i ve been wearing this product now for over a month and it has been great  i like all the features on it and i like how i can turn on or off the alerts  i really like the color as well  i have had more compliments on this watch  i highly recommend this product      
267,1.0,                       i bought this for heart rate monitoring and step counts  on the second day the hear rate went off the rails  at one point it shoed my resting rate ae     while i was working in my office  my true resting rate varies between      bpm   then the average showed   bpm and that is after me working out during lunch on the   days i wore it  on the second day i was walking all over the factory and went to the gym and it showed my step count at     when in reality it should have been around       minimum  i came close to buying the heart band to get a true reading but this thing is just unreliable across multiple functions      
268,4.0,                       my husband uses this watch for long distance running   he finds it easy to use without unneeded gadgets   this watch is also water resistant   the cost was reasonable      
269,3.0,                       i like the watch  it has good  basic features for my weekend trail runs   i was wearing it every day to track my activity and sleep   after a     mile run this past weekend  it just turned off and won t power on any more  even when connected to a power source  i even tried connecting it to a computer    i did not purchase the warranty so i m out      for a   month watch   the serial number also came off the watch due to sunscreen exposure so i couldn t make a claim even if that were an option   i will be buying my next garmin watch directly through garmin or rei      
270,5.0,                       this was a gift as a replacement for a fitbit surge  i believe  and she loves it   it is more accurate  has more functions  and is no where near as bulky   since she loves it i love it      
271,5.0,                       finally a watch that will continuously display heart rate  and any other metric you wish  throughout a workout   seems like nearly every other product has the display turn off to conserve battery   exactly what you don t want when you re in the middle of workout wanting to see your heart rate and other stats      
272,5.0,                       i run every other day and used to track my runs with my phone  i started having issues with my phone and decided to pick up a watch to track my runs so i didn t need to carry my phone anymore  all i can say is that i don t know what i waited for all these years  this watch does it all and even syncs to my mapmyrun account  i love the heart beat monitor and step counter as well  battery life has been much better than what the reviews and way longer than i anticipated      
273,4.0,                       the current average price of the forerunner    is a bargain for a very good      meter waterproof rated   fitness tracker  this tracker watch will provide those who perform moderate to intermediate fitness activities all the fitness data they ll likely want  and it will do it quite accurately  when it first debued   years ago  it was one of the top devices for the price today  garmin and many other manufacturers have tracker watches that provide a wide array of features and apps that the forerunner   can t deliver  but those are about  x more costly  so  at    rd the price of the latest devices  if you re a moderate intermediate fitness oriented person looking for an accurate waterproof tracker  this will likely satisfy you with all the data you will be interested in      
274,5.0,                       great watch for my daughter and we got it for a  steal  during the amazon prime sale      we really like this watch   its actually our second one   my teenage son has a black one   the watch is pretty durable  nice backlight and display  super cute band color  and it has all the typical features in an activity watch plus it can be connected to some mobile devices for text alerts   we bought a separate display guard and screen protector to make sure it stays nice and pretty      
275,5.0,                       upgraded from the     well worth it  finds the gps faster and it s easier to synch     
276,1.0,                       i like to keep track of my heart rate while the elliptical at my gym   the heart rate feature just plain doesn t work   it never went above     even when i was peaking   when i brushed my teeth quickly  it went up to over       it only responds to how quickly i move the wrist it is on      
277,4.0,                       so i ve taken up running recently to get in shape and lose some weight   i was looking for something to track my running or other activities with gps and heart rate   i also wanted something with great battery life to take the place of my pebble   i thought the forerunner    was going to be the watch   while i m very pleased with the battery life and simple display  the thing i m most disappointed in is the alarm   it would be more functional to be able to set up alarms from the phone app and have the option to set alarms for specific days   also when the phone rings the vibration should continue instead of just occurring once      
278,3.0,                       since purchasing this watch in march        i have used it extensively  i loved it   it was perfect for what i needed during my runs and bike rides  heart rate monitoring can be a off in a hit workout setting  but in general the average is okay  sleep tracking is not great  but not supper important to me  overall  this watch perfectly suited my needs and is easy to use  however after     years  it can no longer connect to gps  it doesn t have any physical damage and it is in otherwise good conditions  without a functioning gps  this watch no longer suits my needs  when i contacted support about the issue  they said the warranty only covers one year and the best they could offer me was a     discount on a different model or a refurbished replacement for      both options would require me to send them broken watch   i would not recommend this watch if it means buying a replacement every few years at a cost of around one to a few hundred dollars overall  great watch but the longevity leaves a lot to be desired      
279,5.0,                       i love this watch  easy to use with lots of great features specially after you download the app and pair it with your phone  it s the best bday gift my sons have given to me  best thing is that it did not cost them an arm and a leg     
280,2.0,                       who needs sleep tracking  who needs to be tracked during their workouts  this is waterproof pretty deep  but does it display pulse rate while swimming  no  and it s expensive as sin  if you want bluetooth this  wifi that    gps records of you  then this will do it  ready for your social credit score  there should be a better cheaper heart rate monitor  without a chest strap  available for much less      
281,4.0,                       great pricepoint for me  i got this to replace my beloved  old forerunner     that was shattered when i tripped on a run and ate pavement  this cheaper product does almost everything my expensive     did would be   stars if the gps connected a little faster  sometimes i stand around for a few minutes before it is ready to run      
282,3.0,                       i bought this to monitor my heart and i cannot find how to make it do that and the instructions do not give the right information on how to get it to the heart monitor     
283,5.0,                       instructions were a bit confusing at first but once i figured it out i am very satisfied with the forerunner         
284,2.0,                       absolutely stellar active watch for a beginner runner like myself  however after just   months of use the adhesive connecting the silicone band to the plastic  which screws into the watch   has completely separated  this leaves me with a glorified pocket watch      
285,3.0,                       are you a runner looking to take training to the next level  but can t afford a really pricey device  wondering why in the world you d even need one  i was in your shoes  as an activity tracker  the forerunner    is very nice  i give it   stars because many of the features that a runner would use don t work  and i feel it s deceptive to sell a device with these features when they re not really usable for training  essentially  this is a good activity tracker posing  ineffectively  as a training tool many reviewers mention that the forerunner    isn t for  serious runners   and i took that to mean that they believe  serious runners  need all the complexity of a very expensive watch  i need to know pacing  hr  distance  time  fancy analytics  realistically  aren t going to do a lot for my running  so really  this watch has everything a serious runner needs  the reason i believe reviewers say the device isn t for serious runners is that none of those features actually works in a way that is useful to someone trying to train seriously  the watch has pacing  heart rate and distance information  interval programming  virtual pacing  it notifies you when you deviate from a set pace   etc  however  in reality  most of these features don t work well enough to matter during a training session  you can get a nice ballpark pace during your slow runs  but it s pretty useless for speed work and can become really frustrating  here s the rundown pros hr monitor works very wellfor general pacing info on easy runs  the price is good and the device is adequateafter initially updating with the garminexpress app  satellite acquisition is quickcons  for runners     pacing   this is the feature that really drives me nuts  it can take up to   minutes to catch up to your pacing change   for example  during interval work it takes a long time for the device to figure out how fast you re going after a  down  piece  resulting in huge spikes in pacing as you overcompensate because the device hasn t caught up to you and you think you re running too slow  i ve raced with it  and as long as i didn t make any really drastic pace changes it was ok  but it s pretty useless for interval work    virtual pacer doesn t work   you have to be way  way off pace for a long  long time before it notifies you that your pacing is off  which is useless for intervals tempo work  they seem to have given it almost a full minute mile buffer on pace notifications  also  you can t change the desired pace during a run  so your warm up and cool down and any intentional pace changes will set off constant notifications   autopause doesn t work   you ll need to pause manually  it takes     seconds for the watch to start and stop  meaning you have large spikes in your data   intervals   you can only set one interval time and then run it over and over  which runners don t really do  so no ladders  cut downs  etc  i still have to carry my phone on interval speed work days so i have a useful interval timer  on the upside  you can program it to leave you alone during warm up and cool down  and start the intervals at any point during your runall in all  although it s very useful to have a pacing device for my runs  i greatly regret not spending a little more to get a better device for training  but i already blew my budget  so after a little live and learn and some really frustrating training sessions  i decided to write this review  no  i still don t believe you need fancy analytics from a really expensive watch to be a better runner  but i strongly recommend you find out just how well a device s features actually work before buying      
286,5.0,                       this is the best option for someone who wants to get gps and heartrate monitoring without paying for more stuff they won t use  the screen is very simple and monochrome and because of this the battery life is very good  it lasts for over a week before i need a charge  at least in the first couple months  the cycle time will diminish over the long term like any battery but it doesn t need to see the charger for over a week with regular use  the cell phone notifications are handy and you can tailor which apps come thru on the watch  so you can read texts or emails etc and filter other notifications  the sleep tracking is not very good but that s not the point of this watch  i love the thing and use it all the time  gives me good data for strava which is my primary use for it  my training is definitely better off with it      
287,5.0,                       love this watch my battery lasts one month easy to read  large display   menu driven rather than having a touch screen  which probably explains the long battery life   very simple cannot load apps on it like on my other garmin watch but it has the usual sports items  reading text and email messages  and daily and hourly weather   perfect  everything i need without a lot of unnecessary clutter  eating up batteries   if i lost it  i would purchase another one  exactly the same      
288,5.0,                       the simple functionality of the watch is the best feature of itself  it leaps me push my fitness levels and tells the time  and allows me to just see my notifications  i feel like other watches try to cram too many features in their product and end result is you lose sight of the main purpose of the watch  i love how strava has somewhat teamed up with garmin and made the products software interact seamlessly  i can go on a run or ride and all the normal info is tracked  segments  elevation  everything  all you have to do is hit the activity start button and go      
289,4.0,                       i bought for my wife who runs and walks relentlessly  she absolutely loves it but has noticed the steps and mileage doesn t seem to track as well when she is pushing a stroller vs  running by herself  my guess is the watch doesn t recognize her steps since she is holding the stroller but honestly have no clue overall  still a great looking watch that does pretty much everything she wants      
290,5.0,                       this is the first and only watch both my husband have purchased and we will keep purchasing the same watch if we need to like when i flush it down the toilet on accident  my husband has had his for over two years and it works fantastically      
291,5.0,                       works great  i love the heart rate feature  the gps is pretty good  but often has me several hundred yards away for an ending point  i wear it for cardio and i even wear it on when driving my tractors in the field for gps  unimportant in the field  but i do enjoy tracking how far me and the tractor put in going around and around in the field  sure has an important health aspect  but pretty fun to use the gps in other aspects  when it dies  i will buy again      
292,1.0,                       i have had previous garmin products and hate to say anything bad about them  but this product has issues  i am currently waiting for my  rd replacement in one year  the manual states that the product is waterproof up to    m and it is not  the customer service reps say that mine may have been failing because i am plugging them into a wall  not an into a computer usb  however  whenever it fails the screen starts to get a halo or what looks like a water ring around the screen that progresses into the screen pixilating  customer service has been excellent  but i don t want to ship the product back every   months  i just expect it to be waterproof if it is advertised to be waterproof  i use this every day to run  and it gets exposed to rain  sweat  etc  i do not swim with the product  but i also do not take it off to wash my hands  it has not been abused  when it works it is everything i could hope for  the gps is accurate  the gps is quick  the sleep monitoring is accurate  syncs with my phone great  and the heart rate monitor is accurate   i am currently doing research into a better product because i have passed the  yr warranty phase and i am certain this replacement will fail too      
293,5.0,                       so glad i got this watch  it is perfect for me  i love that i can read my texts or see who is calling while at work without having to take my phone out of my pocket  it also tracks miles great and links up with the nike run app  would definitely buy again      
294,1.0,                       i was trying out the one if the features and when i tried exiting it wouldn t let me stop the timer  i tried resetting there was no technique or button for that  the quality of the screen was ugly  the display of the screen as far as changing the face  you couldn t do some of the functions you couldn t use  the pacer took a couple of minutes to catch up  which is the main reason i brought the watch i have a fitness watch that i spent     and wanted to up grade to garmin for other features but the cheaper fitness watch work way better  it took me only a couple of hours to wrap it back up   send it out      
295,5.0,                       i ve had various running watches before   carmen    is easy to set up and use   the app also tracks sleeping and other health data that i did not expect   the depth of the watch on my wrist is bigger than expected and takes some getting used to it   i have had to remove the watch because of this issue i would re buy this watch especially for its price value      
296,1.0,                       the information may be hidden somewhere in the product materials but i didn t see it before buying  the watch band has latex in it  that became very apparent after i started wearing it for extended periods  i had to glue some cloth strips on the underside to be able to wear it  it also turns out the chest band hr monitor also has latex in it the wrist sensor for pulse rate is a random number generator unless you crank it down to the point it s uncomfortable  even then  it has random changes in hr that have nothing to do with activity  if you want accurate hr  you need the chest band sensor  however the unit uses the wrist pulse by default  so if you are not recording an activity  you have at best an approximate the unit is surprising good on tracking indoor treadmill distance for me  it s usually within      for a   mile run the elevation changes are much closer to actual numbers than my previous units the choice of activities to record is limited so i m often going back after synchronization and changing the category  however  it does have the common ones and it s easy to switch overall  i wound not buy it again because of the latex problem  if that s not your issue  it s a good unit at reasonable cost      
297,3.0,                       if i were a runner who ran mostly outdoors  i would probably give the garmin forerunner    five stars  but i m obliged to rate it instead according to its value to me  and even though i may not be the typical user  i can see no reason why better design decisions couldn t  in most cases  made it just as useful to me   however  because  as a crackerjack programmer and software designer myself  my expectations for the functional designs of computer based systems of others are quite low  so i was not unduly disappointed by my purchase i expected at least  that the garmin would provide me with an accurate gps based reading of time over distance for my infrequent outside workouts and races  and on that it delivers well   both with accurate readings  fast gps acquisition  and so far no dropouts even though some one of my courses follows a winding road up a wooded mountain also  i didn t necessarily suppose that i d find much use or interest in the device as a fitness tracker  and that i wouldn t want to wear it       but in that respect it provided me with a pleasant surprise   it s small size  comfortable band  and highly legible readout without illumination  all make it desirable to wear just as a watch  and the hr and fitness tracking data are just gravy   interesting  if not always reliable  more on that below  i am  in fact  a competitive speed walker who mostly trains indoors on the treadmill  so i also purchased the garmin footpad accessory in the hopes that it would help me to cross calibrate the various treadmills i use with each other and with my actual speed  but in that respect the reported forerunner   footpad results have been puzzling and unreliable   the functionality of the footpad  which laces into one s shoes  is supposed to based on an accelerometer that provides an estimate of stride length  and in some way this is supposed to be further calibrated for accuracy by wearing the footpad while training outside with the gps also enabled   i suppose that the gps measures the distance  while the footpad accelerometer at least counts the number of strides over various sampled distances  and  if its program were sufficiently sophisticated  might be able to correlate variations in acceleration with particular over the ground speeds   but no documentation is provided by garmin on the programming so one can only guess about this be that as it may  the actual speed pace results the garmin reports on training sessions of various treadmills where  as usual  i exercise at constant speeds for most of the session  anywhere from        minutes  typically   are far from the steady constant speed one presumes for the treadmills themselves   i do much of my training on my home treadmill  which is of pretty good quality  but i also go to the gym and use many of their expensive and robust treadmills  and the least i would expect from the garmin is that it would report an even pace for the long stretches when the treadmill speed doesn t vary   but that s not what i get in the first place  instead of an even constant pace line  i get a garmin readout consisting exclusively of up and down spikes which bounce around the treadmill reported pace by several   each way   that might be ok provided there was a way to derive the exact average for particular training stretches  but as it is the only thing i can do is to eyeball the graph and make a crude estimate of the average  the garmin needs to smooth the data instead of reporting it as a series of inaccurate spikes but that s a minor problem compared to the other anomaly i ve encountered in my constant pace sessions  the spiky garmin reported pace often sags across a session  with my average pace declining  say  from    mph to    mph  but then sometimes the pace seems to climb a gentle slope from lower to higher  and besides all that  there are occasional dropback spikes to much lower paces  even though i  and the treadmill belt  are just plugging along at one and the same pace throughout thus  one of the two main reasons i got this garmin   footpad  total price well over        to give me a way of independently checking the reported speeds of the various treadmill speeds i use  has been frustrated  and neither customer service  nor the sketchy manual have been able to offer any cogent explanation for these anomalies given the extensive functionality claimed for this device as a tracker of fitness  goals  personal bests and stuff like that  there are a number of other problems with the garmin forerunner      for example  it has modes that are supposed to be customized for walkers as well as runners  both inside and outside  differentiating gps based walking from inside footpad measured walking  and there are also modes for biking and for  cardio   whatever that is    yet personal bests over various classic distances like the  k  are only reported for running   which i don t do   i m a competitive speed walker or race walker  and am faster than many runners over the distances i do  yet my records don t get registered calorie trackingthe device undercounts calories for me both because it apparently treats the hundreds of stairs i climb each day as flat walking  and  more importantly  it undercounts the calories for the fast treadmill walking i do by from       compared to the online exrx calculator  at https   www exrx net calculators walkrunmets  which is based on american college of sports medicine data   and since the exrx calculator also undercounts calories for the speeds i walk at   mph and up   the garmin undercounts by some          for anyone else in my boat  who does speed walking or race walking  i suggest that they multiply the exrx results by about     if their speeds are in the      mph ranges   i ve worked out this factor based on comparisons between the graphs for the running and race walking world records that the world masters athletics organization has come up with and built into their own wma age grading calculator  at http   www howardgrubb co uk athletics wmalookup   html  which also permits level playing field performance comparisons between people of different ages heart rate trackingwhen i get up after sitting for a while  walk down the hall and climb a set of stairs  or conversely  after moving around i trot downstairs then sit down and check my hr  i get counts that are highly volatile and way out of line both with the polar ft  hr monitor i train with  and for that matter with my measured pulse   thus  doing the above might skyrocket my hr to     on the forerunner display  which then settles down rapidly  say by    beats every few seconds until it gets back to my actual rate in the   s    s  and   s   all within the compass of       seconds   my actual hr virtually never gets above the high   s after climbing the stairs  or the high   s if i m just walking down the hall   it appears that these wild fluctuations are somehow smoothed out and ignored in what the watch stores because they don t leave such wild peaks in the   hour rolling hr report display or in the hr graph that displays when i upload the data   why  then  doesn t the dynamic watch display work the same way   smoothing out the data like my polar ft  does before reporting it in wild misleading swings   it appears that the same set of poor design decisions were made for hr reporting as for pace reporting sleep reportingi m not going to comment on the device s differentiation between  deep sleep  and  light sleep  because these terms are nowhere defined in the sketchy inadequate manual  let alone related to the scientific sleep literature   i ve read and thought a lot about sleep science but the garmin provides me with nothing of value when it parses my sleep period into these two undefined categories  punctuated with occasional slivers of wakefulness  which don t necessarily correspond with my actual state of consciousness   what does matter to me though  is my heart rate during sleep  because i have  all my long life as a distance athlete  used my resting pulse  rp  as an indicator of fitness  or the lack thereof  and as a warning sign of undue stress or overtraining   but the garmin reporting of hr  and what it calls  average resting heart rate   arhr  has it s own anomalies for example  when i went to bed last night my arhr was   bpm   according to the graph of my hr for this sleep period  based on the uploaded data   my total sleep period was        during the first   minutes  my average pulse was about     and during the night there were five short spikes up into the   s ranging from     minutes  and for some fraction of a minute my pulse reached     the first of the three times i got up to pee the garmin showed that my arhr had by that time dropped to     indicating that even though customer service told me that arhr is an average over the last   sleep periods  my arhr when i went to bed was close to      which tracks with readings of the previous night  which also dropped intranight to    however  last night  except for those     brief intervals  which totaled about    minutes across the duration of my      sleep period  the graph of my hr shows a resting pulse that ranged from        with the average for the night being about      yet at the end of my sleep period my arhr had gone back up to    how did customer service explain this anomaly   apparently the device ignores any resting pulses below    as artifacts  and since my rp was in the    s for about an hour and a half  and since this wasn t even counted in averaging over the night  which gave more weight to the brief periods when my rp was in the high   s and   s  there was no drop in my arhr  and in fact  over the last   months i ve only briefly ever gotten it down to     even though my actual rp for the night is typically around        except on the nights after intense training sessions despite these evident software design flaws  my overall impression of garmin  and even of the forerunner     is positive   customer service is good to excellent  with actual americans at the other end  instead of indians or filipinos working from a script   who are at least familiar with the workings of the devices they are supporting   and because english is their native language they are at least able to understand the more probing questions i ask about how the device was actually programmed to work  though they are seldom able to come up with the answers on their own   but then even their supervisors or the experts they go away and consult with are apparently in the dark about how the device is programmed  and as is to be expected these days of minimal american literacy the manual is barely adequate as a guide to the operation of the device  and quite inadequate to explain the meaning of the various readouts  which renders the whole thing of dubious value once you venture beyond the bounds of its core functionality   i e  gps tracking of time over distance      
298,5.0,                       i really like this sports watch  i am a bit disappointed that it doesn t track swimming in any way or tennis  it connects to my phone seamlessly and tracks my sleep patterns well      
299,5.0,                       i am using every feature available on the forerunner    and i am super impressed  i track my sleep every night  use it for running in the gym or for trail runs outdoors  the app has so many features and much more to do add  i synced my garmin with my galaxy s  and my fleet feet app so far  since having this i have been much more motivated and staying on top of how much water i drink each day  it is very accurate      
300,1.0,                       the  enter  button stopped working one month after warranty   i was going to use the time function but now can t even do that because i can t reset for the daylight savings adjustment   i really liked the big numbers and the ability to make it brighter at night   i did not use all the functions because i just couldn t figure them out   tracked my steps  and used it for a timer mostly      
301,1.0,                       this watch can t keep track of your heart rate  its always at     bmp       
302,1.0,                       like most features  but heart rate was way off after having worked the first   weeks  read twice my real rate returned sept    at ups with return label and according to amazon rep  received the   th of september  but now amazon claims it has not been received      
303,5.0,                       i ve had a few different fitbit models and with my daughter s recommendation i bought this one  i like it a lot   has weather on it  tracks my active minutes way better than my fitbit  and will even page my phone   it s lightweight  the charger connects easy and well  and it s a great size on my wrist  very happy      
304,5.0,                       i have had several different garmins  this model has been my favorite so far   lightweight and not bulky  my wrist is very small    i love especially that it will show you current pace and average pace at the same time  for us interval runners   gps links quickly and i have found it to be accurate like all my other models   liked it so much i bought one for my husband too      
305,3.0,                       my fitbit hr charge was wearing out after only    months of use  so i did a lot of research on which fitness tracker to buy   i selected the forerunner    based on many reviews   after almost one month of use and can say mostly good things about it   the major pluses are    very long battery life  i ve only had to charge it twice in    days of use    bright  big  readable screen   i use readers for close up viewing  but don t need glasses to see the screen   i used to wear a watch on one wrist and my fitbit hr on the other  and now i only need one device    the gps function sync s and works properly  i see some others have had problems but it worked fine for me    allowing the alerts to come from your iphone is great  i can see who is calling  texting  etc  without having to get my phone    i haven t been in the pool yet  but assuming its okay  being waterproof is a great plus here are a few things that didn t work so well    one major flaw for me   the custom stride length doesn t work   outside you measure your distance via gps so stride length doesn t matter   inside  on the treadmill however  the unit guesses stride length   in  user settings  you can set custom stride length for walking and running and it just doesn t work at all   for me  even though i set the custom stride length   the unit consistently under reports my distances by    to       it s very frustrating    the user interface on the app for your phone is a little clunky   i much prefer the fitbit dashboard  but maybe that s because i ve used it so much longer i was thinking about returning the unit because of the custom stride length problem  but overall the other pluses outweigh this one major flaw   i m hopeful garmin will fix this in a future update   i would have given the unit   starts otherwise      
306,5.0,                    excelente reloj c modo dise o no pesa y sus funciones se acoplan al tel fono        
307,1.0,                       this watch worked long enough for the return window to close  it always says no notifications when i clearly had just gotten    phone calls do not appear  i test it and none of the features are working correctly  wish i had my money back        
308,4.0,                       great watch for running  walking  biking  and keeping track of steps   i love the indoor running feature so i can still link my treadmill and indoor track runs to the garmin app without having to do a manual entry   i am enjoying the sleep function as well   it is a bit bulky for my taste but overall i am very happy with it      
309,4.0,                       received as a gift  and like it overall  generally  i think the operating system and user interface could use some more thought  some obvious things missing and left out  few specific quirks    sometime i feel like the heartbeat tracking is off during runs   will jump from     to like     for a minute or vice versa    no way to store an owner id  emergency contacts  or identifying info on the watch    would be nice to be able to silence alerts  ie  heart zone alerts  in the middle of a workout rather than quitting and restarting  yes  it asks if one wants an alert   but how about if i want to spend two miles in zone    then do sprints  it just alerts the whole time with no way to silence  such a glaring ui problem    sometimes the gps takes several minutes to lock on before a run    the garmin ios app is also sort of clunky  and i ve had issues with the watch not consistently syncing  once even requiring deleting the device from the app and reloading it to get it connecting again all that said  i generally like it  and appreciate that they didn t try to stuff the os with  smart watch  features  they kept it to being a watch that tracks exercise with gps  and can deliver some phone notifications  alas  like so many things with garmin  it s only     of the way thought through and the end product lacks some obvious things      
310,2.0,                       although i bought this thing for the gps feature  i tend to expect it to keep time since it s on my wrist   i run outdoors everyday and i charge it and do updates about twice per week   it never has the correct time in the morning and sometimes during the day also   they tell me i need to do updates then go outside and quire gps   i am already doing that all the time   garmin doesn t see a problem with a watch that doesn t have the correct time   unbelievable   i gave it two stars since the actual run features are exactly what i want   i have been late to work and also late to meetings because of this  watch      
311,5.0,                       for    buck wow   i loved my forerunner       this    cheapy is great    good   goodbye chest strap   incredible pulse reading off your wrist  notifications on my wrist   syncs with garmin connect app and ww app  no more manual entry   weather on my wrist  notifications on my wrist   it haptics just like my       resting heart rate  wear it all day and night    comfy   styly   much much more bad   no hr graph on my wrist   i like a notification every    miles or     miles   you can not set the hundredths place on distance notifications   a little hard to figure out   has acted a little wonky once  for some features needs bluetooth on and your phone present   doesn t seem to bother phone   battery   though amazing little watch for almost nothing      
312,4.0,                       the watch does pretty much everything i want it to  the mileage tracker is accurate  and the sleep tracker is pretty cool as well  i am a runner  and i mainly bought this one as opposed to a cheaper gps watch because the cheap ones always break for me  especially when exposed to water and rain  this one has been functional so far  and i usually just wear it all the time  the only issue i have is that the band comes unlatched so easily  and it s really inconvenient to fix it in the middle of an interval or another important task  overall  good product      
313,1.0,                       this watch was great on all fronts  however about a month ago  something was leaking out of it and then it stopped working  no  we hadn t been swimming  at the beach  or pool  just a regular day at home  we re very upset because we didn t even get a years worth out of it  we bought two at the same time and the other is working just fine  so not sure what to do now about getting a replacement      
314,5.0,                       it s very good for someone beginning a running journey  i m not a marathon runner but i run daily  k   k and i love it  only recommend if running is all you use it for  intervals work great on this to  i ve had it for sometime and it is still in great shape  battery lasts a long time      
315,2.0,                       no music controls for android even though it was heavily advertised to me as being able to skip songs and control volume  heart rate tracker not too accurate  disappointed      
316,1.0,                       i bought the watch because my friend recommented to me  he has one of the first garmin watchs  i liked the watch  it was confortable to wear but the notification doesn t work and other thing that i didn t like was the navigation butters were  inconvenient after about a week i returned  it i dound it a peice of junk  garmin should do better jobs     
317,5.0,                       have owned   fitbits and this out performs both of them would recommend this to all      
318,5.0,                       love this thing  never wanted a hrm  but now that i have it  i love it   though it can be  sketchy  at times i get about     days out of the battery when not using the activity function  when i do use that regularly  i get like     days  tops  no biggie   i just charge it overnight when it gets down to   bar the strap is very comfortable   i thought it might get dirty easily  but it hasn t  regardless  i wash it with a damp cloth every night   i have the lime green  i also recommend the iq shield for it   it s a biggish screen  and you want to protect it i went from fitbit to this   and although the fitbit community seems larger better  i m still happy with this watch      
319,1.0,                       we were so excited to get this new garmin  but it s a disappointment as it does not record distance accurately  for my initial test  it took    minutes in wait mode while finding satellites  then the recording for my run displayed an absurd amount of drift  showing me cutting every corner and flitting through yards and houses like superman  the resulting mileage and pace were highly distorted   this is an inner suburb where there should not be such problems    we are not in a remote location nor anyplace near tall buildings or mountains   i then tried the garmin an hour later for a track workout  this time it was already warmed up from the prior run  so it found the satellites quickly  within   or   minutes  my run was    miles  i e  slightly over     miles each way to from the track plus    laps around  of those    miles total  the garmin recorded     miles   we were looking for a simple and accurate running watch  but the forerunner    failed the tests  we will try to return it and find something else      
320,5.0,                       my husband loves this  he didn t want a watch that was high end  just something simple that can help him track his workouts  he only charges it once a week  if that  and wears it       i wanted something a little more feminine and touch screen  so i went with the fitbit versa      
321,5.0,                       my training is measured in hours  not miles  but in that time  i d like to know how far i went and what my average pace was   i mostly run by perceived exertion and don t want to fixate on data   again  pace and mileage are good to know   this basic model is all i need and i love it for it   simple to charge  easy to learn to use  easy to configure  long battery life  still going after a   hr bike run    the bike feature is also useful if you don t have a bike computer on one of your handful of bikes         
322,5.0,                       love this watch  this is my second garmin forerunner     it s very accurate for working out and tracking mileage  steps  calories  etc   i m a    mile per week kind of runner  and this is perfect for my fitness level and activity tracking  if you stand still  it picks up the location very quickly  only tiny complaint is having to push the buttons so many times to get to the setting you re looking for  but you get used to it      
323,3.0,                       i ve had this watch for almost   months  have loved everything about it until about the last month  the bluetooth is having trouble connecting to my phone  even though it s right in my pocket   also  the heart rate monitor is accurate about     of the time and the other      it goes rogue and says my heart rate is in the   s during a difficult workout  all that to say  beware of the bluetooth and heart rate monitor on this watch  if you want something more accurate  spend the extra money      
324,5.0,                       so easy to set up  i didn t even need the instructions  i had a     garmin before this and wanted something to track my  everything  throughout the day  it s gps is fast to connect and the app works great with my fitness pal  better than i thought it would be  battery lasted   full days before needing to be charged      
325,5.0,                       this garmin is easy to use and i find the large watch face easy to read  i track my steps and add goals love the gps   i also use it in the pool and shower with no problems seeing my heart rate keeps me focused  there are other features i love   it was easy to connect to my phone and i just charge it on sundaysi m highly recommend this garmin      
326,5.0,                    ed hermoso el reloj  la malla no es caliente  conecta perfecto con el tel fono  reci n comienzo a usarlo y parece funcionar perfecto         
327,3.0,                       i love my garmin forerunner    watch   it is easy to read outside  easy to use  records mileage  steps  heart rate   but the band failed in less than   months of use   very disappointing for a garmin product   the warranty replacement bands are black  but i would prefer a white band  which is what i ordered originally   disappointing   garmin  are you listening      
328,3.0,                       went for running outside several times and the date never setup automatically with the gps always on the wrong day  have a polar watch as well  with chest band  and its heart rate is much more accurate than this watch     
329,4.0,                       i bought this watch for my little brother for his b day  although the ui  user interface  isn t catchy enough to capture the attention of a    year old  it does actually get the job done if you are new to running and tracking your fitness  fairly accurate in its readings  but garmin makes better products depending on how deep you want to get into your fitness journey  if you just want to know mileage and calories burned  this is good and straight to the point      
330,4.0,                       i owned a fitbit before and thought it was ok  garmin is better and battery life is about a week of steady use  i have not used the gps mode yet  so i do not know how that will affect battery life  seems durable     
331,5.0,                       i like just about everything about this watch  i ve had it for   years  and have trained for two    ks with it  but mostly  i just run  if you want your watch to sing to you or give you colorful displays  it won t  it just sits there   on your wrist   and displays and tracks essential information it is reliable  i have had no problems and the original battery is still good it is also accurate in tracking your running and heart rate  i am a serious runner  but not  like  a hyperserious one  this watch is great for me      
332,5.0,                       i used polar hr watches chest straps for years but after about     to   years  the watch would die  despite changing the battery in both the chest strap   the watch    i wanted a hr monitor that would show calories burned that would work without a chest strap   this performs that task   i also use a garmin edge for my bicycle   it has a chest strap   together  the watch   the chest strap would great  too   i like the visibility of the numbers   the accuracy of the hr calories burned   watch is comfortable   although looks big  it s not bulky on my small wrist      
333,1.0,                       initially  i loved this product   it was easy to read  accurate  and easy to set up   that lasted less than   months   although it says that you can use it in water for swimming laps  when i started to do so  it stopped working completely   then i had to use the not user friendly garmin website to try to find out how to return the completely useless item   once i had their lovely rma  i sent the watch in   only to have them tell me that they never received it   apparently  it is  lost  in the mail and they cannot send me another one until they receive mine   after reading other reviews  this is not the most reliable of fitness trackers  and the company knows that   their customer service is less than ideal  and i wish they stood behind their product   i m going back to a fitbit     not as user friendly  but spent the same amount of money and it lasted   years      
334,4.0,                       love this watch  was between this and the garmin     and decided on this because i have tiny wrists  fits perfect  love that it tracks my hr  steps  sleep  etc  and that i can get phone notifications sent to my watch  also  a bonus is that you can sync the my fitness pal app to it and it will log your calorie intake each day  the gps on outdoor runs seems to be pretty accurate  although not for treadmill runs  cons  it doesn t really allow you to create workouts on the watch  only in the app  the metrics do not include meters  which would be helpful for workouts on the track  the band is a little cheap and flimsy compared to other watches  such as the apple watch or fit bit all in all  i am happy with this watch and it does what i need it to do  great for runs      
335,5.0,                       excellent fitness watch    i ve had it for a few weeks and it is very accurate for tracking exercise and daily movement tracking  using the included fitness programs has been easy and helpful when overlaying your heartbeat  there is a lot more things that i m discovering it can do as well  it was a great purchase for me      
336,5.0,                       i ve waited before reviewing because i wanted to make sure it was exactly what i needed  i ve had this watch tracker since february and it s perfect for my needs  i m a senior who walks  it does a good job  i love that it sings with my iphone and it alerts me to a call before my phone even rings  love it      
337,4.0,                       i like a lot of the functionality of the watch  does a great job tracking runs and the app logging functionality works great with outlining the entire exercise  only desire would be to allow some of the in app training levels of higher level watches offered by garmin  but again  a perfect watch for starting to train for marathons      
338,2.0,                       this product is great  if you can get it to consistently detect your heart rate   first  if you buy the garmin strap and have a small frame the strap won t work at all   it won t pick up your heart rate and is not snug even if pulled as tight as possible   the workaround to that is to use a polar strap and cut the rubber around the sensors  this does the trip  most of the time  but i d say at least half  if not more  of the time i look at the watch it just shows   lines on it   meaning it can t find my heart rate  so pretty much makes the watch completely useless i ve been using the watch for about   months now and although it worked ok for biking  it seems for cardio classes it just can not consistently detect my heart rate  my old polar watch  although much less fancy  never had this issue  i am just about to consider junking this watch or selling it on ebay and buying a polar watch as i hardly even wear the watch now since it s not accurate      
339,5.0,                       it tracks my pace  distance and speed for my runs and i enjoy how i can also use this garmin to track other activities like hiking  cycling and kayaking  simple and efficient  i bought a newer model and found it tedious to use compared to this model  so i switched back      
340,5.0,                       i simply wanted to track our walking with the most basic performance indicators   i tried a     exercise watch but the software and connectivity were sketchy at best   this garmin watch does everything reliably and elegantly simple  the buttons are easy to learn and the reports are thorough      
341,5.0,                       i love running  biking  and lifting  this watch tracks all three fairly well  i am always amazed at the accuracy of the gps  i look at the stats of the most recent run and the map is spot on and i enjoy being able to set when i want the watch to alert me i have achieved a desired distance  great watch for the price  recommend if you are exploring fitness watches and just want to get an extremely good idea of how a fitness watch can impact your journey      
342,3.0,                       the heart rate monitor is so inaccurate it s useless  not very intuitive  the face can t be reconfigured  i had a garmin gps watch before and it worked very well with their web site  but this one i haven t been able to figure out yet      
343,5.0,                       i love it  for the price you can t beat this  my husband has a apple watch still paying for it  it has a data plan  mine is just as good as a apple watch     
344,5.0,                       this is my first smartwatch   i resist putting money into technology that obsoletes quickly  and     is my threshold for rapidly changing tech   so when this dropped to that i finally bit what is great      day battery life   i just charge weekly  that includes a daily workout of about    minutes   every other workout is with gps on   i alternate between stationary bike and outdoor running   size is reasonable   i have fairly small wrists for a guy and it does not look huge   cost is reasonable   is a hrm and gps  and also supports all the other ant  garmin sensors   i have it connected to a garmin speed distance puck on my stationary bike and i believe it will attach to cadence  power  and running pucks sensors   hrm seems accurate relative to the hr strap i formerly used   resting hr seems low though   garmin connect links to all of the other popular apps   i ve used endomondo for the past   years and connect interfaces seamlessly to that so i have one place to store all my workout data   i also have it connected to myfitnesspal for calorie tracking   all of that works perfectly and automatically   does a good job with notifications from your watch not so great   this is a basic watch   monochrome display  no apps or watch faces to install   screen resolution is just ok   you get   numeric fields in two pages  plus the clock  to look at during your exercise and some ability to customize those fields   that s it   no payment options   but heck  as the us is so far behind europe in mobile point of sale anyway  does it really matter   until restaurants bars here do what every place in europe already has you are going to have a credit card with you anyway   i don t see the black tray disappearing anytime soon   vo max is calculated indirectly   no o  monitor or live metrics   does not have the more sophisticated running metrics that i would assume few people actually use   no swimming metrics   is not a dick tracy watch   no phone calls  no videos   no music storage or control with all of these devices  the central question is  if you have a good phone already  what do you really need on your wrist   to me it is   x  hrm  something that tells time  step counter  workout logger  and notifier   i was tired of dealing with an hrm chest strap   would it be nice to not have my phone on a run   yes   so at some point i ll probably upgrade  but for     i m ok with that and will wait until a watch with such features has the size  cost  and battery life of this device   right now during a run the phone is in a sleeve on my back and the google assistant on the earbuds works just fine for everything else      
345,2.0,                       i used the hr function at the y while on a treadmill to see how accurate it was  i did this because it jumped all over the place when i would simply go for a long walk when the treadmill showed my heart rate to be      the garmin showed      this was consistent throughout the workout  the garmin continued to show a hr around    to    beats higher i love the watch and am really disappointed how ineffective the hr function is so i m returning the watch      
346,2.0,                       the item is cumbersome to use and the band fell off after about a dozen runs  the replacement band i requested did not fit the item  the second replacement band i requested did not fit  for      i would expect more than    uses      
347,5.0,                       this was a gift for father s day for my hubby   he had been using the fit bit for two years but the glass had cracked the first two weeks he owned it   he did the research and decided to try this garmin   he loves this fitness tracker and said it is superior to the fit bit in every way   he loves the feature that locates his cell phone as he misplaces it on a constant basis         
348,4.0,                       i went with garmin when i was looking for a gps tracker  because they are rated way higher than any other brands for accuracy  i have not been disappointed  this is a great tracker  i only wish it were a little more attractive  this tracker is quite a bit bulkier than comparable trackers in other brands  for me it was a trade off worth making  but it would have been nice if i didn t have to      
349,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it  it s replacing a tomtom that he d had for years  the step counter seems more accurate than my fitbit when we compare after a walk and he likes being able to track his workouts  even in the pool   i m thinking of replacing my fitbit with a garmin bc i ve been having problems with the app and because my step counter is off      
350,1.0,                       i bought this watch because my previous garmin stopped charging at first this watch worked fine  but not too long after i got the watch i started training for the la marathon and over the few months of training the time it took to sync got slower and slower  to the point where i had to leave the watch to sync over night  yes you read that right  it took several hours to sync then last weekend i ran the la marathon  i did will  finishing in the top     runners and ran a boston qualifying time  but after the marathon my garmin forerunner    would not sync at all  two days later it still had not synced  then finally it seemed like it synced  but in doing so it deleted all data including my la marathon i tried getting support from garmin but their online support system did not submit yes this watch eventually finds satellites  but only if i am completely still  and it has all the basic functions as well as heart rate that is about     accurate  but the sync problem is not unique to me  i spent hours searching forums and there are countless examples of this same problem i am frustrated that this watch lost all my marathon data  at least i have my finish time from the official la marathon site  but because i had to run in their open corral and run around about       people the distance i ran was well over      but i have no record of what my mile splits were or any of the other data from the race i trained so hard for      
351,3.0,                       i m a huge fan of garmin and have used their products for many years now  i ve noticed a trend with the low quality bands  i ve had my watch for   months and the band broke off  i m a huge fan of the watch otherwise as i use it for simple activities  i d recommend a different watch for those wanting to track their running etc  thankfully i found an inexpensive replacement band on amazon but i still wish garmin would develop higher quality products especially considering their high cost      
352,3.0,                       the included charger cable never worked  because i have another charger cable  from my own watch  my wife s can be charged  otherwise  it would have been a disappointment  since it is very difficult to make the return from costa rica  not  puerto rico        
353,4.0,                       my watch is something i depend on for keeping track of my running and workout miles  garmin produces consistent quality in their products  and this forerunner    is no exception  the fit is perfect  even though i have a small  ok  kid s size  wrist  i m a runner mainly  but also a triathlete  and i do weekly zumba and jazzercise workouts  the watch is comfortable enough that i can forget i m even wearing it  i don t feel the need to purchase a more upscale watch because this one does all i need and more the only drawback i ve noticed is that it can take a full   minutes to find a signal  that is understood and mentioned by the manufacturer  just don t wait until start time to hit go      because of this  i m giving it a   star rating  if it were possible  i d give it a      i m certain to use my garmin watch for years to come  this is my  rd in the garmin series  they haven t failed me yet      
354,5.0,                       i ve had this watch for a couple weeks now and i like it a lot   i wanted an upgrade to get the heart rate monitor and smart notifications capabilities   both functions seem to work as advertised   the watch doesn t recognize emojis or some other symbols but you can get the message when reading a text or seeing who is calling without getting your phone out   ultimately this watch is simple and non flashy but has all the hardware and features i was looking for with a palatable price tag      
355,5.0,                       i have been casual about exercise until recently  and i bought the forerunner    to track my progress as i ve begun to set and achieve fitness goals  i didn t want a smart watch with all the gadgets and frills  just something that can track my mileage  pace  and heart rate  i love the simplicity of this watch  i can easily access the data on my watch during workouts  and i don t smear the screen with sweat since there are analog buttons instead of touchscreen features  the connect app tracks and explains vitals and stats  keeping me motivated  fantastic battery life i charge it once every    days days  but that s only because i don t like dipping too close to a dead battery  the watch screen is like paper white from kindle super helpful in the sun but can be backlit with the touch of a button super helpful in the fading light  the watch has alert features that you can customize i get a little buzz and notification when i complete my  lap  of a mile or my steps goal or my calorie goal  the bluetooth connection to my phone is surprisingly nice  too the watch buzzes only twice when a call s coming in and gives a notification with the caller name number  then falls still  it s the same with any other notification i d receive on my phone  this has helped me if i m exercising on call or if i m with a client to know if i need to whip my phone out of my belt bag instead of keeping the ringer on and being paranoid  i also really appreciate that the watch tracks my daily activity even when i haven t  started  an activity to log i am still forgetful about starting activities when i begin a workout and the auto tracking helps me at least that same day to look back at my heart rate  pace  mileage  and  even if i haven t logged an activity  the calendar in connect app logs my daily steps and heart rate  anyway  to sum it all up  garmin forerunner    has become a daily necessity to a woman who has worn an analog watch every day for    years and loves those analog watches  it s become my accountability buddy      
356,5.0,                       walking steps  what i like most is the watch band is sturdy and easy to clean under the faucet with a little bit of soap      
357,4.0,                       i thought it was a great product with a very easy to use interface  i just live in an area where it took too long to connect to satellite  ended up returning it  but i will probably get one in the future if i move to a better location      
358,5.0,                       my first running watch  it keeps me out there more than if i didn t have one  now i can see all my stats  you can customize your screens for running  i changed the default of the first screen  time  pace  and distance  to current pace  distance  average pace  i don t care how long i ve been out there  when i run in the woods  it s not as accurate  but i think that might be gps and not the actual watch  but other more expensive garmins  have trail running activities  this one is more simple  but i love it  i can only get about    miles at   time before the battery dies  otherwise about   days i think without gps mode  def get you a running watch if you are thinking of it  you can save all your runs to the garmin app  it shows new records as you complete every run  fastest mile   k  half m  full m    k  longest run      
359,3.0,                       this product worked well for tracking fitness activity  however  the music control feature did not work for my iphone  s  i talked to garmin support  and they said this model did not support connecting to iphones  this was a valuable feature to me for running  and thusly brought down my overall review for the watch      
360,5.0,                       i bought this for my wife for christmas to replace a tomtom that had developed problems   she is just learning how to use it  but so far really likes it   the bluetooth connection to the cellphone is super    her only complaint is that the data it supplies is overwhelming    now the next test will be to see how it holds up   if it lasts more than two years it will beat the tomtom       
361,5.0,                       as an avid runner  i have been running with a garmin product for years   i can t believe the technology that i have on my wrist compared to my previous garmin that i purchased for about the same price several years ago   i m not big on tech or stats but this is incredible      
362,5.0,                       i bought this to have the heart rate output sync with my garmin action camera and have the rate showup on my motocross and mountain bike videos  it does just what i wanted it to do and i m really happy with the watch  it took a few try s to learn how to link to two items together but it s very easy once you know how  this has become my daily watch  there are a lot of features i have not even tried yet so i m still learning what it can do but the main thing i wanted it for has been perfect      
363,5.0,                       i have used this for about   month and i have been very pleased  this was to replace an older garmin that lasted about    years and finally died   the unit works great   it is easy to use and the app and garmin connect are great for tracking your workouts  i was not sure how the strapless hrm would work since that is what i am used to  but i think it works great  especially checking the heart rate data in the app  highly recommended   battery life is also amazing when wearing it       could not do that with my old garmin      
364,1.0,                       i am a legit customer of garmin and i had high hopes for this product  but it failed my expectations so the first few months of having this product were great  i got up and off the couch and started running    miles a week because of this thing  so if you run with it  you re going to need to wash your device every workout or it will cause some irritation to the skin  so naturally the easiest way to make sure the sensor is clean to your wrist  is to take a shower with the watch on  so i have been and then one day  just like that  stopped working    min after the shower  ive given it several days to fully dry and try to charge it again  nothing   i am very upset with the fact that it broke that easily and there weren t even any scratches or cracks in the glass  also be careful with the wrist strap  can easily snap if pulled wrong overall  i really thought the heart rate monitor  the gps tracker  and other features work quite well  if you re a beginning athlete or just run for fun casually then this is the device for you  more serious athletes should consider spending more money on a more expensive garmin  its worth the price  i hope garmin reads this comment and messages me back about how i can get a refund or if i can replace my malfunctioning product for one that works      
365,3.0,                       this is the second forerunner    i ve purchased  the first lasted about    months before going belly up with a blank screen  first the good  i graduated to this from a garmin vivofit  so the addition of the gps was awesome  second  the price when purchased wasn t unreasonable         i like the size of the face  the feeling on my wrist   in short it does everything i want need it to do  now the bad  the first watch  for the last   months that i had it was really bad about losing its bluetooth connection  every few days   sometimes every day   i d have to forget the device and pair it again  a pain in the rear but i got used to it  this latest issue  where the screen went blank  appears to be a loose connection  likely with the charging leads or battery  i can tap the watch and get the face to come back and the screen will alternate between fully charged and no charge  why buy a second one  i like it and i m used to it  would give it a higher rating if it were more reliable update  the third forerunner    has stopped keeping accurate time  it loses     minutes per hour  this started occurring    months after purchase  i ve done resets  return to factory settings  etc   all to no avail  it s a shame garmin can t or chooses not to build a unit that lasts a bit longer      
366,4.0,                       it s a great watch  i have owned it for   months now  battery life lasted a little longer than    days after the first full charge  it s easy to conserve the battery though  just turn the power off if you don t need to use the watch  it takes about   seconds to start up once you turn it back on  i have yet to be able to control music and look at weather from the watch  other than that  the watch operates as advertised update  after   months  i swam  recreationally  with the watch in   ft of water with some friends and after the watch would not turn on  the battery apparently died  although it had   bars  before i swam  the charger now has a trip or something where it is not sufficiently charging the watch  this confuses me since i hardly ever move the charger from the same spot even when charging the watch  also  i actually managed to use the music function  it only allows me to control pandora on my samsung s   which sucks because i d like to use spotify  but it s great if you use pandora or like to listen to a certain pandora station when running or something  still no luck with the weather  but it may be a problem with my phone location services not the watch  i ll probably buy a new charger later and see if that helps anything  so for not  the only thing that s been a problem after about   months is the battery and or the charger update dec       i got a new watch for no cost at at other than shipping  as it was still under warranty  it works great  the weather works consistently  the music feature is functional as well with spotify  you just have to pick your default music player on the app      
367,4.0,                       it does what i want it to do and simply  used for monitoring my speed  it starts   stops with a couple button presses  uploading data happens easily  speed and distances are accurate it has a lot of defaults and after a day or two of playing with it  many were turned off to save the battery  battery use after several days seems better than expected recommend it  accurate  simple and good battery life for what i want  expect it to take a while to setup if you don t want it s default settings      
368,5.0,                       i had to replace my forerunner    and ordered the     at first  it was a little difficult to set up  once i got the hang of it  i really like it  it has way more features than i ll ever use  but i like it a lot      
369,1.0,                       very dissatisfied  the battery life is terrible i had to recharge it  x in just   days with little activity  scrolling feature is terrible as well  very hard to figure out how to navigate through all the features bi returned it     
370,2.0,                       i have had my forerunner    for just over two years  now  and the heart rate monitor has gotten more and more inconsistent as i use it   i have gotten use to what my heart rate should be throughout my workouts  and my watch will still say    bpm   i have to constantly move the watch around my wrist to see if it will pick back up to what it really is  sometimes it works  and sometimes it does not   i am ready to give up and go to another watch because i cannot rely on this watch to give me somewhat accurate information  very disappointing      
371,4.0,                       i am not a runner but have been active my entire life  i am a senior and need to move more   i selected this product because consumer reports said it was the most accurate device for steps and hr   i love this watch and it is paired with my fitness pal for the nutrition portion the only negative is i wish the display was brighter      
372,4.0,                       for the money this is a great watch   the battery life is amazing   i m running every day and charging every   days   the heart rate is also very good   the only bad thing is the gps   it s very inaccurate under tree cover   i can run a   min mile pace  and under trees it reads    min mile   i be calibrated this with other devices   once i had that figured out i can live with it since the other features are so good   just know that the gps is flakey but consistently flakey      
373,5.0,                       this is my first ever gps  and i have to say i really like it  i just wanted something to track mileage  and it does the job well  garmin connect is very easy to use  you can even track how many miles you put on your shoes      
374,4.0,                       i have had a forerunner     for a long time and buy them up from ebay over the years when the battery goes dead or the wristband breaks  cannot buy a wristband anymore so i went to the    i like the face very easy to read in any light  the band is super soft and i hope it lasts my forerunner     would let me stop and start to accumulate a full day of walking usually       miles  the    must be saved each time so i have     entries a day  the heart rate is not to accurate  the gps is great i also wear a fitbit and use the garmin to capture only my walking miles also  if you use a pc or laptop and use garmin connect the usb module won t work  you have to use the charging cable connect to a usb port to update  both garmin and fitbit abandoned the pc users and assumed we all have and constantly use a smartphone which we carry all the time  not true if you are retired or don t need a smartphone also  even with a bluetooth connection with the    and my laptop it won t update garmin makes some great products i have been using them over    years      
375,5.0,                       this was my first fitness tracker watch  i ve had it for   months   i normally don t wear a watch so it took awhile to get used to it  but i found the band to be comfortable   i wore it almost non stop for a couple weeks until i scratched the face at work  mechanic   i bought a screen protector for it and relegated it to weekend wear and while working out   the battery life is great  easily lasting more than a week of continuous wear  and about a month of intermittent   it seems to track accurately and update quickly to changes in speed and direction   i use it for cycling  jogging and even  double checking the speedometer in the car   over all i m quite happy with it and it was a great price on black friday      
376,5.0,                       i am really enjoying this watch as well as the app that goes with it  it accurately did an outdoor hike as well as indoor runs   very happy with the accuracy  the heart rate monitor is accurate  the charge lasts for days i charge once or twice a week and wear it almost constantly  the notifications bluetooth on it works really well  overall i highly recommend this watch  i am an avid exerciser and hiker    days a week  and love it      
377,5.0,                       this watch is amazing  i feel like it s the best bang for your buck you can find  gps works well and heart rate  the sleep tracker is off once and a blue moon  but it does the job well  the watch connects to a fun app too  would recommend this one over the more expensive garmin watches  this is because it has all the necessary features for a competitive runner  the new ones has fancy features that don t really actually make you faster    plus the accuracy on those is questionable  like if you want your threshold  you use a machine to take your blood not a watch  if you want v    you need to actually get tested in a lab  not use a watch  you get my point  those features are not effective  making them borderline pointless      
378,3.0,                       the forerunner    is usable for running  but i have a few nits  it has a square shape with buttons directly across from each other  pushing a button requires holding it with both thumb and forefinger  making it easy to push the button on the wrong side if you aren t careful with finger placement  while running there are six customizable data fields divided between two screens  which you can scroll between  but  there are no labels on the data fields  so you have to remember what they re set to  and also what screen you are on  why not have labels in a small font  as it does elsewhere in the interface  i dislike the number of button presses it takes to do basic things  starting a run takes a minimum of four button presses  more if you don t want the default options  stopping a run takes five button presses  which includes two to turn off the unit  to turn off you first have to hold the power button five seconds  okay  that prevents you from turning it off accidentally    but why does it then also ask you to select yes or no to actually turn off the only gps feature is distance tracking  i would have liked to at least have elevation      
379,4.0,                       one important thing this watch does not allow is manually setting stride length for treadmill runs   there is a setting on the app and web interface but that only affects walking stride  which is odd because if it is counting steps inside your work place for example  your stride is not even close to uniform   the one place you need to set your stride manually would be an indoor run or treadmill use   the watch normally uses gps tracking and step count to determine your stride  if you buy this and use it say in the winter  before the watch has a chance to rack up a few outdoor runs using gps  you are stuck with a preset stride   this makes every run on my treadmill over report by quite a distance   a  k run should be     miles  the run as measured on my nordic track treadmill says     but the watch will report about     miles   that s a significant mismatch dear garmin  please see if this can be addressed   i know this model is likely already obsolete but it would be a nice gesture      
380,4.0,                       i purchased this watch for my mom so that we could compare workouts and be  garmin friends  i absolutely would recommend this watch to  beginner  or  average  runners bikers my mom primarily bikes and we have found that this watch is more accurate than her apple watch we like how easily the screen displays bike ride analytics as she is in the middle of a workout this watch seems to last a long time on a single charge  even while in gps mode  much better than the other  smart watch  she currently has this is the most reasonably priced watch with gps integration and a wrist heart rate monitor i found  i am pleased with the purchase of this watch  i believe she will probably use this for     years before we decide to  upgrade  to a higher model of garmin with more  features       
381,3.0,                       this watch does all the functions you need it to  i haven t had any issues linking to strava and it tracks my workout information fairly well when i m inside  where i have noticed the downfall is the gps  i recently did a run in the mountains and it took quite a bit of time to get a signal and my route make came out wonky  when i tried it again for a hike later in the day  it seemed to figure it out  i don t know if that was due to me being at a higher elevation or it adjusting to the extra obstacles the one major complaint i have about this watch is the band  both sides have fallen off and needed to be replaced at this point  the adhesive on the watch doesn t seem to be hardy at all  thankfully it hasn t fallen off during a run or when i wouldn t notice it  reaching straight out to garmin fixed the issue and they were able to send me a new band i would recommend this for a more casual runner  i can imagine how these issues would be annoying for anyone training for something huge      
382,1.0,                       the worst garmin i had    keeps on turning off on long runs even when blutooth and alerts are off  it ruins my monitoring  i had      it is still working and had more stuff i need  if not for sync up problem with garmin express  i will not buy this crappy product  i was disappointed  i used it   times on   and    mile run  it turns off at unpredictable mileage  like after    or    or   miles  and nothing is saved of course  don t buy this      
383,5.0,                       the watch is great  it s everything that i expected  i bought this to have something that could track my pace and distance and it does just that  the design and material is very high quality  which leads me to my next point  the fit of the rubber wrist strap is very durable and fits my wrist like a glove  and i have pretty small wrists  definitely would recommend this product to anyone looking for a watch to go on runs with      
384,5.0,                       this device surpassed my expectations   i was amazed and pleasantly  surprised  by how small and light it was  half the size of my last forerunner     watch  love the new bpm counter and heart rate counter   very pleased with my purchase  i use this device for running      
385,5.0,                       tldr  good for few whistles  basic data tracking  miles and time  with some new perks  if you want high fidelity data or activity tracking  programmable workouts  integration with other devices apps  i suggest youpurchased this about   months ago  may       primarily to track distance speed for running  m       lbs      miles week   previously spent about   years with the forerunner     and forerunner     this is basically the forerunner    with some added activity tracking  wrist hr monitoring  cardio  etc   and a much trendier look  i bought this to replace my fr   and they are almost the same price even after all these years  i suspect the wrist hr monitoring and visual overhaul are responsible for the relative price hike  unfortunately both are features i didn t particularly care for   on the first use or two  it took some time to acquire satellites     min    but after that it routinely is ready to go after    s  even from inside my apt   i imagine if you travel long distances  it will go take a while to acquire satellites again while running  the primary display contains time and distance which is really all i personally care about  other screens contain instantaneous pace  calories burned  hr  etc  i ve personally never found the real time pace indication to be particularly  even on the slightly higher end fr    heart rate has also been inconsistent  when i m just sitting on my couch it indicated hrs of over      and when i ve been gasping for breath mid workout  it s indicated my hr was      hr tracking via wrists is not an easy task  and i haven t tried more popular activity trackers so i can t speak to the relative accuracy  the manual includes instructions on how to properly place the the watch on your wrist  which i followed but to no avail  after about   months with the watch  hr does seem to have dialed in a little better  but still has a great deal of variance  if you re really into accurate data collection  you re probably better off with a dedicated fitness tracker or a more expensive model as the step counter feature isn t particularly great either as far as gps quality goes  it seems to be fairly reliable  compared to manually mapping my runs  this comes reasonably close  with all the forerunner models i ve found that the fewer turns you take  the more accurate the gps tracking is  can t speak for the accuracy during swimming or biking  i did have the gps go haywire        error on the total run distance  on one run during the first week  which worried me a bit  seems like it was an isolated incident as it has not occurred since and i ve had that occasionally happen with the other models in all  perfect for my use with the added benefit of being more flashy and with a few new features  i could have done without the fitbit cross over redesign  but it ain t bad  worried about the glass screen not being as durable  but time will tell  if you want higher accuracy or more control over your data and workouts  go with a higher end watch  this a decent mix of capability and cost if you want all you want is to track time and miles without having to bring your phone along      
386,5.0,                        update    have been using for almost a full year now  still works like new  use it     times a week on runs and occasionally wear it as an everyday watch  my boyfriend just got his own forerunner    for christmas and he loves his too  update  have been using this almost daily for almost   months  still in great condition and working order  has withstood snow  rain  sweat  and repeated taking on and taking off original review  i bought this because i had been using the smart phone app  runkeeper  to track my runs   but needed a run tracking device that didn t use up phone data battery as i m increasing my distance  this fit the bill i ve taken this watch on a few runs now  ranging from      miles  on each run its accurately tracked my run   the gps never seemed to lose signal   i ran familiar routes so i could compare them with the gps tracking on my smartphone and they match up  so this tells me the gps is accurate pros  accurate gps tracking battery life  worked all day as a regular watch with activity tracking turned off  and also worked on my semi long runs no problem   heart rate monitor on wrist  love not needing to wear a band around my stomach  pairs with the garmin connect app on my laptop and phone   color  love it cons  maybe not a con but i wonder about the durability longevity of the wristband  time will tell for me the forerunner    is worth the      i paid for it  its all i need and don t see a reason for spending money on the newer  more expensive forerunners      
387,3.0,                       the sleep tracking is fairly accurate  if you get all your sleep in one solid block   however  if you get up at night for any length of time before going back to sleep  it quits tracking   if you rely on a long nap to supplement your nightly sleep  it will never track those one or two blessed afternoon hours   i even tried defining my  bedtime  as    hours  and it still couldn t see these sleep episodes   so it vastly undercounts my sleep fitbit s inexpensive watches can track almost all the sleep you get   i went away from fitbit since their watches don t seem as durable as the garmin   but since sleep tracking is my major need  i m having second thoughts   i keep thinking garmin will update their software to improve sleep tracking  but no luck so far             if they do  i ll update this review      
388,3.0,                       usually  anyway  as many know  the optical hr monitor is less accurate than one using a strap  however  you would still figure it to be somewhere in the ball park  and it often is  a little less often  it ins t  sometimes it will record a run at     beats per minute which is    beats over my measured max  i could not reach that level  let alone hold it for    miles the sleep is interesting  but i doubt its accuracy too  it can mistake reading a book in bed for light sleep  it can miss waking up for short periods too the garmin connect app  i use it on my mac  cannot delete inaccurate information  you can delete or edit an inaccurately measured activity  such as a run  but all the insane heart rate reading remains  distorting all averages and the crude guess at vo  max  some of the supposed function of the    have never been measured in spite of all the criteria set by garmin being met  for example   training status    the users manual is of little help here  as all it say is if you do a  b  and c  it should read  great  what if it doesn t  no advice on what to do it is reasonably cheap though  and seems to do sorta ok most of the time  i d say is is mostly a way to get a crude idea of a variety of information  unfortunately  i find that information unreliable  so what s the point      
389,1.0,                       the heart rate function is      inaccurate and inconvenient to use  you have to press the button every few seconds to get a reading  i would not recommend for heart monitoring      
390,5.0,                       love this watch  i don t use all the functions and only use it for heart rate  pedometer  finding my watch and time but this is a great buy   best money i have spent      
391,1.0,                       the watch stopped working after   months  there were black lines on the screen of it   i wanted to send the watch back and get refunded but they did not do that  they asked me to send the each back to them  they will probably repair it or send me a new one  but i really wanted to just get refunded because i don t wanna use this watch anymore      
392,5.0,                       i really enjoy this watch   it is a little bit but not massively ugly  it does everything i need it to do  sleep pattern  calorie count  steps  text messages  incoming calls  etc  it does drain your battery on your phone pretty fast though  but the watch itself stays charged for at least   weeks      
393,5.0,                       i have had this watch for years and absolutely love it  i did a lot of research on smart watches and chose this over the apple watch for the battery life  it lasted me a    day trip to ireland in      without having to charge it and an   day trip this february to iceland without having to charge it  it tracks my steps  i love the way it tracks out door runs  its perfect for me  you can also buy watch bands in different colors and they are super easy to switch out  highly recommend      
394,5.0,                       for the money it s great  it s not a fancy apple but does the job  tracks steps  heart rate  shows that you have incoming text  phone call and email   you can t talk from watch but answer if phone is near   i like the big numbers showing time plus day of week and number  i get weather updates too      
395,5.0,                       i purchased this for running and wanted something that was simple to use with large enough display that i could quickly see most important stats for me i am very happy with this purchase  it was very simple to set up and i was easily able to identify functions and read stats this doesn t have all the bells and whistles of some of the more expensive models but at this price point and for basic functions it is perfect for my needs     
396,5.0,                       purchased this for my wife who is a serious runner but is scared of the over complicated running watches  now  that s not to say this watch is lacking in the feature department  it covers all of the essentials  but  it was also very easy to connect to running software and do automatic updates to her running sites  its clear  fits well  looks nice  and handles the rain very well      
397,1.0,                       i bought this watch to use as a heart rate tracker and running watch  for pace  etc   i am so disappointed   the heart rate monitor is not even close to being accurate   i had an polar ft  heart rate monitor which is amazing and i m going to get another one   my running app is much better showing my current pace than this watch and it s free   the only thing i like about it is the pedometer   a feature i did not even want  but i enjoy seeing how many steps i take during a day   this is a very expensive pedometer   i do not recommend     
398,4.0,                       for the price this watch does everything you need  i only wish there was a way to audio coaching feedback while you run  i will try the pacer when the weather gets better  you need to adjust for inside runs  which can be problematic for me as my stride is not consistent depending on my pace      
399,5.0,                       i ve owned my garmin for about   years now  i ve had to replace the straps once  but i love this watch so much  i get a great charge out of it still  and i find it is my preferred watch  while it s not as pretty as other smart watches or as timeless as a classic watch  the  smart  features of it are pretty useful even when not doing anything fitness related   because it s a little bit older  the gps syncing is starting to take longer but this is a great entry level running watch  i ve also used it for cycling and felt it did a great job there too      
400,5.0,                       recieved a few days ago and i love the look  i was worried it would be too bulky but its super cute  i like the reminders for me to move after i ve been sitting for too long  satisfied customer so far      
401,5.0,                       when i ordered this i sure didn t know i would be wearing this every single day and to sleep   i absolutely love it   it tracks my activity and reminds me to move   it tracks my sleep and makes me want to go to bed earlier so i get my hours in  it works great to track my runs  gives me splits on my miles  tracks elevation and best times   great running watch and activity tracking   i love being able to monitor my heart rate at any time   it will even track menstrual cycles if you wish      
402,1.0,                       this is my fourth garmin i ve owned and it s a piece of crap   the software in it is very glitchy   half of my calls freeze it up and i have to continuously restart it   also  it advertised to be used for swimming laps but it doesn t register nor have the capability to do so   last garmin i think for me   i don t have the option to return at this point   bought it a couple months ago      
403,3.0,                       the battery lasts longer than expected  i have it on all of the time and use the gps for about an hour per day for seven days a week during my runs  and i have to charge it every three days or so for about an hour  i m already having issues synching my runs up to garmin connect  i will update this review if the issues gt better worse  the heart rate monitor is cool  but i don t believe it is as accurate as a chest monitor would be      
404,5.0,                       unreal battery life  much better than my old fitbit blaze  takes a bit to connect to gps but honestly i dont use that feature a lot  the step counter is pretty accurate when compared to my wife s samsung app  heart rate is within    bpm of actual physical measurement  good bluetooth notifications as a smart watch  i would buy again      
405,1.0,                       deeply disappointed with the forerunner      first let me say i am current on firmware updates   i bought this as a low cost replacement for my     which i liked a lot   until the hrm failed after about two years   apparently a well known issue   initially the fr   did the job   not as attractive as the     but gave me what i needed   however crazy results started showing up   recovery pace was slightly faster than my  k pace    final straw today     minutes differential between contiguous miles in a marathon    not helpful   looking at the generated map on garminconnect shows me with a half mile on either side of the course and running on water for about three miles   granted there was tree and cloud cover but even my old fr    was able to cope with the same course and conditions a few years ago   with failure after two years  fr     and watch that sends me news alerts but is unable to reliably report lap pace i am pretty disillusioned with recent garmin products      
406,4.0,                       features are only essentials but that s what i like  i like that it tracks my workouts automatically when i forget to set it  battery life is outstanding when using as a regular watch      
407,4.0,                       the watch is nice and the gps is within the range of precision  the bad is that the bluetooth connection goes on and off if not within under     not worth sending back but definitely sub par  as my suunto watch can connect at least     away      
408,5.0,                       very happy with this device  i had a gps some years ago but it was so complicated it would seem like i d spend more getting the settings right than actually running  all i need is to know how far i went  time and pace  this is perfect  so easy to use  picks up the gps signal in seconds and a nice big and clear display  fun dashboard on the computer  love it      
409,5.0,                       this watch does exactly what i wanted it to do  which is track mileage and speed  and it s numbers are large enough for my middle aged eyes to see while running  it was priced reasonably         i d recommend it to others who want a straightforward runners watch      
410,5.0,                       my favorite garmin so far   i got this watch to use for running  but end up wearing all day long   it tracks hr  calories  steps  sleep and even shows text messages band is very comfortable  not stiff at all      
411,5.0,                       i got this to help with my running  this is the perfect watch for the recreational runner  super simple interface  and very accurate with the distance and pace measurements      
412,1.0,                       good battery life etc  but the main reason i bought it was to track heart rate during workout  it gets stuck randomly on a specific heart rate and unless you check it every few minutes or readjust the strap on your wrist  it won t fix itself  i have had it for just a couple weeks before this started happening  i only wear it  hr per day max  never dropped it or exposed to water or extreme shock heat  amazon support said i need to contact manufacturer directly and didn t help me out at all        
413,2.0,                       many days i woke up with having         steps counted on my watch   i may be a restless sleeper  but that s ridiculous therefore i don t have any confidence that it s accurate  most of my friends that own a  sport watch  say that the step counters aren t accurate so garmin may be as good as the other watches   about   weeks of owning the watch  i woke up one morning and the watch said it was sunday at       am and that happened on a wednesday  i had about     charge left on the phone  i called customer support a few times and they were very friendly and willing to help      
414,2.0,                       i can t even describe my disappointment with this watch  i read all the reviews and i had hope that the garmin had improved since      when i got my last watch from them  that the satellite syncing wouldn t take so long like it used to  everyone i know who has a garmin said that it s super fast  i must have got a lemon because mine takes anywhere between   to   minutes to sync  i contacted garmin  who i had been told have excellent customer service  and their recommendation was to sync my watch with my phone every day  i tried that  it did help a little  but i shouldn t have to do that to get it to sync to satellites  i also shouldn t have to do that every day  i live on a small island  it s not like i m moving very far from the last location i ran from each time i use this  i don t understand why the satellite syncing feature would have to be updated on a daily basis with my phone  i was not impressed with the advice and the blase and uncaring from the person i spoke to it also takes a long time to sync to my phone  garmin agreed that this is unusual   as it can take up to   minutes  which is annoying  i have better things to do with my time than babysit my watch syncing i can walk around my bedroom for a few minutes and it doesn t notice i m walking so even counting steps isn t so accurate  i ve been walking down the street looking at the step counter and seeing it not register my movement overall a huge disappointment  when it works  it s great  but honestly  map my fitness on my phone is quicker and easier  i can turn it on and within    seconds i can go  if i was trying to use this watch for a race  i d miss the start because i d be waiting for it to sync  or it might start in time  it s so hit and miss it s hard to tell one positive is that it does have a pretty band and i think the heart rate monitor is accurate but i don t know for sure as i ve nothing to test it against  another positive is that the interval timer on it is pretty good and very useful distances i m not sure who s being inaccurate but my phone and my watch get different distances even though one is in my right hand and the other on my left wrist  i m told that that can be fixed with doing something in the settings but i haven t bothered trying as i ve ceased using this for anything but a step counter  even if it is inaccurate  i hate leaving negative reviews but i can t even begin to describe how disappointed i am with this watch and garmins response to my complaint  i only contacted them the once as the person i spoke to was useless   everyone else i know who has one  different models  find these watches amazing but this will be the last garmin i buy unfortunately  which is a shame      
415,3.0,                       i researched these units for a month before selecting this one  i really wanted wrist based heart rate most of all  with a large easy to read face  and not many other bells and whistles   i want to be able to read the heart rate during workouts   well  it works fine while walking  etc  but when working out hard and sweating  the heart rate data is all over the place  says it is    when i m panting  or sticks on a given hr when i m changing intensity  etc   what a bummer    this is the feature i want most   reading online  others seem to have this issue as well   garmin s website lists faqs  including one about  erratic heart rate data  and it suggests you wipe the sensor off while sweating   how helpful   how can this be functional in water if it can t even handle a little sweat      
416,5.0,                       i like the display which is always on with a lcd and back light for dark rooms   i use the gps mostly for biking  and on the water for kite boarding  with physical buttons  it is so easy to cycle thru the pages to see my progress or heart rate  among other features   another cool feature of a smart watch is  when i leave the room without my phone  the watch will notify me that it has lost the bluetooth connection because i m out of range   i immediately march back to get my phone      
417,1.0,                       after reading consumer report recommendation  i purchased this item from amazon  it is a big disappointment  i have   major issue with it     the accuracy  i am very concerned about heart rate when i do exercise  however  it gives me some info i really think it is false  when i do slow run  my heart rate normally around       it shows me heart beat is too low  when i run faster  my heart beat normally      or more  it shows my heart beat is too high  my max heart rate should be around          the gps connection  when i first time used it  it connected satellite in a few second  after a couple of days  each time it takes     minutes to connect gps  it is very frustrating     the user s manual  there is lots of numbers showing on this watch without explanation or illustration in its manual  i really do not know what these numbers are for  for example  on manual page    the time        i understand it is the running time  but what is the number above it  and below that number  there is no explanation for it  you may have to guess  sometimes  you never get it right  generally  you spent around a hundred dollars  just buy a big disappointment      
418,5.0,                       my son is in the cross country team and loves it  not super fancy  which is perfect for him      
419,3.0,                       first one would not charge fully  after multiple tries and troubleshooting it was just faulty  returned it and got a new one that did charge fully  it s as basic as basic gets which is the design  just don t expect something magical      
420,4.0,                       i did a lot of research before purchasing  i knew i wanted a gps run tracker as well as a step counter and hr monitor  there are fancier models out there but this does exactly what i want and does it well  takes a few seconds to establish gps  also to realize pace changes  but i like the run modes feature  that i can pair it with food apps to watch calories in out and control my phone s music and calls with the watch  very pleased      
421,5.0,                       retired my old garmin forerunner     after i found that replacing the band was going to be silly expensive   and using the garmin ant  stick seemed outdated  and annoying    my new garmin    has been clicking along  locks satellites lickety split  and does everything i want it to and about thirty things more   used for  running  hiking  and competitive sleep tracking      
422,5.0,                       solid watch for alerts  heart rate and sleep tracking      
423,5.0,                       i like this more then fitbit  i like that the screen dosnt go to sleep and i like the work out tracking  i havent used it for sleep tracking  also very long battery      
424,4.0,                       update  after extended use the heart rate readings have become sporadically inaccurate   accurate some of the time  inaccurate the remainder i have used this for walking and for a rowing machine   i compared the heart rate output with a blood pressure and heart rate cuff i use and it is very comparable   if you place it correctly and snuggly   it does seem to take a few minutes to become accurate   when rowing i use the cardio mode and for walking i use the walking mode   i prefer having buttons to push rather than an interactive screen   the battery seems to last well     rowing sessions and   walks before recharging  but then i power it off when not using because i don t routinely wear a watch   for the price and functions i wanted this is   stars   if it were to quit working within     years i would likely change to   stars      
425,4.0,                       i had an older gamin vivofit smart watch that finally died earlier this year and finally got a newer garmin forerunner    gps watch to replace the older garmin watch  first off    it ain t quite like the older garmin vivofit watch pros   pretty easy to set up once you load the garmin connect app to your smartphone  measures all sorts of things  heartbeat  steps taken  rest stuff and so on   even tells me the forecast and current temperature  nice feel watch band  looks decent enough but face is a bit smaller than expected  easy to read time  for those with fairly bad eyes   night lite for a few seconds to see what time it is in low light conditionscons   no touchscreen  that really surprised me a lot   that seemed like a step backwards   smallish watch face  thought the watch face would be at least as large as my prior garmin watch was   kind of hard to use at first  once you figure it out  it s fine   odd way to charge the battery  using a clip attachment   not a magnetic charger like my prior garmin   another step backwards i think overall  this garmin forerunner    is a decent enough watch for me and despite its few drawbacks  i will keep this watch as it s just minor issues and not bad enough for me to return      
426,2.0,                       the garmin forerunner    is a basic gps for tracking workouts  but it is not very accurate and is very limited in what it can do good  light weight easy to follow menus once it finds gps it stays connectedbad  takes forever to find gps signal   make sure you start it way before you want to start a workout   it often goes into sleep mode because it takes so long  it is very inaccurate in tracking distance   i tested the    against two other higher end garmins and the    was off by     miles after tracking for    miles  you can t track elevation gain on the watch   you can see it on the app   to me this is really dumb   all i care about is total distance  total time and total elevation gain   that s all i want to see and know   why this can t be on the watch baffles me  the elevation that the watch calculates after syncing with the app is way off  the app is super intrusive and is always running in the background even if the watch is off   all i want to do is sync my workouts so i can see all the details   i ended up installing it on a tablet i rarely use because i didn t want the app on my phone  the watch takes forever to sync with the app   sometimes it just gives up   super annoying
