56,1.0 ,                       these bears are supposed to be the same size   the pink one came in a bag  not even a box  paid the same price for both  be careful  bear size advertised is not what actually comes to your door

79,1.0 ,                       this item was advertised bigger and in a box  it can unboxed and very small  i am very disappointed      
80,5.0 ,                       grumpy bear was on special but he is a real treat  the kids love how soft he is and we often talk about what makes us happy and what makes this grumpy  he s a nostalgic icon from the past and he feels his role wonderfully     
81,5.0 ,                       i was reading some of the reviews and it is really unfortunate that some of the customers didn t receive the advertised product nor did they receive the collectible coin  i took a shot on it as a valentine s day gift and i received the product  cheer bear  in the advertised box with the collectible coin  it was for the girlfriend and was more so going to be a display collectible item rather than a teddy bear to sleep with  either way  she loved it  said it was really soft and it s cute  would recommend

97,5.0 ,                       i love the carebears  i bought all   of  them     
98,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i ordered this for a dear friend who used to have an entire collection of care bears   due to alzheimers she no longer has her home or contents   i sent this to her as we re not permitted to see her due to the covid   she loves it   she plans on keeping it forever   her words   so hugable      
99,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the bear was soft and very cuddly  was highly dissapointed in the packaging  it was a gift for my daughter for her birthday  she likes to keep the boxes for her stuffed animals but the box was crushed and ruined  i had to throw it away  they need to handle things better over there in the warehouse  that box should never have been distributed      
100,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       box came wrapped in a plastic bag  great since i was worried about the box having an open front side  easy to free bear from box  it s super soft  good quality for            
101,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i am completely excited about these care bears  i was nervous about the texture but wasn t disappointed  they are soft and cuddly  care bears was my favorite child hood toy and i m super excited to gift them to our kiddos      
102,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       beside the box being a little beaten  the plush itself is so soft and very cuddly  i ve seen it in walmart for a less price but like always grumpybear was always sold out  so had to go online and pay a bit more for it  but still worth it since i have the old versions of carebears      
103,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i noticed that these are priced competitively with other stores  but those other stores were sold out so i came here to complete my set of care bears   these also make great gifts to give others   they came well packaged and then wrapped again with plastic on the outside during a pandemic  which is a plus   they also come with a special collector s coin  with the same or similar color as the bear   i d highly recommend these as gifts or as  visuals  for those who need comfort  self care  and or stress relievers   as a side note  during this pandemic  i store the incoming items i ve removed from the main package into a secure place inside my apartment and wait three days before use   i also use either lysol spray or tide antibacterial fabric spray to pretreat these after i ve waited three days  just to make sure they are clean and germ free before use during a pandemic   i am high risk and therefore do what i can to make sure that anything i purchase is cleaned and disinfected before use   it s just an added step that could reduce risk of any infection during a pandemic   the extra care that went into packaging this item was impressive  however   i knew i was receiving a new and carefully packaged product   i received the same type of packaging from one other company that sold care bears as well   i m wondering if they come direct from the factory with plastic bag coverings outside of the bear boxes      
104,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i love love love this cheer bear  i bought it for my daughter  she s only   months old lol  but for a keepsake  it is just as described and perfect in every way  except it smells like a fish factory   it has the faint smell of rotten fish on it  i don t want to deal with returning because my husband works     hours a day and it sucks trying to take my kids and   month old out  especially with covid         is i throw it in the washing machine  will it ruin its fur    thank you      
105,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i love care bears      so i found this one and ordered him because it was only     and then i got worried as i read a review and someone said it looked funny  well it was the wrong bear they had reviewed or something because mine is in a collector box which he will stay in  he s gorgeous like all the carebears  i m going to get the rest of them now just going to make sure it s this specific brand  thanks love how cute it is and the size of the bear is great snd love the box      
106,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the box came damaged in three different areas  the bear itself is fine but if trying to keep in great condition   it s a no go with the box     
107,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       these are awesome  only complaint is my pink one came with what i would call a  fake  version on the coin  the others are solid and you can tell they are metal and good quality  for some reason my pink came with one that feels like plastic  considering i m collecting these in super disappointed it s different sub par to the rest but honestly only complaint  good size  soft and super cute
