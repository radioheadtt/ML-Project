0,5.0 ,                       this phone came in perfect condition  i got my husband a red one and i got myself a yellow one   we are definitely satisfied       we upgraded from iphone  s and were in love with the cameras  they re great for taking our product pictures since we work through our phones  there wasn t a single scratch on either of them   they arrived within   days from purchasing      
1,5.0 ,                       for its price it s absolutely worth it  due note that the battery s do not come at      mine came at    which is totally fine  apart from that there are super minor damage making the devices like new and i will happily be using this for the upcoming years upgrading from a    would recommend      
2,4.0 ,                       the phone works perfectly  my complaint is that it didn t come with the headphones and the charger is not the an original for iphones     
3,1.0 ,                       it said fully unlocked but then further down the page after comparisons when it says product description  you find it is not fully unlocked  not compatible with verizon which is what i have     
4,5.0 ,                       this is a great phone   looks brand new  runs very well  the camera quality is amazing  i would for sure but from this seller     
5,5.0 ,                       just what i needed for my teenager  she wanted a newer iphone   almost        which no way in h   i was going to spend that money   so i looked on amazon and came across this iphone xr  read the reviews  thought about it for a little and decided to give it a try  the one part that convinced me was the price and most importantly that the purchase was backed up with amazon purchase and returns so received it yesterday  fully unlocked  no scratches or dents  screen was in perfect shape  came with the charger and it was just like any brand new purchased phone i had a previous sim card  called metro by tmobile and transferred altransferredl the info to the new iphone and vuala  i gad a fully working iphone for less than       my goal  and didn t even needed to go to the store to activate so  overall on my personal opinion with no benefits or paying me for review  this was a great purchase      
6,5.0 ,                       was really unsure about ordering but i took one for the team and i wasn t disappointed  honestly i had a hard time connecting it but that was a me problem not with the phone  it looks new tbh  only thing that was a little scratched up is where the charger goes but it wasn t like omg this looks horrible  battery life is at      came with a screen protector  a charger and cube not apple but worked fine

9,5.0 ,                       great buy  my son is very happy  everything is working great now  not one scratch or crack on it  looks like new  even came with a screen protector on it  came very fast     days without prime      
10,1.0 ,                       el tel fono      visualmente pero ya al usarlo innumerables problemas desde que se apaga solo  no carga  se recalienta al punto que te pide que le bajes la temperatura  el faceid no vale  la se al se va  etc muchos problemas  no vale la pena      
11,5.0 ,                       i got the iphoe xr from electro wireless  the phone works perfectly but the screen has alot of scratches when i applied the screen protector it made bubbles      
12,1.0 ,                       could not get it to work  screen would go purple  the whole phone would crash  and it would get stuck in a reset loop  absolutely unusable  utter garbage  cannot even get it repaired      
13,5.0 ,                       okay so this literally the best phone  i love it so much   my mom got it for me as a birthday gift and it works amazing   don t even get me started on the camera quality  especially on snapchat    i highly recommend             
14,5.0 ,                       easy to switch over to my current number     
15,3.0 ,                       i paid    gb now that the phone is activated it only shows   gigabytes not a happy camper     
16,5.0 ,                       my daughter loved it  works great      
17,1.0 ,                       this cellphone worked when i turned it on at first but the next day  the screen got blacked and blurred  i m so mad that the product wasn t reviewed correctly before selling it and also i bought a renewed iphone but when i got the product the warranty information stated it was refurbished instead  this is the worst purchase i ve ever done      
18,3.0 ,                       el tel fono llego sin detalles la pantalla se ve a perfecto  s lo que parece que vino la bater a fallada porque se drenaba rapid simo no llegaba a dar ni   horas de pantalla encendida  lo termin  devolviendo por ese tema pero por lo dem s es muy buen equipo     
19,5.0 ,                       phone came in excellent condition  has worked great for the months i have owned it thus far  i would use them again      
20,5.0 ,                       the phone arrived quickly and looked like brand new  i ve had it for almost a month now with no issues at all  the price in my opinion is unbeatable and i would most definitely purchase again      
21,5.0 ,                       got my product earlier than expected  came with everything described and looks like new conditioned  i m not much of a picture guy but the camera seems well detailed  haven t had it long enough to accurately state how the battery life is but it seems to be near     capacity so no complaints     
22,4.0 ,                       i love the phone it comes with a screen protector and charger  my only complaint is that there was no sim card included which seemed odd  it wasn t a problem because i had one but thought that it might be helpful to know if you are changing from another brand to apple  but the phone is just what i was hoping for and is not a scam      
23,4.0 ,                       i spent almost a month with this phone and their hasn t been any problems with data  battery  calls  quality  or anything else  i switched from an iphone  s  which doesn t turn on anymore  and it is amazing not having to charge     times a day  this battery is fine throughout the whole day with mild to intense use  with mild use and school going on  the battery can last me almost   days  i ve seen reviews where the battery comes at      but mine was not included in those cases  my phone came at     and that annoys me a little but it s worth the     dollars i save by not buying it from the apple store  i am not sure about waterproofing but my phone came without a scratch or a chip on the aluminum paint  it was like it was new besides for the fact of the battery  i was really happy with it but another annoying thing was that they didn t require a signature with the delivery  my neighbors have stolen airpods that i ve ordered before so i was quite annoyed by the fact that they just left it in the mail box without making me personally accept it or sign for it  beware about that if you live in a shady neighborhood or busy street      
24,5.0 ,                       screen is very easy to break so make sure you put it in a good phone case      
25,5.0 ,                       i thought this was a bit risky looking at the    of bad reviews  trust me it is worth it  my iphone xr came with no scratches  dents  or cracks  it had      batter life and is the best phone i ever had  do not listen to the bad reviews      
26,5.0 ,                       sparkling and solid     
27,5.0 ,                       this is the best phone i have ever bought off amazon  the phone is just like new  the camera quality is amazing  the battery last me through a       hour shift  i would definitely buy again      
28,1.0 ,                       it s fine the screen is scratched up and the back is     
29,1.0 ,                       this item is going back    not worth buying refurbished no more  last two purchased iphones you are unable to hear people on a call  have to put it on speaker   returning      
30,5.0 ,                       this is a great phone  the only thing is that it does come with some scratches but with a screen protector they are not even noticeable the battery life is as good as any other phone if you re on it all day it will die if not it lives idk it is just a phone not over priced at all  also the charging box it comes with is not trust worthy it was sparking anytime i tried to plug it into the wall      
31,1.0 ,                       i purchased this red xr about   weeks ago i finally decided to activate it i open the box theres no earbuds inside as well as the sim card tray was missing     
32,3.0 ,                       i reached out to the seller multiple times  as soon as i received this item   unfortunately i have yet to receive a response    my issue with the item is the top of the touch screen does not work  meaning it does not respond to the touch of my fingers      
33,2.0 ,                       the face id stopped working the first week i ve had the phone  i ve chosen to just be alright with just using the passcode but as soon as i m able  this phone is getting replaced  respectfully      
34,1.0 ,                       there were scratches on the camera side and later on  i noticed that my back camera and flashlight was not working properly  i asked for a replacement to be sent first so i could back up the phone before sending back the defective one  they said they would never send in the replacement first  even though it meant i was left without a phone for some time  anti consumer refund practices  never again     
35,5.0 ,                       so far so good however it s different than my iphone   plus my iphone   plus the iphone   it works totally different so it s a whole new device to learn from me which i know it s ok but i wish i could just learn it like a three year old other than that i highly recommend it  in addition you can call apple at anytime and they will help you with any questions you have so now it is january         and i have my apple xr about    days     every new day i love it more   more          
36,4.0 ,                       the phone was fine and wasn t surprised that is wasn t in perfect condition  screen was a bit scratched in one area  but looks great with a screen protector on it now  and the phone camera lens housing paint was rubbed off  probably from being used without a case      
37,5.0 ,                       i was prepared for the worst in transferring both cellular info  with swapping sim card   and my old phone s data content to this new iphone boy was i in for a surprise  my old iphone    with updated software   was quickly recognized by the new xr  woke it up and started an internal program to run in concert with my new iphone xr through just a few easy to understand prompts  the whole transfer process was finished in about    minutes  my old iphone   held a lot of data  i was amazed at the ease  completeness and correctness of the process and had been worried over the transfer and activation process for nothing this new xr functions flawlessly  the only issue i have with it is that since we now all have to wear masks  the face recognition doesn t work  perhaps apple can correct that by including a software subroutine that will allow the phone s camera to concentrate on the eyes but honestly  the phone is awesome      
38,5.0 ,                       came in perfect condition  excellent battery life and i play a lot of games and only charge it once a day     
39,4.0 ,                       good phone     
40,5.0 ,                       this phone works amazing  the only problem was the camera was a little scuffed up on the outside but the camera itself works amazing  ten outta ten from me      
41,5.0 ,                       i honestly thought i was going to get scammed but i was in desperate need for a bee phone so i took a chance  the phone came fully unlocked and arrived earlier than expected  great seller      
42,5.0 ,                       this was just like brand new  no scratches no glitches no anything  only thing was it wasn t in original box  that s okay it is perfect condition      
43,4.0 ,                       has been a great phone for my   yr old  nice camera screen is in perfect shape that i can tell for a refurbished phone and the battery lasts all day with heavy use  so far we are really happy with the purchase      
44,5.0 ,                       works fine   battery at      came with a screen protector   put it immediately into an otter box so i don t have to worry about scratches  dents  etc  but it seemed to be free of those   so far i m happy i saved a lot of     over the apple factory refurbished   ask me again in    days         
45,5.0 ,                       i like it so far  i was hesitant about getting a phone for so much on here  it works well      
46,5.0 ,                       the iphone works well i have no problem with it     
47,5.0 ,                       i was a bit skeptical about buying this phone but i am i love i got the coral xr and it couldnt be more perfect just like a brand new phone  no scratches dents or anything   battery life at        all i did was pop my sim card in and it worked great like a brand new phoa     
48,5.0 ,                       i was a little nervous buying a phone site unseen but i m glad i did  looks brand new  has wonderful battery life  and works great  it was a bit of a hassle getting it setup  but not because of the phone  the service provider was stupid   boost mobile        happy with my purchase and i would recommend      
49,1.0 ,                       the iphone worked great  however  there was a scratch on the screen larger than anticipated  it was advertised as unlocked  but would not connect to my network  i use mint mobile  which is a smaller company that runs off the t mobile towers  after spending   hours calling my phone company  apple  and t mobile  i learned that t mobile blocked this iphone from their network because it was reported lost or stolen  so please beware of the risk when you buy a phone from amazon      
50,1.0 ,                       now after using the phone for three months it stopped charging and the battery went bad  now i m going through the process of getting my refund and it has been    days and still no refund so be careful on purchasing a phone through kiss  the phone worked well up until it didn t also the phone looked great no scratches or dents  i have contacted amazon and kiss about my refund multiple times and still    days and nothing  so hopefully i can get my funds back finally received my refund after    days  right after i posted my review  so i m sure other people have had good experience with them but mine wasn t great  so just be weary on what you order and i d suggest ordering the insurance as well when spending this kind of money      
51,5.0 ,                       this was for my granddaughter and until today when someone stole it she has totally enjoyed the phone   no complaints at all      
52,1.0 ,                       the phone did now have the ability to access wifi      
53,4.0 ,                       was sceptical at first but the phone arrived after   weeks because of the covid but the quality is tops    the camera    battery life  really happy with the supplier and the phone  satisfied customer      
54,2.0 ,                       everything seems to be working fine  touch screen is good and it came with a screen protector on it already the issue i had was the description said like new condition  this phone was not in like new condition  there were heavy scratches on the back of the phone and a bunch of dents chips in the metal around the phone  it was obviously dropped quite a bit      
55,1.0 ,                       this phone was reported stolen and stopped working an hour after i got it set up  definitely won t be buying another one from them      
56,5.0 ,                       small issue but manufacturer was timely in resolving     
57,5.0 ,                       great phone     
58,5.0 ,                       this is my first ever review for amazon and iphone seller  i have been amazon costumer last    years never written any reviews  i am tech guy  i know lot about the phone  this is my second day with this phone but i have to say this is the best refurbished phone i have purchased  came out like brand new  looks new and works like brand new  big thumbs up to seller      
59,4.0 ,                       the only thing i dislike about the phone is what it was delivered in  i expected an apple box and an apple charger but instead i got an off brand charger that s   or   feet long and a plain white box  it also didn t come with earbuds      
60,5.0 ,                       i love my new phone  has to take it to the store to set it up properly but i haven t been more excited  absolutely love it for its purpose      
61,4.0 ,                       arrived in time  mint condition in red but after connected phone to test out and found that the speaker on the phone sounded horrible when a call came in or to play music  hassle of going back and forth to get refund  didn t want to go back and forth or wait on refund so took to shop to replace speaker for another         
62,5.0 ,                       great quality product   looks good as new  great price      
63,4.0 ,                       screen was perfect besides very light scratches on the notch  barely noticeable unless you angle it  and small scratches on the back  also  my battery health was on     when received  overall good buy      
64,1.0 ,                       i bought this a few days ago there are a lot of scratches  so it looks like it s been used for a very long time consider buying a new one instead  it s a old item that s been used for a long time and can t get apple a s      
65,5.0 ,                       okay  so i m super skeptical about buying stuff online  i gave it a try and i m so happy with the results  so here is my back story my daughter dropped my old iphone   plus on the ground and in water so i of course had to get a new phone  i wanted an upgraded iphone and i came across this iphone on amazon and found this iphone on sale  i read all reviews  and decided to purchase it  i received it not   but   days earlier then what shipping said i would  i went straight from work to daycare for pickup to metro pcs  they activated my phone for me  and transferred my current plan  it was so easy and so quick  i m so happy    also what came in the box  a pamphlet on how to  a charger and not apple but works perfect  and the iphone and the sim card tray tool thing  shipping was perfect  delivery was perfect  i want to give you    million stars   thank you so much for anyone that made the process this easy         
66,5.0 ,                       i was nervous about buying this phone at first  but i m really glad i did  it functions exactly as it should and it s really great so far  i basically got a      for       the only bad thing is that boost mobile wouldn t accept it  but i ended up getting a better deal from verizon anyways      
67,5.0 ,                       i was actually very hesitant to get this phone i had seen some neg reviews that kind of threw me off but there where much more positive reviews i like everything about it  it didn t come with not a single or dent and all my data moved in less than    mins it was a smooth transition from the   to the xr but i am very much pleased with the result  the max capacity was at    which in my eyes is great coming from a     it also came a day early  must buy        
68,5.0 ,                       love the phone  bought it for my daughters birthday  now i want one for myself  in perfect condition  i was a little afraid to buy because of the negative reviews  but was sold with the positive reviews  glad i did buy it  also the phone came sooner than expected      
69,5.0 ,                       i have used this phone for two days so far and its great  the battery life is super good with the capacity of      no dents or cracks  i bought this phone from the seller buyspry      
70,4.0 ,                       well i am a teenager and i was skeptical about buying this phone because i saved up for about   and half months from my first job  but it is save to say that it s not bad at all  when i revived the phone there were some scratches on the screen  and couple of chips on the side of the phone but nothing major  and on the back there was some scratches  but nothing to major  over all i would recommend to buy this phone     
71,3.0 ,                       charging cord and charging block doesn t work  charging cable is not made by apple  box it came is was damaged but the phone was ok      
72,5.0 ,                       i received my phone over   weeks ago  great buy  i was worried with the bad reviews  but there is free returns if you you get a bad one by chance  why not give it a shot  came with brand new  never opened charger cord and phone was packaged nicely      
73,3.0 ,                       pretty much perfect except the mic doesn t work super well    and the audio at the top it really quiet      
74,2.0 ,                       the battery life seems to be pretty poor my     nokia i replaced with this has a better battery life anything i can do i ve tried all the ways  letting it die and charging it turned  off and overnight thanks for any help      
75,5.0 ,                       awesome phone to have  it feels tougher and the battery life is incredible  the face id works great  better than the aggravating fingerprint recognition  a good waterproof case and this phone is surviving farm life  way impressed      
76,5.0 ,                       not bad for unlocked iphone     
77,5.0 ,                       my phone came in perfect condition  well packaged   works perfectly       
78,5.0 ,                       the phone had optimal conditions  it seemed that it had never been used  with a    battery life  good sound and in perfect condition  the signal works perfect in the dominican republic  don t think about it  it s safe      
79,5.0 ,                       the phone did not have any signs of use and the screen was in excellent condition  the phone came ready to have automatic transfer of data from old phone to new   so far no problems  just had to learn the new techniques of the iphone  came with charger and cable      
80,1.0 ,                       i have a      pos brick now  it s updated and now i don t get texts from android  i ve followed every possible fix online and nothing solves the issue  i have to have texts from android for my job  on top of wasting      on this crap phone i had to purchased another one  android this time  that works properly  thanks apple  you scumbags   of course it s also too late to return this useless piece of junk      
81,5.0 ,                       i like this phone a lot really enjoy the features and battery charges fast      
82,5.0 ,                       fully unlocked  great phone  sound quality not so great but still love this phone     
83,4.0 ,                       i honestly bought this to replace my iphone   being candid  i m to the point of disdain with apple  they used to be geared towards creatives  and still are  some of the music apps i use on my ipad and iphone are  alone  enough to keep me  the machines are superior to the competition  but jacking the cost of their mid level laptops near        think new  with    gb ram and what do they give you a ssd with not enough memory anyway  this phone has a pretty large screen so i can  actually utilize apps like garage band  everyone knows that program so i ll use it for example   there is so much going on in that program  as of the last few years i have just enough room to use it fairly well  this phone is quite heavy  it s at least twice as heavy as my  sx   gb ram  thought about kicking the dough for the models just a notch up in the  x  family  but the price was a lot higher i like the red color  i didn t know it  but i guess it s an aids awareness special model  i was already aware there was a disease called aids  but know i have to keep it in a case so i don t look like a  cause  person bottom line  i have not got into the camera features  but the video when run into my     k knockoff brand  looks fantastic      
84,5.0 ,                       got my iphone today       i m so so happy  it s in perfect condition like new  it has one little scratch that i only saw because i was looking for  battery life      i m so glad i didn t listen to the negative reviews  i ll update the review in few  months the quality is       i wish i could give them      stars   await a minute i can                                                                                                                                                                                                              
85,1.0 ,                       do not buy from this seller   phone does not work started glitching in set up   scam        
86,5.0 ,                       great phone  i bought it a year ago and it still works well      
87,5.0 ,                       i ordered this phone for my son  the phone looked brand new and i found absolutely no defects  the battery life was at       i would gladly buy another      
88,5.0 ,                       i received my phone from  digital age usa    these guys do referbs right   the phone looks nearly new  a slight scuff on the upper right aluminum bumper and that s it   the screen and back glass are scratch free  battery shows     health   it s been running perfectly all day   i m very happy      
89,5.0 ,                       overall  this phone is great  the seller is very fast and i got my phone within days pro  seller is fast  and perfect condition con  no headphones  no attachment for headphones     
90,5.0 ,                       this phone is so amazing  i saved money and it is awesome it is practically brand new  a really great buy     
91,1.0 ,                       would have been   stars if i could have actually used it  phone is beautiful  looks new  unfortunately  when i went to metro to activate it on my account i was informed that the phone was still active on another account  ironically this was a metro customer as well  when i informed the csr that i bought the phone from amazon he couldn t believe  probably didn t believe it  chubbietech was the third party provider  i m currently waiting on a follow up about a replacement   stressful      
92,5.0 ,                       it s amazing how much better this phone is compared to my other one  nobody will be disappointed with this upgrade  and at good price for what you get      
93,5.0 ,                       i was very surprised that this phone came on time and works properly  it s refurbished so there are some small scratches on the corners but not noticeable  i just needed a new phone for camera quality and the camera and audio is amazing  very impressed and am going to buy another one for my  man      
94,5.0 ,                       early delivery  best prices on amazons for renewed phones thanks for the customer service and fast delivery love my new iphone xr will continue shopping from you guys   phone is in good condition  i rate this seller           
95,5.0 ,                       i will recommend this item       
96,3.0 ,                       overall the phone is good   i have encountered a problem with the camera on the get go but thought it would fix it self   the problem is this when i am ready to take a picture it freezes and i have to shut the camera and after i try to take the picture again it works   its very frustrating because i sometimes i really miss  good shots   this is very disappointing         
97,1.0 ,                       we just tried to change providers and sprint said phone was never paid for by the person who had it before  we would like to return the phone and get a phone that doesn t have outstanding loan      
98,5.0 ,                       no problems with amount of ram although i have no idea what s in the phone for ram  camera is high end of middle  phone arrived in better shape then expected  phone arrived within   days so shipping was early i only wish apple offered bigger battery life in general  but i don t have to plug it in every day to use it  i get   days before needing to charge it  overall i would give a    out of    stars      
99,1.0 ,                       the battery life and charging time was disappointing   ok for a second phone      
100,5.0 ,                       this the first review i ve ever done on amazon and i am      satisfied  this phone looks      new and everything that came with was legit as well  very pleased with it      
101,5.0 ,                       so at first i was a little skeptical about buying this but it s worth it  doesn t glitch and came in perfect condition  little scratches but not even noticeable but also it s a refurbished phone so don t expect perfection  totally would recommend to others  also you re gonna have to get your own headphones which isn t that bad      
102,5.0 ,                       good deal came with a nice case and screen protector to my surprise was well packaged and haven t had any issues poped my sim card in did normal setup and i was off and running          
103,3.0 ,                       it said it was unlocked but come to find out it wasn t it was locked to its original provider  so sadly i had to return it i got a full refund back      
104,1.0 ,                       i waited a week for this phone and i payed more for it to be unlocked and now i have to return it because i went to sprint and they said the phone is locked and can t even be activated  phone also came without screen protector and i paid for a new one so im sending it back with the protector  now i have to wait a whole week for a refund and wait another week for them to get the phone  refund my money and then buy another iphone     
105,5.0 ,                       the iphone xr i bought was from amazon renew  it came on time and works great  would definitely buy again     
106,1.0 ,                       update  after a week of use  the phone began to no longer connect to my carrier s network  countless hours on support with them and apple  they are completely dumbfounded  i am never buying used again when i saw this deal  i was extremely skeptical  even though it is a used phone  you simply cannot ignore the price tag  it came in a generic box  with a charger and charging cable  not apple   the one i got has absolutely zero scuffs  scratches or wear  there was already a screen protector on it  not sure if from previous owner or from the seller   very  very pleased installation was a breeze  i just had to swap the micro sim card from my iphone   to the xr and went through apple s quick setup  now it s like i ve had the phone for years however  one important thing to note  is that the battery capacity for this is       so it was clearly used for a bit beforehand  that is probably the only gripe  but i really can t complain because of it being used  if you are on the fence about this  i would take the gamble  you will most likely end up just as pleased as i am of course  only time will tell on how well worth this purchase was  odds are if i haven t updated this within a few months of writing everything is still great so skeptics  i would go for this purchase if you want an upgrade  but don t want to pay full price      
107,5.0 ,                       battery was still at      and the phone looked new  it still had the original box and accessories      
108,5.0 ,                       great phone that was practically brand new when i bought it   i ve had it since october    and waited exactly   months to write the review  it still works perfectly  however  if you have sprint   it can be more difficult to set this phone up  i had to take it to the sprint store and get a new sim card activated in order to use this phone      
109,1.0 ,                       great phone  looks great  functions as expected  order a coral phone for t mobile  received red for who knows which carrier  but definitely not t mobile  what a disappointment for my    y o  daughter  who worked and saved the money to buy this phone  very disappointed  returning it  but is it safe to re order  will they get it right on the next go round also  we paid      a week ago and now the price is up to       will the seller match the original price   will update if i hear anything      
110,5.0 ,                       it was exactly as i expected and wanted  it runs great  sometimes i have to restart it but i don t feel like that s an issue because most phones need a restart every now and again anyway and it doesn t happen often  it came fully unlocked as it said in the description so i currently have an iphone xr with metro pcs as my carrier and i love it        
111,5.0 ,                       this phone was beautiful when i received it  looked and worked like new  i recommend seller chubbiestech due to their fast shipping  great customer service and item quality      
112,3.0 ,                       overall the phone was in good conditions  however i had to return it because the speaker and microphone we re not working  don t they check that before selling a phone      
113,5.0 ,                       i purchased two of these  one for my daughter and one for myself  my daughters came first  that one had some minor scratches that weren t too much noticeable  but phone worked perfect and she loves it  i ordered mine after seeing how good the first went  mine was in terrific condition with even less scratches than the first  both phones were super easy to set up  expecting i d have some issues with it being unlocked and the phones activating  but both were as easy as putting in the sim and that was that  only issue i had with mine was that the battery health was already at     which i was assuming would at least be over      not a biggy though  both phones shipped super fast and i am very pleased with both of them      
114,5.0 ,                       i needed an upgrade after my iphone   started to slowly stop working  i was apprehensive about buying a refurbished phone but i m so happy with it  it looks and works like new i couldn t be happier     
115,5.0 ,                       i was hesitant at first  but i love the xr  delivered two days ahead of schedule  this was the perfect choice      
116,5.0 ,                       the phone came in time  came like brand new   no scratches  came with only a charger  am really happy with  my purchase     
117,5.0 ,                       honestly was very surprised by how it came out  shipment was okay and phone was in perfect shape  didn t find a scratch what s so ever so it was basically new besides the battery life which at     overall great purchase  looking for an iphone on a budget that works and looks like new then would recommend  hope this helps      
118,5.0 ,                       really nice phone     
119,5.0 ,                       came in great condition  fully unlocked and as advertised  shipping was fast considering the circumstances we live in right now  very pleased with this purchase      
120,5.0 ,                       although the phone arrived dead  once it charged up  it seemed to be running okay  the health of the battery was also         as an unlocked phone   it did not register for my verizon or tmobile  it kept indicating phone not allowed for both sim cards  since i was using it for tmobile and the imei was not recognized online  i had to call and the process was completed in   minutes and the phone worked instantly the seller does indicate on the box  not to provide the imei number  but in this situation i had to  since it did not work for both carriers  but i did not encounter any problems with the t mobile representative      
121,1.0 ,                       el celular presenta una falla la cual no le permite activar el wifi  eventualmente funciona pero al poco tiempo vuelve a presentar la falla      
122,3.0 ,                       my phone came in looking completely brand new  there were no scratches or dents on the phone it was very clean and looked straight out of the box  however once i got my phone all set up the top speaker next to the front camera sounded very muffled like it was blown out  this lead me to return the phone but i did get my money back  everything else on the phone worked perfectly it was just the speaker that did not      
123,4.0 ,                       good price     
124,3.0 ,                       a little disappointed that it came scratched but it s whatever  and the touchscreen is perfectly fine  and everything else is good so far     
125,5.0 ,                       fast shipping  but amazon keeps shipping all my packages to a house   houses down from mine  but the product is amazing and have been using it for about a month now and i have had no problems      
126,4.0 ,                       there was a small nick on the camera edging but otherwise it seems to work like it should     
127,1.0 ,                       the product itself was fantastic  coming from a iphone  s plus  everything about this phone and its usage was great  unfortunately the phone was delivered to me locked and not able to connect to metro pcs  after spending nearly      and waiting almost a year for this phone  it doesn t work    i kept it for a month with the hopes i could find someone to unlock  with no luck  no one could  decided to finally return it just for it to be stolen i the mail  before you buy  please take into account that the claim that it ll be      unlocked may not be true in all phones  because of it im out       had it been unlocked in the first place like told in the description and had their also been a disclaimer that not all products may be ready to connect or may still be locked  i wouldnt have wasted such hard work  time and money      
128,5.0 ,                       this phone is definitely worth it for the money  it came in practically pristine  save for a few very minor cosmetic scratches on the back  it seems just like new to me though and i m very satisfied with my purchase   thanks kanga supply        
129,2.0 ,                       this is a joke and i can t return it because i bought it and moved to mexico for   months  the battery is at     capacity  meaning it is not a new one  there are stains around the camera lens in the back  which can t be removed with anything i have tried  it s like sap  it has noticeable scratches and marks in several parts  this is a huge disappointment  i just assumed that amazon refurbished would be of high quality  what a joke      
130,5.0 ,                       me encanto esta nuevecito ni una raya nada y lo recib  antes de tiempo estoy enamorada de mi celular  aparte de que me regalaron un protector para el tel fono     
131,5.0 ,                       pretty good overall only problem is that videos on youtube and tiktok seem to be slightly zoomed like someone did a bad job cropping it     
132,5.0 ,                       i bought an xr with buyspry and it came with a new battery and in good condition      
133,5.0 ,                       my daughter s love their phone s  like new condition  no scratches   it was unlocked   had no problem getting their sim and their internet   they quickly airdropped their info from their old phones   thumbs up    stars      thank you      
134,5.0 ,                       flawless operation and amazing performance  especially when upgrading from  s  used magnifying glass to look for scratches and blemishes and found none  the reported battery health is       it is as good as if purchased directly from apple but for less  i just popped the sim card in and run data transfer from the old  s over bt and it was ready to rock  just fyi  i did elect  amazon renewed  unit to get extra   yr  warranty and better quality  according to the amazon disclaimers and descriptions   i have absolutely no regrets      
135,5.0 ,                       thanks     
136,5.0 ,                       works great     
137,5.0 ,                       honestly  no cap  this is a brand new phone  it didn t come in the apple box  but the battery life is at      it was about     charged  not that it matters    no scratches or anything i m just a dude from ohio living in atlanta  and i d recommend amazons refurbished stuff to anyone after doing this purchase i m not rich  so i was skeptical  but now i m glad i upgraded from my  s to the coral xr  i m not taking pics  cause i m in bed rn  but trust me  phone looks and basically is brand new  i just know how i was reading a bunch of reviews and hoping everything would turn out alright  all in all  i m glad  worst case scenario would ve been using their return policy and getting another sent to me  so    i m grateful that didn t happen choose your color   style  and just take the plunge  it ll be worth it  amazon practically guarantees it      
138,1.0 ,                       ordered this phone for my daughter who was thrilled until we found out that the phone is not fully unlocked   as the description says      
139,5.0 ,                       been using this phone for a month  i was a bit skeptical when buying but all in all the phone was basically new      
140,1.0 ,                       their  unlocked  description isn t accurate  bought an unlocked phone but it wouldn t work with xfinity mobile  the imei wasn t compatible  since xfinity mobile uses verizon s towers i figured i d try verizon too  nope not compatible with them either   customer service was prompt and polite  but there warehouse was all out and couldn t send a replacement  only refund my purchase  seems suspicious since amazon still had   devices available when i rechecked  but the price had gone up       it s disappointing since the phone seemed to be in perfect condition and was a great value  wish they d honor their descriptions and find a replacement instead just a refund      
141,5.0 ,                       the phones is like new my son loved it      
142,1.0 ,                       i didn t get to even activate the phone  the phone was not unlocked at all  as a matter of fact  it was a demo phone is what my carrier told me after trying several times to activate it  sad part is we purchased a phone from ebay and it arrived beyond broken  so i decided to go to amazon to fix my issue because i trust them  this just hasn t been my month  maybe i ll just get a flip phone from walmart when i get my refund  i m done      
143,1.0 ,                       horrible    i wish i could leave a   star review  the phone itself had a few scratches but they were too bad or that much noticeable  the problem with my xr is that it literally has a battery life of   hours  i contacted the seller on what could be done by this and i haven t gotten a response yet   i will update the review once that happens     
144,1.0 ,                       produt in black list definitely no good      
145,5.0 ,                       pretty happy with me product   it has been   months since i bought it and no problems    definitely a good phone quality for a refurbished iphone xr     
146,5.0 ,                       touch screen and screen quality and battery is fine     
147,5.0 ,                       despite being a renewed phone and some minor barely visible scratches on the screen it works great and it was compatible with my phone carrier metro pcs plus i like how they package it with a fast charger which charges it pretty quick     
148,5.0 ,                       i finally became a member of the apple phone cult    and i am pleased and the graphics camera sound is abolutely incredible     i gotta give it props     android has a couple of things i do like better   j m just keepin it real with ya       
149,2.0 ,                       didn t get what i ordered but the phone was nice      
150,5.0 ,                       the phone came looking brand new when i unboxed it and i have had no problems so far  overall pretty happy with my purchase and i do recommend buying refurbished if you don t want to spend a whole lot extra for something new      
151,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          flawless coming out of package   will update after activation       
152,5.0 ,                       battery life and screen quality is excellent     
153,5.0 ,                       we bought two phones from here and one of them had some issues  fortunately they were extremely helpful getting us a replacement phone and now their both perfect  definitely worth the price  i couldn t have been happier with the customer support      
154,5.0 ,                       bought this phone in november for someone and so far it s working just fine     
155,5.0 ,                       this is exactly what i paid for     
156,4.0 ,                       warning  the iphoke i got was not unlocked  and it was locked with cricket at t  other than that the phone is great but i m going to have to change my plan in order to use the phone  not the most disappointing thing but i wish it was unlocked  good phone though      
157,5.0 ,                       it works perfectly  nothing was wrong when arrived and i have been using it for months now and nothing is going wrong     
158,2.0 ,                       the original iphone charger and the original white earphones are missing in the box   please i needyou send me as soon as you can before january    sunday  it is a gift for my daugther and it is not complete       
159,4.0 ,                       not bad     
160,5.0 ,                       everything was as in the description of the device  traces of use are negligible  i recommend the seller      
161,2.0 ,                       it works but the screen already had a chip in it and it looked like there was some water damage when i opened the sim card slot  it works alright but it does glitch here   there      
162,5.0 ,                       the phone came in a couple of days late but it did snow pretty bad so it s as expected  i just received the phone this morning and so far no complaints  if i didn t know the phone was renewed i would ve thought it was brand new  no scratches cracks or anything  i received a charger  a block  a screen protector  and a really nice super protective clear case  the phone charges super fast i was in shock by how fast it was i want to say not even    mins and the phone was fully charged  i am  however  stuck trying to update the phone and it s taking some time but it s an update  i will update you soon about how the phones run but so far so good  i will upload pictures too  oh one more thing i would suggest a pop socket because the phones are a good size and with the case  it s definitely harder to use with one hand i think a pop socket would helpupdate   the speakers work great very loud  the camera quality     immaculate   i don t know what else to say besides this was a great buy i m very happy with my purchase and i think you would be too

166,5.0 ,                       awesome phone  i love it  thanks     
167,5.0 ,                       i was definitely nervous to order due to the couple of bad reviews but mine was totally worth it  not glitches or anything  works just like brand new  there were a few chips in the frame work but for getting it used i expected that  i m totally all for it  don t worry about the bad reviews this phone works excellently       
168,4.0 ,                       i really do love the phone  i haven t had any issues with it so far  the only thing that is kind of  messed  up would be if you turn the volume super loud it kind of gets staticky      
169,4.0 ,                       i had mine doubt about buying a iphone xr brought this in same price for se second generation work perfectly fine     
170,5.0 ,                       phone is exactly as i expected it to be  a few blemishes barely noticeable which is what comes with a renewed phone  the battery life is like     but i still get about    hours before needing a charge  portrait mode doesn t work on the front camera   face id doesn t work at all  but it s an upgrade from my  s   i have no regrets  the quality   the price match of you ask me  i still feel like i got a steal      
171,5.0 ,                       was very iffy about ordering one from the negative reviews  im glad i did its perfect flawless came with the plastic still on it  battery health is      i love the phone already  deff would reccomend  im using on metro by t mobile     
172,5.0 ,                       my purchase was as described and i love it     
173,5.0 ,                       phone works good  looks brand new this is my first i phone so idk how i feel about it in that way yet but other then that great phone works with cricket that s what i m using     
174,5.0 ,                       i love this new iphone xr coral color is beautiful and size fits perfect in my hand      
175,5.0 ,                       received my phone today and was completely as described  a    no scratches or dents  phone is practically brand new  great buy    if you want this get it  i actually like my new xr better than my xs max        
176,4.0 ,                       overall phone works great  came in great condition with battery life at       looks and feels like net the only downside is  that it didn t come with the original charger  but that s an easy problem to solve      
177,5.0 ,                       i recommend getting this phone  it works  it also comes with a case  screen protector  and a charger but no headphones  i regret getting it in white  if you really want it in a color just spend the extra couple of dollars it s seller for  if that s the case   no scratches  smudges  or smears  i m not really good at making these reviews  so i hope this helps      
178,3.0 ,                       the battery is not quite all that good like it was described in the add but over all the phone is nice battery just sucks     
179,1.0 ,                       the seller stated that this phone was fully unlocked and it is not   we are in the process of switching providers and this phone is not compatible   we only purchased this phone in april of this year   we have contacted the seller twice and have yet to hear back   poor customer service for a large purchase      
180,2.0 ,                       i ordered and purchased a coral iphone and got black    the only reason i got the iphone from here was because of the color that s it  the phone itself has the gbs i wanted it is the right phone xr  the charger is nice good quality but the color unacceptable     
181,5.0 ,                       great phone  a quality apple product that we have all come to expect with the iphone  can t beat the quality of apple s touch screen and screen quality  highly recommended      
182,5.0 ,                       i was kind of nervous to spend      on a refurbished phone  i was wrong  i got the iphone xr in black  and it came in nearly perfect condition   it came with a charger as well  the battery life has made a huge advancement  even from just the iphone x  the camera quality is awesome  and overall i rate it a      worth every penny      
183,2.0 ,                       for the amount of money being paid for these devices on amazon for a little more you can get a fully refurb from apple this device arrived scuffed and screen scratched  caution when buying everyone     
184,5.0 ,                       iam surprise  very new like brand new phone  so happy  choice amazon company  thank you     
185,5.0 ,                       i was very hesitant to purchase a renewed iphone but i am so glad that i did  this was my first time purchasing a renewed phone and its basically like brand new  the phone only had very minor scratches on the apple logo on the back of the phone that is not even noticeable  the screen did not have any scratches  the touch screen  camera and face id is working perfectly well so far  phone came with     battery health  i had no issues with inserting my sim card  it connected to my network right away  i will definitely purchase renewed phones in the future      
186,5.0 ,                       at first i was skeptical about purchasing this but i needed an upgrade from an iphone   and i can tell you this phone is it  there were no visible scratches and it came the day before the estimated delivery date  i can say i m very please with this order      
187,3.0 ,                       i got this phone for my boyfriend  as he needed a new one  it came in nice packaging  charging cable and block  the camera was a little scratched and the speakers are busted  it doesn t bother him so it s okay  but i wish it had been better considering i paid a high price for it      
188,5.0 ,                       very happy in all aspects  even quick delivery at the holidays as this was a gift  recipient of the gift tells me everyday what a great phone it is       
189,4.0 ,                       phone is what i expected it to be  a couple of dings and chips on the edges but the screen doesn t have a scratch on it and the back of the phone looks okay too  overall         
190,1.0 ,                       do not buy this product  i bought this phone and when i got it the microphone did not work  i contacted seller and they replied once but never again  i ve emailed them three times with zero response to replace item  worst customer service     
191,5.0 ,                       very good  i recommend     
192,5.0 ,                       outstanding quality  i was really nervous buying this from amazon  but so far no issues  like new and a great buy      
193,5.0 ,                       was delivered on time  you can t tell that this device wasn t new cause i think it is         battery life and it runs smoothly   no complains      
194,5.0 ,                       received faster than excepted  within   days  no scratches  looks brand new   very pleased      
195,4.0 ,                       so my wife was in the market for a new iphone  upgrading from her iphone    which was now obsolete according to several required apps she uses for work  i couldn t bring myself to pay apple     dollars or more for a new basic phone  i tried to get my wife to agree to an android and that wasn t going to happen  then i found these amazon renewed phones  i wound up saving about     dollars on an almost new iphone xr the phone was delivered when it said it would be delivered and does appear as new as possible  less the original packaging and equipment  the box was a repackage box  the power adapter was an unknown usb wall charger and the cable was a lightning cable although it had a crack in the lightning plug housing so it will last about a week the migration from old phone to new phone took about an hour  with an ios upgrade in for good measure  this phone came with      and      has been out for only a few weeks so it is close to current  overall  happy about the phone  time will tell if i run into issues with it lasting but so far all is good      
196,5.0 ,                       i have had this for a couple months now and i have absolutely no complaints  the battery came at      functionality and it looked brand new  i definitely recommend a screen protector especially if you drop your phone frequently  i am on my second screen protector  i don t have a protective case and again  i drop my phone a lot but the back hasn t cracked at all  i say get whatever case you want and get some good quality screen protectors and you should be set      
197,5.0 ,                       the phone is absolutely amazing  the battery life went down one percent since i had it but that s fine  it also came with free apple care  no scratches no marks      
198,2.0 ,                       battery life is terrible and the speaker does not work  this is a renewed iphone that was definitely dropped several times and water damaged but then still sold to me to        could have just bought a brand new one from apple for           
199,3.0 ,                       battery isn t great but everything else is perfect     
200,4.0 ,                       no complaints     
201,5.0 ,                       i have used this phone for over a month and i m very satisfied with it   it had very few marks on it  i put a clear cover on it and it s like a new phone  it works great and i m happy  saved lots of money      
202,5.0 ,                       this phone was better than expected  it looked very close to new  the battery condition showed in the     range   the phone works with my provider as promised

204,5.0 ,                       great upgrade from iphone    replacement phone lots of snapchat and youtube usage  great quality      
205,5.0 ,                       i am always a little nervous when buying a used or refurbed phone  this phone has turned out to be great  i ordered it about a month ago and it has been going strong since  no issues with hardware  battery  or any part of its operation  love it      
206,5.0 ,                       like others  i was a bit hesitant to purchase because of some reviews however  i received my phone yesterday and not only did it come in the original box  it came with a brand new apple charger and headphones  it says in the description that headphones are not included so this was a nice surprise  but wait  it gets better  this phone is still under warranty until this coming december   the battery life is       the screen and body are in mint condition  and all internal workings seem to be in working order  very excited  would recommend     
207,1.0 ,                       this is the phone i purchased for my granddaughter and it wasn t unlocked  it was still under contract with sprint and sprint said it was reported stolen  now just sent it back  sending emails but no response      
208,5.0 ,                       came perfect     
209,5.0 ,                       phone was good  its good deal  little bit unhappy with speaker

211,5.0 ,                       i love this phone  i received this january          this phone has been great to me  there is a tiny little scratch on the screen but u can t barely see it and with a screen protector on it it disappears  it came with     battery capacity  it works great not a single problem with it hopefully it stays that way  the seller i bought it from was amazing and i highly recommend u buy this phone      
212,5.0 ,                       iphone came in like new nothing wrong with it from what i could see and playing games and making phone calls and so on nothing to complain about  really nice

214,5.0 ,                       got a red renewed    gb xr   cpocell   was the seller i got it from  phone is in perfect condition  an amazing upgrade from my    year old iphone  s  the battery life was at      which i was very pleased with because in the description it said batteries could work at     capacity on arrival  i will totally consider buying the amazon renewed iphones again in the future when i need my next upgrade  can t tell a difference from a brand new iphone from the apple store compared to this refurbished one  the ones from there with the same storage run you      and mine with tax came to just under       i saved about      on this which is definitely worth it to me note  it comes with a stock charger  not apple  which i don t mind because it works fine and no included headphones  but that was stated in the product description so it s a non issue i will update the review if there are any issues      
215,4.0 ,                       i was skeptical ordering this from amazon but overall the phone is great  my only issue is my  phone arrived with minor scratches on the screen  besides that the phone works like new     
216,5.0 ,                       i got the fully unlocked blue iphone xr  it is in pristine condition  this is my first  renewed  pone but i would definitely go for it again  it comes with all accesories in like new condition and it is in fact fully unlocked  i travel a lot for work and have used it all over the world with different providers with no problema whatsoever  it does not come in a factory box so just be aware  it comes in a similar box labeled amazon renewed so think about it if this is important to you  in my case  i gave it a shot and i am truly impressed  look no further      
217,5.0 ,                       the phone came in excellent condition  no dents or scratches   it came with a generic iphone charger works well  and an iphone box to connect the usb  i m happy with my purchase  and it s exactly as advertised  i ordered my phone on a wednesday and it came friday morning  super fast standard shipping     
218,3.0 ,                       vino con pinceles de la pantalla da adosquie cubre la garant a y que debo hacer     
219,2.0 ,                       disappointed to open it and see scratches all over the screen  it doesn t take much to notice a scratched screen  not sure if the phone has been renewed at all      
220,1.0 ,                       the description say it s fully unlocked but it was not  in fact the seller had absolutely no rights to sell the phone  it is still under contract with sprint  when i put my sim card in the phone it locked it  could not use the phone at all so i am sending it back  so pissed off      
221,5.0 ,                       i m in love with my new phone  obviously looks exactly as pictured with the exception of a few minor dents  but functions beautifully   came with charger and box

226,5.0 ,                       i decided to purchase two of these phones as gifts and i was very impressed  i could not believe these phones were used  they had no scratches and were in immaculate condition      
227,5.0 ,                       i like this product  everything looks great and the seller included a case and a screen protector for free  i really loved it and recommend anyone to check with this seller when you need something to shop online      
228,5.0 ,                       all i like to said is that please fix the battery life issue  otherwise it is a very good product i love it i haven t had a problem yet it just the battery life that doesn t last alot      
229,5.0 ,                       i was skeptical about buying a phone online  especially with having it shipped  i ve had it for a few months now with no problems at all  no scratches  cracks  etc  not only does it look like a brand new phone  but it works like one as well      
230,5.0 ,                       i use this iphone every day  it lasts me almost    hours of medium use  though that is with the brightness at    and screen curtain enabled as a voice over user  it works very nicely  i love the size of it and it was a very drastic jump from my old iphone se      
231,5.0 ,                       i got the phone unexpectedly early than the expected date should be delivered  i have the iphone red   gb and the battery is full       no scratches and very good condition  it s like a brand new phone  gosh  this is amazing  you can ask me if you guys have questions  here s my email angelasoriano     gmail comgonna update this review soon or after a month  depends of the phone performance but it was really cool that it s still new  thumbs up for this      
232,3.0 ,                       it took only a few weeks for the phone to mess up and i took care of this phone like it was my child  the phone would glitch out here and there and then shut off randomly after being fully charged and ever now and then when my phone is charging at night i will wake up while it s on the charger and it s completely shut down  the phone it s worth what i expected tho everything else is in good condition just expected more from a billion dollar company  and would like a refund just enough to fix the port even half idc  because i got my carrier on the phone and all my personal info and everything and don t want to send it back  i have been proud with most of the things i have gotten from amazon and even the phone but using it in time disappointed me and i m slowly losing my trust about buying things from them     
233,1.0 ,                       not happy at all i ordered the red cell   and got a black one this also was very late bad for business     
234,5.0 ,                       this phone arrived in like new condition with all accessories included  set up and transfer from my older iphone went quickly  i put in the simm card from my old phone and was up and running  my phone slipped and dropped on my kitchen floor  it looked like it chipped the corner of the screen  i found out later  it was just the screen protector that was damaged  the phone was ok  some   piece cases may not fit properly because of the thickness of the screen protector  not a big deal      
235,5.0 ,                       this iphone xr is literally amazinggg   the reviews i read were all wrong by a lot   this phone stands out by a lot and it s absolutely perfect   the response time   the screen resolution   just everything is amazing   don t think about it just buy it     it comes with an adapter   charger   screen protector    a free clear case   and it came within a week without problems   if i were you i would      recommend buying this phone without any hesitation        brought from chubbiestech      
236,5.0 ,                       when i opened the box i thought there was a mistake this was a brand new phone  many weeks later a noticed an extremely small scratch but aside from that everything was great      
237,5.0 ,                       it was in near perfect condition   a very minimal scuff in the top right corner but something you can t when the screen is on  no scratches or dents  i popped my sim right in and it worked immediately  no issues here  i will update before my    day warranty is up if anything happens but everything is looking perfect so far         
238,5.0 ,                       this phone is in good condition  worth the price     
239,4.0 ,                       loved everything but there were a few nicks on the side of the phone  not on the screen but around it  i used a sharpie to hide it but still         
240,5.0 ,                       i love this iphone  it looks and works like brand new  no scratch and any flaws i could find for a meticulous person like me i was hesitant to buy a used iphone  it s my  st time to try a used one  and this phone didn t gave me disappointment    thumbs up  love it      
241,5.0 ,                       it s great  this is my first iphone  great phone  battery health at     but it last me all day  the camera is great and face id is super fast  thanks so much      
242,2.0 ,                       i bought this phone for my daughter to replace her iphone     she takes a lot of pictures  so i wanted a phone with a lot of memory   this one is advertised as having    gb   the phone delivered only has    gb   unfortunately  i discovered this only after i transferred all the data over from her old phone which was on it s last legs   other than the memory issue  she loves the new phone      
243,3.0 ,                       i bought this phone in december       about   months ago  for the most part it works well but the touch screen is a little glitchy  the camera doesn t work properly  it freezes after taking   picture  i have to press the side button to lock the screen  and then the camera works  lately  i can t slide down to see the notification bar or to see the control center      
244,4.0 ,                       i like how they were upfront and honest about possible scratches on the phone  my phone came in and it is in great condition  battery life is good and works really well  one thing that did bug me was the scratches around the back camera  but they did warn me beforehand      
245,4.0 ,                       update since  only problem  i found so far is the speaker only muffles and can only hear calls if using a head phonelove the phone just got mines will update in a month time  one problem i found is that the ringtone doesn t play out loud so i end up missing calls still trying to figure out why its doing that  no scratches battery life is          
246,5.0 ,                       the camera is okay  but great product overall      
247,5.0 ,                       i am screaming with excitement   the charger it came with it bomb and charges faster than my actually apple charger   phone was really brand new not one mark on it and the storage is all there i got     gb for     more and it was worth it   smooth screen and great specs   camera is perfect and on key with adjusting to different lighting   crisp finish   love this phone all around so glad i bought it deff worth the price       
248,5.0 ,                       phone came in great condition   and unlocked no issues  everything works perfectly     
249,5.0 ,                       great product  it s not in perfect condition as stated but it s near perfect  camera area has a few scratches paint that isn t worth fussing about and a very teeny tiny scratch on the screen by the front camera  battery is at     so no issues there either  buttons feel new as well  seems to be running fine  no hitches or glitches so far  overall  this is worthy of   stars      
250,5.0 ,                       it s a great phone  works for boost  super easy to get hooked up  cam in good condition      
251,4.0 ,                       i had ordered a black phone and received this blue one    the phone was over all in ok condition  it had some scratches and it had powder like stuff all of it which was a bit weird but it wasn t as noticeable and with a good clean it was ok  the battery life wasn t bad it came at      decided to keep the phone because i don t have time to be returning      
252,1.0 ,                       the touchscreen did not work on a portion of the screen  so when trying to set up phone   nothing on the right worked  some minor scratches on screen but that was expected for a refurbished model  back it went bought a new xr and love the phone  unfortunately the refurb was a no go      
253,5.0 ,                       no scratches no dents got it on time right color right phone amazing     
254,5.0 ,                       looks just about brand new  no problems so far  would recomend     
255,5.0 ,                       this phone came quick  it appears to be in good shape  we just got it turned on yesterday  so far so good       
256,5.0 ,                       the battery will last for two days     
257,5.0 ,                       the phone arrived as it shoudl  very good quality  battery life is new  it has a little scratch on the screen and something weird on the screen but apart from that the phone is great  i totally recomend      
258,2.0 ,                       not professionally cleaned and comes with visible scratches  there was some dirt around the camera you should spend      more and get a new phone experience  you shouldn t pay       for something that has dirt on it      
259,5.0 ,                       i was super nervous buying a phone off amazon  but this phone works great  there s little marks that are hardly notice able  personally doesn t bother me  very pleased     
260,5.0 ,                       literally order this on thursday and received on friday  amazing customer service  came with screen protector and charger  perfect condition    will definitely be ordering from here again      
261,1.0 ,                       devolvimos el producto     
262,1.0 ,                       when i first got this phone  i wanted to like it so bad  at first it was fine  but every time i dropped it  even   ft drop onto carpet   it would shut down and was unresponsive  i have to manually restart it every time it falls and sometimes just when i m holding it or when it s in my back pocket  everything else about this phone is great  but this happens so often during the day i just can t ignore it  i dropped it earlier and it cracked  i m sad  and ever since  the regular touch screen goes through unresponsive phases  also    mins ago  it totally glitched out with static on the screen and now won t restart at all  i am sad to say i want to send it back and hopefully i ll get another one that works better  i just want my data back though       
263,5.0 ,                       if you ve become accustomed to the red dot  well too bad  with this amazing iphone   xr  you don t get one  but  you do get a beautiful iphone with so many bells and whistles this quarantine will be a breeze   i love my brand new phone   kc  i am sure the camera is great  i still have to play with it      
264,1.0 ,                       these renewed phones are a bit of a gamble  you either get a perfect one  or you get a defective one  this is the last time i ll be ordering any renewed phone  i received it and it was packed well  looked good all up until i made a phone call and realized the top speaker didn t work  tried a few workarounds to no avail  returned within    minutes of opening it  all i can say is good luck  it s a risk and i hope you get a good one         
265,5.0 ,                       the phone is perfect literally like if i bought it from the apple store  only thing is battery life doesn t come      comes around        which is okay consider the condition and functionality of the phone  i would recommend this product to anyone      
266,5.0 ,                       i got for my wife and she loves it     
267,4.0 ,                       i ordered this phone when mine broke  and didn t read any reviews  which was a dumb move on my part of course   i read the reviews two days later and was getting very nervous about how it was going to be  i trusted amazon renewed  and i must say  i wasn t disappointed  my phone didn t have a scratch on it at all whatsoever  and works completely fine  the only problem or concern i have is that the battery is at      but that s what you can expect from a refurbished phone  mine is from the seller   electronic deals       
268,5.0 ,                       got this for my    year old and she s in love  other than the charger port being barely bent  and one minor scratch  it s perfect      
269,5.0 ,                       upgraded from an iphone  s so the difference was there  the iphone does everything i need it to and it has a long lasting battery life      
270,1.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          the iphone works well  buti the screen was very scratched in the front and  back  i have bought renewed phones before  and they come in a better shape    but well  check the video and see for yourself      
271,5.0 ,                       the phone arrived with not visible damage and i m pleased with it  it basically is a new phone     
272,4.0 ,                       i thought everything was basically perfect the only thing is it won t let me download the youtube app onto my phone  i even spoke with apple support and went through every which way to try and let me download it but it still wouldn t let me  im not sure if it s because i bought its renewed or off of amazon    i honestly don t really understand exactly what the problem is because it will let me download any other app  it s alright though i guess i can just watch youtube off of safari  but yeah basically that was the one and only problem i found with the product other than that it s great      
273,1.0 ,                       back was cracked in several places  screen severely scratched  phone locked so unable to immediately see if it works  spent over      would not recommend      
274,5.0 ,                       the best option for phones    if you are not a tech  i gotta have the newest toys person  this is clearly the way to go by far    phone looks and operates perfectly    if i didn t know it was renewed  you can t tell the difference between new and this one    phone is awesome  upgraded from an iphone    that was having issues        
275,4.0 ,                       i was really scared about getting a damaged product   i read the reviews everyday until it came   shipping was fast and the package came   day early    battery was at     i was hoping    or higher but that s alright    for me  i did have some scuffs at the top of the phone tho and near the charging port   the what bands on the side also look a little dingy   my seller was chubbiestech   and they gave me a free screen protector and case      
276,5.0 ,                       this was a present for my daughter  she loves the phone     
277,5.0 ,                       works perfectly for a great price  does have a dead pixel spot  but barely noticeable and we ll worth the cost savings  it did take awhile to get here      
278,4.0 ,                       just got my unlocked iphone today and it came earlier than expected  was package nicely   so far everything works perfectly  there were a couple of dents on the corners but for a used phone it s expected  it s brand new to me and doesn t bother me  the screen was perfect   they even sent the sim card key to make things easier   love it       
279,5.0 ,                       i have gotten them twice and they are always in perfect condition always fast no glitches and always in great condition on the outside   buy it buy it     
280,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          i lovvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeee my phone      it is got here and i set it up  it s n excellent condition im so press  finally upgraded from a   also it arrived very quickly i just ordered it a couple days ago so definitely   stars from me so far  i was skeptical but i m soooooo happy thank youuuuu        
281,5.0 ,                       i loved this phone so much   it took a little bit longer to get here due to weather delays and such but the seller didn t stop trying to help me until i received it       
282,2.0 ,                       i am having problems with making phone calls because the number don t always work  sometimes i have to press a number   times before i actually get the number      
283,4.0 ,                       haven t used face recognition     
284,1.0 ,                       iphone was locked even though it said it was unlocked  was not able to use it      
285,5.0 ,                       so far the phone works really good  except the battery life isn t what i thought it would be  but other than that  phone looked new and i m happy for the purchase     
286,3.0 ,                       i dont like the fact that the camera lens was scraped   very dissatisfied with that  that was the biggest issue  everything else i loved      batter life though      
287,5.0 ,                       absolutely  a great phone  super fast battery life is phenomenal  easy to use and flawless appearance       
288,5.0 ,                       no problems at all from purchase to activation  flawless      
289,5.0 ,                       seller was very accommodating on request for refund  phone wasn t the right one for us  but seller was great      
290,5.0 ,                       nothing wrong with it came like it was new definitely invest for how much it is     
291,2.0 ,                       cheap because we are getting out of debt but the video quality is terrible  wouldn t suggest     
292,5.0 ,                       bought it for a fami member to upgrade them from their  s  phone works with no hassle so i m cool with that  delivery took a little while tho but that s possibly due to the christmas rush      
293,5.0 ,                       i ve had this phone for a little over a month now and i must say that it is absolutely worth every penny  i was weary at first  because it s usually hit or miss with refurbishes  but this one really works  my battery health is still at       camera quality is great  there are no scratches or dings  and call quality is great  i have at t so it was super simple to switch phone with my sim card  i would definitely recommend this phone      
294,5.0 ,                       received in like new condition  really nice     
295,5.0 ,                       i ordered   iphone xr s and they came a day early  both are in like new condition  one of the xr s came with a very  very small scratch at the upper left corner of the phone  but other than that  i m totally satisfied  they even came with screen protectors  i was using an iphone   and   before and the upgrades was long overdue  i m always hesitant when it comes to purchasing things online  but was relieved when everything came as advertised  will buy from this seller again      
296,5.0 ,                       very please with this phone

298,5.0 ,                       the phone came like new and fully unlocked just one small scratch on the side but we do not mind it at all it s awsome      
299,5.0 ,                       i order this phone just taking a risk not knowing how the phone will come or if i would even get the correct thing  the reviews was all over the place but this was an amazing buy      
300,5.0 ,                       my daughter saved her money to buy a new phone  she couldn t afford one from verizon so we took a chance on amazon   it was like brand new when it arrived      
301,5.0 ,                       definitely   i just sent the link to my friend   i would upload pictures but lmao i don t have a phone to take them   but yesssss    it s real battery life was     i haven t had noooo problems and i ve had it for months    love it        
302,5.0 ,                       was very skeptical but it all turned out alright   if you re contemplating getting this   go ahead     i just got my iphone xr today and everything is good so far      the phone came in without a scratch or crack     the seller sent in a charger as well     it looked brand new tbh     i absolutely love the color and the camera     will keep you guys updated if anything occurs    just so you know   i ordered from the seller  chubbies tech  cause i ve seen many phones with these same reviews which confused me          
303,5.0 ,                       i have had my phone for about   month  and in this   month i have had no problems  phone came in perfect condition not a single scratch on anything  battery health was at     was expecting way lower  if you are looking for a new phone i highly recommend getting from here     
304,5.0 ,                       excellent condition   working great    nd refurbished phone purchased here    stars     
305,5.0 ,                       love it and came a day early     
306,1.0 ,                       i received what seemed to be an iphone xr in perfect condition after i went through the hassle of activating my phone i discovered the speaker on the phone is broken  when i make a phone call all the other person can hear is loud static  worst purchase i ve ever made  very disappointed     
307,4.0 ,                       i like that the phone came really well packaged  it did not have a scratch on it  it  powered up just fine easy setup with my apple account but unfortunately the earpiece speaker did not work  i was so disappointed  i did just love the phone except for thatgot in touch with the seller and they agreed to take it back with no problems it took a few days for it to get returned and get my   back for that was okay  i would not hesitate to buy from this seller again      
308,5.0 ,                       just wanted to share my experience buy the used iphone xr off of amazon  as for the body and screen of the phone  the screen and back are absolutely fantastic and the only noticeable damage is two tiny nicks on the aluminum side which i have to look really hard to see  the battery health is at      so i m really happy  i did read some mixed reviews but i m sure it depends on the seller you get it from  it did come with an off brand charger and no headphones but it did come with a decent clear case with no brand which is nice because i didn t order a case i wanted to go in a store or try out a few first and this will keep it safe until then  the seller was chubbiestech as well so just wanted to let you guys know that  super happy      
309,5.0 ,                       i love that the iphone is in really good condition and it came a day early which made me very happy     
310,5.0 ,                       everything turned out alright it was like new you only get the phone and charger so i wouldn t recommend this is if you want the apple experience with original box and everything but if you don t care about all that then save some money and buy this but also think about the is purchase because it is still a lot of money     
311,5.0 ,                       the phone came quickly  it was packaged securely and came with a screen protector  block  and charging cable  all the buttons work and the battery life is great  the phone looks basically new except for a couple of scratches by the charging port  which are barely visible   the camera does not make the clicking noise  i will say buying a phone on amazon is kinda hit or miss but i personally had a great experience      
312,4.0 ,                       great product and yes    it s fully unlocked  decided to upgrade and take a chance on getting this upgrade from my  s  had my doubts but got a great product with very little cosmetic scratches  it s was easy to switch over and came with easy to use instructions        
313,4.0 ,                       i bought this because i needed a new phone and the xr was perfect  mobilespree was a good seller because the device looked brand new with no scratches on either side of the phone  however one thing i noticed was that the phone was full of gunk around the edges and both speakers  but i just cleaned it off with sanitized wipes and rubbing alcohol with q tips for the speakers  the battery health was at     which was better than what i expected but i expected at least      since i ve had other phones arrive with a new battery      
314,5.0 ,                       i love this phone  this is a return to the iphone world for me from a five year absence  so i m happy with the iphone xr as my device of choice  the battery life is great  the color is so beautiful  the touchscreen is great  the durability of the screen is above excellent  i dropped it by accident and it landed face down and didn t even crack  and it fell pretty hard on a vinyl floor tile so that speaks to its durability  can t say enough about this phone      
315,5.0 ,                       i love my new iphone came in a beautiful iphone box with original charger and plug and my iphone was literally brand new no defects or scratches on screen i love it thanks bro     
316,5.0 ,                       received the iphone xr   gb a week ago  battery is       phone looks brand new  i got it from tech exchangee      
317,5.0 ,                       i upgraded from an se  so this thing seems luxurious  love the facial recognition and swiping instead of the home button      
318,5.0 ,                       purchase as a gift for my granddaughter   she loves it and it works perfect   she s a previous iphone   user and raves about everything she can do with this phone   the camera takes phenomenal pictures the phone has no physical defects   happy with purchase      
319,2.0 ,                       my phone showed up good no cracks some scratches but that s what you d expect from a used phone  i noticed that the top speaker is really quiet and compared it to another xr and there was a huge difference  they are really nice for including hands sanitizer but the phone was not great for what i paid      
320,5.0 ,                       love it  for being a used phone it works like new  thanks     
321,5.0 ,                       after seeing a lot of upset customers on here  i was hesitant to buy a refurbished phone   i was wrong     this phone looks brand new  not a scratch on it  works perfectly   i have zero complaints     if you re on the fence  don t be   i received mine from chubbies tech and would not hesitate to buy one again   this is my new way of buying phones instead of paying full price     
322,5.0 ,                       the seller was terrific and package arrived promptly  phone was well packaged and i m happy with it      
323,5.0 ,                       the xr phone arrived a few days early  it came with a new power cord  no sim card  there was a       number included if you had any problems or questions  the phone had no visible scratches and looks like a brand new phone  the battery stays up a long time and holds an excellent charge  i would definitely buy another phone from synergy smart phones      
324,5.0 ,                       excelente compra     
325,4.0 ,                       the phone was in great   condition like it was brand new  the charger wasn t so great and no earphones  but the phone was great i was a little skeptical when ordering it but it s a great product and i m happy       
326,5.0 ,                       i m so happy about this phone  i was so scared about getting it but it s so nice  very very happy  i don t think that the camera is as good at it could be  but its still very great      
327,4.0 ,                       unfortunately i had to return it because it had network issues  all the troubleshooting recommendations didn t fix the issue  it would work fine through bluetooth but using it as an actual phone didn t work however amazon woot accepted it back and send a full refund      
328,1.0 ,                       after owning this phone for   months paid      for it  it is basically a paperweight now  it was fine from april      up until december      then it said it needed a cellular update  every time i tried to do that update it wouldn t work  only allowing the phone to work on wifi  after being frustrated with this for over a month i decided to update via itunes  this did not work either so i made an appointment with apple  when i took it to them they said the phone was not repairable  they couldn t even look up the serial number  it was like it didn t exist i d stay far away  unless you only need a phone for less than  months     
329,5.0 ,                       this phone as a refurbished purchase is a fantastic phone so easy to activate by my iphone   sim card no store visit just icloud   ur sim in the comforts of your home  me   my gf got   xr s delivered today  thank u for exactly what u advertised  what a great update with a    ios system      
330,4.0 ,                       theres a pretty heavy lag when using the camera to take pictures or videos  when you take pictures just expect them to be taken a second or so after you press the button      
331,5.0 ,                       whooo love the battery on this thing  lasts all day     i can recommend using yootech as a wireless charger i think this iphone is as big as the iphone  s plus    speaker are            
332,1.0 ,                       buyers beware pretty phone doesn t work for long before it overheats never deal with these people again     
333,5.0 ,                       if you add the original box  you don t even notice this is a renewed phone  super clean      
334,5.0 ,                       good phone  even isn t brand new  but no major cracks      
335,5.0 ,                       surprisingly great  was concerned buying a  renewed  phone as i never had but luckily all was good  and it was unlocked so everything is great     
336,5.0 ,                       was a bit skeptical but it s legit and came in mint condition only bad part was it is unlocked but won t let you have boost mobile as your carrier which was odd to me  but takes all other carriers        
337,1.0 ,                       the appearance of the phone was really good  but it was not operational  even the box it came in said it had network connection problems  so why would you sell a phone that can not be used on any network  and for       makes no sense to me and it makes no sense how amazon hasnt shut down your operation  you take people s money knowing your products aren t any good and then we have to wait for ever to get our hard earned money returned to us      
338,5.0 ,                       happy with my new phone  i backed up my old one to the cloud and then synced the new one with all my data once it got here  functions perfectly and battery life appears to be good as new      
339,5.0 ,                       muy bueno y en s per condiciones     
340,5.0 ,                       just like new  amazing battery and performance      
341,5.0 ,                       not scratched or cracked   looks really good   battery life guaranteed greater than      was     after got xr charged and up and running    that is reason i rated battery life at   stars   it was as advertised  but with a purchase of this price  i am grading it based on value and i really wanted at least       paying for  renewed premium  would only guaranteed     minimum though   for a  renewed  product  happy with purchase  but this is only day two of use        
342,1.0 ,                       the phone is locked   i spent   hours yesterday visiting my carrier and best buy   i swapped sim cards but even the t mobile imei site checker says it s blocked   i wrote the seller  kanga  to return it and    hours later i get a response that it s compatible with t mobile and to see them to connect   that s not the issue   they obviously didn t even read my email   i wrote back but i m sure it ll be tomorrow before i hear back   so frustrated       
343,5.0 ,                       phone was in perfect condition  the battery came in at         for the      i saved  i think    battery is a fair trade      
344,5.0 ,                       i was almost scared away by the bad reviews  but i m glad i ignored them  phone is in perfect condition  it didn t even have any cosmetic imperfections  which i wasn t expecting  i looked it up the imei number to make sure it wasn t stolen because a lot of reviews claimed theirs were  but it came back completely clean  works great with my carrier  no complaints      
345,5.0 ,                       first time buying used phone online  was nervous  but super glad that i did it  i love my phone  it looks brand new  works great and even came with case and screen protector   would buy again       
346,1.0 ,                       bad screen  burn pixels  not a serious seller     
347,5.0 ,                       excellent       
348,5.0 ,                       at first i was hesitant but i have absolutely no issues with the phone  the battery life was not at      but at a very good percentage      
349,5.0 ,                       i just got my phone like a week ago and i honestly love it basically came in brand new with like no scratches on the phone and with      battery life and it is truly unlocked      
350,5.0 ,                       very nice phone  very clean   as descibed  good price    i recommend this seller     
351,4.0 ,                       i must say this was my first time buying a refurbished phone and i was skeptical about it but i read reviews and many said they got nearly mint condition phones  so i bought it and they sent me a phone with plenty of scratches on the screen  i found that unacceptable and i contacted the seller  i returned that phone and they sent me a phone that s immaculate  i mean it might as well be brand new and the battery is perfect  i don t have to charge this battery more than once a day with moderate use  this is my first iphone as well and although there are some features i wish they had that were more like android i can now understand the iphone fanboys  the seller was so accommodating and i feel like i got a brand new phone for much cheaper than regular price  i wish i could give     instead of   stars and the only reason why i would deduct a half star is because they gave me a bad charger  because of that i can t give a   star review  sorry  but i used my samsung fast charger with the iphone cord and it charges fast now  other than that i highly recommend this seller      
352,3.0 ,                       the screen is very very scratched i m guessing that s why it came with a screen protector on it   after further inspection  it also has dents and scratches on the edges of the phone and back  and camera  i m a little surprised that this is amazon reviewed      
353,3.0 ,                       i was very hesitant to buy this product  but i took the risk because it was an amazon product  the cell phone took   extra day for delivery  it was brand new  or at least it looked like  the phone was perfect  clean imei and unlocked but apparently it was a verizon phone which is not compatible with tmobile network  i called the seller multiple times and did not replied to maybe change the product for one that worked for me but no luck  i submitted a request to returned it and they immediately replied and make things smooth      
354,2.0 ,                       the iphone xr is legit  however  when i got the phone  the phone like to turn off on it s own occasionally  it seems as if they tried to fix something  then messed something else up on the process  shouldn t buy unless you got extra money to get it fixed       
355,4.0 ,                       i bought two of these phones  one has a battery life of       the other just          
356,5.0 ,                       i searched through the reviews  after i already pulled the trigger  i was going to cancel my order because of the negative reviews   my phone arrived   days early  in excellent condition   i had one problem with getting it to update  it took   hours  it sat and spun and finally it downloaded   so far so great  i love this phone   if  i have any trouble i can send it back in    days  but it seems solid      
357,5.0 ,                       omg my best buy on amazon of all time     it was beautiful  immaculate  only wish they had one in white for verizon  but this hands down is perfect  no scratches  smooth setup to verizon  they hook you up with a free case and a temper glass that was a super surprise to me  and they were high quality accessories  it s a steal to be honest  thank you so much to this seller  xo     
358,5.0 ,                       i ordered a    gb iphone xr  i received the phone today the phone does show miner wear and tear the battery health is at     which is good and it s been working good so far      
359,5.0 ,                       i was a little nervous ordering this without being able to see it  it was supposed to be in good condition   but i must say i think it was in excellent condition  there was not a mark i could see on it  the battery life was at      so i was very pleased with that  the phone was totally unlocked so i had no problem getting it switched over to my provider      
360,1.0 ,                       phone is garbage for the amount of money spent for it  can t even  get it activated cause the sim is unable to be read  we tried several times even with the cellular provider  still nothing     
361,5.0 ,                       i love this phone so so much  looked hells sketch until i bought   making this review  on the phone actually  super nice and really big  kinda sad that it didn t come with headphones  but overall an absolute pleasure of a iphone             
362,5.0 ,                       there was not a single mark on the phone  looked brand new  preformed like brand new  in settings it said the battery was still      of when it was new  couldn t be happier     
363,5.0 ,                       so happy and in love with my new phone  i hadn t upgraded in awhile and needed this phone so much  it lasts all day and is easy to use      
364,5.0 ,                       i was iffy about purchasing this phone on amazon   but i m so happy i did   pretty much a brand new phone  activated with metro pcs with no problems   will definitely but something else from them   thanks guys      
365,5.0 ,                       not a scam  ordered this   delivery was super fast for having to travel across the united states  a lot of people don t realize refurbished phones don t come with original apple cord headphones or sim card  i thought that was obvious but looking at other reviews i guess not lol  comes with a very long  i believe    foot charger  and charging block  in perfect condition  unlocked  high recommend     
366,2.0 ,                       screen was pretty scratched up with one really deep scratch on the lower left side  another fairly deep scratch underneath the camera on the back side as well  i was hoping it was going to come in good condition as other reviews on here state their phones looked almost brand new with very little to no scratching      
367,1.0 ,                       it said it was supposed to be at t locked but was really cricket locked i guess they just didn t look into it the phone is great but they should have made sure that the phone was locked to the carrier i selected instead of a totally different one that s my only complaint      
368,5.0 ,                       my son is very happy with this phone  and i always want to say that amazon done amazing job on delivery  very fast and professional  i would definitely recommend this phone for any phone from amazon     
369,5.0 ,                       if you have the money this is the way to go  i bought myself a new iphone xr from at t and will end up paying almost     times more ordered this for my    year old and she s in love      
370,5.0 ,                       me switching from a   to a xr it s gonna take some getting used to but so far so good   great phone great quality  it was fully unlocked i popped my sim in and it instantly connected   well worth the money     
371,1.0 ,                       bought this phone for my son because the last one i brought from amazon something was wrong with the audio same thing with this one   i suggest buy a new one     
372,5.0 ,                       like screen size  battery life is much better than my  s      
373,5.0 ,                       for a refurbished iphone  when i received it  it might as well have been brand new  there were like   tiny tiny scuffs but that was it and who cares  the front camera though won t work and i have to reset the phone but that s about it  everything else works great and i had     battery health which is amazing  this was well worth the money vs buying a new xredit    nov     the camera issue has been resolved since this was posted  it seemed to resolve on its own after about a month of using the phone  it still works amazing      
374,5.0 ,                       great item not a single scratch  so happy with it that i bought my wife one too     
375,5.0 ,                       this is the  nd refurbished phone i ve gotten  the  st was from another seller and it it came in completely damaged  this one i m very impressed  it looks brand new  no visible signs of use or wear and tear  the quality is superb  extremely easy to switch to my provider  i simply popped out the sim card from my android and popped it into the iphone and bam all set to go in minutes  would definitely but again         
376,4.0 ,                       all my apps and data transferred easily but i still cannot use the phone because i can t get my number transferred to it via sim card   my old sim card is too big for the xr  i m still trying to figure out how to get my number transferred      
377,5.0 ,                       i love this phone  it looks brand new  the camera quality is great  the screen is perfect and i love the color  i ve been desperately in need of an upgrade and i m glad that i chose to order from this seller      
378,5.0 ,                       didn t come in original packaging or with headphones but the phone had no scratches or scuffs on it and it came with a charger      
379,5.0 ,                       i was pretty skeptical ordering from this seller but i do not regret it  best purchase by far  awesome quality   brand new   does not come in the original box but that didn t phase me   it does come with a charger         recommend     
380,4.0 ,                       great refurbished phone  was reluctant because of mixed comments about not working with verizon but gave it a shot anyway  worked fine for me  would have given   stars but missing accessories  which was advertised but i want it all lol        
381,4.0 ,                       overall  the iphone was in pretty good shape  but the screen had some defects  for example  the top piece has lots of light scratches on it  at first you don t really notice them  but if you look closely  you ll see all these scratches from who knows what at the top  secondly  there is a small white transparent dot on the middle left portion of the screen  like if some sort of heavy pressure was put on the screen itself  doesn t really bother me that much  but from time to time my eyes would catch a glimpse of the dot  other than that though  the phone itself runs really smooth  has a great battery life  i could use it almost a whole    hours without charging it  and it only takes       minutes to fully charge  overall  though the screen is not in perfect shape  the phone is extremely useful  smooth  convenient  and long lasting      
382,5.0 ,                       such a great price for a iphone my only problem was the camera is a little dinged up but that s to be expected with a used phone so all in all very happy with my purchase     
383,5.0 ,                       i ve been using this phone for about   weeks and i m so happy  i really wanted to upgrade from my iphone   but all the phones at apple were        i decided to try amazon renewed and i m so happy with my purchase  the phone i got is a beautiful blue color and the cameras are amazing  my phone came in pretty much perfect condition and the battery capability was at       the iphone xr is a great phone that speaks for itself and i m very please with buying it refurbished on amazon  such a great deal      
384,3.0 ,                       the phone looked great   a couple of surface scratches on the top right of the screen  but that s to be expected i guess with a used phone   i wasn t really concerned with those small issues  i transferred everything from my old phone and completely set up the new phone and everything was great   i was soooo excited and felt really great about my purchase      until i made a call   it wasn t until i had invested several hours into the new phone that i realized the ear speaker has a shattery sound and makes it difficult to hear the other person on the call   the speaker does technically work  but the voice sounds muffled and shattered  like an old busted car speaker   i really hate it because i like the phone and spent so much time setting everything up to be personalized to me   if i new the quality of the speaker before hand  i would have returned it immediately  but at this point i think i will just deal with it   i don t like change and it took me forever to upgrade from an iphone  s  crystal clear speaker btw  to the xr  and unfortunately it was just a bad experience because of the speaker issue   the phone is excellent other than this one issue  but a key feature of the a phone is to have conversations with others right   i needed this phone for my personal and business use  so i hope the speaker doesn t continue to degrade i m not sure how the company tests for sound quality and clarity  but i would encourage everyone if you decide to purchase a used phone  call someone on the phone first before personalizing it to you      
385,4.0 ,                       wasn t really sure about buying it but well  i could return it anyways if something dissatisfied me  so far  it s been good   phone battery lasts enough  screen works perfectly  except it got like frozen for a while but just restarted it and everything is good again      
386,5.0 ,                       absolutely perfect and flawless  i was weary about purchasing a renewed phone but it arrived fast  packaged well and looks and operates just like a new phone  purchase with confidence      
387,5.0 ,                             
388,5.0 ,                       fast shipping good packaging and great product     
389,5.0 ,                       the product came well packed  with barely visible scratches  the battery life was     which isn t bad at all  facetime and face id  work perfectly fine  the left bottom speaker doesn t work as well as the right bottom speaker but overall  it was worth the money      
390,5.0 ,                       i bought this phone to replace my old iphone   and it s perfect  the front and rear cameras are great  and the sound quality is excellent  it came in clean and looking brand new  i d recommend buying from this seller      
391,2.0 ,                       when i first got my iphone xr it was stunning and everything worked and it still does  however i live in the us and when i attempted to get it activated with a us service provider i kept running into problems  like i said before the phone was perfect and worked remarkably well  but turns out the phone was from the uk so i couldn t get it activated in the us  i hope this helped some of you out      
392,5.0 ,                       excellent quality i love it     
393,4.0 ,                       the speaker doesn t work well and the battery doesn t last long  not really worth the price      
394,5.0 ,                       i bought this for one of my children and they love it  we have not had any problems and it s exact like the other one i bought from apple      
395,3.0 ,                       brought two of these phones for both my mom and dad  my moms worked well but straight out the box  my dad had issues with the bluetooth  the range was about   feet before it disconnected   he decided to take it to the shop and figure out whats wrong and turns out the motherboard was messed up  currently working on returning the phone a week after buying it  just know there is an actual risk you are taking by buying this refurbished phone compared to a new one      
396,5.0 ,                       the iphone xr came in what appears to be new condition definitely looks brand new   i checked all around the phone throughly and i see no marks at all       satisfied  i got the black model      
397,1.0 ,                       the seller stated that this phone was unlocked  however  when i attempted to get service i was told by my provider that the phone was still registered to someone  therefore  i was unable to use the phone  though this was a huge inconvenience  i did receive a refund     
398,5.0 ,                       great item  i was looking for an iphone xr and stumbled across this renewed version  though it was  renewed   it basically was factory new and it works perfectly      
399,2.0 ,                       my son disliked the fact that the phone was chipped off in the bottom right hand corner after opening the pkg  however  he was happy it finally came in      
400,5.0 ,                       very good     
401,5.0 ,                       i wasn t worried  because of all the great reviews i read on here  my phone came within   days  excellent delivery speed  it comes with a really nice charger as well  i ve seen people give   star reviews because it doesn t come with headphones  but it says that it doesn t  so this is a heads up   no scratches at all         worth it     
402,1.0 ,                       i understand that with refurbished products there might be some cosmetic faults but the scratches on this device is really disappointing  shipped with some third party charger and no headphones in the box i m pretty i m going to return this one      
403,5.0 ,                       product came as described  in a generic box with a generic off brand charger  they mention this in the description somewhere so i wasn t necessarily disappointed  did not come with headphones though  phone works like new and it says it has     battery capacity  overall happy with my new phone      
404,5.0 ,                       i really loved the phone  but it had an issue with my carrier not wanting to work with it and it being stuck on some random signal  although  the phone didn t work for me  i absolutely loved how well the seller responded to me  and how they took care of the problem and approved my return  i will definitely recommend someone for you guys      
405,5.0 ,                       this phone came used and i could not believe how new it looked  it s an upgrade from the iphone   i had  way bigger and clearer screen  the phone even came with a protective case  guess i got lucky  i would recommend buying from here  it s a good price and was activated quickly      
406,5.0 ,                       bought a phone on amazon before  i was scammed out of my money on that one  this one i was skeptical  but  i m so happy i did    such an amazing phone      
407,3.0 ,                       i got this phone to hopefully be just as good as new  but no  it has times when it drops calls for no reason  exits from an app unexpectedly  will not allow for volume adjustment  and sometimes will not allow me to answer an incoming call  i didn t care that the air pods were not included  i knew from the product description and i already had some   i expected a scratch or two on the back glass  i use an otter box for drop protection anyway  so no big deal there either  i love the big screen and the high quality camera  it would have been perfect if the annoying little quirks did not happen so frequently      
408,5.0 ,                       i love the iphone very much   but when i got the box it was lacking a real charging port and the headphones    but other than that everything was great       
409,5.0 ,                       flawless condition very happy with this product     
410,5.0 ,                       seller was very friendly and understanding and resolved my issue within days   highly recommended     
411,4.0 ,                       awesome   no visible scratches   excellent  battery  life  as good as a new one      
412,2.0 ,                       really did not meet my expectation quality wise     
413,4.0 ,                       i love the phone the screen has a few scratches  super fast shipping     
414,1.0 ,                       this product did not work charger did not fit  and that s not even the worst of it  when tried to switch services from my old iphone the boost mobile technician checked and this phone still had an active sprint account so i could not activate the phone  and to make matters worse they charge a     dollar restock fee hilarious what is amazon doing i love amazon but this will change things      buyers do not make purchases from third party sellers  be careful            
415,5.0 ,                       the cosmetic appearance was almost flawless  on the back  there are tiny chips but almost invisible  the performance is flawless m  cannot tell the difference from a new one  i will be a persistent customer      
416,5.0 ,                       id say pay the extra money for premium it really makes you feel better about the purchase because let s be honest amazon refurbishment for iphones isn t the best and it backs you up through and through if your not satisfied and if there s any issues with the phone i basically got mine brand new but almost  it had     battery life but i had no issues with it     
417,2.0 ,                       beautiful phone but   could not get it microphone voice  to work after several hours of reboot blue tooth off on resets and sim card changes i upset everyone i tried to call as they could not hear me  no one at vendor to chat or help resolve  vendor returned emailed me after i already returned iphone   i worked with my phone service provider to check out sim card s  not there  no help available   i may have been unlucky but glad amazon returned product      
418,4.0 ,                       i loved everything about the phone   however it doesnt want to stay connected to my bluetooth earbuds   that part rly disappointed me but i am trying to find a way to fix it     
419,5.0 ,                       i absolutely love this phone it s works just fine and it didn t have and dumps or dints looks new and works great  it didn t come in a apple box or have an apple charger buts other then that live it     
420,5.0 ,                       i bought my phone the iphone xr for christmas  works great no problems with it at all   i purchased a second one for my other sons birthday   and we just got it yesterday looks brand new and works great   love it        
421,5.0 ,                       i haven t used the phone much yet  but i am very pleased with the product that i received   as far as i can tell  it s new  no difference  except for the generic charger and cable  but that was expected  seller merits the positive reviews update   i finally set up the phone   everything seems to work fine  but the speaker seems to be damaged   contacted the seller directly   will wait to see the the response   staying optimistic since the vendor got great ratings update  seller is great and the replacement phone is working like a new phone      
422,2.0 ,                       open the phone  not in an apple box  a knock off charger   box that don t work  the phone looks like someone slid it across asphalt  it s been stuck updating to ios        for about   hours now  not worth the money

434,1.0 ,                       this is completely frustrating to buy this phone as it is selled as refurbished and sold after apply warrenty is over  please be careful while buying this product  i would request amazon to stop sellers to sell these kind of products as it does not last for long and gives issues like heating  charging isssue and sometime phone is never poweres on       
435,4.0 ,                       excellent condition   not a single scratch  although  taking  a star off only because of battery life being at

447,2.0 ,                       iphone works fine as expected  but i didnt expect how bad it will look  the back glass has a lot of noticeable scratches and one is really big and thick  sad      
448,5.0 ,                       as described      
449,5.0 ,                       i love the color and quality of the phone  the seller was quick with the shipment and i have no complaints about the phone      
450,5.0 ,                       great phone fantastic shape     
451,5.0 ,                       i got the white fully unlocked iphone xr and it worked for xfinity mobile  i didn t think it was going to but it paired really easily  this phone is really nice and works really well  i would highly recommend it  the camera quality  battery life  and touch screen are amazing  this is not a scam  it also ships within a few hours and came all the way across the country within   days  i just ordered a second one      
452,5.0 ,                       going to buy another for my sister  this is a great product  especially for half the price  came with a charger and screen protector  whole it didn t include earpods that s stated in the product description  had very minor scratches and scuffs   at most  got a sim card and it had service within    minutes      
453,4.0 ,                       had it for a month  it is a good phone  it froze a few times after putting my information in and had to  download  my pictures when i clicked on them kinda weird  smooth fast keeps battery far better than my   or   did  feel like these phones are overpriced considering but it should last me a while      
454,5.0 ,                       i was very skeptical about purchasing this phone on amazon  but i m glad i did  the phone is like new  not one scratch  works great  no complaints the battery life is at     but that s fine      
455,5.0 ,                       came in a generic box and had both a generic charger and brick  phone back and front glass is pristine and a few corners have  a couple of scuffs  battery was at     pretty good buy but always remember it s a gamble     
456,5.0 ,                       it s been working fine     
457,2.0 ,                       screen was broken on the inside  no problem returning it  got my money back in just few days      
458,5.0 ,                       the iphone was great  it came with a clear case and a screen protector and a charger not from apple  but no headphones sadly  the battery capacity was     which is good in my opinion  the face id works like a charm  no scratches on the screen  back glass  camera  or the aluminum frame  this might be risky but with a seller like chubbiestech  they don t disappoint  at this price point  this is a great buy this year      
459,5.0 ,                       works well     
460,5.0 ,                       very minor scratches  almost looks brand new   very happy with purchase   phone functions as new and i had no problem connecting with my carrier   i ve purchased   iphones xrs in the last   months  both of them refurbished and i m very glad i did   rather than buying brand new     
461,5.0 ,                       it came early and is just like new  would order again  than you     
462,5.0 ,                       el telefono esta impecable  me asuste un poco al recibirlo ya que el paquete estaba abierto y el repartidor de dhl dijo que estaba as   grave la caja cuando la recib  y luego al abrirla  por suerte el telefono estaba intacto      
463,5.0 ,                       by far have no problems everything is running smoothly and i love the phone and was very scared to waste my money but it turned out great     
464,5.0 ,                       dope     
465,5.0 ,                       my son recognized that this phone has served him well  wanted the exact same phone when his became inoperable   loves it  just like new and wasn t      dollars  get one if you don t need to compete with the jones      
466,5.0 ,                       this was the easiest phone setup ever  transferred data from an old  s using bluetooth and put the sim card from the  s in the xr and everything worked perfectly      
467,5.0 ,                       i was so hesitant to buy a used phone on amazon   i ve always purchased brand new from apple because i m so picky about the quality of items   i decided to take a gamble on this and i m so glad i did   the phone is exactly as described  works perfectly and the condition is a solid     out of     the phone i received had very minor marks on the back  which i expected given this is used and the fact apple uses glass backs now  but they re barely noticeable even by my picky standards   the screen is flawless and i m beyond impressed with this purchase and seller   the battery health on the phone i received is     which way higher than i was expecting it to be     
468,5.0 ,                       awesome  came exactly as planned  i don t understand how this phone is renewed  it looks brand new  no scuffs or marks  checked everything from  camera  microphone  speakers  flash  battery life  etc  everything was brand new  don t get scared of the other reviews that look bad  i too was scared but i am extremely satisfied  if i ever need to buy a phone off amazon renewed again in the future  i won t be worried      
469,1.0 ,                       tried to return defective iphone and company only returned half of the product cost  then refuses to respond to emails asking where the remaining funds will be returned  absolutely horrible customer service and product  do not purchase from this company       
470,1.0 ,                       this phone was so full of scratched     
471,5.0 ,                       this phone is amazing  i order it november    and  it said arriving the   th  but came november     im so happy   i purchased it from maverick wireless and i want to say i was very nervous about purchasing an refurbished iphone for only      but its amazing  the camera is amazing  screen is brand new and they ll put a screen protector on for you also the packaging was great it came with the actul iphone box port ans iphone charger  so happy with my purchase      
472,2.0 ,                       i ordered this phone as an upgrade from my  s which was outdated and slow  amazon guaranteed that the new phone that s i ordered would be just like new  that was definitly not the case  when i red or ed the package the back glass was scratched all up  later when i transferred sim cards my verizon account was frozen because the phone was labeled as stolen  also the phone is supposed to be water resistant and could be submerged but i took it camping and went into the showers with it  after the shower it strobed black and white but when soaked in rice it was fixed  all in all it s safe to say that i will return this and get a refund      
473,5.0 ,                       i bought this phone for my daughter and  it arrive   days earlier no scratches it is in excellent condition my daughter loves it   the only thing no headphones but that s not a problem     
474,5.0 ,                       me encanta funciona perfecto     
475,1.0 ,                       the phone has some small scratches and the battery health is     capacity  being a device with the tag  amazon renewed   i was expecting it to have either a new or like new battery  the box had an inspection certificate so i wonder how it passed quality control  very disappointed  will not buy again      
476,5.0 ,                       arrived   days early and in perfect condition with     battery life can t really ask for more from a renewed phone  not a scratch or ding on it  it truly is like getting a brand new phone      
477,5.0 ,                       i like to take a little time when i review something like a phone  i ve had it for a couple months and i love it  i definitely had to make a decision between a more expensive iphone in this one  but if i would ve had the chance to use this one the decision would have been easy  this phone is capable of anything that the    xs is basically  end it has an a impeccable battery life  it s battery life goes head to head with that of the     and this song came out before the   th so i definitely told you something  i will recommend this phone for anyone  also has a pretty great camera  and currently it s pretty fast      
478,5.0 ,                       works great

480,1.0 ,                       i got this from  chubbiestech  i contacted the carrier before even getting the phone shipped about it been unlocked and not cracked working perfectly fine they text back with this big paragraph lying telling me it was going to be unlock but it was locked highly upset     
481,4.0 ,                       the phone works absolutely perfect and how it should be brand new  but there are some messed up pixels on the screen that appear on a black background  but overall it works great      
482,1.0 ,                       very disappointed  i bought this phone in october and three days ago my carrier blocked my device saying that another carrier claimed as stolen device  right now i am without a phone waiting for a response from olympic wireless seller      
483,5.0 ,                       this iphone is great  it looks and functions just like a brand new iphone     
484,5.0 ,                       likes it      
485,1.0 ,                       the phone wouldn t let me unlock it past the hello screen  it looks like the phone was tampered with on the inside before being shipped off  i know because when i tried to fix my phone i did the same thing and the screen couldn t read my finger  do not buy      
486,5.0 ,                            battery life potential  and the phone condition looks crisp and brand new  thank god no scratches or glitches so far      
487,4.0 ,                       phone came in like new condition the charger was a generic kind and only lasted my daughter   weeks before it gave out    the box was not original but a very cheap cardboard box all in all phone was good and she s had no problems  besides baveing to buy a new charger      
488,5.0 ,                       looks like new  no scratches anywhere  shiny  and powered right up   quick switch with my cell provider sim    will buy again from this seller      
489,5.0 ,                       this was a christmas gift for my    year old grandson   he just loves it and says it works great  i was very pleased with the seller and the communication and fast ship      
490,5.0 ,                       i was skeptical after reading some reviews but when it came i was impressed  there was no scratches at all and it looked brand new  came with a generic charger  not original  but that was specified in the description but it charged pretty fast in my opinion and the battery lasts all day so that s a plus      
491,5.0 ,                       bought this is a gift for someone and when i opened it to check it out it was perfect  not a scratch on it  came in great condition would recommend to anyone looking to save some money     
492,1.0 ,                       the back camera was with humidity i don t recommend this seller     
493,5.0 ,                       good quality  battery life last long  good quality camera and touch screen is great      
494,1.0 ,                       the ear speaker on the phone does not work   company very slow to respond to emails  the only reason they finally answered my email was when amazon called them directly  i still do t have a working phone        
495,5.0 ,                       this is a amazing phone  it came in like brand new condition  it arrived sooner then expected  my son loves this phone      
496,5.0 ,                       i bought for my younger and she was surprised  i wouldn t purchase this product any other way  thank you so much for my sisters birthday present      
497,3.0 ,                       i d rate this phone     stars  overall  i cannot complain   it functions properly  battery life is at      there are mild scratches on the side and back of the phone  more than what i have on my iphone    but i m particular with my stuff   it came with a generic charger and was in a standard box  not an apple one  there is mild moderate dirt lint in the cracks crevices speaker cover  it came with a screen protector installed  which was unfortunately installed a little off center  it does not appear this phone was disassembled and fully refurbished  it appears to be a used phone  would i buy another one   i m not sure  i d highly consider buying a brand new one from apple for      more  that way you know exactly what you re getting   however  if you just need a phone and are ok with minor cosmetic blemishes  this could be a way to save a little money over a new phone      
498,5.0 ,                       this phone is amazing  it was safely shipped and delivered earlier than expected  and the manual set up was quick and easy  i hope the battery life proves to be strong as i use this overtime  that s my only concern so far      
499,1.0 ,                       the phone was ok except for the screen   i have owned several phones and have never seen a screem crumble at the edges in several different places   the screen was most likely replaced by amazon and they used a low quiality glass replacement screen      
500,1.0 ,                       the phone is great too bad the camera is broken  can t take pictures or video      
501,5.0 ,                       a solid upgrade for a reasonable price  bigger screen and functionality in contrast to iphone se equates a satisfied purchase  condition of iphone xr is      functional and clear of any cracks or mishandling  thank you for both a reliable phone and quick shipping      
502,4.0 ,                       camera isn t as good as i expected but the phone works great  it has a good battery life  good sound quality  and it s sleek      
503,5.0 ,                       absolute mint condition   not one scratch or blemish   absolute new condition        battery health   how can that be with a reconditioned iphone     great packaging   extremely happy with this purchase   note   i very rarely review my purchases      
504,5.0 ,                       this is not a scam  i was skeptical at first  but this was the best purchase i ve made  the battery health is at      no cracks or scuffs  and looks brand new  my seller was chubbiestech  make sure to choose your seller wisely      
505,4.0 ,                       the phone was in near perfect condition and the batter capacity is at      there are practically no scratches on the phone  it s practically brand new  the problem is the front camera  when i had went to take some pictures with the camera  i had found there to be cracks within the camera  which sucks a lot  i had ordered another phone for my sister  and her camera was just fine  it was amazing even  the rear camera on my phone works well  it s just the front camera that is messed up      
506,4.0 ,                       it was actually ligit and a real iphone  the only thing i had was a little scratch on my face id camera still works great tho  also around the front camera it was chipped a little the color was     
507,5.0 ,                       phone came in beautiful condition  battery life is amazing  was skeptical about buying a phone off the internet but i m glad i did  front camera quality is weird but i ve noticed it s the same with all xrs             
508,3.0 ,                       this phone was absolutely amazing aside from the rear camera glitch  it never wanted to work  you have to expect that sometimes things can go wrong when purchasing refurbished  but they were super nice about it all and refunded me promptly  had the camera worked  i d totally give five stars      
509,5.0 ,                       i was looking for something pretty  lightweight and has protection when i drop my phone   i m thinking i ll get a few more so i can a variety of colors and designs to go with my wardrobe   since there not bulky and very easy to to switch out might as well have some fun with the many patterns available      
510,4.0 ,                       this is a solid deal  as to be expected with buying anything used  it s kind of a game of chance  but from using this phone for over a month now i have no complaints  a few minor dings and dents here and there but nothing noticeable  it s apparent that this phone us some replaced parts but again nothing that affects the usability of the device  i would definitely recommend to anyone who s trying to snag a good deal      
511,5.0 ,                       had to replace teen s phone and didn t want to extend carrier contract  ordered the xr and he has not had any problems with it  came in great condition

513,1.0 ,                       it works pretty well at the beginning  all of the sudden my phone didn t work and blacked out in      in the morning  i am not sure i can refund or fix the phone      
514,1.0 ,                       the camera is trembling when you try to take a picture from send text the camera can t open     
515,4.0 ,                       todo bien  completamente liberado  ten a unos desgaste leves en una esquina del marco  la parte de atr s esta bien pasa desapercibido algunas l neas de desgaste  c mara frontal esta muy bien  tiene una se a como q estuviera por dentro algo  no s  si es q as  son  pero igual no afecta en nada las fotos salen excelentes en frontal y trasera      
516,4.0 ,                       i have had for a while now and all is good  i would recommend to everyone who s looking for a good used phone  hb

520,5.0 ,                       it was for my dauther s   th birthday  she enjoyed it very much and was telling me about all the features      
521,1.0 ,                       when a phone is lost stolen and reported to the carrier it was registered with  the carrier blacklists the phone s imei so it can t be used with cellphone data  the phone shipped to me was unusable with any carrier due to it having a blacklisted imei  i m extremely disappointed in this purchase      
522,5.0 ,                       this phone is ligit my husband and i have this same exact one we purchased from at t on contract well my sons iphone   needed an upgrade instead of paying full price for an upgrade to renew his plan  i did my research and found this one i took a chance and pooped his soms card in and tada it worked perfectly he loves it it s no different than my own same color performs the same plus it was his birthday gift so i have a happy    year old will be doing the same soon for my younger daughter when she needs an upgrade        
523,5.0 ,                       phone came in great quality       battery and no scratches      
524,5.0 ,                       no issues so far  functions well  everything came as a expected  charger works fine as well      
525,2.0 ,                       everything about the phone worked looked perfect except the screen  it doesn t respond very well  which makes typing almost impossible  it might be a knock off replacement screen  wouldn t recommend      
526,5.0 ,                       very satisfied      
527,5.0 ,                       i was a little worried but it came perfect  not a single scratch that i can see  feels brand new and works perfectly  it does only come with its charger  but that s all it said it came with so no need to complain  overall good purchase do not regret it    side note it came much earlier than expected which is also a plus          
528,2.0 ,                       the iphone itself is great but     received the phone without a sim card tray  so without that it is pretty useless until i can go out of my way to order one     
529,5.0 ,                       loved it need   more     
530,5.0 ,                       so i m sure there is still time for something to go wrong but i was so skeptica to order a phone from here    but the one i got is beautiful    not a single scratch  the serial number is a genuine iphone and the battery has      health   i m super happy with myself for making the decision to get this phone       
531,5.0 ,                       phone was as described would definitely recommend      
532,2.0 ,                       im not sure if this is normal but the speaker on this phone is supper annoying  there is sort of an echo and vibration and all the extra amplified background noises that i cannot stand to hear when on a phone call  not a fan      
533,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          only issue i had was around the back frame of the camera is a little damaged  the camera itself it okay  but again it s a renewed iphone so i can t complain too much    i was a little worried it was a scam but it indeed is not  the phone works exactly as my current iphone x does and exceeds my expectations  i can t wait to give this to my best friend for christmas      
534,5.0 ,                       tuve una urgencia con el env o y amazon cumpli  con los tiempos pautados  excelente servicio  excelente tel fono      
535,3.0 ,                       i love the iphone xr  but for some reason the phone battery dies too quickly and the touch screen lags and makes me tap several times  i had an xr on another carrier and it was awesome  but couldn t unlock it for some reason      
536,5.0 ,                       great     
537,5.0 ,                       a lot better than my previous iphone   plus  i like all the different gadgets on it      
538,5.0 ,                       buen producto  la bater a me vino con    de capacidad     
539,5.0 ,                       wow  i am literally speechless   my iphone xr just arrived  a day early  and in less than    minutes i was ready to go   the phone is spotless  not a scratch on it  thank you chubbiestech i could not be happier with my purchase  i highly recommend this seller and their product  i am amazed    please note that i received a sim removal tool with my phone  i had ordered one just in case but it came with the phone      
540,5.0 ,                       the phone came in excellent shape  i could not find a single scratch or dent on the phone  the phone so received was identical to a brand new one i have been using it for    months now  absolutely no issues i have bought quite a few things from the amazon renewed program and have never been disappointed      
541,5.0 ,                       came with the usual cable and charger   plugged in the sim card and i was up and running      
542,4.0 ,                       this phone was in great condition and i m very glad i made the purchase  no scratches  came with an off brand charging cable and charging block  so be aware that you will most likely not get apple brand accessories      
543,5.0 ,                       i would like to specify i purchased the phone from the seller chubbiestech  first of all  i received the package a day early  bonus points   it did not come in the apple packaging but that s ok with me  the screen is in perfect conditions   overall the phone is       basically new  i was skeptical about this phone but honestly  no regrets  i bought it for my mom and i will buy another one for me  also  it did come with a charger  the screen quality is perfect and it s extremely responsive like any other iphone   if you ask me  don t think twice  buy it   from chubbiestech      
544,5.0 ,                       it was in excellent condition there wasn t one scratch on it  it was fully unlocked just as described and had a charger cord and connector  i love the picture quality and this is the best battery life i ve ever had in my life lasts about    hours and i m a very active user  my phone is never not in my hand  but no it doesn t come with headphones  but it s excellent      
545,5.0 ,                       bought this for my    year old son and it came spotless  as if new  it came in plain brown box  had it been in an apple box it would be very difficult to tell it wasn t brand new   we are very pleased and will buy from here again      
546,1.0 ,                       rebooted many times a day  automatic rebooted  suddenly shut down while using the process  restart  i tried to restore all the settings  refreshed the system again and cleared everything  resume but things got no better  i m checking it with computer software  the computer showed that the crashed file was due to a conflict between the cpu and the peripheral      
547,5.0 ,                       love it came packed nice good seller     
548,5.0 ,                       not one scratch on the back nor front  this was an easy transfer from my old one to this one  my whole layout and text messages from my old phone got transferred to my new one which was awesome  no glitches so far  no problems  this was a successful purchase by far  also it came with a clear case      
549,4.0 ,                       this is my second iphone xr and i have had iphones over the years and love them all

555,5.0 ,                       i am glad i ordered this phone  it was worth the money  the camera quality is good to record tiktok and to take pictures of my dogs  the speed is top quality  and it is all together an amazing phone     
556,2.0 ,                       phone came in acceptable conditions  scratches on the side  all aspects of the phone work except for facetime and imessage  i went into an apple store and was directed to call a technician  called   over the phone who told me the same thing to restart my phone and would not call back after i restarted my phone  the last one i make sure i skip that trouble shoot solver and move on  he said there was a problem  probably  with my carrier  went over to my carrier and had someone tinker with setting on my phone to no avail but in her defense she is not apple technician  she confirmed that my plan is what it is and that there shouldn t be any problems  i then call amazon who then after describing my problem calls iphone and put me back through that process over the phone where i did not get a call back again  i messaged amazon and this guy mark seems to be the most helpful and recommended i try to replace the phone  might return all together and get rid of this headache     
557,5.0 ,                       i love my new phone      
558,5.0 ,                       like everyone  i was super nervous to buy some refurbished phone from amazon  but it was sooo worth it  the phone came in days before the estimated delivery and was in amazing condition  mine even came with a glass screen protector  the only damage on the phone is a tiny scratch on the screen  it s less than it inch small on the corner and barely noticeable  but hey  if i wanted a phone in brand new condition  i would of bought a brand new phone  it came with a charger which is cool  it s not apple name brand   which people are mad about for some reason    lol okay karen   i don t mind and it works perfect   so far the battery is great too  this phone is an amazing upgrade from my   plus  i highly highly recommend this seller           
559,1.0 ,                       the phone was perfect  within a month the phone battery exploded and burnt the phone  still haven t received a refund from these people      
560,1.0 ,                       despite all the reviews saying that this device is fully unlocked and compatible with any phone carrier  it is wrong  it is not compatible with verizon so don t let them scheme you as they did me      
561,5.0 ,                       it s perfect     
562,5.0 ,                       the phone came just as it was shown  there are no scratches or anything it looks brand new  it also works really well and i had no issues transferring my sim and data over      
563,1.0 ,                       phone keeps freezing and not working well     
564,5.0 ,                       purchased the iphone xr from tech exchangee  received it within   days  perfect condition not a scratch  everything works perfect as describe  very nice iphone and well worth the money  will buy again if needed      
565,1.0 ,                       the screen was all scratched up and had some internal scratches    plus the camera quality isnt there as expected from apple products so it has me thinking that i got a fake iphone      
566,4.0 ,                       came is expected in very very good condition   there are some slight scratches around the camera housing see photo    but the lens itself seems perfect   perhaps the damage came when if the camera lens was replaced   the battery health is     i would ve expected preferred a brand new battery in a refurbished which is how they lost one star   in all i m very happy with the purchase      
567,5.0 ,                       when i ordered my new phone i was pretty skeptical     hoping my phone wouldn t be damaged or a fake   it shipped and i had it within days  it came with a knock off charger but i m not going to be using it anyway  i checked for the battery health and it s at       phone came with a screen protector on  nice packaging  couldn t be more perfect  would recommend      
568,3.0 ,                       i ordered the renewed version thinking it will not be identified  however the phone that i got had too many scratches and the camera was also scratched  highly disappointed  i immediately requested for return and ordered a new iphone    from apple s own website      
569,4.0 ,                       seems to be working fine just this green mark on the screen when the phone is on  i m not sure if it will get worse but i hope not     
570,4.0 ,                       i m happy i bought this phone from this seller  they shipped it as fast as they could and the phone is perfect  only issue it that my battery life is     but it did say that in the description and still lasts long  definitely a good choice to buy this phone and very affordable compared the apple and other sellers     
571,5.0 ,                       worth the money  works great with safe link     
572,5.0 ,                       this phone looks brand new  no scratches or knicks  came with original charger but no headphones but for the price you can t beat it      
573,5.0 ,                       i know that     battery capacity isn t that bad  i just wish they actually replaced the battery to get a brand new one  the phone came will a screen protector on it that was well applied  so that was nice  everything works prefectly and it was easy to set up  i just had to slide my at t chip in it and login to my apple id and i was good to go  i would definitely recommend buying refurbished  it s not worth the money for a brand new phone  and i can always replace the battery later for     if i need too  although it has been fine so far      
574,5.0 ,                       i almost told my boyfriend not to order this because i seen so many bad comments but the phone was perfect  he absolutely loves it and everything on it works fine      
575,1.0 ,                       phone came from kanga supply as refurbished phone  it worked fine but it was blacklisted and could not activate it  returned for full refund and bought from a different xr form apple      
576,5.0 ,                       i was scared to buy after seeing some comments but great phone actually works perfectly fine and is actually unlocked of course its a used phone so u might see a scratch or two on the metal but other than that every thing is in perfect condition

583,5.0 ,                       im impressed  i figured since it was refurbished it would have some scuffs or scratches on it but it literally looks and works as if its brand new

585,1.0 ,                       phone will not receive or transfer data from computer   spent two hours with apple genius bar   the problem is still not resolved   the phone is supposed to operate  like new    it does not operate properly

592,5.0 ,                       i was reluctant to buy a phone online but i am very satisfied with my purchase  to be honest i was impressed  it has good battery life  the touchscreen is working and the screen quality is awesome      
593,5.0 ,                       very nice phone  came a day early  battery at     small scratches around phone  not worried bc case will cover  everything loading smoothly

595,1.0 ,                       it didn t come with original box and manual  it didn t even come with the pin so you can put your sim card in  very inconvenient     
596,5.0 ,                       surprisingly still doing well  when i received the phone in december  no scratches were seen in sight  the phone looked brand new  came with a charger  was not from apple but works fine  it had     battery health and now it is down to      as a student  i use my phone extensively so the battery life lasted me all day  very satisfied with the purchase  buy a case too since the front and back is glass

598,5.0 ,                       we just received this iphone xr yesterday and set it up   it was easy and set up flawlessly in about an hour or two  the phone looks like it has never been used  and amazon gave me      for my iphone  plus   they paid postage both ways and i am excited to be able to upgrade at such a reasonably low cost   time will tell if the battery is ok per my   star rating       
599,4.0 ,                       the phone came in with  screen protector  but it had a big scratch in the middle of the real screen  it doesn t have a single dent or scratch other than that  the phone looks brand new battery came in at     i did not like that it came with that percentage     
600,5.0 ,                       works as a fine cell phone     
601,5.0 ,                       very  very happy with my new phone  looks and works like it is brand new  i was a little skeptical at first because i bought a renewed phone from another company previously and had to return it due to no sim tray and the screen wasn t working  but i am glad i decided to go forward with this purchase      
602,5.0 ,                       i bought this phone for my   year old  he loves it  he initially had an android but wanted an iphone like his sister  the quality was amazing  no visible scratches  we had no issues with added the phone to our family plan  he wanted the red one  because that s his favorite color  the color was vibrant red  no issues at all  and the price was reasonable      
603,5.0 ,                       i read alot of reviews before buying so i wanted to review to help others  i bought this phone for my daughter  it was in perfect condition  no scratches or scuffs  screen was perfect  she has been using it for a few days now  and no issues selling point for me was the    day return policy   just in case something was wrong with it      
604,5.0 ,                       love it  great     
605,3.0 ,                       beware phone not compatible with all phone companies  may have to switch carriers to get activated  and pay a         fee for switching      
606,3.0 ,                       i selected white as my color choice  i received a black phone  that s not a big deal  i just didn t receive what i asked for  also  it s kind of glitchy and slow  there is a scratch on the screen and a small space of dead pixel  it s not terrible  but it s really not worth        i m just going to bite the bullet and buy a new phone once my refund is processed      
607,5.0 ,                       love my iphone came on time and no problems with the phone looks like new and works excellent      
608,5.0 ,                       this phone works great  though it took some time to get used to not having the home button but finding it s  actually easier  the phone came well packaged with a universal cable and wall adapter but no headphones  some reviews mention this as a show stopper but it wasn t a big deal to me  i was only concerned about the phone working  while in town i noticed the phone showing  g and it is considerably faster when not on wifi than my old iphone  plus  i give this phone a high review as it worked and was easy to set up      
609,5.0 ,                       beautiful  tbh i was scared to buy my first iphone ever  online  but i didn t it and i m so glad i did so cheap so nice  perfect condition      
610,5.0 ,                       wow  what an amazing company  shipping was speedy  got here in two days  the phone itself came in perfect condition  as if i brought it directly from apple itself  no scratches  smudges  and they installed a free screen protector  battery life seems awesome so far  i am so impressed  highly recommend      
611,5.0 ,                       iphone xr is amazing       i ordered it for my daughter for bday  xmas and gave it to her early and she absolutely loves it     she s   and said it s like brand new    seller was the best     kept in contact with me until it arrived     do not hesitate to purchase from him     she popped her sim card from her old verizon phone  put it in her new iphone and she was texting in blue immediately     the whole reason she wanted an iphone     she felt she was tired of her androids  inferior green texts       maybe she s a little spoiled     only child      she loved the phone     go ahead and order  you won t be disappointed     see pics not one scratch on it         
612,5.0 ,                       works perfect  great looking phone     
613,5.0 ,                       i liked a lot  the price is great and it looks like a brand new phone  just the battery life that came with     but i think that s good anyways           
614,5.0 ,                       i ve only had it for a few days but so far it has exceeded my expectations  it looks like new and it is a very responsive phone with a great camera      
615,1.0 ,                       the phone worked for two days before the cameras stopped working  i took it to an apple certified repair center  best buy  and they did everything to fix it and finally said i need to replace the whole thing  the phone still had the warranty coverage so jokes on you fiesta renew i got a brand new xr for half the price      
616,2.0 ,                       bought this for my daughters   th birthday   came with a broken charger  seriously          
617,5.0 ,                       one of the iphones is perfect  just like new in appearance and performance  the second one had a small paint  blemish around the lens but camera performed great  the important problem was  on the incoming calls the person who called me hears interference  not in my phone side but only on the caller side  i called my phone company provider but told me my line was good  then i changed the sim card chip to my old phone and there is absolutely no interference on the incoming callers  finally i decided to return this phone  wished there was an exchange option and not only a return option the iphone i am keeping is working perfectly was easy to start and even came with a nice case and a glass screen protector      
618,5.0 ,                       i ll admit after reading through the reviews i was very hesitant but i am beyond happy with my purchase the phone is flawless  yes you read that right  absolutely flawless  it came with a glass screen protector already installed and all oem accessories  phone has a brand new      capacity battery and is still under factory warranty until may       i understand some of this will vary but this is a review of my experience i purchased another  renewed  phone  pixel  xl  from a different seller and it s perfectly functional but no where near the condition this iphone xr arrived in i just popped my sim card in and it worked right away  usually with my carrier i have to call in with the imei number but i didn t have to  i also tried a gsm sim card and it worked too  fully unlocked as advertised best  used  phone  purchase  ever so glad i did not listen to all the negative reviews      
619,5.0 ,                       came as advertised  actually it was better  my phone is pretty much brand new  i found zero scratches or dents when i received the device  hopefully apple doesn t slow the xr down until we get to the iphone    or something super far into the future      
620,1.0 ,                       not even a month later the phone started to not work  the charging port is messing up and then the  phone itself with the software is messing up      
621,3.0 ,                       i bought this phone because the   plus that i had the screen broke and be of corona virus no apple stores are open for my screen to have gotten fixed  the iphone xr is very swift i got it in white which gives it a very clean smooth look  however i am having issues putting my boost mobile sim card in the xr it is saying i need a punk code i called boost mobile and they then told me the phone is locked  now i dont know what to do     
622,1.0 ,                       the battery life   shipping time are the only good things about this product  it came in a manila envelope  no box  the screen was completely ruined and had to be replaced before it was even useable      
623,1.0 ,                       phone came with a blown main speaker and the back and screen were heavily scratched  i m not going to outright trash the seller as i m waiting to see how they reconcile this issue and i m going to return with a proper review once i receive my replacement device and or a possible refund if necessary  right now it seems like they never even tested the phone and they didn t look at the device because of the scratches mentioned      
624,5.0 ,                       looks new to me     
625,5.0 ,                       came early to my surprise  packaged weird no block  but it is working properly  so  i m satisfied      
626,3.0 ,                       saw the good reviews on this  but when i got it  there were a lot of scuffs and scratches  especially on the bottom right corner as well as on the side of the camera lens in the back  i d usually be okay with it since i have my case to cover the   sides of the phone  but this is a tell tale sign that the previous owner just didn t take care of this phone and that s an indicator that this phone probably won t last   i m coming from the iphone  s  which i had for like   years  and plan to stay with the xr for years before upgrading   battery life was at     which wasn t too bad  i d say it s more like a gamble what you get  so good luck guys  planning to buy another one with a grade a or grade b  so it      won t have this much cosmetic issues  this phone i got was at best a grade b      
627,5.0 ,                       i got an iphone xr  exactly what i was expecting  everything is good  only a couple of tiny tiny scratches on the side of the phone  battery is      not original apple charger  everything else looks and works great so far  reasonable price  i was really afraid to order renewed iphone  but in my opinion iphone that i got worth money that i spent      
628,5.0 ,                       works well and super durable  worth the money     
629,5.0 ,                       perfect in every way   the phone is in excellent condition and the battery life is super   the picture is shown with a clear case on the phone that i put on after receiving the item   would purchase from seller again   thank you      
630,5.0 ,                       phone came in perfect condition and completely unlocked i am very satisfied with my purchase and i will definitely buy from them again in the future     
631,1.0 ,                       phone is nasty has dirt in all of the openings and did not come with apple charging products     
632,5.0 ,                       great condition and very good price     
633,5.0 ,                       i m happy with phone really was a good good and cheap     
634,1.0 ,                       i did my due diligence and researched several options before i committed to a renewed iphone xr from the amazon  i had high hopes and really needed an unlocked new er  phone  and you would think with so many positive reviews  this was the real deal  wrong    the phone arrived nicely packaged with a slight scratch on the side  not a big deal at all  because separately i purchased a nice case for it  the screen was also nice with no visible scratches  i m addition  i attached a screen protector  so the phone performed flawlessly for about two months  i loved how responsive it was  and then out of the blue  i receive the following settings message   unable to verify this iphone has a genuine apple battery  health information not available for this battery   say what  the phone started automatically shutting off and restarting  you re in the middle of writing an email  and boom the phone shuts off  lovely  the battery indicator said it s completely drained  but it really isn t  waste of time  highly disappointed and will send it back tomorrow for a refund      
635,5.0 ,                       so far so good  we got it turned on about a week ago  everything seems to be working great      
636,1.0 ,                       packaging was fine  delivery was fine  but the phone id not work with sprint sim card  i returned the item and have not received my money back  won t be buying refurbished  or unlocked phones through amazon vendors again      
637,3.0 ,                       el tel fono f sicamente no tenia problemas  el problema lo tenia al hacer la llamada que no pod a escuchar casi a la persona  doy tres estrellas por que a pesar de todo me devolvieron el dinero en su totalidad     
638,1.0 ,                       i love how it was super intact on the outside but i paid for    gb it had like    and it kept turning off randomly and the battery percentage was going up and down        
639,5.0 ,                       phone looked like it was brand new  works great and easy to put on my plan with metro      
640,4.0 ,                       me encanto  vino totalmente desbloqueado y no trae aud fonos solo cargador  su condici n de bater a no viene al      la m a es de          
641,5.0 ,                       excellent phone and in perfect condition and i have purchased multiple iphones but i cannot believe the savings and quality of this phone which far exceeds all the pros vs cons     
642,5.0 ,                       bought this phone for my wife and she lovesis a renewed but looks and works like newno hear buds or original charger thoughhappy wife is a happy wife     
643,5.0 ,                       good     
644,4.0 ,                       so far the phone has been great  there was a glitch that happen once with the screen clicking stuff by itself  i only had this phone for maybe   weeks      
645,1.0 ,                       world s worst thing ever never get on this its a scam     
646,4.0 ,                       el tel fono est  como nuevo  no tiene un solo rasp n  la vrdd estaba muy asustada antes de hacer la compra pero al ver las rese as del vendedor  me decid   lleg  muy r pido  dos d as antes de lo anunciado incluso  todo funciona correctamente  me alegro de haber hecho la compra  lo  nico malo pero entendible  la bater a est  al     de su funcionamiento  pero el resto  s per bien      
647,3.0 ,                       it s a amazing phone but the screen is very delayed      i also have to press down hard on the screen to do whatever i wanted to do       
648,5.0 ,                       it was worth the money very new although one scratch but that s okayv     
649,4.0 ,                       didn t realize it came with a screen protector  so that s a plus  minus the fact that it has a hardly noticeable little scratch near the usb port it s a great phone  basically a new iphone for cheaper lol  one thing that irritates me is the charger and the block  they both aren t by apple nor does it come with headphones  other than that i recommend     
650,5.0 ,                       well i ordered it yesterday and got it today should have taken   days i think so great on that  the phone looks new no scratches so great there too  i activated it with no problem  i didn t get a chance to use the cam etc yet but i think it will be just fine  have to say very happy thanks alot  i was worried ordering a referb but it is for my daughter who broke her phone and with this carona going on i needed her to have it  awesome work people  i would recomend     
651,5.0 ,                       phone is in great shape  screen looks new and phone arrived with ios     phone came with a charger and case as well  no problem moving my info files from android  took a few hours though  or installing the nano sim  verizon  which only took a few minutes  good purchase overall  fedex took a few extra days to deliver the phone  but that s understandable this time of the year  i recommend requiring a signature at delivery  worth the wait        
652,5.0 ,                       perfect condition  definitely would recommend  when i originally got it  it was damaged in shipping but after returning it they sent a replacement and i am overjoyed  couldn t be happier with what i received      
653,5.0 ,                       exceeded expectations   great way to purchase a phone      
654,3.0 ,                       this phone is good it just glitches out a lot and freezes     
655,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love it  it s actually a gorgeous phone  the battery lasts  the camera quality is amazing  front and back  and it genuinely comes with     gb  and unlocked  the only downside is the cheap charger but nothing to worry about  when you can purchase an original charger  in love  definitely recommend      
656,5.0 ,                       everything is great     
657,5.0 ,                       phone is exactly as advertised   nothing cosmetically wrong with it that i can see   phone was unlocked and i had no problem connecting it with my carrier     
658,5.0 ,                       the phone was as expected      
659,4.0 ,                       i m giving it a four star  the phone physically was amazing and perfect no scratches  nothing  unfortunately i use cricket and as soon as i activated my sims into my new iphone xr my account was suspended cricket said it was blacklisted  however i spoke with apple and apple said the phone is not blacklisted they even spoke with the cricket carrier and cricket said it was a glitch i  their system so after reading reviews on rocket ive realized they have this  glitch  very often  the phone if you are not with cricket will be a great buy  i would personally buy this phone again if i wasn t with cricket      
660,1.0 ,                       pretty sure i got a fake xr  came in wrong color  isn t the size of a normal xr  won t turn on  came with an android charger  the list goes on      
661,5.0 ,                       this phone rocks  it has plenty of storage and it doesn t slow down  my daughter loves it  thanks again      
662,1.0 ,                       horrible working with this company  they will not respond to me getting a replacement on my phone  right out of the box the facial recognition didn t work  randomly the phone won t register that i am pushing a button  the camera has a scratch on the lense and doesn t take very good pictures   looks like they received the phone and didn t check it at all  i mean the facial recognition is one of the first things you do when setting up the phone  so frustrated and now will be out of a phone for weeks waiting for my money back      
663,1.0 ,                       i just got my phone   hours ago  i plugged it in to charge  and it does not charge via the charging port  i tried my personal charger and the one that was included in the package  and both do not work  i then tried one that charges wirelessly and it does charge  i will be happy to be issued a replacement  as of the moment i have not been contacted back by the seller  as soon as they reach out to me  i will change my review      
664,1.0 ,                       the iphone s calling is not working  when i call  neither i am able to hear other person nor the other person hear me  but whatsapp call works  it s very inconvenient that since i have the phone  call never worked  earlier i thought is it my network  but when i use sim in other phone  it works perfectly  the phone has a defect  i never expected this quality through amazon  i request amazon to take action and help in return or replacement      
665,5.0 ,                       amazinggg   everything works fine   it should ve came with headphones but other than that it s awesome   great for the price     
666,1.0 ,                       keeps lagging and freezing all the time  i tried emailing the seller to work it out but never got any response    frustrating bad experience     
667,5.0 ,                       my seller was buyspry and i couldn t be happier with my phone  it go to my house a day early and i took it to my carrier s store and got it set up that same night  no complications  the phone is pretty much scratch free besides a tiny bump by the charger  the phone battery is at       and it even came with a screen protector  it came with a charger and a thing to remove my sim  i would definitely buy this phone from the same seller  it s a       worth the buy      
668,5.0 ,                       this phone is absolutely gorgeous please don t listen to no negative comments   it only took a week to come came with a charger no headphones tho     
669,1.0 ,                       i purchased this iphone rx as a gift for someone  i was so disappointed  no headphone   the charger is not original  does not work   the box that the iphone came in was very dirty   i reported this issues to amazon s customer services  never again will obtain a phone from maverick wireless  i  will  be returning this iphone      
670,4.0 ,                       pretty good overall  i haven t had any issues thankfully      
671,5.0 ,                       this iphone xr is amazing  i bought it for my teen and she can t stop raving  when i get ready for my updated iphone  i m coming here      
672,5.0 ,                       very good phone even tho it s used  the battery life is good it s at     it doesn t die quickly  i bought phone on monday and it came on wednesday which was very fast shipping  the phone also came with a really good phone case glass screen protector  and a phone charger so it s worth the money i suggest buying from here       
673,2.0 ,                       had this phone for about   days now    the battery health is absolutely trash as you can see it only has     battery capacity and they also gave me a lg charger    very disappointed     
674,1.0 ,                       i use this phone for one day only   and the second day the phone is died   and i return already but until now i didn t get my money back   i think it s already one month i return the phone     
675,5.0 ,                       works amazing even better then i thought i would buy it again without any hesitations      
676,5.0 ,                       the only way to know this was not a brand new phone was that it came in a generic box  far exceeded my expectations      
677,1.0 ,                       i paid for an iphone xr   i only received a charger      
678,5.0 ,                       iphone xr was in perfect condition  this actually was the second one i bought for my grandsons  i previously bought one in february  put in verizon sim card and phone was good to go  would definitely buy from this company again      
679,1.0 ,                       this was a refurbished phone and the seller did not verify whether the phone had been paid off   since it wasn t paid off the phone never worked     
680,5.0 ,                       the xr iphone work perfect i can use any company  thank you     
681,5.0 ,                       the phone looks brand new  everything works perfectly fine  it came in a protective box with a charger  i was a little bit skeptical about them  but it has been a really nice product so far i had some issues with my delivery  but customer service helped me right away  i      recommend it      
682,5.0 ,                       this is legit  i received the phone the day after ordering  there was just the phone   charger in the box    the phoneee   it s beautiful   it looks brand new  there s not a scratch in site   it functions perfectly  set up was effortless  it s fully unlocked   i popped my sim card in and have had no service issues  if you re thinking about buying this phone   do it  you won t regret it      
683,5.0 ,                       great price and works great     
684,5.0 ,                       never bought anything refurbished but amazon made it look and feel new and im using it to type this review its great i love it  i traded in my  k dollar note   to switch back to apple and dont regret it  note   was cool but android has no facetime bad snapchat quality and bad video sending quality so apple still on top years later     
685,4.0 ,                       good with the phone but the lightning cable is not oem and it doesn t work right  it get lose at minimum movement so it s not extra fe that after long time  the cable was not correctly set and there  s no charge  they should invest in a better cable      
686,5.0 ,                       excellent quality  no defects thanks for the easy buy      
687,5.0 ,                       it came on time  and in perfect condition    highly recommended for me   i know your concern  battery life    is it gonna work in the first place my answer is yes  worked fully  battery life is good  i charge it takes   hrs life span and that s when i overuse it  so get it highly recommended     
688,1.0 ,                       i purchased this refurbished phone which didn t work when it arrived  i sent it back and was charged     for restocking a product that didn t work in the first place  save your money      
689,1.0 ,                       came good  with all the accessories  had some minor dings next to the volume buttons  but  upon activating and setting up face id wouldn t set up  then was glitching in apps  and finally took it to best buy to help me they tried to reset it and the phone froze up and failed a reset  returned and very disappointed      
690,4.0 ,                       very great phone  but one thing  if you want to give a like new experience  replace the battery with a new one      
691,4.0 ,                       according to my child   a perfect holiday gift    absolutely loves it and it seems to work fine     
692,5.0 ,                       the apple iphone xr  the order was expedient and was a great purchase for the right price      
693,5.0 ,                       the battery life on the first week was amazing but now it s not as good  but it still stays charged  it takes forever to charge tho i have noticed that  i do recommend getting the xr     
694,5.0 ,                       it s legit  the phone came faster than expected and works well so far  only downside is the charger i got isn t working      
695,4.0 ,                       i would like to change the device  please confirm if i am able to return the device to the store in person  i live in newark nj  it seems that you have physical stores in new york am i able to go there  regards       
696,4.0 ,                       i have enjoyed this phone     
697,5.0 ,                       fast turn around  excellent packaging  product as stated  have been using for   weeks without issue  like new      
698,5.0 ,                       most the bad reviews are because they were expecting a charger and earphones  i love the phone  no need to spend money on a brand new one           
699,5.0 ,                       very great came fast  there was a screen protector on the phone already which was great  definitely would buy again amazing           
700,4.0 ,                       the only thing that s wrong is it won t read my sim card it s unlocked to any carrier but my sim card won t work it in it   other than that really good quality

707,2.0 ,                       i had to return this product because of the call sound quality  when making a call  i could barely make out what the person on the other line was saying      
708,1.0 ,                       the screen was defective after about    days  bought the  renewed  version   contacting seller as amazon one stop phone number basically says no one will answer your call   so much for this  i ll buy from my cell phone service provider  next time

724,2.0 ,                       i find it very hard to use as when i switch from my old phone not everything switched over  it has smaller numbers and letters  not really happy with it

728,4.0 ,                       cant beat the apple quality     
729,4.0 ,                       i like it it s just a used phone that s clean i was worried at first but it s great overall battery health  was at    a few minor scratches i think i put a screen protector on so it s not at all recognizable     
730,3.0 ,                       audio was not working  had to return it     
731,5.0 ,                       came in an amazon package  but phone was received as described  it does not come with sim card  so beware i put the sim card from the old phone into the i   and setup with flawlessly      
732,5.0 ,                       no complaints  excellent like a brand new phone not one scratch  not one ding  perfect  holds a great charge as well  comes with a generic charger piece  but of course you know you can always buy the apple brand end piece as a replacement  worth the money      
733,5.0 ,                       this was my first renewed phone so i was a like nervous about what i was going to get  thankfully all my worries were unjustified because the phone came in perfect conditions  not a single scratch and battery status at       but the best thing is that it also came with a apple guarantee that last for   months  the seller was networkstore  shipping was very fast      
734,2.0 ,                       everything works and in good condition except that i put fully unlocked and when tried to connect to my boost acct i was told the phone was locked a     
735,5.0 ,                       i bought the iphone xr  coral    gb for my mom around september of last year from chubbiestech  the phone works great  the battery life is outstanding  and the camera quality is amazing  my mom is very happy with the phone and i just wanted to thank the peeps at chubbiestech for doing a wonderful job on her phone  y all rock      
736,2.0 ,                       i ordered this coral iphone  xr for my mother and i was so excited when i got the phone because it looks like brand new  my mother noticed that one part of the screen is dead and honestly i didn t believe her until i try to type something on the keyboard and i noticed the backspace button doesn t work  i tried to open another app to see if it was a software glitch but it s not  i m assuming it has to do with the screen  i m going to return this phone and see if i can get another one because the quality is great is just that part of the screen that doesn t work properly      
737,5.0 ,                       it came a day earlier than expected  there was a few scratches on the top right corner of the screen but that is what you get with a refurbished phone  other than that its perfect  it even came with a real iphone charger and a very nice sturdy clear case  im not going to lie i was a bit nervous because of the horrible review section  however the speakers work perfectly  the screen is bright and vibrant  im very satisfied with this purchase  i got the coral pink  iphone xr  through chubbiestech  i suggest anyone making this purchase  to definitely go through them  ill update if anything goes array  thank you chubbiestech      
738,1.0 ,                       phone looks great delivery was on time got it set up  and  st full day of using it and   of the speakers does not work  just contacted seller  this is the first time i have gotten something from amazon that has had an issue will update with how this issue is handled      
739,5.0 ,                       so far so good phone works great the phones battery is at     full battery capacity which personally i think is good  also i got a unlocked iphone xr red with    gb  also they had it for a very good price when i bought it and they send me a letter with the phone saying there was lower price than what they had listed but they told me they weren t going to charge me extra or cancel the order  that why have them a   star     
740,3.0 ,                       i am glad this wasn t a scam  i have issues with the phone i got  a crack in the corner of the screen  but it s nothing that will definitely be the case for another buyer and the crack isn t too bad  i just wish i had gotten a phone that wasn t     
741,5.0 ,                       i was leery to purchase a refurbished  renewed  iphone xr  but it only cost me      with tax and i needed a new phone  i received my iphone quickly and it was in perfect condition  no scratches on the screen and no dents or scrapes on the exterior  i m very pleased with the phone  all i needed to do was take my sim card from my old phone and place it into my xr and i was good to go  i highly recommend purchasing from this buyer      
742,5.0 ,                       they looked like new      
743,5.0 ,                       overall excellent     
744,5.0 ,                       this phone is amazing  it looks completely new and works perfectly  an amazing phone  i recommend it for sure  don t doubt about buying it      
745,5.0 ,                       what a beautiful and excellent product  i will recommend this provider to buy the cell phones  thank you again  it works great internationally with claro ecuador  works perfect      
746,5.0 ,                       i love my phone it came perfect and fast shipping  good battery good touch screen and screen quality      
747,5.0 ,                       for starters  it depends on what seller you go through when ordering these phones  i bought mine through digital age usa and the phone is perfect  it said it was supposed to arrive february  nd but it arrived january   th  i m sure it s because i live only a few hours away from where it was shipping from  it did come with a charger box that wasn t apple but if you actually read the description it says that could happen and that it won t come with headphones  completely understandable considering these are used phones  other than a tiny scratch on the outside of the back camera  the phone is flawless with no severe scratches  i ve had the phone for   days now and i haven t run into any issues  the touch screen works perfectly and i was able to turn it on through total wireless  which goes through verizon  my advice for anyone wanting to get a renewed phone  look at the seller  the seller i bought this from has a     rating  the very next day a different seller was on here with only a     rating  if the seller doesn t have a good rating do not buy from them   wait until another seller comes up with decent reviews      
748,1.0 ,                       phone was in good condition but sent me an unlocked phone with a blocked imei  i can t even use it with my carrier  really disappointed will probably return  bought from kiss electronics inc  don t really recommend      
749,1.0 ,                       if i could give this a rating of a zero   i would because that s how bad it is   i had an older iphone   and it works way better than this   i updated to this phone because i bought the apple series   watch and it required a newer iphone to work with it   this xr phone keeps dropping calls   many times i m not able to dial out   what s the point of having a phone if your calls keep dropping    nd major issue is when i m away from my house   i m not able to use my data   hence   i m not able to connect   even when i m home and use wifi data   i would lose connection   i would be on facetime with my mom and so often   i would lose connection    rd  the battery gets hot very fast   again   i never had any of these issues with my iphone     i wanted to return the phone   but i was told i was a month to late   i only had the phone for   months      
750,1.0 ,                       this item came to me with scratches and cosmetic damage  it was also sent in a box with no type of protective bubble wrap or anything  battery was at        with a non apple charger  i promptly sent it back i do not recommend      
751,5.0 ,                       this phone came just as promised  there was one itty bitty scratch  that you wouldn t notice unless you were just looking for it  the battery lasts so much longer than my previous    the price is very reasonable  so far  i have had no trouble with it  i ve had it since wednesday              the screen quality is also immaculate  i love it  so crisp  the camera is great too  overall this is a great phone   i would definitely recommend this seller  there was also a free case included with my purchase      
752,3.0 ,                       the phone was great but now after a few months having trouble with ringer goes to silence every time i turn around  very frustrating and the volume isn t very  loud     
753,2.0 ,                       it was a refurb phone  but i ve dealt with factory refurbs in the past and have had no issue  not a big complainer on my end  but lets face it  phones are expensive nowadays and one deserves to see their money well spent  the phone was in typical refub condition  a few small scratches on the rim of the frame  find  no complaints here   but when i powered on the phone and saw the apple  the rest of the screen is black  i knew something was off  there was this small  rainbow esque  circle just to the right of the apple logo which told me right away that the screen was replaced and not done properly  sending it back and maybe thinking about giving them another chance   other than the screen issue  the phone came as described  could have done a little better job insulating the phone in general  it was literally in factory ziplock bag and inside a box  so it was able to move around a lot  hope this helps      
754,4.0 ,                       good deal for the price  didn t come packaged to well but phone works fine so no complaints      
755,5.0 ,                       pretty sure this is a brand spankin new  or max used for a couple months  phone  amazing quality  super fast  battery in perfect condition  warranty until august  got it in january   the red is gorgeous and i got a clear case to show it off  haven t had a single issue with this phone and i ve been using it for several weeks  quite an upgrade from the iphone   i had      
756,5.0 ,                       i purchased this phone for my daughter for her   th bday and she loves it  the phone appears to be brand new with no scratches on it      
757,5.0 ,                       everything works on this phone as it should  i got my daughter this same phone in yellow brand new  i got my son this red one for half the price and it looks and works just like the new one  delivery was fast     days      
758,3.0 ,                       this phone works well everything functions as it should battery live isn t as good as brand new but gets the job done  only complaint is a rattle sound from the top right corner from speakers      
759,5.0 ,                       just like new  highly recommend     
760,5.0 ,                       funciona en su totalidad  detalles m nimos de uso en el borde inferior  pero casi imperceptible  el cargador no es el original de iphone pero funciona a la perfecci n  buena compra     
761,1.0 ,                       disappointed as i ordered unlocked and it clearly stated it would work with any carrier of choice  e g  at t  t mobile  sprint  verizon  us cellular  cricket  metro  etc   when we tried to put the sim it would not fit in the slot   checked the video on the sim card tray holder slot size for iphone xr and iphone x and is the same and the sim also is shaped the same  after looking at the slot more carefully we noticed that the slot shape is not cut to fit the sim  i guess amazon certified is not doing a good job at testing and making sure the slot that holds the sim is actually compatible      
762,1.0 ,                       my iphone xr really came with a notification saying unable to verify this iphone has a genuine apple battery  health information not available for this battery  learn more    and if i give it a little shake something inside the phone literally moves and i did turn off the  shake to undo  feature to see if it was that but it wasnt i m not gon lie it did come with lil scratches on the top right corner but i didn t mind them at first but now i do      
763,5.0 ,                       i m really enjoying this phone     
764,5.0 ,                       love this product  great picture quality      
765,5.0 ,                       great phone  no issues with service provider and it took    minutes  the phone has no scratches  great condition  my daughter in law is getting another one from same seller    stars     
766,5.0 ,                       the phone arrived a day early and was in perfect condition  there is not a mark on it and it had a new battery in it  my charger was a apple charger  i love my phone      
767,1.0 ,                       do not buy from the kanga seller  i bought a refurbished phone from them  it worked for   weeks then all service got shut down because it s saying it was stolen        
768,5.0 ,                       the phone looks brand new other than some very minor scratches in the corners which is expected when buying a used phone  honestly it was much better quality than what i expected      
769,5.0 ,                       looks like new  bought it for my son and he loves it  so far working with no any known issues      
770,3.0 ,                       everything is great works fine other then having issues making and receiving calls people can call me or i can call them but as soon as either party picks up it disconnects but internet and everything else works fine as does calls on facebook messenger     
771,5.0 ,                       i saw some bad reviews about ordering from them and people having cracked screens but mine came in on time and in very good condition it pretty much looks and acts brand new     
772,5.0 ,                       i was worried about the quality of phone i was getting after reading some   star reviews  however  i took the chance and bought the iphone anyway  i can confidently say it was a great purchase  my iphone came in like new condition      
773,3.0 ,                       in near perfect condition  almost no sign of use  the boxing was a little generic and not so great in terms of unboxing flavor but that s the only gripe i have  no problems and its miiiiiiine edit  the phone stopped receiving cell service in a week  make sure to get a return or replacement from the networkstore as networkstore doesn t respect manufacturer repairs      
774,5.0 ,                       love this product i got it in red  came with minor scratches that are not really noticeable at all  battery health was at     and lasts all day  would recommend to any future buyers      
775,4.0 ,                       the iphone xr is amazing it s easy to use i had it since october it s loud i got the     gigabytes the storage is amazing but the only problem i seem to have if i m on facetime with somebody for a long time my phone starts to freeze up and do it s own thing like move on it s on so the only way how i fix that problem is i gotta turn off the phone and turn it back on but it s a great phone to use tho dont be scared to by it     
776,5.0 ,                       ordered   phones  worked as soon we put our sim cards in and turned them on  nearly perfect      
777,3.0 ,                       screen  is going  off  and on  alt leat     times day      and kept  off for    or     min without  etting turing on or off    i need to do an exchangue bu t i dont see the opstion    only  see a return     should ai process the retun and repurchase   i just want  to exchangue it     its defective     
778,5.0 ,                       very good condition and so far no complaints about the performance      
779,5.0 ,                       this is great  it came with two chargers and a plug in  and the phone has a screen protecter on it  all the negative reviews say that there is no sim card which is true  but their cheap anyways so don t believe the negative reviews this is a great product      
780,5.0 ,                       this phone is amazing  overall quality was amazing  no damage or scratches anywhere  basically brand new  if it didn t say  refurbished  it could pass as brand new  instead of paying       at apple  buy from here      
781,5.0 ,                       was really stressed about the reviews and the negative reviews and it s really not that at all  it s an good phone and unlocked      
782,1.0 ,                       i ve baugh this phone as it s fully unlocked  then after receiving it today  i put my sim card and it did not work  when i went to my verizon account  it said that the device is currently suspended  how could they sell to me a suspended device as a fully unlocked one  this is just a scam      
783,5.0 ,                       some background  i have had the phone for one week  my previous phone was an iphone se  so this was a huge upgrade  i am a masters student balling on a budget  i typically keep a phone for   to   years  until it completely stops working  so i was looking for a bargain without substituting quality better than i ever could have hoped  the iphone xr arrived a day early  even in a time of pandemic  in a generic box with a generic charging cord  i put in my sim card and set up the phone in less than an hour  no issues  i checked the battery health and it is at     capacity  i expect like with most iphones that the battery lifespan will be about     years before i must replace it  i am very happy with this  no broken buttons  screen damage or anything  for over      in savings compared to a new device  i am blown away by the quality  i will never buy a new phone again  i will use buyspry refurbished phones      
784,1.0 ,                       phones are blacklisted since they are stolen      
785,1.0 ,                       this unit worked great for a few weeks until it began to give sim card issues   eventually led to failure  i ended up with a phone that no longer held a cellular signal  eventually every day it dropped the cellular service going from bars to no service within a min even   stuck in a cycle   even after paying for a new sim card   later found out that the phone was the issue and returned it  pretty disappointed  don t think i would but from here again  unless they offered an exchange of the device for me but no one has offered      
786,4.0 ,                       my son loved this  he had an iphone   and the battery died very quickly  this one lasts a lot longer      
787,5.0 ,                       i love this phone   has worked perfectly since i got it back in november   i have had no issues with this phone and heavily recommended this product to those who may be skeptical about purchasing from amazon  and those looking for a phone they can trust to do the job         
788,5.0 ,                       the phone came in fantastic condition  i was shocked by the quality so i went ahead and ordered another one for my husband  it s fully unlocked and you can t beat the price      
789,5.0 ,                       phone shipped out monday i received it wednesday   so far no issues i was able to put my sim in and just use the phone  no damage perfectly good phone  i will be reordering for my son soon      
790,5.0 ,                       i love   i would recommend it to anyone the phone was in excellent condition  it came with a nice clear case  screen protector  i m so happy i was able to save some money and be a part of saving our environment and the same time      
791,2.0 ,                       everything is great except the phone is locked and the speaker has a hard time hearing me  so i can t talk to siri without having to yell and my phone calls sound like i m using a pay phone  it s so frustrating  i might just send this thing back  sucks because everything else is great      
792,5.0 ,                       i just received my phone so far i like it  it wwsnt no scratches or dents in the phone looks new  the camera is not the best but it will do  it was unlocked all i had to do was sign in and it came right on  switch my sim card and i m using my phone fine i love it     
793,5.0 ,                       perfect for a refurb phone   cannot tell from brand new      
794,5.0 ,                           it s a really good product especially for the price of it  i ordered the red xr unlocked and it came fully unlocked and putting my sims card wasn t a hassle  i totally recommend getting     
795,5.0 ,                       great phone  just like new     
796,5.0 ,                       i have had this phone since the beginning of may and it still works perfectly  occasionally glitches a tiny bit when i pull down to search for things but other than that it s super fast and basically brand new      
797,4.0 ,                       the phone came in almost mint condition  just a couple super tiny details that indicated it wasn t brand new  the setup went fine and when checking the functionality  everything seemed to work as indicated  when buying these phones you re guaranteed          battery health  mine was in the middle at      wish it was higher but what can you do at the price you re paying for it      
798,1.0 ,                       please do not buy this phone  they say that the phone is unlocked but it is not and the only way to get it unlocked is to go to the original carrier  however it is impossible to find out who the carrier was  i bought   different sim cards none of them worked  talked to so many different carriers to resolve the issue and nothing was resolved  i sent the phone back  got my refund  and purchase a phone directly from apple  i wish i could get all my time and energy back i used to try and get this phone to work  disappointed      
799,5.0 ,                       as of right now very satisfied with this phone  it came with a charging cable and block  but the phone is working great  i was super skeptical at first  seeing all the negative reviews  about stolen phones and locked phones  but those really negative reviews were a couple years old  so i kept a positive outlook  the phone is quick and much better than my iphone   which served me very well for its time and age  and overall this phone is in mint condition  it has a couple of surface scratches on the screen but nothing major  as for its battery life i was kinda disappointed with it being barely at     but other than that a great phone  approved by me  hope this sits well with anyone attempting to pull the trigger on this phone      
800,5.0 ,                       had the phone almost a week now and everything looks great and is working like it s brand new  i can t even tell this was a used phone honestly and it came with a warranty not only from amazon but a hardware warranty that lasts until september from apple  awesome phone and the delivery came way faster than expected  mine also came with the original charger and headphones       recommended     
801,5.0 ,                       i chose expedited shipping  and the phone arrived five days after it was ordered  there were no scratches or cracks  definitely recommend ordering     
802,5.0 ,                       best phone i ve had so far  battery life is exceptional      
803,1.0 ,                       worst phone i ever had  slow  received viruses with clean internet history and power button worked once to shut off  glass is very fragile shattered in case     
804,5.0 ,                       my phone came   days early  and it looks brand new  came with   charging cords and a screen protector already on it  there is not a single scratch or ding on the whole phone  battery life works like new  i m truly impressed and      satisfied      
805,5.0 ,                       agonized over this purchase for a week  so glad i bought it  zero scratches battery health at       it s literally perfect      
806,2.0 ,                       i got this phone yesterday and it was very very glitchy and sometimes if i opened an app it would automatically shut off and it would not work for boost mobile so i had to switch plans also it would randomly turn off and then later that night it got stuck on the apple logo and it still has not gone back to normal     
807,5.0 ,                       working good so far      
808,5.0 ,                       i m enjoying my new phone it s doesn t look like renewed everything is perfect   doesn t come with real box and original charger but i m using my old original charge without having any problem  thank you for the seller     
809,5.0 ,                       good phone waited   weeks to write a review case of the phone was scratched but i have a case on it and i m happy that the screen is new love it besides the battery because it only has a     battery health and i know it s going to drop fast in a few years     
810,1.0 ,                       this phone is not fully unlocked  i took it to my carrier which is metro pcs and it is not compatible  i can t get this phone turned on  it is not fully unlocked like advertised

812,5.0 ,                       this deal was the best price i found on the internet without having a trade in  although it is a  renewed  item  it came in like new condition  and even came with a nice protective phone case and a screen protector  also  it arrived   day earlier than expected  which was a pleasant surprise  very happy with this purchase      
813,5.0 ,                       let me start by saying i ordered my iphone xr in april  unfortunately  at the beginning of june my phone had an issue  this is usually where you would stop reading a review however  this has been some of the best customer service i have had as long as i ve been using amazon  they were quick to respond  they were quick to address my issues  and they sent me a brand new phone for no charge  i would highly suggest buying a phone from this company  my new phone works beautifully there is no external damages and i have not had any issues with my new phone      
814,5.0 ,                       i m completely surprised at the quality of the phone   not a scratch or mark that i can find   battery health at        i ve had it for five days and it seems flawless   everything functions so far it still has some apple warranty left as well      
815,5.0 ,                       i don t usually write reviews but i had to for this  this is not a scam and the phone looks brand new  it came with a screen protector on it but i m not sure they would all come with that  the battery health is still good too  highly recommended this phone     
816,5.0 ,                            perfect phone  basically brand new in operation and physical condition      
817,5.0 ,                       i recently received the phone and came across   issues and the people who sold it are very nice and answer your questions  they also gave extra things like a phone case and screen protector  very nice      
818,5.0 ,                       good phone  bought for my mom  she likes the bigger screen  she had an iphone    got the att version  no problems hooking it up  not one scratch or blemish  looks brand new  came in generic box with charger and sim pin  have bought phones from this seller before  always done me right      
819,5.0 ,                       i skeptical about buying this phone   but i am so so so grateful that i did  it is cheap  and the phone looks brand new      
820,5.0 ,                       i m very happy with the phone  it s like brand new     
821,5.0 ,                       i have been using apple products for as long as apples been a thing  i saw this product on multiple commercials and after doing my own research on it i decided to buy it  some of the best features of this product are its long battery life  user friendly interface  and low price  the iphone xr has the longest battery life out of all the iphones in its generation and it lasts me the whole day without any problems  its user interface is also very easy to navigate which makes things very convenient  the best part about this phone is its price starting at       compared to other iphones that cost       and above  there are some negatives to this phone  however  the camera  screen resolution and it is not durable without a case  the camera on this phone is subpar compared to other iphones in this generation which is to be expected at its given price point  the screen is also subpar to the other iphones as it can only go up to     p resolution compared to  k  the glass on the back of the phone leaves much to be desired as it can easily shatter without protection from a case  overall  this phone does have its drawbacks  but it is still a great buy      
822,5.0 ,                       i was a little iffy on buying the phone but i needed a new one due to problems with one i had just got and i love this phone  it came about a week earlier than estimated date from amazon and there is nothing wrong with it  i would definitely buy again  it is not a scam like some people say  took it into my carrier the day it came in the mail and had no problems seeing it up at all      
823,5.0 ,                       boo yah  my phone came in mint condition with an apple charger something people need to know about newer iphones is the materials have changed  opposed to older models that were more scratch resistant but more prone to shattering when dropped  the newer models traded in the scratch resistance factor for higher durability and less likelihood of shattering occurring  there s a coating on it and yes  you will absolutely need not only a proper case for this phone  but also a screen protector  i did not know this until after purchasing this phone and noticed some minor cosmetic scratches from my light usage my unsolicited advice if buying is to also purchase a case and screen protector simultaneously so you don t have to deal with scratching  both can be found on amazon together for under     total unless you re totally rich and don t care  then do whatever you want because this is probably your back up back up iphone      
824,5.0 ,                       good as new     
825,5.0 ,                       the phone was delivered faster than stated  looked very nice  tiny mark near the charging port  barely noticeable  did not come in the original box or with the original charger      
826,5.0 ,                       el tel fono es suficiente para lo que es  es cierto que viene con peque os puntos de ralladuras en la parte de atr s y la pantalla no es la original pero de ah  en fuera todo funciona como nuevo     
827,3.0 ,                       the speaker  for hearing on calls  is extremely low for the device i received   it is clearly a defect   one that is actually a major issue in a phone  outside of that the phone is what you d expect     
828,5.0 ,                       i purchased this phone for my daughter and she loves it  excellent upgrade from her previous iphone  s plus      
829,5.0 ,                       this was the perfect gift     
830,4.0 ,                       the phone works like new  the battery life was at      which isn t bad but it means i ll have to get another battery put in sooner than normal  the switch on the side of the phone that silences the phone is broken still  it s stuck on silent which i will have to fix soon  other than that everything is great      
831,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          the item came perfectly fine scratch free it came with a screen protector and the transition from my old phone to this phone was perfect all i did was insert my sim and boom i was ready to go battery life it did say in the description that it would be above    and mine was     so i m happy with that would definitely get this phone again     
832,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s in perfect condition  looks basically brand new nothing noticeable at all  only thing i disliked is the battery like is     but that s how my old iphone was that i just had so it s fine i guess      
833,5.0 ,                       this phone looks brand new  the battery came at     capacity and without a scratch  just wish it came with headphones      
834,1.0 ,                       no connectivity     
835,1.0 ,                          i was waiting forever for this phone  it did come earlier than expected  but it came locked        
836,5.0 ,                       this iphone xr looked like a brand new phone  no scratches or anything  battery is at     life capacity  i would definitely buy from this seller again  it doesn t come with headphones and the charger is aftermarket but it tells you that in description  excellent phone       
837,3.0 ,                       a month after receiving the phone  the audio began giving problems  during calls  the sound will be muted  not only that but also during apps usage  facebook  tik tok   the sound will be muted also      
838,1.0 ,                       it was a great phone but i had to return it to the seller because the touch display in the phone was failing  it would have costed more than half the price of the phone to fix it  so it wasn t worth it to me  the return policy is great tho     
839,5.0 ,                       my husband enjoys the phone very much  he is still getting used to having no  home  button  overall  the phone is in great shape  it works great  and we have nothing to complain about      
840,4.0 ,                       honestly i thought i was going to be mad but in all actuality i am please  it s came exactly as design and everything works properly only problem i brought it for      and they sold it for      after taxes so other than that take the chance     
841,5.0 ,                       took a chance in ordering a refurbished phone online  and was blown away  the phone was in amazing condition  came with a glass protector  new super durable phone case  new phone charger  and instructions on how to set up  would order again      
842,5.0 ,                       love my phone i switched from samsung you iphone  great transitional phone  with the swipe action i feel like i m still using android but with iphone functionality  phone came in new condition  no damage  i even updated the system  it was easy to connect to metropcs  love it      
843,5.0 ,                       don t let the few bad reviews on here scare you off the phone i got is in mint condition      
844,5.0 ,                       great phone     
845,4.0 ,                       my main complaint is right at the corner it has some very noticeable damage  with that type of damage i fear one good drop my screen will start to crack  a few minor scratches on the touchscreen right in that area  the phone itself is in good working condition      
846,4.0 ,                       i have been using this phone for a few months now  and it is has caused me no real issues  the only slight compliant i have is that the speakers sound like they have been water damaged  i am assuming that the phone was water damaged and repaired  but i am not completely sure about that of course  but again  the phone has been working great and i love it  i just simply use headphones when i want to listen to phone or talk on the phone     
847,4.0 ,                       this phone is amazing  i love it so much  everything is perfect  no cracks  broken parts  and etc      
848,5.0 ,                       the phone came in mint condition  you d never know it was refurbished  the battery life is      which isn t bad since it s   years old  it s worked great for   months now  i really like it      
849,5.0 ,                       phone like new thank you seller        
850,1.0 ,                       iphone was defective on arrival  not able to make calls using the microphone     apple genius bar performed diagnostic tests and said it could not be repaired and the microphone hardware on the phone was defective non existent customer service from this third party seller  caveat emptor  buyer beware don t walk away    run   avoid  avoid  avoid     
851,5.0 ,                       my son loves it  he is so happy  i am happy because it is alot cheaper for the refurbish with warranty than new

855,5.0 ,                       nothing     
856,5.0 ,                       best iphone i ve had  works great  had iphone   and it was awful  this phone never has bad reception  is fast and overall great  maybe it s because i didn t buy it from at t  every single phone i ve ever purchased from them has had issues so i now doubt it s apple

863,1.0 ,                       very bad  phone was glitching and wouldn t let me swipe through it and the battery life was very bad within   days of buying  the ringer button doesn t work and will only be on silent  the company that refurbished this phone has put off brand batteries into there phones and it doesn t let the phone charge

870,5.0 ,                       i love this phone  my mom bought me this phone   everyone keeps saying the charger it came with doesn t work but mine did      
871,2.0 ,                       i would be weary of this company  this is supposed to be refurbished and like new especially considering the steep price  mine came in today with faulty speakers after a  whole team renewed  it  sounded like static on a radio      
872,5.0 ,                       this is soo good     it was suppose to come next week but ended up coming a week earlier i got this for my granddaughter and she loved it   buy this product it s not a scam        
873,5.0 ,                       i was extremely nervous buying this  but not only did my phone come in perfect condition  they provided a phone case  charger   glass screen protector    it came a day early and went above   beyond my expectations       
874,5.0 ,                       when i received the phone  it looked brand new  no scratches  dents  etc  i basically bought a brand new phone for less      
875,5.0 ,                       my wife loves this new phone  considering it s renewed there were very few noticeable issues  i examined it very closely and could only find a couple smudges on the screen  none of which my wife has even seen  the battery capacity was at     out of the box  to me it is basically a new phone      
876,1.0 ,                       the phone is a nice phone but unfortunately after couple days the battery would turn hot quickly  i am also having problems with the volume  the phone hangs up without me pressing anything  there are too many things going wrong with this phone      
877,5.0 ,                       ordered the    gb blue couple days ago and i would say it is an excellent phone  work great without any problem so far  will update if anything bad happens but so far i will give this a  s     
878,4.0 ,                       came with scrapes and a ding at the bottom side  none of that was listed in the description  can be covered with a case  despite that  it s a decent phone  works like new      
879,5.0 ,                       at first i was very iffy on buying this product  based on the really bad reviews that were posted  but i took a chance because the majority of the reviews were   stars and didn t have any issues but i bought this product  and am very happy with it  the only problem that i have with the phone i received  is that it arrived with a bunch of little scratches on the screen  they can t be seen when the phone is on  but when the screen is off and black  and the light shines on it  you see all the little scratches on the actual screen  i wish that they would have given the phone a new screen before sending it  but the over all function of the device is good      
880,5.0 ,                       i was worried waiting for this product to arrive  thinking i would get something particularly scratched up  but i was surprised to find this phone was delivered in nearly perfect condition  no noticeable damage or wear  i checked the battery health        i popped my at t sim card and it worked like a charm  this is day   with the phone  and i m writing my review on it  literally  so far  i am very happy with my purchase the seller i bought from was blutek intl      
881,5.0 ,                       muy buen producto  lleg  perfecto         
882,5.0 ,                       i bought this iphone and it was the only one left in stock so i was concerned but it is in amazing and no scratches no marks no dents it was absolutely perfect i am super happy with this and will definitely buy from this vendor again     
883,5.0 ,                       received the phone in hand on   th february and so far has been flawless  everything works as expected and phone is in immaculate condition      
884,5.0 ,                       i just got my phone and i am in love  i have always been a fan of apple   this device is in pristine condition   it came in the original apple packaging and looked almost brand new  the only downside was that i didn t get any ear pods but thats ok i can always purchase   it works like a dream   no issue so far   i also love the fact that i have a warranty which i never had before with my other apple devices i got from amazon   i am really happy with my purchase      
885,5.0 ,                       so far so good  this phone is in excellent shape and is working great on all levels  my son is super happy with the purchase and would recommend amazon renewed products      
886,5.0 ,                       i was leery of ordering a phone online but i am very pleased   the phone looks brand new  no scratches whatsoever and the battery seems to be great   it didn t come with an apple charger but for the price and the condition  i don t care   overall  very pleased   i had an iphone   which i loved but the camera was horrible and i am more than pleased with the camera on this phone   i was on the fence but trust me  this phone was worth every penny i paid      
887,4.0 ,                       the phone works great but there are some visible scratches on the side of the phone   it s not in like new condition like described but so far works great      
888,1.0 ,                       arrived with scratches on back  corners  and camera  battery health upon arrival was      not satisfied      
889,5.0 ,                       was very pleased with this phone so easy to use     
890,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my uncle ted to watch my dirty pictures for christmas      
891,1.0 ,                       iphone shut down on a regular basis  updated and reset on itunes but still doesn t work properly  trying to return is difficult through this seller  product never preformed properly and we have   other that work perfectly  do not buy from this seller  problem phone from day    very disappointing nit to mention i m out like       amazon should ban this seller      
892,1.0 ,                       phone is already broken after   months  won t turn on  locks on the apple logo  very disappointing there were problems after    day warranty like touch screen didn t work well  or would screen would blink out  but the worst thing was that there was clearly not     gb like advertised and i didn t realize until the warranty was up  i would never buy from this seller      
893,5.0 ,                       the iphone came earlier than the expected delivery date  it looks perfect in condition  no damages  scratches  dent  or anything  i m satisfied  i was skeptical because of some of the   star reviews but as a seller myself i ve learned that petty people over exaggerate irrelevant factors to hurt a seller s reputation  so  i d highly recommend someone to purchase this  plus amazon is amazing with customer service and returns  it s also a very good price      
894,1.0 ,                       they said the phone is compatible with carriers  well i just got off phone with verizon  the phones are not compatible at all  very disappointed      
895,5.0 ,                       i bought this and i don t regret it at all  battery life lasted me for   day and i used it for the whole day  camera quality is very good and the condition it came in was amazing  no scratches and it looked like it had not been touched at all  i have only had it for a couple so the performance might change but its been great so far and i really  recommend it       
896,5.0 ,                       i was really hesitant when buying this phone  then i got it and it was in mint condition  battery life at      max health  screen protector on it  no scratches  nothing  just like you d buy at the store  i would recommend you buy this product because it s affordable and definitely  worth the money     
897,1.0 ,                       received my device moments ago and this is what i find  boy am i pissed  i spent      bucks on what feels like trash  of course it s used but i do expect something amazon endorsed to be thoroughly checked  cleaned  polished  buffed out  and certified  after all isn t that the name of the sub store where we re purchasing from  renewed certified   carrier unlocked       other customer have seemingly lucked out but who wants to shop anywhere where your depending on the luck of the draw inorder to secure a descent purchase  contacted the seller but at this point i couldn t be more disappointed used phone or not update  spoke to customer service  they suggest i purchase an additional phone which they ll be sure to inspect to ensure there is no damage  i m then to resend the damages until back and they ll refund that  so they screwed me for      bucks and i m just supposed to dump another      into these already untrustworthy people  what great customer service  take your business somewhere else  do no buy from these people  you ve been warned      
898,5.0 ,                       lo iba a devolver porque no soy de iphone y la verdad no me pod a acostumbrar  pero mi hijo se qued  con el  esta muy bueno todo funciona perfecto le doy             
899,5.0 ,                       was a little skeptical to buy a renewed phone but it came in pristine condition and has worked perfectly  it was packaged in generic amazon packaging with an amazon brand charger  it did not include earpods  but for the price it was a great deal for primarily the phone   i ll update down the road if any issues pop up with the phone  but so far so good      
900,4.0 ,                       i m always super scared to buy phones on here but this one was a good one  the only bad thing about it was it does have some scratches on the front screen and one scratch across the back camera but it doesn t affect how pictures come out so it s not a big deal  other wise i would recommend        
901,1.0 ,                       this phone was terrible  kept freezing  music didn t work and and it made a weird vibration like it was going to explode  i took it to apple  they said it was iphone xr on the outside and a older version inside  y all should be ashamed of yourselves      
902,5.0 ,                       the iphone xr is fabulous   however  i do not recommend buying refurbished  i bought one thru amazon a week before christmas and it works with the exception of voice calls   i can barely hear callers even though the volume is at at max   i have to use speaker phone method if i want to hear incoming or outgoing calls      
903,5.0 ,                       this is a nice phone  screen and everything looks really nice  you can tell the back has been opened replaced but no big deal especially with a case on it  came with charging cord  usb plug  sim card slot opener key thing  and a tempered glass screen protector      
904,5.0 ,                       super happy      
905,5.0 ,                       flawless   love it     
906,1.0 ,                       don t buy from this seller  iphone xr touch screen stopped working   week after we got it      
907,5.0 ,                       i was hesitant to buy this product last august after reading a few reviews from people  i am happy to report that over   months later  the product is still working perfectly and has had no issues for me  knock on wood   i would recommend this iphone for the quality  the price  and the fact that it is still a newer model phone  definitely worth your money      
908,5.0 ,                       i just got the phone today and so far so good   phone looked brand new and is working very well   the camera is amazing       would recommend      
909,5.0 ,                       mine although refurbished  came with no scratches whatsoever   crisp clean and fully functional   only thing it doesn t come with is the wired headphones which i didn t care for since i have my own airpods  comes with new charging block and use charger  very please   i was kinda skeptical at first  because i read other reviews of people having bad experiences but i didn t   my battery health was at     which is good       
910,1.0 ,                       sound and speaker not work     
911,5.0 ,                       came with everything it said it would  works like a brand new phone  even came with tempered glass already on it  which is awesome because i forgot to order some      
912,5.0 ,                       this arrived a day early  which was awesome because i had crushed my previous phone  and i was having to use an i phone    looks and performs like a new phone   best price i could find on amazon      
913,5.0 ,                       my iphone xr came in perfect condition  i bought it in late march  and right now it s early june  i haven t had any issues with the phone at all  i was very hesitant to buy this product due to the reviews  but i was pleasantly surprised       
914,1.0 ,                       i had a problem with phone  because it wasn t unlocked  so i had to go to sprint to look at for help also it has some scratches that i didn t read before buy it     
915,5.0 ,                       i m using the new phone so i can t take a picture of the phone  but the quality is very nice it s like new it does have a little scrapes but thats only because it s a renewed phone  but overall i love it and the batter life is amazing the screen had no scratches i recommend buying from this reseller      
916,5.0 ,                       the shipment was fast   i was so glad it came with a screen protector and case  that s a plus for service  so far works very well   i m very satisfied with my purchase      
917,1.0 ,                       the phone s speaker is bad  loud speaker is noisy and even in low volume  the voice comes in as cacophonous  i gave that phone as a gift to my brother  that s why i could not return it  i wouldn t recommend it      
918,5.0 ,                       loveeee  so happy that i took a chance to get this renewed phone instead of full price for it  it works beautifully  no scratches  no dents  that perfect apple quality       recommend      
919,5.0 ,                       i ve had my iphone   plus for three years   i ve never bought any phone from amazon before  i was a bit worried at first but i m so happy i did  this xr works flawlessly  it s fast   everything works on it  it also arrived a day early         recommend

921,1.0 ,                       when we received the phone  it still had a passcode lock on it  it was not factory reset  also the battery was not charging after left on the charger for an hour

923,1.0 ,                        nd day of use got the phone wet and it completely failed  obviously not refurbished to any spec  phone should withstand submerged    min  didn t last    sec  only option was return and they took  a      restocking fee even though the device was defective      
924,5.0 ,                       beautiful phone   it came with no scratches cracks   or phone looks brand new and battery capacity at      and it came with a case and screen protector as well as charger  i love it   happy customer here  ordered from chubbie

931,4.0 ,                       good     
932,1.0 ,                       bought an xr and it came with this  i can t even ship it back  i need the phone because i m overseas military      
933,5.0 ,                       my iphone from front to back seems brand new      
934,5.0 ,                       phone is basically like new  brand new battery  already came with a screen cover  and not a scratch on it anywhere  couldn t be more satisfied      
935,5.0 ,                       amazing  i just received my new phone  a day early  after setting up it works great   the battery life is      and there are absolutely no scratches or dents      
936,5.0 ,                       phone was gift for granddaughter  she was extremely pleased with it exactly what she wanted     
937,3.0 ,                       i was thrilled when i received this and quickly got it setup and started using it  it took me a few days to figure out that the microphone did not work  on calls  or recording a voice memo  the only thing getting through was white noise  i hope the vendor improves the quality assurance testing on their renewed devices  this phone was great otherwise  very good cosmetically  but i needed it to function as a basic phone too  response to email regarding the issue took almost   business days which was disappointing but they did send a prepaid return label and are promising a full refund  we ll see how that goes       
938,5.0 ,                       this product that i receive is amazing  i am so happy that i have got this phone because i ve worked for this phone for quite some time now and for the fact that i actually got it  it s great  this phone has absolutely no scratches no dent marks it came with a charger but no headphones sadly  but it s ok though because i already have some headphones  the battery life was kind of low  but i get why it was low though  i don t know why i see all kinds of replies about this product being bad but it really isn t though  it take time for it to arrive but it is worth the wait      
939,1.0 ,                       upon receiving my order for an  unlocked  iphone xr  i then renewed my cellular data with simple mobile and placed my current sim card into my new  unlocked device  however  the new  unlocked device wouldn t pick up the cellular data that i just payed for and renewed and insisted i had  no service   after phone calls and store visits to my cell phone carrier  simple mobile  i was forced to purchase a new sim card for         and transfer my cellular service onto the new card  but the service still didn t work on the device        down the drain  at simple mobile  the representative tried putting in a friends at t sim card into my new device to test if their service would work  which it did  after waiting about an hour in simple mobile for them to trouble shoot and call it  the representative confirmed that my purchase of an unlocked iphone xr turned out to be a locked phone after all      
940,4.0 ,                       phone is great  has very minor tiny cosmetic scratches on it but does not take away from functionality  even came with a screen protector and charger      
941,5.0 ,                       i purchased the iphone xr unlocked  phone overall in great condition  a few scratches on the screen not real bad or that noticeable  battery health     arrived early  i m happy  thanks       
942,5.0 ,                       i ve only had this phone for a day and it s great  just like new  it did come with a charger and cube but the cube didn t work but that doesn t bother me at all  very pleased with the phone so far and will probably buy another for my son      
943,1.0 ,                       the seller used false advertising and straight up lies  spent      on a useless piece of crap  the phone is not fully unlocked like it was advertised as and is still locked to a phone company  again do not buy these items they are falsely advertised and the seller is only concerned about getting your money      
944,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my wife and she was overjoyed  the phone was in great shape and the battery seems good  only downside was no headphones      
945,5.0 ,                       great buy     
946,1.0 ,                       i like the fact that is was a iphone xr however i noticed the phone gets really hot and i ve had it for a month now  what would be the best thing for me to do now  good thing i got insurance on it  but i didnt expect this  so unacceptable  please be aware everyone      
947,2.0 ,                       the seller claims that there will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm s length  i got a dirty phone with scratches all around   returned right away      
948,5.0 ,                       i disliked the fact that i could have bought a brand new phone at the same price the same week i received this cell phone because the iphone    was just released and all the older phone prices went down  it was a bummer as i only received the phone and a charger and i could have received the full package deal      
949,5.0 ,                       muy bueno llego muy bien grasia amazon     
950,1.0 ,                       i even could not activate this iphone also it keeps turning off and on  i don t know how amazon checked this seller and product but this is not working at all  i also trying to restore this iphone use to a computer but this iphone even can not connect to the computer because the iphone even can not recognizable      
951,5.0 ,                       everything came out perfect  if your having trust issue buying a refurbished iphone  then go buy it from kiss electronic inc very trustworthy  my iphone xr product red is perfect           
952,3.0 ,                       for the price should be better poor screen resolution     
953,5.0 ,                       the phone battery is amazing  my map is kind of difficult to use  it keeps saying that my location is turned off when in fact it s on  i took it to the apple store and they fixed it super fast   other than that i had no issues and the phone works perfect       
954,5.0 ,                       i liked it was unlocked  refurbished almost new      
955,4.0 ,                       my phone works great and i had no issues setting it up on cricket  it has no visible damage externally  but there is a small magenta line in the bottom left hand corner of the screen  only visible when the phone is turned on and displaying a darker color in that area  definitely not a big deal  does not effect phone function  but slightly distracting until you get used to it overall  would definitely recommend this product as a cost effective way to get a newer iphone      
956,5.0 ,                       worth the money works with metro pcs    few scratches but it can be covered with case i love it      
957,1.0 ,                       only had this phone since october  barely   months  it s suddenly turned off on me and won t come back on  i brought it to a repair shop and i m told it s unfixable  i guess those are the risks of buying refurbished phones      
958,5.0 ,                       compr  desde argentina y tard  tan solo   d as hasta la puerta de mi casa  el celular vino en perfecto estado y      de bater a  caja y cargador alternativos  volver a a comprar a ecommsell     
959,5.0 ,                       i bought phone for my son and it is absolutely amazing  it works just like a new phone and was in excellent condition  no scratches or dents  just prefect     
960,3.0 ,                       i got this phones over a week now and i must say i m really in love with how it shipped and how good they packed it  it even came with an case which i was happy about     they only thing i dislike is the battery life it gets low very easily

966,3.0 ,                       honestly  i knew what i was buying  although  this phone looked like it was dropped a multiple times  just know that yours could come with scratches on the side or back      
967,1.0 ,                       so i should have listened to the reviews bc this phone is pretty as crap but locked     can u say pissed    then customer service is always not there    never again        
968,5.0 ,                       bought it as agift for my brother  he loves this phone   great quality and it work with our network      
969,5.0 ,                       at first the said it was gone be delivered next week but it came the same week i ordered it and the battery life so much better than the iphone       
970,5.0 ,                       the phone came in very good condition and works well  after buying a defective one off of ebay  i was iffy about this one  but it s very nice      
971,1.0 ,                       screen was scratched when i got it  the screen scratches were concealed under a tempered glass that was shipped with the phone      
972,5.0 ,                       this was a great purchase  just like new  no signs of use  no scratches or dents  battery health is great      kinda skeptical about it at first but with amazons having a    day return policy i trusted it      
973,5.0 ,                       activated easily     
974,1.0 ,                       worked for a few days then the screen totally went crazy  not worth the risk     
975,5.0 ,                       awesome came with scratches on the back glass but it is a refurbished phone i ve had it for almost a year and it s still amazing        
976,4.0 ,                       this is my first phone purchase in almost a decade  i am going from an iphone  s to an iphone xr i asked someone for advice for where to purchase my next iphone  i have a lack of trust when it comes to purchasing phones on the internet after hearing about so many stories of people being scammed  i was told by a couple of people that amazon has registered users so i gave it a try so far i am happy with my purchase  the iphone is in like new condition with no major scratches  however  there are two little scratch indentations on the front screen  they are hardly noticeable because they are to the side of the front just off the lcd screen and screen protector and do not interfere with the use of the phone when it comes to the actual phone itself  the big screen  sound quality  and fast processor are something to smile about  apple outdid themselves with this phone  the only thing that will take some getting use to is the big slim design  i find it hard to reach some parts of the screen while holding the phone in one hand  i think there is an adjustment period  the phone was incredibly easy to set up  i just had to back my old iphone up to itunes and then restore that backup on the xr i do not like how there is no headphone jack and that the phone only has   g storage but this can be overlooked   i know that i also have the option of purchasing a different model that has better storage and a headphone jack i just thought it is worth mentioning for anyone considering to buy this item  pros great price  fast shipping time  sold from someone trustworthy  honest listing and as described  came with screen protector and sim removal tool  the phone indicates that the battery life is at     as a phone  great quality overall  the lcd screen is big and bright  the sound is fantastic  the processor is super fast  i think one of the fastest processors you can purchase in a smartphone  cons the phone came with a knockoff charger not an oem  original  apple charger or headphones  yes  using an apple charger versus using a knock off makes a difference  look into it if you do not believe me  fortunately i have my old apple chargers  the screen has a couple miner indented scratches  my finger covers the mic at the bottom of the phone sometimes when i record videos  the audio gets blocked or becomes scratchy i made this review as detailed as possible because i greatly benefited from other reviews made by other people that purchased this phone one major takeaway from all of the comments on this listing is to be careful that you may or may not get a phone that has some sort of issue  i think this comes with the territory when it comes to purchasing a renewed phone  when you are spending a lot of money on a phone you expect quality and consistency  for a couple of hundred dollars more i could have bought straight from apple  but i am happy i got to save that money      
977,4.0 ,                       i love the phone  it s prettty nice upgrade from my  s  the only issue i have is that it had a dent in the frame  but it was very minimal and didn t take away from the look of the phone  looks virtually brand new     
978,5.0 ,                       wonderful purchase  was afraid at first to spend this much on a renewed item  but product came in mint condition no scratched no scuffs  didn t come with originally charger but that s find  also came with   free screen protectors  all in all great purchase      
979,4.0 ,                       i absolutely love this phone  it came in great condition and works efficiently  it came with everything it said it would  the charger and key   my phone didn t have any scratches or cracks  i love the coral color so much  i m so glad i took a risk and purchased it  my provider is straight talk so if you use straight talk or the other providers they use and want this phone i would definitely recommend it       
980,1.0 ,                       bought phone as a gift and it was a stolen phone  couldn t use it  went through a lot of trouble trying to return the phone      
981,5.0 ,                       daughters wish     
982,5.0 ,                       i got this phone as an upgrade for my   year old  s after reading all of the reviews  i was the slightest bit skeptical at first  but once i ordered it  it arrived a week earlier than expected  the only damage i could see was some minor dents and chips along some of the aluminum corners  but other than that this phone looks brand new  it even came with a new battery i would definitely recommend buying this product  it s worth every penny ps  this phone doesn t come with headphones  but they already state that in the description      
983,5.0 ,                       i like that it last long and you don t have to have it charge for a long time and the battery life will have  the the same amount of battery that you left at     
984,5.0 ,                       i have been an android user for over    years  my family have been trying to convince me for years to get an iphone and i m happy i did  the phone was delivered sooner than the date promised and the setup was quick and easy  i would recommend anyone looking to buy a new phone to shop here first  im thinking about getting my mom one for mother s day      
985,5.0 ,                       i was a little worried ordering this with everything that s been going ok and i didn t want to get scammed but i always check the reviews on things and i seen more good reviews than bad reviews so i just decided to get it a shot and order this phone my husband were trying to pay for the phone with our carrier but it s was just a headache because only certain stores had them so we just bought it  i m glad we did because it s just like brand new no scratch or anything my husband was able to plug his sim card right up and it s started working instantly  get it you won t regret it i love this phone       
986,5.0 ,                       i upgraded from long term iphone    much like my new phone      
987,1.0 ,                       the product is defective and is not worth ordering from this seller      
988,1.0 ,                       we only had phone   day   my husband opened it set it up bought lifecase for it    tried to take phone call the speaker didn t work couldn t hear anything   took it to verizon dealer they confirmed it was defective      
989,5.0 ,                       it s amazing  everything is so good  i definitely recommend it everything works even in russia     
990,1.0 ,                       wifi works when it wants to  otherwise great phone  hard to contact supplier  not very good at responding      
991,5.0 ,                       i have no complaints  the phone came fully unlocked  i have total wireless and all i had to do was put my sim card in and i was ready to go  there was only a tiny little scratch on the top left corner of the phone  but that s already covered up by a case  they even had a screen protector put on it when i unpackaged it  totally worth it      
992,5.0 ,                       everything is good     
993,5.0 ,                       great purchase great price  i purchased this phone for my fianc  who s old phone was dying  even though he was an android user before  it didn t take long to adjust  he loves it      
994,5.0 ,                       love it works great  great quality perfect condition     
995,5.0 ,                       just received my phone  i actually ordered it as an early valentine s day gift for my bf  it came with a free case which was super helpful since i m still waiting on a screen protector  so far there s no damages to the phone at all  i was a little nervous because of some of the bad reviews but since it was      i decided to take the chance of it   i m glad i did  he loves it      
996,5.0 ,                       just like new  i m very pleased with this item      
997,5.0 ,                       i absolutely love my new xr  so glad i purchased it  i got it in coral and sometimes i wish i got it in white but it s okay  now i say where s carl  coral twd joke       
998,5.0 ,                       i was skeptical after reading the reviews but this phone is perfect   no flaws at all  i love it      
999,5.0 ,                       i did dislike how you put my iphone xr  in a generic box instead of an apple iphone box and i really like my iphone because its black      
1000,5.0 ,                       good quality  item as described  fast service  recommend      
1001,5.0 ,                       it was    gb  it was coral colored  and i did indeed receive an iphone xr that was carrier unlocked     
1002,5.0 ,                       i was going back and forth on whether to get the iphone    or the x  i found the xr and read reviews and most people are satisfied with their xr  i m glad i found this refurbished one on here  so far  the phone has worked well  i haven t had any issues   the camera is magnificent  i am using this phone with straight talk  and it took about   hours to port over from verizon  unless i missed it in the description  i wasn t aware of who the original carrier of the phone was  so that threw me off because i was trying to get the porting started and it kept tell me the phone was not compatible  turns out you have to know what carrier the phone is on in order to have the correct porting  other than that  i am satisfied with my purchase  you can t beat the price      
1003,1.0 ,                       i was so excited to get the phone for my daughter it came and it looked great the battery life was great everything went well until we went to charge it we tried apple cords we tried the cord it came with we tried about    different cords and it will not charge the only way will charge is if it sits on a charging pad so clearly the port needs to be replaced so they sent me a phone that won t even charge by the port so they must not inspect these as well as they say they do hoping the seller contact me so i can get a different one because it not convenient to have a phone the only charges by charging pad  stinks i got the phone all set up a screen protector on it and i need a different one i was nervous to buy a used phone off of amazon     
1004,5.0 ,                       i was debating wether or not to even get the iphone to begin with but it ended up working out nicely  for the negative customers they probably made sum sort of mistake on there end because in all honesty it happens  doesn t mean the seller won t help you out  there trying to make money  i had no problems an i recommend this seller because people don t appreciate like they use to  an i appreciate this phone very much  word of advise for other customers  just read the descriptions  make sure you know what your buying before you do      
1005,5.0 ,                       i ve had this phone for about   weeks now  no regrets yet haha  i m very happy with my purchase  the phone looked pretty much new when i received it and was unlocked as stated  i would highly recommend to others      
1006,5.0 ,                       i love the security of this phone first of all  the face id is awesome  i upgraded from an iphone  s to the iphone xr  huge difference  love it already  always been an appleguy always will   thank you apple and amazon  for the user friendly exceptional product      
1007,5.0 ,                       great phone  not a scam   i bought my phone and was hesitant  i have always had nothing   but great experience with amazon   i bought the iphone xr and love it even my son got one for his dad

1013,5.0 ,                       i really loved this product  it came the day after because i ordered it for one day shipping  the screen is great and it came with a screen protector  the battery life was at     which was good  i bought this   weeks ago and it is working perfectly  would recommend      
1014,5.0 ,                       this product  i was skeptical of purchasing because of the reviews  but don t listen to them  the phone came brand new  along with an original charger  but the box wasn t an apple one  i ve had it since october and i m in love  i highly recommend this product at this price      
1015,5.0 ,                       phone froze on me one time  sometimes when i touch the screen trying to select something  it takes a while to press  but other than that it works fine      
1016,4.0 ,                       i received the phone and condition is great  it has   small scratches on the screen but the rest of the phone is great  the camera is wonderful but the screen is delayed and sometimes it won t type clearly      
1017,4.0 ,                       honestly very happy with the money i paid  well worth it  the phone is almost flawless with little to no signs of use  the color is outstanding  it was easy too setup   transfer everything over from my  s  definitely recommend  it s a beautiful phone   functions perfectly      
1018,5.0 ,                       i absolutely despise the apple store  so when i saw that the xr was for      i didnt believe it at first  i expected to get some obviously counterfeit or slightly damaged goods  but instead i got a high performing spotless phone  i cant really believe it tbh but so far its performed very well     
1019,5.0 ,                       looks good so far   in pristine condition let s hope it works well too i ll be back to update  btw if you re buying from a supplier buy it from synergy  not buyspry

1022,1.0 ,                       p simo el tel fono vino bloqueado con clave y con fotos de la persona anterior dentro del mismo     
1023,5.0 ,                       it s an iphone  so it s awesome  enough said      
1024,5.0 ,                       i honestly thought i was gonna get punked but this is the real deal  and for a good bit less than what you would pay buying it in store  bought it with prime and it came even earlier than expected in absolute perfect condition

1028,5.0 ,                       it looked like a new device and worked as promised      
1029,1.0 ,                       false advertising it says it s unlocked    i got the phone in a android box then days later i found out that it isn t unlocked so i would appreciate it if i can get the carrier name     
1030,1.0 ,                       finally picked my phone  packaging looked like someone stepped on it  phone screen cracked so i will be returning it  everything else seems to be okay

1032,5.0 ,                       it came on time  looks brand new  no problems so far  so far excellent buy  i ll buy again from buyer if anything goes wrong i ll update  but i am honestly satisfied  i read the reviews to and it had me skeptical about buying  but once i seen people that felt the same way i did take a chance and they stated the were satisfied  it eased my mind a little and i m am happy i took a chance with seller      
1033,1.0 ,                       i didn t like that at first the phone with shut off on me in the middle of a conversation every now and then but as time went on it kept shutting off more and it got to the point where i couldn t use im messages any more  it was really frustrating especially when you re in the middle of important stuff      
1034,5.0 ,                       i was a little skeptical about purchasing this phone because of the mixed reviews  but i m so glad i did  if your on the fence about purchasing it don t be  go for it     
1035,1.0 ,                       the phone came crack the owner said to send it back and purchase another phone i shouldn t have to spend no more money     
1036,5.0 ,                       i was expecting few scratches or some sort of used marks  but i was surprised when phone came with perfect condition with     battery performance  it also came with new lightening usb and wall cube  i am so satisfied      
1037,1.0 ,                       for      plus tax this phone should of been in much better condition    i am very upset about this purchase    go somewhere else to purchase your phone    the customer service answered quickly  but would not negotiate an acceptable outcome        
1038,5.0 ,                       i have only had this phone for   days but have used the heck out of it already   i have not found any issues thus far and it looks beautiful    will let you all know if something changes   update  phone is still going strong and i absolutely love it        
1039,4.0 ,                       the camera came with a crack on it in the inner and outer rims      
1040,5.0 ,                       got a little freaked out by some horror stories in these reviews so i figured i d throw in my two cents  this phone is great  no scratches  battery at     capacity  everything runs smooth  came fully unlocked etc etc  don t get scared off by the bad reviews  the few people who get a bad phone are just more likely to leave a review  and if yours is broken you can j get a replacement one      
1041,1.0 ,                       i got a  s in the box     
1042,5.0 ,                       phone arrived in like new condition  no scratches or marks which was a pleasant surprise  easy to get up and running  considering a new one is      this was an excellent value      
1043,4.0 ,                       i love the phone  however  i bought the renewed premium and there s a scratch on the back of the phone and the charger doesn t work  i payed more but didn t really get the quality ensured  so i would buy the cheaper renewed one edit  i changed the review after contacting product costumer support  i received a refund for the charger and bought a new charger      
1044,1.0 ,                       do not buy  i went to get the phone activated but it wasn t unlocked because it was reported lost so i basically paid       for a brick  very dissatisfied     
1045,5.0 ,                       excellent phone  functions just like new and was very easy to set up with my cell phone company  battery life is just like new  screen was perfect with no flaws      
1046,1.0 ,                       it was a nice phone  came in good condition but when i tried to connect it to my carrier it said the phone was stolen and could not be connected  do not recommend      
1047,1.0 ,                       we bought this iphone and it does not charge at all    the battery is very low and it is at     condition and why do you do this stuff check your phones before sending them        
1048,5.0 ,                       i absolutely love this phone  amazing pictures and super easy to use  my husband and i are switching from android to apple with this phone and i don t think i ll ever go back  i was a little nervous to order due to seeing negative reviews but i watched a recent unboxing of this exact phone and i changed my mind and i m so glad i did       
1049,5.0 ,                       excellent product  very small dents on the side of the phone  isn t even noticeable  the seller included a screen protector and a case  battery could ve been better but it s not terrible           
1050,5.0 ,                       battery life awesome      
1051,4.0 ,                       i ve had several other phones from buyspry  and they ve been as nice as new   this latest purchase  an iphone xr arrived with multiple scratches on the back as well as the face   i am aware that buying renewed products can result in this sort of thing  but still          
1052,4.0 ,                       i liked the iphonexr    everything worked fine with the phone   the power cable was a disappointment  didn t work and was from some roku system or unit     looked crappy and overused from some old system      
1053,5.0 ,                       the phone works great   touchscreen  battery life  and the screen quality are all perfect   it s hard to believe it s a used phone  thank you       
1054,1.0 ,                       says it was a refurbished phone but the battery has to be charged three times a day     
1055,4.0 ,                       battery life only came at     but only paying      for a almost new phone is unbeatable      
1056,3.0 ,                       around the camera lens came very scuff  battery came at      everything else works perfectly  for being     dollars i can not complain      
1057,5.0 ,                       thank you very much description was as said and looks like brand new     
1058,5.0 ,                       very amazing had it for about   months now and hasn t crapped out on me yet     
1059,5.0 ,                       the product is just as described      
1060,5.0 ,                       my husband s iphone   was draining in just a few hours without him even using it   we wanted one that had similar features  and i have an iphone    that i like   we got him this iphone xr for maybe a little more than half what a new one would cost   nice variety of colors  works great  no problems with the provided charger cable   i m glad we found this product rather than having to buy him a brand new one   no complaints      
1061,4.0 ,                       works well however when we received it battery life was      so refurbished good however device was used  more rigorously     
1062,5.0 ,                       this iphone was really great  but there was one thing it was not durable i dropped once  and it was practically shattered but overall it was a good phone      
1063,1.0 ,                       they are not unlocked it s very hard to communicate with the seller i m still in the process of trying to get a replacement or refund with no success it s a waste of time easier to just spend the extra money and get something that actually works     
1064,5.0 ,                       i am telling you this is  cheap and the best deal  when i got it it came with a brand new original charger and the phone is awesome great battery life  no scratches      
1065,1.0 ,                       i could not activate this phone because whoever the previous owner was did not finish paying it off or it was stolen  so i couldn t activate it onto sprint because i was an invalid owner     
1066,5.0 ,                       i didn t really care for the charger that they included i wish it would of been the original one but other than that the phone as a whole is amazing it even seem new     
1067,3.0 ,                       will not work until sprint issues and activates you a sim card  tried swapping card from old phone and will not work  i have to take it in to get activated      
1068,5.0 ,                       i was very skeptical to order it from amazon after reading all the comments but it came in without any defects and i am very pleased with the phone itself       would definitely recommend     
1069,1.0 ,                       the phone was listed as renewed   all carriers    apple iphone xr     gb  black   fully unlocked  renewed  however  when i went to the t mobile sprint store  the technician indicated that the phone was locked  after i stood in line to await my turn  i am disabled and have limited stamina and mobility  this mistake may seem minor  however  it was a major issue for me   i had to find a store to print my return label  then i had to locate an open usp drop off center   with waiting in line  and travel time  these tasks took over two hours  i absolutely love  love  love amazon  however  this phone issue was disappointing  i will have someone to help me purchase a phone locally  i appreciate your consistent outstanding customer service   thank you and happy  holidays      
1070,5.0 ,                       this was bought as a gift so i have not used it myself  i have not received any complaints and if their had been any issues i would have been informed   i chose this company because of competitive pricing      
1071,5.0 ,                       as advertised     
1072,5.0 ,                       i like it a lot because of face  recognition and i didn t have to type password all the time  it s pretty easy to use it most of the times      
1073,1.0 ,                       received my iphone xr on        wasn t able to connect anything to the bluetooth  it just kept spinning  reset the phone and tried different options still spinning  called apple support and learned that the bluetooth antenna is bad  they are going to charge      plus to repair that and i just paid about that amount for the phone      
1074,4.0 ,                       everything  is fine with the iphone xr  only minor scratch made me not      happy      
1075,3.0 ,                       face id not working properly  suspect camera issues  won t recognize a face and keeps zooming in and out i gave up  just ignore that feature     
1076,5.0 ,                       i purchased this phone for a friend that lost her phone and she hasn t had any issues with it so far  once you receive the phone  it comes factory reset like a brand new iphone from your provider or the apple store  i plan on purchasing any phone for myself from now on like i did with this phone      
1077,5.0 ,                       yhe phone came quicker than expected during holiday which was suprising  it works fine   stars     
1078,5.0 ,                       me arriesgu  y compr  este iphone a ecomsell y realmente es igual a nuevo  esta impecable sin ning n detalle ni marca          recomendado

1082,3.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          i received the product and it seemed  nd hand as well as it came without headphones  i m not happy that it has scratches already  however the phone is perfect     
1083,5.0 ,                       i received my xr     gb black  two days ago to replace two iphone     gb units i have used since       it has been worth every cent  i wanted dual sim  one physical sim card and one esim  and it works flawlessly on the two completely different networks i use  one for my local country and the other my roaming number from my home country   the device arrived in a generic box and with a generic lightning cable  which looks and feels much better than the original lightning cable from apple  as indicated by the seller but the unit itself is like new  i even have apple care for one year from the date of purchase  there is not a scratch or blemish anywhere to be found  whether on the front or back the xr is obviously a huge step forward from the    which is starting to show its age  at the price i paid  this is an exceptional bargain  so i purchased two identical devices so that my so does not feel left out      
1084,5.0 ,                       i love my new phone and the plus to my phone is that i paid less then i would of in store and it s also come with a screen protector which i was going to buy myself but i don t have too and it come fast also will which is another plus it s been   days now and i love it

1086,5.0 ,                       im not gonna lie to everyone at first i was a little hesitant about the buyer from some reviews but i gave it a chance    two weeks in and so far the phone is perfectly fine so i highly recommend giving it a chance

1093,1.0 ,                       i cannot even explain my dissapointment with this purchase  not only is the screen scratched and the top scuffed but half of the freaking speakers dont work at the bottom    total rip off to say i bought brand new      
1094,1.0 ,                       the face id has never worked on the phone it s faulty and the seller had to have know that it was before it was shipped to me  pissed off and disappointed to say the least      
1095,5.0 ,                       just like new  came with a screen protector and a case even  no headphones but came with charger and sim card ejector thing

1100,5.0 ,                       when i got the phone i was a little worried about the reviews   so far the phone works basically brand new   saved a lot of money going this route and i would again in the future     
1101,2.0 ,                       it has scratches all in the back and battery life         
1102,1.0 ,                       i brought it to apple because it wouldn t connect to cellular and they took my phone and won t give it back because it has  third party parts   i paid way too much money for my phone to not be given back  do not buy this phone because it will break     
1103,5.0 ,                       this phone came with no scratches anywhere or even on the sides  has great battery health  and is in great shape  the phone also came with apple charging cable and power adapter so that was great  i didn t get any earbuds which i was okay with since i have airpods  i would definitely buy from them again

1105,5.0 ,                       i love it       it s fully unlocked   it s in immaculate condition  i checked with apple and it is      authentic  i paired it with my apple watch with no problems and i m in love  i would recommend getting a heavy duty case   i m not really clumsy with my electronics but if you are get a case  money well spent  thank you   it also arrived very early   yes it comes with a charger but it is not an apple charger   it is a brand new knock off but it does it s job   also  it came with a mint mobile free trial inside the box   don t listen to the bad reviews   get this deal while it lasts      
1106,5.0 ,                       works like expected  new condition  the vendor went out of their way to get it to me  thank you     
1107,4.0 ,                       for a refurbished phone it is very good  there was a little dirt in the speaker at the top of the phone  it did not hinder my ability to listen  and the phone came in a android box  other then that it is a very good phone and worth the price     
1108,5.0 ,                       couldn t even tell this phone was used  would ve like an oem charger tho      
1109,1.0 ,                          days after my return window has closed and my apple iphone x that i purchased from this company has completely shut down  it s frozen on the apple icon and i ve tried several  boot loop  trouble shooting methods  nothing  i paid almost      for this  total loss as far as i can see and conveniently i m not able to contact the seller  absolutely disgusted  i am a long time amazon customer  i have bought at least four iphones from amazon  many other electronics  appliances  housewares  clothes  pet supplies  etc  if this cannot be resolved i am through with amazon      
1110,5.0 ,                       iphone xr works well       battery life indicated  and in great physical condition   just like a new phone  setup was easy as it was configured from an iphone   plus backup  great deal

1112,5.0 ,                       perfect     
1113,1.0 ,                       this didn t work  i sent it back and still trying to get my refund  do not buy from this seller  amazon isn t being helpful either      
1114,5.0 ,                       great phone with great battery life  my only gripe was the phone had no charge upon arrival     
1115,3.0 ,                       i refused to accept delivery of the phone as instructed by seller  i did not order the phone and did what they told me to do  i hope to receive confirmation of credit soon  the seller has been more than understanding on the two previous phone orders  much thanks        
1116,5.0 ,                       overall the phone is good  a few minor scratches   i m writing this with my old phone while the new one is setting up edit  phone works good   i m only using it in my house for now because i drop things too much edit  march   th   the phone keeps shutting off on me   i work a lot with my phone      
1117,5.0 ,                       i don t usually write reviews but this was really great  i order my phones off of amazon a lot and i m skeptical every time  but i m super happy with this phone  no damage  everything works super fast  and i got it activated through at t with no problems  great product        
1118,1.0 ,                       they had a disclaimer upfront that the battery was at least at     capacity  so i thought  cool  that just means the phone will die a little faster  this was the case and then some  as i was transferring my things from my old phone to my new one  i kept the new one on the charger and fully charged it before use  when the transfer was done i was very content with my new iphone and was readily exploring the new features  the first thing i noticed was that the new phone was unable to display the battery percentage  i found this pretty odd since every other phone can do this simple feature  a few minutes later  i receive a prompt letting me know that the battery in my iphone was not genuine and that i needed to call apple support  after a conversation with apple support  they suggested that i send the phone in for diagnostics and repairs  and because we are amid a global pandemic  i knew this would take forever  but i had no choice  so this now leaves me   weeks later with no phone back and a feeling of regret      
1119,5.0 ,                       this phone is absolutely amazing  everything works perfectly and the camera is incredible quality  the sound is so loud  i love it so so much  thank you        
1120,1.0 ,                       top left corner of touch screen does not work  the cancel icon in top left corner does not work   some apps require top left corner icon for functioning   i tried resetting phone to manufacturers specs and started fresh again   but still the top left corner does not function      
1121,5.0 ,                       i was a bit scriptural at first because i had never bought an iphone from this person at such a low price but this is amazing  i have bought two already  it s worth the money guys trust me      
1122,5.0 ,                       this phone is amazing for the price  works great and was super easy to set up  arrived on time and is exactly what i ordered  comes with a charger that works and charges fast   i recommend this seller      
1123,5.0 ,                       battery life is amazing touch screen works great    and screen is definitely viewable        
1124,5.0 ,                       i got pretty scared when i saw the reviews and the pictures that were being left by some buyers but decided to purchase anyway since it has a    day return policy  it is awesome  it is in amazing condition  seriously looks brand new  the battery health is    and it is so quick an beautiful  i upgraded from a  s to this one and i am so happy  can not recommend more  i feel lucky to have found this deal      
1125,5.0 ,                       i was beyond exited when i saw that the phone had no scratches on the screen  i was a little disappointed when i saw that the battery life of the phone was      besides that i m totally in love with the phone  at first i was very nervous because i had never purchased a phone for myself  overall  not bad besides the battery life everything is amazing      
1126,5.0 ,                       the refurbished iphone xr arrived in excellent shape   perfect screen condition  no scratches on body  no visual damages at all   the phone looks brand new   battery is at       the seller even threw in a few screen protection sheets and a protection case   very much appreciated   just for reference  earlier a competitor sent me a xr at a     higher price with a screen in terrible condition  three visible scratches that became even more noticeable when the phone got powered up    i returned it   shipment costs on me     refund has not been issued yet   so  it is a gamble      
1127,5.0 ,                       received   days early   phone looks brand new  original charger was nkt included but that isn t a concern for us  completely unlocked and my son was able to transfer everything over and switch sims card and start using it right away      
1128,4.0 ,                       four stars because the fedex that was used to ship was terrible  would have preferred usps or ups  however  the phone looks amazing and is working great so far  wonderful communication with seller and i would recommend      
1129,5.0 ,                       i use this produce for everyday purposes  i m more then happy with my phone  it was truly unlocked iphone  it also came    days early   perfect and would buy again     
1130,5.0 ,                       had a small scratch on the screen other than that it s perfect my husband loves it phone came days early the seller communication is great as well     
1131,1.0 ,                       no sirve no trabaja    se apaga solo     
1132,3.0 ,                       i understand the phone is  renewed   when i unpackaged the phone i noticed a weird spot on the bottom of the screen  upon further inspection with a magnifying glass  there was a chip and crack in the screen  i tried to contact the sellers and received no response even after two emails  i have several iphone xr s in the family and they are good phones  my compliant is with the seller and receiving no response  i kept the phone  it s for a    y o that will probably crack it anyway   i was hoping for just an exchange  but i couldn t even get a response      
1133,5.0 ,                       i love the bigger screen size  touch screen is flawless  videos are very nice  i don t use my tv hardly at all  mostly my phone to watch movies  battery is better than average     
1134,1.0 ,                       this phone was horrible  the phone did not come on at all  even after having it on the charger for a while   it had scratches  i will never buy anything from this seller again         
1135,5.0 ,                       so far a good purchase  i purchased an iphone xr from the seller trademore  i received it   days after purchase  much faster than was expected  it came nicely packaged and clean  it came with a charger and a sim card tool to transfer  there were some scuffs around   corners of the phone where it was previously dropped  luckily they are veryyy light  the battery health is at      also i purchased a    gb and received a    gb  so i am not complaining  lol i m enjoying the phone and it s been a great experience so far  thank you      
1136,4.0 ,                       it was not      battery life but that is understandable either way everything else is fine  i definitely recommend      
1137,5.0 ,                       i love the phonexr had it for    weeks and it works perfect  i didn t get headphones with it but being refurbished it didn t come with the  usual  stuff  i am so happy with the price and functionality of this phone  i contacted the sellers about something the day i got the phone and they replied the next morning and helped me with all my questions  i am more then pleased          
1138,5.0 ,                       i was a little skeptical ordering a phone like this online  however the seller guaranteed a return if the phone did not work out  my phone was like new  i swapped my sd cards and went about my business  everything turned out perfectly      
1139,1.0 ,                       extremely disappointed in this product and the fact that apple is the seller standing behind the product  i spend      on a product that claims to be  renewed   specifically detailing the following   professionally inspected and tested to work and look like new  with minimal to no signs of wear  by an amazon qualified supplier  who is not apple certified   the phone has signs of wear and tear  front to back  as shown in the attached   not what you d deem  minimal to no signs  and absolutely not what you d seem as  like new   i hope amazon improves the quality of their products  specifically ones advertising as new for almost the price of a new phone sold directly through apple      
1140,5.0 ,                       just got my renewed xr  i would ve assumed it was brand new if it weren t for the small scuffs on the edge of the phone  scuffs so small i wouldn t notice them unless i were trying to look for them  very happy with this purchase  hope it gets me through the next few years      
1141,5.0 ,                       me encant       
1142,5.0 ,                       i bought this phone for my son  i was very sceptical because of some bad reviews i read but took a chance  i am so glad i did  my son loves this phone and there was no damage whatsoever  i have not got it turned on yet but for the price and how great it works it doesn t matter to me if it s unlocked or not  thank you        
1143,4.0 ,                       love it  works perfect  like brand new and i had no problem setting up service  i was worried because i saw a few bad reviews but i think that was just the competitors  i received mine from verizon pre owned      
1144,5.0 ,                       i love this phone  i ve been meaning to get it replaced for a while and i thought this was gonna be crappy and lag a lot but i ve had   problems like that  it s been a few months now and the phone is still going great      
1145,4.0 ,                       todo bien lonunico malo es que la bateria no duran el tiempo establecido     
1146,4.0 ,                       very scared my phone was not going to be what i thought it was but i got it a day early it works perfectly no problems at all  the reviews scared me but it had the best rating and many good reviews aswell thanks so much for my phone guys i had cracked my other iphone and also got it from amazon in perfect condition it was just time to upgrade so don t be scared like i was about buying it it s totally worth it especially since it is refurbished         
1147,5.0 ,                       so happy with my purchase  i did have a problem with the sound of my calls at first but i call amazon  renew and they sent me a return label right away and i was able to send the phone back  i received an email   days later apologizing for the inconvenience  saying they received my phone and my new phone on its way  i received my new phone the next day and it worked perfectly   i m not only happy with the phone but very pleased with the service  will definitely recommend buying from them if you need a phone   oh i forgot to mention the free phone case and screen protector i also received with the phone  pleasantly surprised     
1148,4.0 ,                       came in good condition  however there was slight damage from shipping but was not noticeable  after   days of usage  the battery health went from     to     the phone can overheat easily which caused the battery to weaken  but  everything else is perfectly fine  i highly recommend this phone since it was very cheap and worth the money      
1149,5.0 ,                       i really like it no scratches and the phone is unlocked any company     
1150,5.0 ,                       this is the second iphone xr that i buy from amazon renewed  all i can say is that these phones are almost in new condition  as for battery life they have came in around     at maximum capacity  witch for being more then      off then original price i don t mind getting it second hand  plus you get    day warranty  so it s a no brainer  make this purchase  you won t regret it      
1151,1.0 ,                       the listing says that it is fully unlocked  i called my carrier and they informed me that it was in fact locked  other than that the phone was in almost perfect condition but i couldn t activate it with my carrier so that s worthless  it s a shame because the battery life was at          
1152,5.0 ,                       very pleased with the product bought the xr    gb  phone looks and feels like new didn t get any headphones or oem charger but i did get a   ft generic one overall im satisfied with the product     
1153,5.0 ,                       i searched high and low for any defects or scratches and found none      percent battery life  it came with an off brand charger cable and box but i m not complaining      
1154,1.0 ,                       message the seller for return and didnt get response screen keeps going black when im on a phone call or playing music and left in idle  screen dosen t want to come back on just the back light with no picture  i have to turn the phone on and off several time to get it to come back on      
1155,1.0 ,                       paid almost      for this phone and it will randomly turn off  lost my laptop so i was unable to return within the     days  so i m stuck with a      iphone that doesn t work  i gave it to my    year old to play games on  it s turned off randomly on her   or   times already  save your time and money do not buy from these rip offs        
1156,5.0 ,                       thank you     
1157,5.0 ,                       love it     
1158,5.0 ,                       the phone came in perfect condition and unlocked  no scratches found m  would highly recommend     
1159,5.0 ,                       phone works great got it very quickly seller was networkstore no scratches or anything looks brand new     
1160,5.0 ,                       first phone without the  home  button  i enjoy the larger usable screen area and learning to use the phone without the home button was quick  product was shipped out fast after ordering and in secure packaging  good because the outer box perhaps had extreme weather and taken hits from larger packages      
1161,5.0 ,                       phone is really good and no scratches or cracks at all  had to go to sprint because you can t go from an   plus to an x series and still use the same sim card  sim card costed    bucks so no worries  phone was fully unlocked and everything as advertised      
1162,5.0 ,                       it was just like i expected no more issues     
1163,5.0 ,                       it was on a very good shape overall  good opportunity to buy a high end phone at a budget price     
1164,5.0 ,                       this phone is great    it arrived ahead of schedule it was securely boxed and sealed no scratches or dings  thus far the batter life is good  camera takes clear picture perfect pics the setup was very easy and the phone looks good in the case  this is a good phone for the price  so don t hesitate to buy one     if anything should change in the next    days my review will change      
1165,1.0 ,                       voice not working well when i get or make calls  not sure how the return works      
1166,4.0 ,                       my daughter loves it so happy dad here      
1167,1.0 ,                       the phone is on a bad condition  has alot of scratches on the screen       
1168,4.0 ,                       great phone  love everything about it  particularly the camera  battery life could be better      
1169,5.0 ,                       haven t had any issues with the phone  wanted something for back up and ive actually used it for my main cell phone because its working great      
1170,5.0 ,                       it arrived early and in great condition  i m really happy that the battery life was at     as well so it should be good for a long time      
1171,5.0 ,                       you would never know that this phone is not brand new  it works great  there was not a scratch on it  and the battery life is great  i am glad i took a chance on this because it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone  well worth the money      
1172,5.0 ,                       i ve never left a product review on amazon before  but based on all the negative reviews i felt i needed to share that i got a brand new phone for      less than i would ve on apple  no dents or scratches or imperfections whatsoever and battery capacity is       love it     
1173,5.0 ,                       amazing performance and flawless look  been enjoying it since the day i got it with no issues or problems      
1174,1.0 ,                       not renewed like amazon likes to claim these products are  is not near like new  to be fair is in good condition  but that wasn t the deal when the advertise   to look and work like new   i have bought refurbish phones before that you can tell they were summited to a reconditioning process  not this phone  it looks like my actual phone that i have been using for   months  the amount of dust and sweat that loge by the conector and speaker holes tells me that this phone has been use for at least a year and they barely wipe it before shipping it to me    kind of nasty to be honest am giving it another try and i hope i get what they are advertising      
1175,5.0 ,                       it s great  not a single scratch  i put my sim card in and it automatically worked and my service and everything was up there  i was scared at first but i m glad that i bought it        
1176,5.0 ,                       so far so good love the battery life  the only issue right now is that there was a software update along with me having my hearing aids updated  the problem right now is that i m only able to link only one hearing aide and not both right now  waiting for the next update to make determination     
1177,4.0 ,                       phone arrived on time  did not receive an apple charging cord but cord provided is of good quality and works fine  battery life is very good  phone is fully functional and works fine  my only complaint is the screen has several scratches in upper corner which i did not notice right away  my advice would be to check phone screen well before activating      
1178,5.0 ,                       the battery life isn t that great  but overall the phone is great and works fine has slight scratches but not noticeable      
1179,5.0 ,                       the iphone xr was a present for mother s day and was like new   worked great and processed insanely faster than its iphone   plus replacement   camera was great and easily backed up data from old iphone   the battery was in red when first opened  but nothing a simple charging didn t correct highly recommend this product     
1180,4.0 ,                       bought it as a present for a family member and they loved it as they transitioned from huawei  but battery is not efficient no headphone jacks and doesn t come in the original box  charger is not an apple original charger overall the phones camera quality and processors are very good      
1181,5.0 ,                       its work perfectly      
1182,5.0 ,                       still haven t try battery   c mara  because it is a present for my daughter but so far perfect  beautiful cellphone  a lot of complements at cricket store  brand new   doesn t look refurbished     
1183,5.0 ,                       i was sketchy on buying this phone because i never bought a phone off amazon before  but when i ordered it  it came in a matter of     days  it came with a charger and a charger box  had no scratches  and works really well  it even came with a screen protector that was already placed on the phone  i am happy i ordered this      
1184,5.0 ,                       been a couple months and i love this phone slid my sim card in and had a working phone within seconds definitely recommend buying from this supplier thanks guys      
1185,2.0 ,                       there was a lot of scratches on the sides of the phone i thought i was buying this new     
1186,5.0 ,                       just as described  not a scratch on it     
1187,3.0 ,                       the phone is amazing  has everything i want  unfortunately had an issue with connecting with my carrier seller responded quickly and helped resolve our issue      
1188,5.0 ,                       yesssss  this phone is immaculate and a dream come true     
1189,5.0 ,                       i would prefer a clearer screen     
1190,3.0 ,                       the phone works great  but i was expecting it to be in a little better shape when i received it  the back of the phone has some dents and scratches the screen has something on it can t really tell  i would purchase this item again just not from electronic deals though      
1191,5.0 ,                       man of man where do i start      i must say that i searched high and low for an affordable iphone for my son birthday as he wanted to switch over from android and join the apple world like his dad and i  that is when i landed on this baby right here  i have never been one very fond of renew devices because of how the appearance might look of issues with the device itself  but upon receiving this device from amazon it blew my expectations out of the water  i was completely amazed by how like new this device looked it came with a screen protector and case and a    day warranty guarantee what else more can a mother asked for  my son was over joyed ands loved his phone which made me really happy to know that it put a smile on my face as well as his  i will definitely be using amazon in the future for device purchases      
1192,5.0 ,                       this phone what like new no damage or anything i made a great choice     
1193,5.0 ,                       great phone  works great  probably will get beat to death by software updates once apple comes out with the    or    because apple does that a lot  so as long as you remember that it will be forced into obsolescence within a couple years  it s great      
1194,5.0 ,                       this product is awesome  i was scared because it was so cheap but it turned out to be fine  everything works perfectly fine and it even came two days early       recommend     
1195,1.0 ,                       it s day two of having this phone and i don t know  it could crap out on me but so far  it s working great update   yeah i jinxed myself here  when i make calls i can not hear the other person on the other end  it sounds like they re in a tunnel lol  horrible waste of time and money so i m returning it asap but hey you live and you learn right a learned note here  do not buy refurbished off amazon  better to head over to bestbuy or the cellphone company you already have and see what they have for refurbished  they thoroughly test products before sending out and clearly amazon s third petty sellers don t good luck my friends      
1196,5.0 ,                       i was only slightly hesitant to get a refurbished phone but i m so glad i did  i got a beautiful coral colored iphone xr and it looks brand new      
1197,4.0 ,                       overall satisfied with this phone  doesn t have any problems functionality wise  and came with      battery health  so no complaints there  but it had a scratch in the top corner of the screen  and some scuffs on the body  i got it with the     discount  so these issues don t worry me  wish it would have come with the lightning to    mm dongle  but again not a big deal considering the savings i got     
1198,5.0 ,                       beautiful phone for a great price  how can anyone complain  this was purchased to help keep my son safe at school  he has experienced the worst form of bullying and still stands firm  thanks amazon renewed      
1199,5.0 ,                       this is the first renewed phone i have ever bought on amazon or anywhere  this phone feels and looks brand new  i would never have known it was refurbed  not a single scratch or dent  powered up perfectly and works great  i have nothing negative to say about this phone  i am glad i bought this here and gave it a chance and didn t end up spending my whole life savings on a new one      
1200,4.0 ,                       love the phone  i received my phone with no problems  i was able to connect it with my carrier      no problems  over all a good experience      
1201,5.0 ,                       great     
1202,1.0 ,                       don t buy from digital tech  came with scratches all over front and the charger it came with was a usb c charger     
1203,4.0 ,                       honestly the phone isn t bad for a renewed one  battery efficiency came at     so that s pretty good  only thing i found upsetting was the camera quality  the quality on mines wasn t the best  when you aren t in good lighting  the pictures have android quality  however  when you have nice lighting or go outside  the lighting looks amazing      
1204,5.0 ,                       i was skeptical because of the reviews but this is actually the best purchase i ve made  came with no scratches or any problems whatsoever  battery life is at        screen works perfectly  and it s truly unlocked   so happy with this phone       
1205,5.0 ,                       great condition came with     battery life but that s ok for me    tiny microscopic scratches that you can t even see when you put a tempered glass screen protector at all overall great don t believe the negative reviews         
1206,5.0 ,                       i love this phone  absolutely not a scam  i wanted to spend the least amount of money and still get a good quality xr so i was a bit worried about the quality of this one because it was the cheapest one  but it is great no problems at all  no scratches  dents or anything and works like new      
1207,5.0 ,                       just what i wanted  works great      
1208,1.0 ,                       i am so disappointed  whenever i touch the screen it goes where it wants  freezes constantly  last straw was it froze and i had to wait for it too die before i delete all my information off of it  what a waste of my money      
1209,5.0 ,                       i purchased for my grandson s   th birthday  the touch screen and screen quality is awesome  he is constantly showing me the features of his phone  i would like to add that technical support is awesome  not only for a problem  but to help you navigate through the functions of the phone  don t forget to order your  i phone case and screen  protective glass  through amazon  can t beat the prices   happy i didn t listen to negative reviews  not a scratch  dent  or broken screen  excellent condition      
1210,5.0 ,                       we bought these phones  renewed premium  in coral for our granddaughters for christmas  i was so pleased when i opened the box for each phone  they came nicely packaged and look brand new  to say these girls were thrilled is an understatement  the price was also better than any we found elsewhere and i like the fact that amazon backs them with a year warranty      
1211,5.0 ,                       i was very hesitant to not buy this based on some bad reviews but i did anyways  when i received my package i was very excited and when i opened it and took out the phone  it was in excellent condition  no scratches  no marks  no scuffs  about perfect  the only downside i have about this is that the my battery percentage is     but it s okay      
1212,4.0 ,                       dont look at the bad reviews guys im telling yall this phone is good i promise and im not a robot i bought the phone because i have never had an iphone and im not impressed with the battery capacity life it was at     but its not terrible and i can work with it besides that everything else is perfect ive downloaded all my apps and stuff on it and im going to transfer it to the plan that im on once i get paid again i give it a    out of     if the battery life was a little higher i would rate it higher but everything is working great and im satisfied with my purchase thank you     
1213,5.0 ,                       i can t believe how well this phone looks for it to be renewed  omg  fast shipping  i was having trouble logging into the cloud  but i guess i forgot my password and locked myself out  lmao  but it s cool i made a new cloud account  thank you     activated and working flawlessly      
1214,5.0 ,                       i was so scared to spend over     before i see the actual product but i m glad i did  this phone doesn t even look refurbished it looks brand new and works very well  no issues so far and it was easy to switch service

1227,5.0 ,                       i was really skeptical about buying this but i was pleasantly surprised after i received it  my phone came in an almost perfect condition  no scratches  screen was intact  the camera worked well  and it is covered under apple warranty until november       i love it so much  i purchased it from chubbiestech and the delivery was quite fast  i ll update this review after a couple of weeks of using the phone      
1228,5.0 ,                       the iphone is in a really good shape  and it arrived earlier  the only issue was that it didn t come with the iphone pods which i thought it would come with its box     
1229,5.0 ,                       awesome experience  phone got here a day early  was in excellent condition and we had zero issues setting it up  very pleased with this purchase      
1230,1.0 ,                       my product cannot turn on  i paid over      for a product that does not work  neither can i return for refund nor replacement because of restrictions  i shop on amazon every single day and this is the treatment customers receive  this is totally ridiculous      
1231,5.0 ,                       great phone  works perfectly      
1232,5.0 ,                       i was a little skeptical from reading the reviews on this phone  but decided to buy it anyways  it s in perfect condition  absolutely no scratches or marks  battery life is incredible  shipped fast and was delivered quickly  came with charger  overall very pleased      
1233,4.0 ,                       i ordered this for my daughter  i was skeptical about it but it works great  the only thing is that the battery life if short but she is a teen and always on her phone  the phone was gently used a couple minor scratches  i would purchase again      
1234,5.0 ,                       really good i loved it i got the black iphone xr   no scratches  my battery percentage was      which is really good  came in   days way earlier then expected  really good presentation works really well by far i ve had it for a day and i m super satisfied with the results so worth the money and it worked with my cricket carrier     super good job love it      
1235,5.0 ,                       love the phone works amazing it did not include headphones which i m fine with but it should have  came in with a charger amazing  everything works fine     
1236,2.0 ,                       opened it up to see multiple  very obvious scratches on the screen that you can see from arm s length away  i wouldn t have paid      for a phone that looks like it has been dropped on it s face numerous times  i won t be returning it because of the hassel but i won t buy from this seller ever again  the phone screen was also dirty when i took the plastic lining off      
1237,1.0 ,                       when i first got the phone it looked ok but when i went to get it turned on they said its not unlock     
1238,5.0 ,                       she loved it and it works good too     
1239,2.0 ,                       the phone works great but it did not come in a apple box  the cube and charger were not an apple brand  the camera quality is android quality  going from a iphone  s to this phone felt like a down grade  i would much rather pick my phone over this on  if the camera quality doesn t bother you go for it      
1240,2.0 ,                       me llego con un ray n muy visible y grande      
1241,5.0 ,                       in perfect condition cosmetic and functions  happy buyers here      
1242,5.0 ,                       phone came in great shape no issues what so ever  i was a bit worried with it being renewed but as soon as i opened the box all the worries went away  the product was easy to connect to my service and has been functioning properly for the last few months  great deal i would definitely recommend      
1243,5.0 ,                       just as advertised  beautiful phone  does not look used at all  works perfectly      
1244,5.0 ,                       great buy and saved a lot of money  most definitely will buy again from this company  my phone works excelente and it looks super new no even one dent or scratch  guys these people are the real deal and the device  works great love it and saved hundreds of dollars      
1245,5.0 ,                       great phone     
1246,5.0 ,                       i loved everything about the iphone xr  the display is very nice  just large enough to easy see what s going on  for the size of it   it was surprisingly light i definitely would have kept it  if it wasn t that i needed the best camera possible just for my work  i am a micro blading technician  taking pictures of my work so  in short if you need a great phone with a great camera for everyday use then the iphone xr is the sure one to buy  i like the iphone xr actually better then the iphone   pro that i have now  but again the camera for work made the decision for me      
1247,5.0 ,                       great phone       
1248,5.0 ,                       i received my phone today  got it all set up and everything transferred from my old iphone to the new iphone  no trouble out of it  works great  no scratches or dents  looks like new  i love it      
1249,1.0 ,                       nunca lo recib    estoy sumamente desepcionada y muy enojada me he gastado casi     d lares o m s en un tel fono y en   meses est  roto sin golpes con cuidados extremos  su pantalla no funciona      
1250,5.0 ,                       battery life is about normal of an iphone  while playing games all day only charging once  the touch screen is a bit hard to get to work greatly likd other phones however that may be the screen protector and stylus i use  if the new ones i buy fix the issue ill correct the review      
1251,5.0 ,                       i am so impressed  i was very skeptical to say the least in relation to the quality of device i was going to get  so pleased    fully unlocked model worked immediately with my cricket wireless chip  phone and screen in perfect working condition  instantly worked with my iphone  plus  all data  and photos  transferred without issue  worth every penny      
1252,5.0 ,                       this product was very satisfying  i wasn t expecting such a nice refurbished product  at first i was hesitant to buying  but i have never been more pleased  highly recommend      
1253,5.0 ,                       thank you seller  unblocked      battery health  no scratches      
1254,5.0 ,                       my daughter saved her money all summer to purchase the phone  she was so happy when it arrived  product was in great condition  no scratches or dents and it worked perfectly  it was such a good experience i just purchased one for myself  should receive it this week      
1255,4.0 ,                       everything worked out great  shipped on time and there is no visible damage on the phone  the only problem is that one of the speakers  sound quality isn t great  may have been damaged from the previous owner  however  i understand that this was refurbished  so that is okay  thank you      
1256,5.0 ,                       delivery was fast   phone works properly     
1257,3.0 ,                       looks great  feels like a second hand manufacturer though being honest  not in an apple box or with an apple case charge it s a store bought charger  i thought everything was good till i discovered a crack  thought it was the screen protector so i take it off to change it and there s a crack right along the e in update if you look  so kind disappointed     
1258,1.0 ,                       terrible service   the phone was clearly written as for sprint yet i take it to them and it s locked in to t mobile   therefor i cannot use this phone at all       
1259,1.0 ,                       was unable to use with metropcs imei   was blacklisted was a display phone     
1260,5.0 ,                       it arrived on time  i bought for my son  it has great battery life  good as new  no complaints here      
1261,3.0 ,                       everything was clean and there were no scratches at all  it came with a glass screen protector already attached to the screen  it had a charger and box the only bad thing is that the battery health was at         
1262,5.0 ,                       wow  it came so fast  it actually came before the date  and in great cosmetic condition and it works great  my fianc e is gonna love it  i m a real person from newark nj and not paid or nothing like that  but im a satisfied customer  and i will be purchasing again real soon  this time for myself      
1263,5.0 ,                       arrived on time and was of perfect quality  absolutely no blemishes or flaws and was unlocked i was able to easy transfer all data from my old iphone to the xr in less than an hour  battery analytics show     would recommend and purchase through seller again      
1264,4.0 ,                       love this phone  i made the switch from an android device to this iphone xr and the difference in camera quality and speed is quite substantial  although  the phone came with one broken speaker grill at the bottom  a missing screw next to the charger port  and a quite noticeable scratch on the top left of the phone  these complications did not effect my every day usage  so far i have been able to use the phone without any problems      
1265,5.0 ,                       came without any scratches or dents  works great after i realized the sim card goes in with the gold panel facing upwards  received a month ago with     battery life  after a month use of charges with usb c   w cable  battery life is the same      
1266,5.0 ,                       my son saved up his money for months to buy this phone  he loves it  it s a good phone and it has survived a lot being that my son is      and i love that he bought it himself        seriously  not because i don t want to spend my money  but because it s teaching him that money doesn t grow on trees and sometimes you have to wait to get what you want   he is also learning how expensive things truly are  great life lessons all around      
1267,4.0 ,                       phone came in a very good condition with some cosmetic issues on the screen nothing major just regular use   battery and performance are overall perfect  fully unlocked i just inserted the new sim and it was working just perfect     
1268,5.0 ,                       phone arrived sooner than expected nice surprise of course  package was in generic box however was protected in bubble wrap and fit the box  no big to me  phone was in perfect working order right color no starches anywhere and completely unlocked  very happy with my phone at a fraction of the cost      
1269,5.0 ,                       shipping was extremely fast  especially with all the delays of covid     phone arrived pretty much brand new  with only light scratches caused from previous owners keys and such  can only see them if the screen is off and you re looking for them  battery capacity was at      bought this as an upgrade for my friend who had the iphone    she absolutely loves it      
1270,1.0 ,                       i bought it for my daughter  the phone came in looking ok  set up was easy  but some apps won t install won t even come up on app store  some music apps say that it s not being able to install because this phone was originally from china or india and some music apps can not due to royalty  called apple and they agreed to the same situation  i have contacted the seller  they said ok no problem we can return  i asked if this can be fixed  they said first have to agree to keep the phone then they can help me  but was not sure if it was a good idea      
1271,4.0 ,                       it s good product in general  but the charger doesn t work  and it comes with no headphones  so that you know      
1272,5.0 ,                       this phone is amazing  as an iphone user since i was     this phone rocks and as it may take some getting used to not having a home button it really didn t take as long as i thought it would and it takes really good quality pictures  absolutely love it     
1273,3.0 ,                       it s refurbished so i was not expecting perfection   the phone itself came looking beautiful only defect was the red paint around the camera lens was chipping away but the rest of the phone was perfect   however the charger it came with did not work at all so i had to order a new one   not good    also the screen glitches a lot   it will touch things  type when my finger is not even on the screen and sometimes too when i touch the screen it doesn t work   i will have to click it off and on again for it to move   it works for the most part and the camera is ok but probably if you want an iphone just go buy a new one     
1274,1.0 ,                       phone was unlocked and fully functional but was an  international phone  and wasn t compatible with sprint t mobile even though it had stated it was all carriers so had to be returned     
1275,5.0 ,                       absolutely worth the money i have had this phone for about   months with no issues and it works wonderful  i have straight talk      
1276,5.0 ,                       i love that my phone arrived earlier than anticipated  it arrived very quickly  it had one or two nicks but being that it s a refurbished phone i guess it s fine  i love my phone and glad i ordered it  i was so torn about inheriting a used phone and not knowing if i was making the right decision but so far so good      
1277,5.0 ,                       i was skeptical about this purchase  but the phone is perfect   fully unlocked for any carrier  so far no battery life issues  face id works perfectly  even inside of other apps  i m very happy with my purchase      
1278,5.0 ,                       for personal reasons i had to return the product without opening the packaging     
1279,1.0 ,                       my new iphone xr flickers the screen try restarting it and updating it did not work it is still the same  it does not work  i want my money or a replacement that works properly      
1280,5.0 ,                       i had reservations about buying a  refurbished  phone but the deal was so good i had to try and it s just like new not a scratch runs great and i am ecstatic to be able to get a great phone for under     bucks which seems impossible now a days     
1281,5.0 ,                       my renewed iphone arrived very quickly and in amazing condition  no flaws at all on the outside  came with off brand charge block and new charge cord  batter health was at a maximum capacity of     so that is the only sign of wear i notice  excellent value for the money      
1282,5.0 ,                       i love this phonegreat buy     
1283,5.0 ,                       i was very impressed by the quality of this refreshed iphone xr  the phone looks brand new and the battery health is still at      there is only one minor scratch on the screen which is only noticeable if you look very closely      
1284,5.0 ,                       i m not going to lie i was skeptical of buying a refurbished phone but i was promised    days to figure out if i wanted a refund for it  it has been a couple of weeks and i can say i will be keeping it  the battery health was      when it arrived and it had no scratches or damages plus they included a screen protector  it did come with a charger but it was not an apple charger  if you re on the fence about buying a refurbished product i say go for it and return it if you find defects      
1285,5.0 ,                       sorry i m late making this review   the phone came in perfect condition   i waited to see if there would be any late issues there has not  i m very satisfied with this purchase  i will purchase again in the future

1287,5.0 ,                       everything worked perfectly for me  came with a sim card removal tool  moved my old sim card to the xr and followed the on screen instructions to effortlessly transfer everything from my old iphone      
1288,5.0 ,                       not a scam  works perfectly fine  does come with a screen protector on it but the screen protector isn t the best mine lasted   days with it one it  good battery life i can be on it and not have to charge it till about      pm pst  from about      am to      pm is when i m on my phone

1290,5.0 ,                       ni un solo rasgunio  no detalles que hicieran ver como usado   de no ser por la caja  el equipo esta en condiciones de nuevo     
1291,5.0 ,                       tbh i love the phone nothing has happened so far just got mine today but wondering why people are giving it bad reviews but in any case love the phone       
1292,1.0 ,                       i bought this phone and put my wireless carriers sim card in it  calls and texts will work but the internet will not  it reads e  it will not connect to  g or lte  i spent hundreds of dollars on this phone that i need today and all i found out all i can do is receive a refund    days after they receive the phone back  i am very upset  everything else works fine but the one thing that is needed to make this phone work does not work      
1293,5.0 ,                       phone works perfectly and has no visual effects  very pleased with the seller and the phone

1295,5.0 ,                       i m glad i upgraded from the  s plus to the xr  i love the battery life and the camera quality      
1296,5.0 ,                       don t waste your money on buying a phone from the apple store buy one on amazon this phone is amazing works just as well as the ones from apple i love it      
1297,5.0 ,                       what exactly what i ordered we didn t know it came with a protective cover      
1298,3.0 ,                       bought     red   blue one    sending blue one back for refund  speaker was blown or something  full volume didnt work in any mode on the phone  return process was very easy to do  kept the red one     working great     
1299,5.0 ,                       the phone came with all the necessary accessories and they also added in a phone case and screen protector  also the battery has a capacity of     which is really good  no scratches or problems with the use of the phone  a great buy overall      
1300,1.0 ,                       i recently purchased this item received before due date and has failed tone a quality working item   have had issues since delivery date connecting to my carrier   this phone is as puce of garbage     
1301,1.0 ,                       my daughter saved for months for this phone and what a disappointment it is that it will no longer allow her to download apps  wanted credit card info but no matter what type of card we try to use  visa  mastercard  etc   it says it is not supported  she has no subscription that would require a card anyway  tried doing a full reset on it and creating a different apple id but still won t download apps      
1302,5.0 ,                       i received my iphone xr today from kiss electronics  and i was very impressed  the phone was in very good condition  no noticeable scratches or dents  and came with a charger and cable   a screen protector was even affixed  the battery was charged to more than    percent   i was able to set up my apple id and face id recognition   my sim card from my other phone was instantly recognized on the iphone and i had to configure no other settings to get it to work i am highly impressed with this purchase and would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat      
1303,5.0 ,                       amazing deal  probably one of the best around for genuine iphones  only possible downside is that i feel the battery is not as long lasting as i had imagined     
1304,3.0 ,                       too bad phone was not up to par  minor issues but the seller was more than helpful and took care of the problem right away  i will do business with them anytime      
1305,5.0 ,                       this phone is in excellent condition  there are no physical marks on it and the battery life is well over      touch screen works perfect  the speakers are so loud and i was surprise with a nice phone case and screen protector that i love so much  guys i was skeptical but i swear i got a brand new phone and it was worth it  i also must say the seller is very pleasant and answered my every question on time     
1306,5.0 ,                       was kind of skeptical at first  kept stalling buying the iphone because i wasn t sure if buying it brand new directly from apple would be a smart decision  really glad i decided to take the plunge   came in a timely manner  was in perfect condition  very tiny discoloration at the corner of the screen but that s negligible  the risk was probable  got the black one  and was glad i got basically a new one for about      less than the brand new price  hoping that this phone lasts me many more years           
1307,5.0 ,                       excelente     
1308,1.0 ,                       sent phone to my cousin in argentina   he tried to activate it and it came up blacklisted as stolen  so they won t activate it   seller won t respond and won t send a prepaid label to return the item  it will cost      to ship back       
1309,3.0 ,                       phone came in okay condition the body of the phone looked brand new  the front and back glass had minor scratches but are very visible  battery health came at      please don t buy this phone with the expectation of being brand new  you re basically just taking a chance  overall  it s a okay  phone not a great one      
1310,1.0 ,                       screen was lifted off the shell of the phone  scratches around phone also  do not recommend to anyone  i get that s it s renewed but the screen should not be lifted like someone replaced the screen incorrectly      
1311,5.0 ,                       well it s my first iphone and it s awesome because i m already a mac user  the best thing was the store i bought it from  they put a glass screen protector and included an extra long braided cable and fast charger  awesome referb  in perfect conditon      
1312,5.0 ,                       i purchased   of these before i read the reviews and after reading the reviews it made me nervous   got the phones today and both of them are in great shape    looks brand new  battery maximum capacity is     of both phones   no dings or scratches   plugged my sim card in and it picked it up automatically     this was a great buy     so far         
1313,4.0 ,                       good phone    very clean    looks like new    battery  health

1318,4.0 ,                       i ve heard so much about i phone  i ve been a life long samsung galaxy user  i know that i phone is simple to operate but totally backwards from what i m use too  i made the switch for better security  i did purchase an i phone xr which i m told seems to be there budget phone  my         samsung has a better crisper picture and seems to take pictures just as well  i ve only owned the i phone   weeks and admit i haven t totally figured it out yet but i have enjoyed it thus far  i m still partial to my samsung tho      
1319,2.0 ,                       phone arrived with defective front facing camera which made it impossible to enroll a new face id   seller responded to complaint immediately and offered refund and return labels   very good customer service  just wish the phone worked   fast ship  good customer service

1321,4.0 ,                       the overall process was great  i received the phone earlier than estimated   was very nice  i gave it a lower rating for price simply because it s just hard to believe the price of iphones   from the old school generation   i would use this supplier again

1325,5.0 ,                       great phone  works perfectly  all i had to do was switch my sim card  screen had no scratches  or marks  only problem is battery takes a while to charge  but overall  is definitely worth purchasing      
1326,5.0 ,                       arrived quicker than expected   amazing phone   super easy to set up  just had to put the sim card from my old phone into this one and boom ready to go     fantastic came with a charger and block  already fully charged and came with a screen protector  above all it s a great phone  i love it

1329,5.0 ,                       i bought two of the iphone xr in white  they both came in great condition  the battery life for one was at      and the other one was at      i recommend the phone and the carrier to anyone      
1330,4.0 ,                       purchase of iphone xr  renewed  went well  as the phone itself works like new  with only exception being the installed battery barely at     maximum capacity      
1331,3.0 ,                       the phone came with alot of scratches on the screen  definitely not happy about that

1334,1.0 ,                       i have bought not one but   different iphone xr fully unlocked white from this seller   the first one i received was attached to somebody s number i figured okay not a big deal i ll just return it and buy another one well i buy the second one and i go and i try to activate it and there telling me that the phone needs to be updated by apple okay i call apple and they say nothing appears to be wrong with the phone i will send you a email saying everything is fine and the phone is unlocked okay go in to try to activate again and they say that there s something wrong with the device information call apple again turns out that the phone has some kind of activation lock needless to say another dud that has to be returned     
1335,2.0 ,                       the screen is starting to go black where i can end a call or text at times  i haven t had it butt a couple months and it s already giving me trouble  not happy very disappointed and not satisfied  if i could i would love to have a replacement for this phone  the red one i ordered      
1336,1.0 ,                       terrible do not buy from this company  they will ship you a phone full of scratches and dents  the phone is so scratched up it s discolored      
1337,5.0 ,                       i m really enjoying my phone so far   i ordered it on sunday       and i received my phone on       even though the app said it was going to arrive on friday  so i got it a whole two days earlier  and the phone arrived with no cracks  very few blemishes noticeable  a screen protector  and a phone charger  also fully unlocked as mentioned in the phone summary  the phone as mentioned doesn t come with headphones which i knew about  i already have headphones anyway  the phone battery life is at      i m loving this phone so far and i m so happy and i went for it  after screening the reviews for weeks on end i m very satisfied with my purchase        
1338,1.0 ,                       bought this iphone  description said it checks everything before it s sent out  i got my phone everything was ok until i tried taking a picture with the front camera and it was blurry  i cleaned it   turns out the camera was scratched  then as i m typing the keyboard goes from letters to numbers automatically  now i have to wait even longer to receive the right phone as a gift  they don t see things thoroughly      
1339,5.0 ,                       the phone works well  apple has never had a long battery life and this one is no different i don t claim to be a photographer but the pictures seem fine to me  i do like my new i phone      
1340,5.0 ,                       i didn t know how i felt about buying a refurbished phone but after i read the reviews i got comfortable enough to buy it and i do t regret it one bit best buy ever only down side is not a real apple charger  no earphones and no sim card     
1341,5.0 ,                       zuper good service and the phone look like new not problem i recomend the seller

1344,5.0 ,                       i was a little nervous to buy this product just because anything not  new  is never promised to be worth the price  if i had not known myself that this was refurbished i would have thought it was new  everything works perfectly and though it didn t come with an apple charger  it did come with a charger and wall plug that works fine as well as a case and screen protector  pleasantly surprised with this purchase     
1345,5.0 ,                       love it   came early   came with a screen protector   all   no scratches or dents       i have the product red       came from the coral to red   i love it so much better      thankyouuu  definitely would buy again   recommend

1349,5.0 ,                       very happy with this purchase   checked the battery health and it shows     max capacity like brand new  no scratchesperfect for my teenage boy      
1350,1.0 ,                       no me agrado el telefono  que insatisfecho con amazon y con la compa  a que venden este celular porque pedi mi telefono desbloqueado para t mobile y resulta que no est  desbloqueado porque otra compa  a lo bloqueo  no recomiendo que compren este celular por amazon         
1351,5.0 ,                       i was a bit skeptical at first but i took the risky of buy a blue iphone xr  i am very happy    it came like a brand new phone  i was very impressed  i will definitely be buying from this seller again          
1352,5.0 ,                       i am so happy with my product  phone came with not one issue i swear it looks as if i literally just purchased it from store  i dont understand why anyone would give low rating complaining about charger being factory charger when everything was explained in description  product came super early and even gave me a screen saver  definitely purchasing from this dealer again     
1353,5.0 ,                       for the price i paid i m highly satisfied  the phone came earlier than expected it also came with a case  value         screen protector and a charger box  feels like new  i would definitely buy from this company again      
1354,5.0 ,                       i bought a renewed iphone from amazon   months ago  it was in very good condition  almost new    months later  it is still working just as it should be    problem  for      less than a new from apple  this is a very good deal       
1355,5.0 ,                       for a used phone it s literally brand new  i can t find a scratch on it      battery life  i read a lot of bad reviews and was very skeptical at first but i am very satisfied   i will post an update if i have any problems that turn up     
1356,5.0 ,                       this product came in really well condition  like brand new condition  amazing packaging  the phone is indeed unlocked  and i was able to have my mobile carrier switch over my service  highly recommend      
1357,5.0 ,                       as expected      
1358,5.0 ,                       it came withe a screen protector    it looks perfect  i haven t used it yet  but the phone came super early and i don t have amazon prime and it came   days early   thanks so much     
1359,5.0 ,                       what i dislike is the left speaker that doesn t work but it s still good quality  i m assuming these are used refurbished phones  which i ve been purchasing refurbished phones over the past two years and they work great       
1360,5.0 ,                       face id is very disappointing   only certain lighting conditions work but     of time it does not work and have to punch in my code   frustrating to say the lease because i and    year old disabled vet with shaky fingers and my other iphone was very good at face id opening and on aps   dr  holmgren     
1361,5.0 ,                       this process was nothing short of spectacular  i immediately found what i was looking for and actually received my device earlier than expected  when i opened the box i was surprised to find what looks like a brand new phone  as someone who is in the cell phone business i can say that you ve checked all the boxes on this one  thanks      
1362,5.0 ,                       phone arrived in a timely manner  great condition  and no problems getting it registered on a phone plan      
1363,5.0 ,                       buenas condiciones     
1364,5.0 ,                       i was skeptical of ordering a renewed phone from a seller where amazon wasn t fulfilling the order  but the seller  chubbiestech  came through with a great phone that was legit  checked the serial    etc    i ve seen no issues at all  but i ve only had it for half a day  i m confident it ll last the    day guarantee but i ll update the review if anything comes up  so far so good      
1365,2.0 ,                       the rest of the phone was fine but the speaker at the ear level was broken i guess they do not check these issues out when they clearly state as such in the description      
1366,5.0 ,                       phone is perfect  it literally looks brand new  and the battery was also brand new at      will definitely recommend thank you so much for a wonderful experience      
1367,3.0 ,                       product is great exactly as described     
1368,1.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          pantalla levantada en la parte inferior  eso no es un detalle menor  si bien la pantalla funciona bien se mueve al presionarla y eso deja mucho que desear del control de calidad del equipo     
1369,5.0 ,                       definitely has met expectations  would buy again            
1370,5.0 ,                       hello  this iphone xr is amazing  the battery lasts so long i don t really need to worry about it dying  it didn t come cracked or anthing  it just took long the load the update  other than that  the phone is amazing       
1371,5.0 ,                       perfect condition   didn t come with any of the original gear but the phone itself looks like it just came from the box  put my sim card in and it worked like a charm      
1372,3.0 ,                       a few knicks on the phone but my main concern is the bottom of the screen is lifted  called left hm and order number  being xmas no idea if i ll be able to get in touch with anyone  the bottom literally is lifted and makes noise when pressed  screen has visible damage item not stuck on reset erase  beware       
1373,5.0 ,                       awesome phone   very fast     
1374,1.0 ,                       the camera does not work properly  it will do the zig zag lines down the screen  i have contacted seller and they have not responded  phone does not ring half the time volume does not work properly     
1375,5.0 ,                       i wasn t sure about spending this kind of money on something i didn t think was legit until i read the reviews myself  and i amazon itself has never gave me no bs so i felt like i made the right choice and i did  i totally recommend buying this phone from them to anybody  i ve worked my ass off this and i m so happy thank you so much to whom ever      
1376,5.0 ,                       just want to say i love this phone  i purchased this phone because i was having issues with another  unlocked phone and every since i placed this phone onto my service i have been having the most  excellent signal  no issues and the phone does not get hot while charging and on facetime  and the white color is growing on me lol      
1377,5.0 ,                       just received my phone a few days ago   it was in excellent condition   the quality   battery life is like new  super satisfied      
1378,2.0 ,                       screen came scratched  put in a return request    minutes after i got it from the post office  no response so far    days       battery life which was good  but no one wants a phone that is scratched on the screen     
1379,2.0 ,                       the battery port on my phone doesn t work as it should  i ve woke up several times where it said my phone was charging when i went to bed and it s almost dead when i get up  only specific chargers work with it as well   and have to be put in a certain way  definitely not happy and dissapointed     
1380,2.0 ,                       battery life sucks   it was suppose to be a gift for my sister and i sent the phone overseas but the battery won t hold a charge and dies quicker than it should  very disappointed     
1381,5.0 ,                       works great  thank you      
1382,5.0 ,                       product works well as described happy with purchase     
1383,5.0 ,                       i received the phone ahead of scheduled date  it has a brand new appearance  no scratches or defects  i have it it three days now and everything is in working order      
1384,1.0 ,                       the phone cannot be used because it was stolen and blacklisted     
1385,5.0 ,                       arrived as described and on time     
1386,4.0 ,                       no scratches no finger prints no cracks on the screen  the iphone xr is great for most purposes  social media  games  and streaming videos  which makes it very convenient  it does indeed have a     p resolution screen  after getting to level    in hole io the amount of objects loading and your hole s size started were what i believe started the temperature of the phone to raise  battery life is very useful  it can last the whole time your awake      hours  on     brightness  in fact  i m using it right now to write this review  my only real complaint is the price  most iphones are very expensive  but for the newest model iphone this is pretty cheap      
1387,4.0 ,                       amazing phone  i previously had a    came with charger cord and block  good packaging  has scratches on the screen mainly at the top but they are barely visible and it s expected  the only way i see them is when i flash a light and look really close  no dents  good battery        amazing camera  the reviews were very troubling but i went with my gut and i m glad i did  amazing phone      
1388,4.0 ,                       i needed a new phone  i did not want to spend major amounts of money on a new phone so i started looking at reconditioned phones  i am usually pretty skeptical about reconditioned items but thought i would try this one  i am very happy with my purchase and it seemed to be better than the description on their site  it showed up on time and even had a way to return it if needed      
1389,3.0 ,                       loved everything about this iphone xr but had to return it disappointed   the audio level of the ear speaker was much too low  tried all manner of adjustments and tips   i don t think the ear speaker was defective  this seems to be a design issue   too bad  but my old iphone   is much clearer and louder at the ear      
1390,1.0 ,                       the phone had scratches all on the front of the screen  after we got the phone activated and workout it would crash every five minutes and reboot and then wouldn t connect to the cellular company  we returned the phone    days after i shipped it off i contacted them they said my item had arrived already and my refund would come in       hours  terrible product  terrible communication and customer service      
1391,4.0 ,                       the phone is great  but it arrived with the screen protector cracked  the seller has been unresponsive      
1392,4.0 ,                       i m submitting this on the purchased iphone xr   getting used to more  sliding  of apps   wish phone would  pair  more easily with car radio via bluetooth   older iphones paired with car radio seamlessly       
1393,5.0 ,                       this is amazing  i just upgraded from a  s cracked almost completely broken phone to this mint perfect coral xr  it s truly beautiful and you ve got to hold it for yourself to see how great it is  all around amazing      
1394,5.0 ,                       the phone looks good with no stratches  its working good so far  and it works with cricket       
1395,5.0 ,                       great purchase the first i ordered didn t work so i bought a new one and it works perfect thanks      
1396,1.0 ,                       the iphone xr was not legal to activate wasted    hours trying to activate phone with apple and my carrier and it was impossible because the phone did not qualify for activation      
1397,2.0 ,                       bought as a mother s day gift it worked fine first week then phone kept shutting off on its own and a message would pop up saying can t confirm battery is an original apple battery and would shut off  sent back waiting on my refund      
1398,1.0 ,                       i bought this phone with the sense of assurance from the amazon verified retailers  when i received the phone it was stuck in a constant death screen and could not even be verified when hooked up to a computer  if a single person even attempted to check it  they would see that it would not even power up  either they don t check  or they don t care  don t let the positive reviews sway you like they did me      
1399,5.0 ,                       the company is great   had a problem with the first phone and the took care of me   thank u       
1400,5.0 ,                       the phone is just like new   i even have apple care    although the battery life is at     but i m not a heavy phone user so i m grateful          
1401,5.0 ,                       i got this new iphone when my old one went for a swim in the pond in my backyard  i have not wanted to spend the crazy amount of money on a new phone that they were asking  so i went with a renewed phone  i was not disappointed  the phone looks brand new and acts brand new  i am so glad i made this choice      
1402,5.0 ,                       i bought the black iphone from chubbiestech  it came clean with a charger  cable  and hard screen protector i can apply myself  it looks almost new there s a small shallow scratch across the top of the screen which i notices during my initial inspection but i haven t noticed it since then  i ve been using this for over   weeks now the battery says it s at     health but it fully charged and lasts forever  i have had   issues  i m very pleased with what i received and would order from them again      
1403,1.0 ,                       my iphone did not come with an official apple charger  cable and it didn t even come with headphones  why did i not receive those two things  that was not specified in the description at all      
1404,3.0 ,                       i ve had my phone for   weeks now and all day today my phone has been freezing and the screen has been turning black  when the screen is black it won t got back to the regular screen for like   minutes     
1405,5.0 ,                       yea i was also worried about ordering a phone from the internet  let alone refurbished  but it arrived in perfect condition  great phone  fully unlocked  no complaints  great camera btw     
1406,1.0 ,                       this devices and not even wiped  still had stuff from previous user

1408,5.0 ,                       great for the price  it s like a brand new phone      
1409,5.0 ,                       this an amazing and cheap product      recomend     
1410,4.0 ,                       phone looked brand new  was super clean and ready to rock  unfortunately unlocked phones do not work with boost mobile only boost mobile devices will work on their network in the usa  perhaps seller doesn t know this but may consider adding to description  i tried repeatedly to plug in the imei on boost s website and it kept spitting out an error message  after calling support  they said they could not swap me to this device  oh well      
1411,5.0 ,                       i received it early and looks good for the price  just a few minor scratches and no headphones but it was expected like it said on the descriptions  i was reading some reviews and i was worried but i got my phone in good condition working perfect     
1412,5.0 ,                       lovely  so good and excellent cell      
1413,4.0 ,                       really good all around  only a few problems the speaker on the phone isn t very loud and won t allow me to set up the hey siri   but other than that the phone works like perfect      
1414,3.0 ,                       the product it s self works good  but i was sent a charger that doesn t work  i was just assuming if i were to pay for the phone it would come with a working charger too      
1415,1.0 ,                       compre este iphone xr el   de febrero del      y hoy    de junio del a o      se acaba de da ar    meses de uso y se da o no les recomiendo comprar un tel fono reconstruido   repente se apago y no quiso prender mas     
1416,4.0 ,                       got phone today a day earlier than promised  phone seems to work pretty good  there are minimal signs of wear on the off and volume buttons  but other than that it looks brand new  battery life was    which is pretty okay      
1417,5.0 ,                       only problem with it is when i go on instagram theres a glitch where i cant see all videos published on the app mind you this usually never happens on an xr  from what im hearing this is on instagram s part but i would argue otherwise  other than that  a  quality     
1418,5.0 ,                       exactly what i needed  no hassle prime shipping  i highly recommend     
1419,5.0 ,                       phone looks like new  pleased with the purchase great seller      
1420,5.0 ,                       great phone for the value  i haven t owned a apple phone since the  c  they have come along ways  i would buy this again in a heart beat      
1421,5.0 ,                       i got my order way before the estimated delivery  my order came in good condition  no scratches or cracks  which is great  it works well and the item was in safe packaging  i highly recommend ordering      
1422,5.0 ,                       i m in love just got it    minutes ago  very happy with the phone  slight signs of usage  scratches around camera  but the camera it self is perfectly fine so is the body of the phone and screen  only issue was the shipping being delayed by a day or so lol  but i m very content and happy   order it do it     
1423,5.0 ,                       battery life was at      the screen had no noticeable scratches  back of the phone was super clean everything works fine chubbiestech is the seller and i will buy from them again  for under      it comes with a screen protector and a high quality clear case  i might not buy a new phone again lol thanks chubbietech     
1424,5.0 ,                       iphone xr was in good condition  as described  shipping was prompt and i received the phone early  i ve been using this iphone for a week and it performs as it should  i just popped my sim in and setup in a few minutes i was ready to go      
1425,2.0 ,                       everything is good on this phone except for one thing  it won t activate when i put my sim card in  the cellular update keeps failing  i was thinking that maybe it s the sim card or something like that but it s most definitely the phone  i must have got this from a bad batch because at t couldn t even help me  if apple can t help me when i go to them  i ll have to do some further action      
1426,4.0 ,                       this phone is a great deal for the price  the only reason why i didn t give it   stars was because it had a few scuffs and scraps around the sides  i don t mind them so long as it doesn t effect the phones quality or efficiency  the battery life could be a little better  but i don t know if that s apple s fault or the seller  either way that doesn t deter me either  i will be purchasing from this seller again in the future if they continue such great quality products i will update this post in a few months to let everyone know the life of this phone as well  i plan on keeping this phone as long as it lasts  which will hopefully be up to   years      
1427,1.0 ,                       un desastre  lo tuve que devolver porque me llego inoperativo      
1428,4.0 ,                       screen isn t broken   great shipping  bug display and it being referbished honestly can tell the difference     
1429,1.0 ,                       scratches all over  the phone functions  but it s no where close to what was expected or described as like new      
1430,5.0 ,                       after i purchased the phone it was shipped in the morning and arrived very quickly  as it only took   days to arrive  the phone has no scratches or dents  the battery came with     capacity and the seller also included a free charger  the phone also worked perfectly fine with my sim card  overall  very fast shipping and great quality      
1431,4.0 ,                       so far so good  i just got the iphone yesterday and nothing seems to be wrong so far  the battery capacity is at     which isn t too bad since it s refurbished  it came with the plastic wrapping  the box  block  and charger  i almost thought it was completely new when i first saw it  there are no scratches on the phone  i ll edit the review if i find something wrong      
1432,5.0 ,                       i love this phone  i know it s not new but it feels brand new  mine had zero scratches and zero dents  the screen was in perfect condition  i would recommend this  i was a little scared because of some comments that i saw but it s worth buying it      
1433,5.0 ,                       received my phone exactly on time and it s amazing      
1434,5.0 ,                       i got the phone yesterday  until now everything is going well  the battery came with a     life that is pretty reasonable  the only thing that i didn t like is that the camera has a few scratches on the borders but it doesn t affects the photos quality      
1435,5.0 ,                       i absolutely love this phone  i was very skeptical and scared to purchase due to the many bad reviews  i decided to give it a try anyway  because i really needed a new phone  best choice by far  literally looks exactly like the picture  the screen is amazing   and the picture quality is even better  the setup was literally under    minutes  and it took only   seconds to switch my sim card to this phone and my service was automatically connected  also for those who want to know  this is compatible with cricket  i am a cricket customer and you literally only have to change the sim card over  now i was coming from a iphone   so i had to flip my sim upside down to fit in properly  if you don t feel uncomfortable doing it yourself you can totally go in a store and have them do it and it s free  wish i had pictures but i m currently using it      also it doesn t come with headphones but i did purchase airpods  plus i had my own set of headphones  it does come with a charger  the charger isn t from apple so i decided not to use that charger  but everything else is great  it comes very secured in a brown box packaged very well  and the shipping was super fast  i ordered my phone on a thursday it came on saturday   definitely would recommend      
1436,5.0 ,                       the fact it s completely unlocked and functional is fantastic  always been skeptical of buy pre owned but im glad i stuck to it battery life isnt as good as i thought it would be but its good enough to last a decent length      
1437,4.0 ,                       i received the phone early  it came boxed nicely and with a charger and wall mount  not upset i didn t receive earphones as i already own air pods  a no scratches no cracks or dents  camera is excellent as expected and phone is beautiful  i ordered it in the color blue    gig  great buy      
1438,5.0 ,                       my red iphone xr came in perfect working condition  fully unlocked  and      battery life  i have only had it for a few hours and i m in love  thank you       
1439,1.0 ,                       i wish i didn t have to give the seller this one star because they don t deserve that  the phone came with a black charger that wasn t the original   no head phones  but i didn t care because the phone was perfect no scratches or dents   it was unlocked i was sooo happy  until i got to the t mobile store   wasn t able to put the phone on my account   the number on the back of the device was already in use  waste of time   money   i did send the phone back      
1440,5.0 ,                       i was nervous to buy a phone off of amazon  i am not disappointed  the phone looks brand new  no scratches or signs of wear   doesnt come with original charger but still comes with one  no headphones which idc about anyway  overall great purchase and very very pleased      
1441,4.0 ,                       happy with purchase   got complimentary screen guard and case  however i did not get the sim remover tool in the box  otherwise it was worth getting this       
1442,5.0 ,                       i ll admit i was a little hesitant at first because when i first purchased a phone from a different seller  it didn t come in good condition  i was stuck with the phone for about three months until i decided to upgrade to the xr  all i can say is that the phone arrived in great condition and it came early in the mail  i would definitely recommend this      
1443,4.0 ,                       i bought this phone about a month ago and love it so much  but i have a problem with it  whenever i call someone or someone calls me my audio doesn t work  i don t know what s wrong with it  but whenever i put my audio on speaker my audio works  i just wish that my audio worked      
1444,1.0 ,                       purchased this phone because it stated fully unlocked and shipped to a dpo address   waited almost a month for the phone to arrive  then it didn t work with my singapore sim card and now i have to pay shipping to return the phone   very disappointed      
1445,5.0 ,                       at first i was very sceptical about buying a refurbished phone but this phone is really good      
1446,1.0 ,                       el tel fono parece en buen estado  pero no tra a auriculares y el cargador que recib  no sirve    la verdad no aconcejo comprar a este vendedor     
1447,5.0 ,                       very surprised when received   the iphone xr looked brand new   no signs of use anywhere on the phone   battery life maximum capacity is     which was comparable to my old iphone   the price was great as well   while it comes with no sim card  i was able to pull the sim card from my old phone and use it in this one   the data easily transferrred and within a hour or so i was up and running on the new phone        
1448,5.0 ,                       fast delivery  came with front and back screen protector and cord  plug  excellent product  like new  easy to transfer from old iphone  highly recommend seller      
1449,1.0 ,                       phone was unable to be activated on an existing verizon account due to the phone being on a stolen phone database now  i don t know if this is true or they just say that to get you to buy their phone  but they couldn t wouldn t activate the purchased phone at the verizon store     
1450,4.0 ,                       it had a little scratch a first but that didn t bother me  the first night i had it started to kinda froze but i had powered it off and the next day it was working fine besides that it has been working perfectly it has a great camera and face recondition seems to be working fine i was scared to buy it cause of all the bad reviews but i m glad i bought  the battery life compared to my old phone is amazing i only charge it during the night and it lasts me the whole day      
1451,4.0 ,                       i m happy with my phone so far  i ve now had it for about   months  no issues so far and it came with a screen protector already installed     
1452,5.0 ,                       well worth the money   looks like new   fits in the shirt pocket  just want i wanted   and it is an iphone      
1453,2.0 ,                       iphone came with damage     
1454,5.0 ,                       everything works great and was in perfect condition      
1455,1.0 ,                       the phone came with visible scratches at arms length dirt all over it and it the silent switch and charger port and to top the cake  the speaker mesh was poked through with a toothpick it looks like  i m sad cause my daughter won t receive her present on her bday anymore  very dissapointed       
1456,5.0 ,                       nice phone  everyone works as if it was new  i ordered a fair condition and got an excellent  im very happy  the transition was easy from my iphone  to the iphone   but i did need to go to att and get a sim card installed  the old one didnt quite fit  i would order again      
1457,1.0 ,                         star the phone was locked and i bought it as a birthday present for my daughter if you guys said is  fully unlocked have to be unlocked this is for the seller next time take your time and make sure the phone is unlocked before you send it because is annoying printing the label  no everybody have a printer at home and the post office don t print labels also  then send it back to you wait until you guys received it and then wait   days to get my money back never again     
1458,5.0 ,                       i don t like apple products  that said i bought it for my wife  seems like women like apple products for some reason  anyway she really likes it  she upgraded from a   plus      
1459,5.0 ,                       nice phone  had   days and no issues setting up  i use straight talk and it works perfectly  haven t found any issues      
1460,5.0 ,                       works exactly as described  i use straight talk service  i just popped the sim card in after software update and it works like a charm      
1461,5.0 ,                       it s only been a couple months since i bought the red iphone xr but it arrived looking brand new and i ve had zero issues with it  glad i bought it here vs buying it brand new      
1462,5.0 ,                       the iphone xr came in perfect condition  i got the red color and it is absolutely beautiful  i could not recommend this product enough      
1463,1.0 ,                       everything of great about this phone as far as hardware and software  the phone arrived was early as well  but   it is not fully unlocked for every carrier and that needs to be specified in the description info  carriers use direct tech for their cashing and internet services  for example  att  cricket and simple mobile run on one tech  and verizon runs on another  i wanted a phone to connect with verizon and could not  because this phone is unlocked  but not with verizon   fyi     
1464,5.0 ,                       good     
1465,2.0 ,                       everything was mostly fine  but on startup i noticed several discolored pixel areas  i also got weird notifications about sending sms messages when i wasn t sending anything  spend the extra      and save yourself a headache from worrying about what the phone went through and how long it ll last      
1466,5.0 ,                       i purchased an xr for my son  he loves it  highly recommended      
1467,5.0 ,                       works great good product     
1468,5.0 ,                       great buy    no exaggeration  this was my first phone purchased from amazon renewed  i ordered a yellow    gb version  the phone was in perfect condition  you would think it was brand new  zero scuffs  scratches  or marks  phone battery health was excellent at     seeing that the phone has been out for awhile  would definitely consider purchasing a phone from them in the future  thanks        
1469,5.0 ,                       i had doubts before the purchase but now i am glade for the choice the phone looks like new  no scratches or sign that was used before  it came with     battery even was just renewed  the sound is great  it has no issue  everything works fine  i checked and it s fully unlocked the charger and the cable are not original as the seller specified in description      
1470,5.0 ,                       bought this as an upgrade for my husband and it works very well  it came fully unlocked  we paid     to get it registered with metro pcs  the camera is awesome and lots of storage space      
1471,5.0 ,                       it is like a brand new iphone xr  it does not come with headphones but for the price is a great deal      
1472,5.0 ,                       the phone looks like new  not a scratch on it  works perfectly      
1473,5.0 ,                       we purchased these for traveling so we needed them unlocked arrived one day early  we tried them in other country and worked the battery life of one of them was      very cool the other has battery at      ii was expecting a little bit more  but not an issue they came with new glasses to be installed and one of the phones had a new cover to use with it very nice vendor       recommended      
1474,5.0 ,                       so i received my phone two days after i ordered  to be honest i m happy with it  i think it was worth the money  i tested it already with some of my games and so far it s near perfect  the battery health is     so it s pretty much a new phone  as far as cosmetic  i only found one little scratch which is not visible with the case i bought for it  also  the phone is unlocked  i already tried two different sim cards and it worked great the phone does not come with headphones or an original charger but the seller has those specifications in the product description i do recommend this phone and the seller             
1475,3.0 ,                       came with no charger    but phone looked like new     
1476,1.0 ,                       i just received my i phone i charge it the whole and still    percent of battery     
1477,1.0 ,                       i originally wanted to give this seller   stars because the phone was at least functional but just busted but after continual use i have become irate with this phone  to call it functional would be a compliment  you can t scroll or try to click something because if you do it will pick something else entirely  just buy straight from apple and save yourself a headache because you aren t saving much money from buying here regardless      
1478,5.0 ,                       first of all  this phone came delivered two days earlier than i expected   it is absolutely beautiful and looks brand new  it s definitely better than my old iphone    the camera is wonderful  switching over to my cell carrier was so easy  i love the face recognition and the size of the phone  it was packaged perfectly  included headphones and even directions or a return policy  thanks so much      
1479,1.0 ,                       when i received the phone i immediately took it to my phone company to get it activated and they told me the phone could not be activated because it was listed as lost or stolen so i was angry      
1480,3.0 ,                       dead pixel   this can be seen in the photo   what a pity  i m very upset    there are scratches on the bezel of the iphone   the entire back panel is covered in small scratches   battery       the phone works fine   i do not recommend the seller   the phone in this condition should be on sale at a discount      
1481,5.0 ,                       this phone is great  new condition  excellent battery life and unlocked  shipping was fast  i love it       
1482,5.0 ,                       i was a little scared to buy an unlocked iphone but then it was the best choice i made  i love it very much and there was no cracks  it basically came brand new  comes only with a charger  the battery capacity is     but that s normal because it s a renewed phone  buy this iphone guys you won t regret it           
1483,5.0 ,                       i was really nervous to get this but my cousin ordered the black one and it arrived in perfect condition so i ordered the white on it looked brand new was fully unlocked and the set up was super simple  headphones aren t included and it doesn t come in the original box or charger but that was a problem for me     
1484,1.0 ,                       received this phone to give as a christmas gift and it was not unlocked   the previous owner must not have made payments and the phone was locked and could not be used   super disappointing           
1485,5.0 ,                       this phone came in perfect condition  i can barely believe it  works fine  no scratches  etc the only hiccup was with delivery   people who live in apartments be warned  i had some difficulty with fedex  where they weren t buzzing my apartment building and kept rejecting delivery  then said it was delivered although it wasn t  however  hybridit was super helpful in tracking down what had happened  filed a complaint with fedex for my package   and voila  next day i had the phone     
1486,1.0 ,                       face id hardware faulty  also  the accessories  charger and cable are extremely sub par  have to return unfortunately  what a waste of my time      
1487,5.0 ,                       i will admit  the packaging and presentation wasn t there and i was scared of receiving a cracking or non functional iphone  i was wrong  the phone came in very good condition and isn t very slow at all  but  there s always a but  i received my phone with a     battery health  it doesn t affect me too much but it s worth mentioning  you also won t get headphones with the phone  i received my phone with an off brand roku lightning charger  overall  i was very happy with my order

1489,4.0 ,                       like everyone else  i was apprehensive buying such an expensive phone with no guarantee if it will work or not  but it came   days after ordering  i will say packing was great  phone was nicely packaged in a plastic wrap  on first sight i thought it was a new phone  i inspected the hell out it  it s in absolutely pristine condition  absolutely no marks on this phone  it s beautiful  i was a little worried when i turned it on to set it up and update ios  it had stated it would take   hours but it actually took maybe   hours  a little less    battery is great at       so far i have no complaints about this phone  i m giving it   stars just because i just got it   the description of the phone and it s components are exactly what i got  no more no less  i m happy         
1490,1.0 ,                       i am very upset about this product  when i received it  i switched my sim card from my old iphone into this one  but it would not work  i tried everything  restarting it  logging in and out of apple id  nothing worked  i called my carrier  they said my phone number was suspended because the phone was reported lost stolen  amazon sold me a faulty phone   i am beyond livid  i m sending this phone back and i expect a full refund   be careful with this company       
1491,3.0 ,                       the phone is ok but the audio is very low when im on a call   i have to keep  putting it on speaker     
1492,5.0 ,                       ok  i admitted that i was not confident when placed the order and expected that i may return it  however  i am wrong  when received the phone  i was so happy that i made the order  the phone is like new  well  i will say it is new   not one scratch is found  no deficit is found  battery life so far is good  well  just can t complain about it

1494,2.0 ,                       everything is working fine and phone came new but there s something wrong with my carrier t mobile and cellular data keeps turning on and off every second  can someone help     
1495,5.0 ,                       the phone is great i recommend it and i am going to buy another one for my mom  it is easy to get used to there s no problems just that you might need a case since it has glass on the back  the charger is not original but i have others laying around  it also came with a glass screen protector which was really handy      
1496,2.0 ,                       i ve had the phone for a few months and the phone started showing a blue tint at the bottom of the screen  it just started after no reason  it s been getting bigger since i ve noticed it  the battery has been great though      
1497,5.0 ,                       got this for my girlfriend who wanted to switch to iphone from android  already loves it  as soon as it came we put her at t sim card and the phone was working right away  definitely would buy again   will update in a week after use      
1498,5.0 ,                       was hesitant at first but i received a white xr and it was pretty much immaculate condition a little scratch by the speaker barely noticeable  it s a used phone so it s expected  this company also hooks you up with a very nice protective case and a screen protector with a lighting charger  i m impressed at the quality of the great customer satisfaction they are trying to achieve           
1499,5.0 ,                       i received a really nice black iphone xr  there were no scratches or dents or any other visible imperfections on my phone  i have had it for   days and has been working with no problems  i am really happy i made this purchase  thank you

1505,5.0 ,                       i like the phone in general but the fact the the screen come scratched i didn t like very much because it took away form the overall quality of the phone      
1506,5.0 ,                       this was a great phone but i had to send it back because my carrier was giving me problems  the seller was quick with the refund  i will be shopping again     
1507,1.0 ,                       i received the device and everything physically was functional  there were a few scratches  but i ran into problems when trying to activate my phone  it s listed as   fully unlocked  but it s not  my sim card didn t work and i took it to my carrier store and they told me the device wasn t unlocked to begin with  i returned it the same day it was delivered  still waiting on a refund     
1508,5.0 ,                       ok so i was skeptic but turns out this phone is really good for the price that it is  no scratches or glitches sound quality is good came with charger wish it had headphones have to order them separately but either way i m loving it big upgrade from the       
1509,4.0 ,                       ya know  it s a major upgrade from what i had and was in solid shape  would ve given   starts but there was light wear and tear and the battery life was      which is pretty good   i would def recommend this route for anyone who doesn t want to break the bank on a nice phone      
1510,5.0 ,                       my phone arrived jan          i got the coral iphone xr   i ve had it for few days and so far the phone is in good condition  i haven t had any issues  i saw some scratches on the screen but it wasn t bad that i needed to return or exchange   it is normal   the battery is good and lasts good        the phone came as if it was practically new  no issues   it s legit      
1511,5.0 ,                       all around great phone     
1512,5.0 ,                       i was in need of an upgrade but didn t want to lease and couldn t afford the price of something brand new so i took a shot on this   probably the best  refurbished  items i ve ever bought   i used refurb in quotes because this thing was mint     looks and functions brand new   i mean honestly  not a thing wrong   battery life was at       screen quality is perfect   couldn t be happier with this phone      
1513,5.0 ,                       no ven a con aud fonos     
1514,5.0 ,                       i like everything so far        
1515,5.0 ,                       muy buenas condiciones tal y como lo describe     
1516,1.0 ,                       i bought myself this phone for a christmas gift  it arrived early but the speaker was broken  i could not hear my phone conversations  everything was muffled  i wanted to make sure and put phone side by side with my sons xr to test the sound  absolutely not working properly  very disappointed  you would think that someone would have caught that  what good is a phone if you cant hear conversations      
1517,5.0 ,                       good quality     
1518,5.0 ,                       i got the iphone xr black and it works really good  the battery last all day and longer and the screen is smooth with transitioning app to app and gives no problem  came with no scratches and and a screen protector already as well  doesn t come with headphones so don t get mad about that lol      
1519,5.0 ,                       this seller is incredible  shipped very fast  and the best part is the phone had zero scratches    i ve bought a couple of refurbished phones before and all of them had some sort of dents on them  but not this one  this phone looked totally brand new when i took it out of the box  i highly recommend this seller  i do not think you can find a better purchase if price is your concern     
1520,5.0 ,                       the phone arrived in excellent condition   very happy with the phone and the seller      
1521,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s good  my battery life is     that s good for a renewal device  there are a few tiny scratches on the side corners but it s nothing too major  the phone is functioning well      
1522,2.0 ,                       i received my refurbished iphone yesterday  and so far it has been functioning well  the battery health on the phone says       and there is only minimal evident scratching on the back  my only issue is with whoever put the tempered screen protector on the phone  they must have some serious hand eye coordination problems as the glass is horribly off center and slightly hangs off the bottom  i m going to look around to see if any shops can remove it and reapply it correctly  it is pretty annoying and if i had seen images of it beforehand i definitely would have not purchased the phone      
1523,1.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          as soon as i inboxed the phone  the screen on both sides were badly cracked and there are scratches all over it  it looked as if the shipment got tossed and thrown around  half of the screen is blacked out and you can t see the time  i won t ever buy another phone online because of this horrible experience  the charger was not an apple charger and it over heated like it was going to blow up      
1524,5.0 ,                       i was a little nervous to buy  just received the phone and i am very happy  if i am going to be extremely picky  the only tell that it was refurbished was it was a little dirty around the camera  but there are no scratches the screen seems responsive so far  it even came with a screen protector  i will update after the holidays when i contact att to let everyone know if it s black listed or reported stolen lol      
1525,5.0 ,                       it s is nice phone i didn t had any wrong with this product  battery is great nothing wrong but why apple makes small screen size for iphone xr         
1526,4.0 ,                       the phone is literally in perfect condition  not a scratch on the phone or anything  only reason i m giving   stars is because it didn t come with the sim card removal tool  other than that it s perfect      
1527,5.0 ,                       glad i made this purchase   it was extremely simple   just popped in my sims card     
1528,4.0 ,                       delivery sucks i give     star but good phone     
1529,5.0 ,                       buying expensive items like this from any online places always makes me skeptical  however  i very much appreciated all of the reviews that were left   so now i m leaving mine  product arrived sooner than expected  it was in great condition and has been working just fine thus far  would definitely recommend if looking for a cheaper alternative      
1530,5.0 ,                       the phone is defiantly worth my upgrade  i came from an iphone se  so it was a huge change and i love his phone     
1531,4.0 ,                       it was overall a pretty good phone with no damage or malfunctions  came in three days with prime shipping  the only thing thqt displeased me was that there are five or six micro scratches on the phone  although they re barely noticeable  i expected one to two max  other than that  it worked out well  if you re purchasing this expect a scratch or two  but you can t really complain for under     bucks      
1532,5.0 ,                       i was a little nervous about buying an phone from amazon but now in really impressed  first i get a brand new car charger in the box  i open the box and the phone is all wrapped up for protection  no scratches  no cracks looks brand new  i am very impressed that they provided a screen protector and its already on the phone   it also came with the legit apple charger cord and block  the price of amazing and definitely worth the price   everything works fine on the phone just like a new one  highly recommend buying from this seller        
1533,2.0 ,                       it started off working fine  battery was great  glad to have a working phone  now i have issues with the touch screen spazzing out or not registering  save your money  buy a new phone if you can      
1534,5.0 ,                       really great phone  battery life is really well  appearance is great  surprisingly came with a case  and screen protector  so that s a plus   i havent had any issues thus far        
1535,1.0 ,                       it came in broken     
1536,3.0 ,                       the phone came in in perfect condition  not as much as a single scratch  battery life is great but as i started to use the phone  there are several issues  many of my apps won t work properly and sometimes things just won t load for no reason  i am still using the phone though  i just wish the phone didn t come with these minor issues  overall  the phone is okay      
1537,5.0 ,                       this phone has worked a lot better then i thought it would  i am very pleased with this purchase      
1538,3.0 ,                       dark shadow in corner of the screen  sent back for this issue  reordered same type phone and company still charged me a      restocking fee for sending me a defective product updatei contacted the company with this issue  and they agreed to reimburse the restock fee as well      
1539,4.0 ,                       so  i bought this product and it came without any scratches or marks on both the screen and the back  though  later when i was pressing the volume button the phone started glitching badly  i returned this product after contacting the seller   i got a full refund later i bought the same product except from a different seller in hopes that it would be better  luckily it was crack free with no marks  this phone does not glitch and i ve been using it normally  definitely recommend        
1540,5.0 ,                       i m so pleased with my purchase of this phone i m amazed at the quality it looks brand new there s no scratches and the battery health is     i m pleased and i ll recommend buying from this seller  once again i m extremely pleased     
1541,1.0 ,                          scam    i bought it once and it came lockedi bought it a second time and guess what    it came locked   i m so mad i reported you to amazon don t fall for it people      
1542,4.0 ,                       phone was in excellent condition and good battery life     
1543,5.0 ,                       so far so good  it s the first day so i ll see if it changes  i ve read all the good reviews so i m feeling pretty confident      
1544,5.0 ,                       i love my new iphone xr  it came in perfect condition  no scratches  no dents or damages  everything works perfectly fine  i was scared to make this purchase  but it was worth  i absolutely love my new iphone xr      oh and it came way before it was estimated to come       
1545,5.0 ,                       i was surprised by the quality   seemed completely new  there s only been one other time when i got a great used iphone   it s perfect   thank you guys

1550,5.0 ,                       the phone works properly   thank you   i was hoping to receive my text messages in realtime  but this purchase did not improve that function   i guess realtime transmissions are not available these days   that s very unfortunate      
1551,4.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          pretty good phone for price  few minor scratches on screen  but its definitely a good buy  dont hesitate guys     
1552,5.0 ,                       i upgraded from an iphone  s plus and this phone is amazing  o   m wireless provided all the information that i needed to successfully transfer my data  the phone even arrived   days  ahead of schedule   this all is even better than i hoped  the phone looked like new as did the charger  i am glad that i purchased this phone from this company      
1553,3.0 ,                       the phone is great and came in working condition  nothing wrong with the software and wasn t blacklisted so that was a plus  however  the screen had multiple scratches  some of which were very noticeable  on the screen as well as on the back  was disappointed but the phone is amazing      
1554,5.0 ,                       so many reviews said bad things which made me hesitate to but this but it original and not fake i even got it checked and i have had it  for so long and it works great best purchase i have made     
1555,5.0 ,                       great phone  looks and works excellent since i received it      
1556,1.0 ,                       it came with a faulty charger   had to spend     for a charger to use the phone   seller only credit me     after i asked it i could return the charger for a replacement  returning the phone now there is an issue with the charging port      
1557,1.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          touch screen is useless  stopped working within   months of purchase      
1558,1.0 ,                       i would never purchase from here again or will i recommend any one to shop here   i bought an no good phone that can t be used and said it s a stolen phone     
1559,5.0 ,                       i use this product for work casual purposes  i love that it is unlocked and i am able to use on any carrier  in my suggestion  the phone should have been placed in better packaging such to protect screen and prevent scratches to surface but overall everything else is exactly as described and the phone is in perfect condition  would i buy again  absolutely      
1560,2.0 ,                       not worth the scratches and the laggy software   just pay      more and get it brand new from the apple store      
1561,2.0 ,                       i love how a good price i got this phone for it s just has a little scratch but that s what happens when you get refurbished items but i m complaining about the battery life i charged it to      and i only used it for   mins i thought i had a good buy but to check the battery percentage it dropped significantly at first i thought i was tripping it came to me at    percent and it died fast so i let it charge to     and as you can see the picture it dies fast i needed a replacement because my oldnphone broke just be careful if any of you guys going to buy it and this happens i never complained about anything or reviewed stuff but just be sure to look out for little things like that i contacted the seller i m just waiting to see what he or she to respond     
1562,5.0 ,                       phone is a        had no issues since i purchase back in march of       had no scratches  dines and shipping was fast  price was reasonable also so far so good      
1563,5.0 ,                       i was sooooo worried about this purchase  going from samsung to apple  this was a great switch  i have att service  was able to switch over sim cards without going to att store  phone came in excellent shape  few scuffs on back of phone but i use a case      so this was no big deal for me  i have no complaints about this purchase  so each and fast shipping  would recommend      
1564,5.0 ,                       this product was faulty  as the touch screen didn t work more often than it did  however    the return and refund process was extremely fast and efficient  i was impressed with both the response time of the seller and the ease of the return  even though we were not satisfied with this particular product  i would no doubt  buy from this seller again      
1565,5.0 ,                       excellent and i m happy i went with this vendor  the first one audio was not working but i was able to exchange it for another very quickly  the seller was very responsive to my request  the other one  came within   days and that during covid    pandemic  the second worked perfectly had no damage and      battery efficiency    stars      
1566,1.0 ,                       the phone looks was good on the outside  not sure what was happening on the inside because it only worked for a month  i took it to my carrier to see what they could do  tried getting a new sim and nothing worked  i ended up returning it      
1567,1.0 ,                       i m rewriting my review as the first one was not accepted by amazon  poor quality control and was locked  unlike advertisement  cell phone carrier could not unlock and had to return  my experience is similar to many that have   star  very frustrated as i had boyle screen protectors  case etc in anticipation for using xr  will now wait for the iphone   or whatever they will call it  will never use this co again  their generic email as a response suggested it was a wrong item  not that this was defective  buyer beware     
1568,5.0 ,                       absolutely love this phone  it s basically brand new awesome condition even got to me   day early  upgrading from a iphone   and omg it s a perfect upgrade  thank you so much      
1569,5.0 ,                       i absolutely love this phone  i was a little nervous at first because of some reviews but the phone arrived and it is in perfect condition  came with charger and headphones  it works beautifully  would definitely recommend      
1570,3.0 ,                       the phone didn t come in a box  it was just thrown in there  the charger was cheap and scratched  don t waste your money      
1571,1.0 ,                       the phone came in a bubble pack missing the case and no ear buds  the phone looks used and different from the pictures shown i would give it no stars if that was an option extremely disappointed please don t waist your money on this junk      
1572,5.0 ,                       acceptable phone it comes with everything and looks new     
1573,1.0 ,                       i put for charging and  i put it to charge and in the morning when i went to get my phone it was like this   broken out     
1574,1.0 ,                       this phone didn t work and they are requiring me to pay for shipping to return the item  extremely frustrating and will not purchase anything from them      
1575,5.0 ,                       i m sorry i taught i did a review i just love my iphone xr i love the color it s fast i have no problem with my phone i am very happy to have one thank you     
1576,2.0 ,                       i m not satisfied the iphone came with wear marks on the sides  a stain on the back and a slight stain on the corner of the screen  besides the battery capacity with         
1577,5.0 ,                       it s very very good     
1578,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          bought this from the seller bmof  st  phone came almost like new repackaged  one of my best experiences buying renewed devices from amazon speaking on the phone itself  using it for a few days i could hardly tell a difference between the iphone    and the xr  feels like the exact same phone minus one more camera  if you were considering buying this  i think you should go ahead  solid buy      
1579,4.0 ,                       my phone arrived on time in absolutely perfect condition  i checked all over and there s not a single scratch or dent on this thing  it also has a brand new battery  it didn t come with a stock apple charger or headphones but that doesn t bother me      
1580,5.0 ,                       i love it so much  i really came to write a review because i had a problem with other people s reviews  if your phone comes in cracked or damaged      of the time it s because of transportation  not the seller  you also have    days to return replacement and it s easy and fast with amazon  if the phone s software has an issue  that is where you blame the seller  that is why i never buy don t buy something based off reviews ever      
1581,4.0 ,                       i had to get it replaced  the first one i ordered didn t work  you couldn t charge it  i reached out to customer service and they were very helpful and replaced it  i am glad they did because the first one was a little worn looking as well  may have been just a dud  the replacement looked like new and has worked great  the replacement did take longer than i wanted to arrive but it wasn t such a big deal  this is a good alternative to buying new the price point worked great for us  i d definitely buy again if i needed to      
1582,5.0 ,                       everything works great      out of   stars       
1583,1.0 ,                       looks like new        but the face id doesn t work and the touch screen system have issues      
1584,5.0 ,                       smooth phone definitely a must if you like having a stress free phone if you know what i mean     
1585,5.0 ,                       product as described     
1586,4.0 ,                       my new iphone xr came in great condition  no scratches and everything works great  the battery though only charges to      this is the same as my other iphone xr  which i have heavily used for   years  no effort was made to improve the used battery  so i am knocking a star off for that but it really was a good purchase otherwise      
1587,5.0 ,                       love love love this phone   i was definitely skeptical being i have tried a refurbished phone before and it wouldn t work but this phone worked perfectly and i have had it for months now and no complaints   battery life is great  facial recognition works perfectly and the phone looked brand new  no scratches or anything   i would highly recommend this phone and company      
1588,5.0 ,                       i was reluctant about buying a secondhand phone  but luckily it all worked out great  i got the phone in march and haven t had any issues      
1589,5.0 ,                       i use straight talk through verizon towers and this phone works perfectly for this  the only problem i had was when setting up the phone i had to create a apple id but got a message saying that the phone has had too many people make a new id on it  so i just skipped that part  after setting up the phone  i went back to the settings and tried setting up an id again  and this time it let me do it  not sure what was up there but just an fyi  other than that this phone is perfect  and i am very happy with my purchase  mine came with charger only  but phone had no scuffs or scratches      
1590,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          so grateful that this was everything that described get your phoneit shipped quicklyi received itit was packaged great and i m extremely pleased just get you some headphones and the original charger but for the price  it s def worth it extremely pleased and grateful     
1591,5.0 ,                       the apple i phone xr was a great purchase   the battery life is great   i was little leary of buying a renewed phone but i was impressed by the overall quality of the phone      
1592,4.0 ,                       the phone works well and arrived quickly   the only two minor issues are that the speakers were not cleaned well  there is visible dirt  and the paint around the camera is chipped and it is visible from far away    according to amazons renewed phone policies the phones should be thoroughly cleaned and not have any visible scratches from arms length       
1593,5.0 ,                       other than the cutting edge camera  the xr keeps up with the iphone    step for step  excellent      
1594,5.0 ,                       my  th amazon refurbished iphone   the phone is perfect   not a mark on it   battery is perfect and lasts all day   simply pop in your sim and you re in business   highly recommend     
1595,5.0 ,                       this phone came at     percent battery capacity it works just like new i literally love it i highly recommend  also the order came early and it came with new apple earbuds and charger      
1596,3.0 ,                       so i ordered   red iphones   when they came in one of em had scratches all over tha screen then tha other one has a deep scratch in tha back of it  so i go to connect them   tha one with tha scratch on tha back was able to get turned on but turns out tha other one was black listed  tha one i ended up keeping is a good phone   only thing i m disappointed in is that it has a big deep scratch on tha back when they advertise that these phones are like new      i m disappointed that tha other one was black listed   they weren t able to send me a replacement    but i guess they say they re sending me a refund so we ll see    guess what im tryna say is   good luck hopefully u get a great phone like these other reviews say      
1597,5.0 ,                       i was absolutely terrified to buy a phone off of amazon  especially one worth this much  i got it in the mail   days early which was amazing  i looked it over  and there was nothing wrong with it  looks brand new  performs brand new  such an amazing phone for a great price  go for it      
1598,5.0 ,                       this phone met my expectations   it was in good condition and works as new   i previously had an iphone   plus  and i did prefer it s larger size   i think this phone has an excellent battery life      
1599,2.0 ,                       so when i got this phone  it was dead and i thought all i needed to do was charge it  after hours of waiting it turned on  but seconds later the screen started bugging and glitching out while slowly turning black  i thought it was because it was still dead so i charged it for days and it still didn t work  honestly not worth it especially for the price  the box isn t very good and secure and the charger isn t even an apple one  the box i got was something off brand  honestly the only reason i rated a   star is because they had good communication and i was able to get the refund by the time their warranty said i should get it  took about a whole week for the refund to come through  if you still don t t get a refund i suggest talking to them about it      
1600,5.0 ,                       apart from the fact that fedex  made one attempt to deliver a phone purchase and i had to pay almost    dollars more for what may or may not be the same phone i must say the phone is in excellent condition the camera quality is really good also battery life        a really good buy       
1601,5.0 ,                       looks and works like it is new  did have to have a new sim card put in by sprint  but that only cost     great iphone      
1602,5.0 ,                       when i purchased this phone for my brother for christmas  i was a bit skeptical about purchasing a renewed phone on amazon but it worked out great  there were no scratches  dents  etc  on the phone  it genuinely appears to be a brand new phone  although  i would like the battery life to be a little higher but you can t expect too much from a renewed a phone  i would definitely purchase an xr from here again      
1603,5.0 ,                       this phone came in literally perfect condition there was one small dot on the turn on button would was not a deal breaker and could be covered with a case  the battery life could be better but again it s a renewed phone which is not bad  overall everything is working perfect and would      recommend buying this phone      
1604,4.0 ,                       only thing i was disappointed  in was rhe was the iphone was shipped i received  it in a shipping bag and rhe phone was slidding around in the box      
1605,3.0 ,                       the camera looks like an android camera the phone had scuff marks     the charger that was sent with phone overheated causing the phone to be hot as well       
1606,5.0 ,                       we got this for our granddaughter she seems bh to love it      
1607,5.0 ,                       me gusta mucho  me resulto muy bueno     
1608,5.0 ,                       great phone just not with the hype of iphones themself  lol  that s just me as a person  i ve had it for a month or so now  i got exactly what i ordered  this phone looks and functions as if purchased from apple themselves  in other words like new  i would definitely recommend this seller           
1609,5.0 ,                       not an apple charger but it s a good phone      
1610,5.0 ,                       love it  there isn t a headphone or original charger but i m not worried about that  the setup was a pain but now everything is working perfectly  there are no scratches  battery life on setting says       i checked the serial number  it s legit  i do have to say  the shipping company  fedex  was horrible but that s not on the seller  the phone is perfect      
1611,2.0 ,                       i bought this phone about     days ago  it came on time and i was quite happy  once i inserted the sim card  it would search for it then say no service  i went to t mobile and they said the phone may have been blocked  though it was a beautiful phone  i had to get it refunded i might buy it again and update my review      
1612,5.0 ,                       i ve had no problems with the phone and feel that it works like new      
1613,2.0 ,                       i received this phone as a christmas gift for my son and was disappointed  because there is no apple apple iphone charger and it didn t arrive in a box just a crappy wrapping i hope its going to work properly when my son opens it on christmas morning      
1614,1.0 ,                       the screen would stuck and the touch would not work  you have to close whatever is on the screen and reopen it  the problem was there the moment i took the iphone out of the box  i thought the issue will be resolved once i upgrade it to the latest ios but that didn t work  the phone still will get unresponsive and i have to close and reopen everything  i trusted a renewed product only because i thought that i can return it if something doesn t work but the return process is very stupid  i have to talk to an agent then he will give me useless troubleshooting steps to follow such as resetting the phone  i know the problem is not a software  i simply didn t expect this  very frustrating      
1615,5.0 ,                       i got my brand new iphone xr blue     gb phone during quarantine  and it is in perfect condition with      battery life  i bought mine from buyspry and i would recommend you to purchase from there as well  camera quality is great and i love the phone  every works well      
1616,5.0 ,                       phone is great  delivery by ups was not good as it was delivered to my neighbors door  an adjacent apartment       
1617,5.0 ,                       i really like the colour of this phone  it came packaged really well and had a full battery health      
1618,5.0 ,                       a hour after purchase i saw the reviews and was kinda worried but when the phone came it was perfect  battery life is only     but i can work with that  camera was perfect  screen was perfect  everything works perfect  i d recommend buying here if you aren t wanting to spend the extra      from apple      
1619,1.0 ,                       had the item for less than   months  took it in the bathroom and played music   did not take in shower  did not take into water   it had water damage on the screen after i came out   the screen is damaged beyond repair and i have had it flat and  drying  for weeks      
1620,5.0 ,                       this iphone xr is imaging  the screen is perfect and everything works well  i like the seller  this is how great people do business by satisfying customers  i recommend you to buy any iphone from this seller  thank you so much      
1621,1.0 ,                       bought this iphone for my husband exactly   months ago yesterday  this weekend the phone died and wouldn t charge  it was stuck in a boot loop then said it needed to be updated  update didn t work so then it said to restore iphone  that didn t work either  turns out the memory has failed and we now have to pay over      to have it repaired  that s half the price of the phone we just paid for  pretty irritating  wouldn t recommend their  renewed  products      
1622,5.0 ,                       best phone i had so far works great     
1623,5.0 ,                       purchased as a gift for grandson  looks and works just like a new one     
1624,4.0 ,                       not a scam  received the phone a day early  it has      battery life and looks brand new  no wear and tear at all  the only thing i didn t like was the fact that it did not come inside an actual apple box  and even though the charger is apple  i received a random off brand charger block instead of a regular apple one  other than that  i love it  thanks       
1625,5.0 ,                       i have not been to town to activate yet but everything otherwise is perfect      
1626,4.0 ,                       the product is overall great  wasn t fully aware that it would come with bigger scratches and scuffs  either way the phone is awesome and works great  didn t come with an adapter though  which is quite a pain considering no headphone jack      
1627,1.0 ,                       i don t usually write reviews  but i was very disappointed with this purchase  the phone looked like it was in perfect condition when i first opened the box but then i noticed the front facing camera did not work properly  on top of that  the phone was not registered so i could not get service with it even though i had a sim card inside      
1628,5.0 ,                       i m new to apple world and have only ever used motorola previously so i spent a lot of time looking at refurbished phones  iphone came in amazing  nearly flawless  shape with a screen protector  would recommend to anyone who doesn t want to buy new     
1629,5.0 ,                       this has minor scratches but work perfectly and my daughter loves it at first i thought i was a scam but i saw all the reviews and they convinced me it been like   months already and looks like it work perfectly     
1630,5.0 ,                       i was very skeptical on buying a phone from amazon but i did it   it s like the phone came right out the box i haven t had any problems   the battery was      compacity     
1631,1.0 ,                       phone stopped working less than    days after purchase with no option to replace only refund  seller customer service not available on weekends do not buy renewed from this seller     
1632,5.0 ,                       i bought this phone recently and i was reading the reviews and was debating on getting it  but i m glad i did i absolutely love this phone it s amazing i highly recommend this phone     
1633,4.0 ,                       maybe it s not really captured in the pic but it s scratchy on the back and there s like a little yarn string that looks like the final touching process hasn t finished yet  but so far the camera  music  touch screen works      
1634,1.0 ,                       el telefonoi se debe por completo en la at t y presenta una deuda total del equipo en dicha operadora  aparte de eso debe      de intereses por mora en el pago  eso no salia en la descrpcion de haberlo sabido no compraba este telefono      
1635,5.0 ,                       i was very hesitant to buy a used phone  it s hard to know exactly what you are going to get  of course  you want to believe it is going to be perfect but you do have to be realistic  because it s used  i m happy to report the phone was nearly perfect  it has no scratches at all  no marks or anything negative about the appearance  i took it to get a sim card and everything transferred perfectly from my old phone  i didn t miss a beat  i know some people are particular about this one but i did get an apple brand charging cable too  the battery was full and it lasts a long time  i go all day with using various apps and phone calls and even use it with the controller while flying my drone  at bedtime  around     am  i still have about     battery left from the charge the night before  the only thing weird is the iphone podcast app does not work  it says  there is a problem and the podcast library needs to be rebuilt before continuing   when i click rebuild library  it never finishes doing anything  i have even kept touching the screen to keep the phone from going to sleep in hopes that the rebuild would be successful  i eventually deleted the app and re downloaded it from the app store  everything seemed to be fine and then    i got the same message  i will eventually take it to the apple store to see what they can do but for now  the rest is perfect and i am glad i saved a few hundred bucks      
1636,1.0 ,                       horrible experience  had the phone less than a month before it was blacklisted  reported stolen  however i was able to send the phone back and get a refund  for the price and quality you are better to buy new from apple      
1637,4.0 ,                       i returned the first iphone since it had minor scratches and was able to do this with no issue at all   however  when i repurchased the replacement phone the price had gone up  contacted the customer service and they did not honor the original price after this was made to their attention  overall  i would recommend the phone to another person but the customer service was not satisfying as a buyer      
1638,5.0 ,                       el tel fono lleg  mucho antes de la fecha que me dijeron  adem s que aparte del tel fono y cargador  trajo y cover antishock y un screen protector  no me lo esperaba  la calidad del tel fono es impresionante  no me arrepiento      
1639,5.0 ,                       i love the size of the phone  that was a big thing for me when i was looking for a phone to buy  i dislike how long it took for me to set everything upbut that isn t a big deal      
1640,5.0 ,                       the phone looks quite new and has every functionality in working condition  i haven t have encountered any problems yet      
1641,1.0 ,                       they get one star for fast shipping and that about the only positive thing i have to say  could not get service after installing sim card and resetting phone multiple times tried inserting both my sim card and the one from my wife s phone and neither worked  verified that both sim cards worked in her phone which is an iphone xr that she got a week ago from another company and they worked fine  can t tell you much else about this company because i didn t get that far but won t buy from them again simply because the device i was sent was faulty which leads me to believe they don t check devices as well as they claim or it wasn t fully unlocked like they claim      
1642,5.0 ,                       amazing phone  it s like it s new  came in an original iphone box  with      battery life and not a scratch on it  i was skeptical to buy it because of the bad reviews but i m glad i didn t listen  i ve had it for a while now and it doesn t have any problems at all       
1643,5.0 ,                       i love this phone  the battery life was     when i got it  it s been two weeks now  and so far it s been greats i recommend this phone for anyone with a budget      
1644,5.0 ,                       the phone was a a  renewed quality the only issue was on us the buyer  my wife ordered a iphone xr instead of a iphone xs  i would definitely recommend this vendor in future or for family      
1645,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          phone came days early and in great condition with     battery life  it came with everything that would be included in a original iphone box except with a different package box itself   have been using it for two weeks now with no complaint  a great buy      
1646,5.0 ,                       i was a little skeptical about buying this phone but it s honestly great  it was fully unlocked   the camera quality is great  and mine came looking      new  mine has no scratches or marks on it   honesty worth it if you re trying to save money   just know it doesn t come with the original charger  nor does it come with earphones   it says it in the description but most people don t read it and act surprised when it doesn t arrive with them      
1647,5.0 ,                       i ve bought iphones new ever since      when i bought the very first model  i ve never ever considered refurbished especially for a phone  but i decided to take a risk  mainly because i really wanted the xr in blue in    gb and apple stopped offering this model  to entice you towards the more recent models   i wanted to get the best xr i could because it s the last lcd display by apple w the best battery  i want this phone to last     years  i spent      after tax  and i got what cost       about a year and a half ago  there s not a single scratch on my phone  the battery life came with      health  it honestly feels like someone owned this phone for less than a week  and gave it back and it was  refurbished   very impressed  can t believe i got a brand new battery  chubbiestech was my seller     
1648,5.0 ,                       llego entero sin ning n rasgu o la verdad estaba dudosa de comprar en linea pero quede encantada con el producto       
1649,5.0 ,                       if you spend nearly     dollars on a phone you d think it ll at least work for    months  never again will i purchase from whoever sold me this phone      
1650,5.0 ,                       great phone with horrible specs and a great price tag for apple sheeps  when you can get a better phone with samsung        
1651,1.0 ,                       keeps shutting off randomly   the rest of it works perfectly fine   i tired everything to fix this issue   resetting all settings and even factory reset   still shuts off randomly      
1652,3.0 ,                       after reading some reviews i took a chance  i brought an iphone xr for my son and thought i was saving some      out the box the phone looked brand new  it was clean with no scratches  but when i put his sim card in  the carrier network wasn t working  the phone s description says that it s fully unlocked  i was going to take it to his carrier  but then i noticed the haptics  vibration  doesn t work      
1653,5.0 ,                       it came in excellent condition and worked with my carrier   no problems updating  but some trouble with setting it up because it required a new icloud but the company was great with assisting us  but overall if i had to i would definitely purchase again      
1654,5.0 ,                       i must admit i was very skeptical because of the mixed reviews on this item  but that aside  i am very happy with my purchase  i expected at least a couple scratches or scuffs on the device but there were none this was in near perfect condition  the camera and front camera work great  also i checked the imei and this is a legitimate product  if you want an iphone but dont want to spend retail price this is a great place to buy

1658,1.0 ,                       the product seller  havearly is a poor seller  they sold me an unlocked iphone xr and after using it for   months on att  i decided to switch to verizon where i discovered it was not unlocked  seller told me oh well  you should have checked this before return date ended  poor excuse for customer service

1677,5.0 ,                       this phone is definitely worth the money  the phone came in a very professional packaging  not original packaging but i don t mind  along with a charger and a screen protector which was great  the phone is free of scratch and dents and i was so impressed considering the price  it s running smoothly and fine      
1678,5.0 ,                       i was ver sceptical about buying a      phone on amazon but it is totally worth it  the battery says      and nothing wrong with this phone  i would totally recommend this seller and this phone  iphone xr yellow     
1679,4.0 ,                       works great so far  few scuffs but not noticeable  thank you       
1680,5.0 ,                       cant kapp this one of the best purchases i ve ever made on amazon i thought this was a scam but i started seeing everyone s reviews and it was great the phone works great nothings wrong with it came in it looks very brand new     
1681,1.0 ,                       phone volume and sound didnt work   phone kept shutting its self off on it owns every   mins  phone was definetly cheap and not refurbished at all was junk  now i sent the phone off and am waiting to have access to my      they owe me since they re not sending a new phone     
1682,5.0 ,                       got the phone in amazing time  great condition  great battery life and just looks and works well  i was skeptical but i had to try to get some savings and also be more environmentally responsible  this seller will get my money again because they sell quality product      
1683,5.0 ,                       my wife loves her  new  iphone  it is indistinguishable from a brand new one      
1684,2.0 ,                       i have had this phone for less than a week and there is a purple smudge that showed up on the screen  i have not dropped or damaged the phone in any way      
1685,1.0 ,                       the vibration of the phone dose not work properly and  battery  was at        
1686,2.0 ,                       well  it looked good  so two stars  i have always feared buying phones described as  unlocked   after investing the usual amount of time in transferring my information to the shiny new phone  the sim card could not be read  i called apple who confirmed that this phone was locked  this is ridiculous  my time is far more valuable than the money i would have saved on this purchase  fyi  buyspry s customer support is only open during business hour  very inconvenient  thank you  amazon  for a robust return policy  such a shame an hour of my life will never be returned      
1687,5.0 ,                       i bought this phone for my daughter and it works great   looks brand new   no scratches and very clear screen   i definitely recommend this phone      
1688,1.0 ,                       what a waste of time  don t bother with these productsspeaker is toast out of the box  barely able to hear anything and the phone itself was scuffed      
1689,1.0 ,                       the product was delivered fast but the product inside is not what they offer niether what other customers shows  the phone came with the camera all broken in   parts  the phone have scratches and easy noticeable bumps at the base of the phone  im super unsatisfied and disappointed with this product  i bought this as an amazon prime member  few minutes ago i asked for the refund so lets see if amazon renewed services take care for what they sell  i will be posting updates      
1690,3.0 ,                       so far so good  the phone came in good condition  but the phone was turned was on and the box was a little open when i received it  the packaging on the outside was sealed so the phone should ve been okay regardless  so far i ve had no issues with the phone  it came with a charger  no headphones though  which is perfectly fine  i have my own regardless  i think it just random if you get all the products or not  but either way you are paying for the phone and it s a great price anyways  comes with what you need so take a chance it may end in an amazing purchase will update as time goes on as i ve only recently received it      
1691,5.0 ,                       the iphone xr is in excellent condition   strong battery  no scratches on the screen   the phone works like it s brand new   i will buy from this company again  royal     
1692,5.0 ,                       i live in liberia so it took a while to get the phone  my sister received after i paid for it and  mom brought it on her way back home  i must admit  the phone is like brand new  there s not a single scratch on it and i t works pretty well  the seller is highly recommended as long as their products are like mine      
1693,3.0 ,                       the phone is very glitchy and when we brought it to an apple authorized dealer  we were told that it needs a new screen  that the one that is on the phone is not an apple one and something about missing ribbons   these things are what is causing the problems with the phone   i would not purchase from this seller again note   updated review   while we had the problem discussed above with the phone we purchased when we notified the seller of the problem they sent a fedex call tag for returning the phone freight prepaid   the credit for the purchase price was credited back a few days after we sent the defective phone back      
1694,5.0 ,                       really like this product  its only been a month but its performing very well  i also got a free case with it that wasnt mentioned so i have an extra case so thats really nice        would recommend     
1695,5.0 ,                       the phone is like brand new and worked with cricket out of the box     
1696,5.0 ,                       muy conservado cubri  mis espectativas     
1697,5.0 ,                       bought for daughter  very pleased      
1698,1.0 ,                       the phone worked really well for about a month  after that the front camera started to get a few lines in it  which was tolerable and kind of an expectation of a cheap iphone  then the camera started to not work at all      
1699,1.0 ,                       was really excited had great past experience with amazon iphones but this came scratched and with a low battery health   so i will not be ordering again went straight to apple to get a new phone  worth it to just buy new      
1700,5.0 ,                       do it  i know there s some not great reviews but they came perfect      
1701,5.0 ,                       the phone works very well  it came in an apple original box  no scratches or any defects  the battery status is        also came with a screen protector  it was unexpected and very nice      
1702,5.0 ,                       it came in great condition  there was a little scratch not too bad it came with a screen protector and a case which i didn t expect but was nice  definitely get you wan if you re planning on upgrading yeah     
1703,5.0 ,                       too early to rate features   will follow up     
1704,4.0 ,                       phone works well and looks good  even came with a glass screen protector  been using it for a week and no issues  only blemish is a finger tip size area of scratches on the screen  not a big deal  but they re there      
1705,5.0 ,                       came just as said it s an authentic apple iphone my only problem is that while yes i was aware it refurbished which is fine it s clear they didn t replace the battery and so it only fully charged to     it also doesn t seem to charge pass     sadly i probably wouldn t of ordered it knowing this  the charging port also is dirty almost looks corroded      
1706,2.0 ,                       i would not be touching my screen at all and button would still be pressed  at one point when i tried to restart the phone  the screen glitched and called emergency services  the outside of the phone looked in good condition but the phone did not work properly      
1707,4.0 ,                       it was beautiful  i just returned it because i m too damn old to not have the button to press  if i m not refunded properly i ll definitely adjust my rating      
1708,5.0 ,                       phone arrived on timephone works greatphone was fully unlocked as stated    i put my cricket sim card in and on it went     
1709,1.0 ,                       i would give this   stars  got the phone  turned on without me even pressing it  was weirded out but ignored it  it worked perfectly fine until i put in my credit card info  created an apple id account  password and face id  and transferred photos  this is when the phone completely shut off  the next day it turned on and turned off at possibly the exact time it turned off the day before  it seems they set these phones to only turn on long enough for you to do enough to only get a partial refund        
1710,5.0 ,                       purchased this iphone for my daughter and it worked no problem with verizon and looked in good shape  i hope it continues on       
1711,4.0 ,                       product was unlocked as promised  able to connect to boost mobile s service  one of the speakers doesn t work  but for the price i d say it can be kind of expected to have some mishaps      
1712,2.0 ,                       got the phone recently and at first i actually thought it was great  it seems to be in great hands and  looks brand new  zero scratches and the battery life is also great however  after a week of buying it the speaker stopped working and it was completely unprovoked  i didn t drop it and do anything to it  when i started calling people they were not able to hear me  i did everything i could to solve the issue but nothing would work so i returned it  i hope i just got a bad phone because i still want the phone  aside from that issue it is a great phone      
1713,5.0 ,                       phone came in perfect conditions with no scratches        of battery health     
1714,5.0 ,                       i upgraded from a   so this phone is amazing   love the extra memory as went from   to

1716,4.0 ,                       phone looked new  they did a good job refurbishing  i couldn t tell it was a used phone  when i m ready for my next phone  i m definitely going to order from this place  it s a lot cheaper than financing a phone      
1717,3.0 ,                       ireally like the phone but there is some scratchs in screen an the metal of the phone is not perf  but there is free case     
1718,5.0 ,                       the iphone was amazing     battery life  perfect screen  unlocked was amazing perfect gift for my mom thanks     
1719,5.0 ,                       i purchased the apple iphone xr from amazon because of the price and reliability of the refurbish products   my son enjoys his birthday gift that instantly operated with the verizon service   am looking to upgrade my old android to one of the apple iphones on this site      
1720,5.0 ,                       muy bueno     
1721,1.0 ,                       it was awesome until i found out it s currently still activated under a phone number  no phone company can help me so therefore i can t set up the phone and spent almost      on it for no reason  i would love to get my money back      
1722,5.0 ,                       other reviews had me sceptical on purchasing this item but it was a great buy for me  everything is in perfect condition  there was a couple of scratches on it that can t be seen unless you really look at it  but other than that it s perfect      
1723,5.0 ,                       whats not to like   works well and integrates with other apple products     
1724,5.0 ,                       great value for the money  will buy more     
1725,3.0 ,                       i ordered this phone and it came with a defect on the screen  where it had been damaged  the screen was scratched up from prior use and had an old screen protector on it  the phone is slow and you can tell something has happened to it  if they are going to sell products at this quality it should be half as much as they are selling it for  not original charger  no headphones      
1726,5.0 ,                       came ahead of time  and look practically new work like brand new too    daughter love it     
1727,1.0 ,                       this phone did not work right straight out of the box  the company claims to do a check of all the components but they clearly do not since then sent me a phone where the microphones and camera didn t work    hours to set up the phone with updated software  transfer of data from my old phone and then a trip to verizon to activate the phone proved to be a waste of time      
1728,5.0 ,                       looks and works like brand new  no issues at all  fast delivery and packaged well  have been using it for over a month now  facial recognition works perfectly

1734,1.0 ,                       this phone doesn t work with my carrier   i wouldn t advice anyone to purchased   everytime i go to the store to have the issue fixed with metro all they asked is where did i purchase this phone cause it reported lost stolen so now i have to return phone and get my refund      phone looks brand new though but just doesn t works     not good     sometimes it s best to buy phone brand new cause i wouldn t have this problem          
1735,4.0 ,                       me encanta esta como nuevo     
1736,2.0 ,                       does anyone else have a problem with the camera  just got my phone today and the front camera is just android quality  and even worse with the flash that makes you look as pale as a ghost  my iphone   plus had way better camera quality

1740,4.0 ,                       i purchased this phone for my daughter  she has only had it for   week  so it is a little early to review  but i have not heard any complaints from her  so all must be well  purchase and delivery was easy and fairly fast      
1741,5.0 ,                       the phone came in perfect condition  i could barely tell it was refurbished  the battery is new too  it just won t come with original charger and earphone just like any other refurbished item      
1742,1.0 ,                       first of all  calling it an amazon renewed iphone is misleading   it s not an amazon product  amazon can t help  and i have to deal with a  rd party  i have a problem with the display  and my only option is to return it  get my money back  and then purchase a new one  i m extremely unhappy with my purchase but i m stuck with it because i can t be without a phone for a week      
1743,5.0 ,                       i m so glad i took a chance and didn t read the negative reviews  this thing is perfect not physical defects or operational ones the this looks and performs like brand new      
1744,4.0 ,                       everything is perfect except maximum battery was at     when i got it i can t still charge till      but idk for how long     
1745,5.0 ,                       i am very satisfied with this product  i was unsure to buy this iphone because i was afraid it ll no working  but this iphone xr was in a great condition  everything works perfectly the camera  battery  microphone  etc  it comes in a box with all seller s information      
1746,3.0 ,                       cons  it had a little scratches at the top of the screen  price is almost as new but it isn t new pros  battery capacity     which is good  but you may get          
1747,5.0 ,                       it work fine  with my straight talk  i really like it     
1748,5.0 ,                       i offered it to my husband and it works very well until now no complain  everything looks and works as new  we are very happy to buy second hand so we are not contributing to produce more phones and so contribute to   th century slave  definitely recommended     
1749,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          i purchased this phone a little over a week ago  this phone has been amazing so far  there are no problems with it  the only imperfections are minor dings on the aluminium frame and some scuffing on the screen that is only visible when the phone is off  over all i recommend it            
1750,4.0 ,                       i needed a new phone  i decided to get it and really like the phone  my first one the speaker didn t work had to send back  customer service was great and my second phone hasn t given me any trouble      
1751,5.0 ,                       i love the color and it works great     
1752,5.0 ,                       was worried about buying a refurbished phone  but i couldn t tell looks like and works like new      
1753,5.0 ,                       bought this for a birthday gift to my daughter and she loves it   package came on time and in mint condition  great price    setup was a breeze the phone does all the work        
1754,5.0 ,                       i thought it would be a scam but it wasn t  face id works      battery health  good screen  there was a small scrape at the bottom but it s a refurbished phone  so it s totally worth it      
1755,5.0 ,                       battery health      touch screen is very responsive  the phones condition is       i only noticed one small light scratch on the phone  cameras are great      
1756,5.0 ,                       touch screen is great and same for screen quality  battery life is good when i got it battery life was at     so not bad for used phone      
1757,1.0 ,                       once powered on turns off after a few seconds  haven t been able to use the phone  returning for a full refund      
1758,5.0 ,                       this was supposed to come in the   th  but it came in the  th  i ordered it on the  th  insane fir the shipping  but this phone is one of the best bang for the buck iphones right now and i love it  all good here     
1759,4.0 ,                       its good phone no scartch like brand new     
1760,1.0 ,                       came in sooner than expected but no service when sim was inserted and found a dead pixel  tried everything but nothing worked  it shouldn t be that hard for my service to work since it worked on my old phone  it was literally an all day thing trying to get the service to work and my finally gave up and returned it only one day after i got it  all that i research that it may be potentially stolen  still locked or a hardware issue because it seriously could not get service  the dead pixel wouldn t have bother if the phone actually worked  they couldn t even take off the lining of the adhesive to properly tape it together  i m seriously disappointed  never ever buying from the seller gryphon commerce      
1761,5.0 ,                       this phone is exactly like brand new  it came to me well packaged and was exactly as described  i honestly have no complaints  you d never know my phone had been refurbished

1763,5.0 ,                       i was a bit hesitant till i read the reviews the good out weighs bad so i took my shot i finally got it today and set it up came with a screen protector surprised it was brand new unlocked and perfect all around  i highly recommend      
1764,5.0 ,                       i get that buying refurbished iphones can be a roll of the dice  but i have yet to be blindsided   this is probably the  th refurbished iphone i ve purchased off amazon and have yet to be disappointed      
1765,5.0 ,                       have not used it yet  will review in the future what i can say  it is a most excellent phone at a very good price  and  not a scratch on it   excellent service as well              
1766,1.0 ,                       guess you take your luck when purchasing an iphone because mine came locked  i m currently still waiting for my refund or replacement very frustrating     
1767,5.0 ,                       perfect   i was so worried because some reviews  but it s perfect i definitely recommend      
1768,5.0 ,                       this phone came early and in great condition  i was very hesitant to buy a phone on amazon but a friend suggested it after i tried to buy from facebook  and it didn t work out  there are no scratches  came with a charger and sim pin  i ve checked the camera and the speakers also working well  i m very happy with this purchase  this is not a scam      
1769,5.0 ,                       i was skeptical after reading some reviews but i must say i m so thrilled with my purchase it was in mint condition everything worked flawlessly and the battery life it s still really good i charged it once and didn t need to charge it all day long and half the next day  very good company would highly recommend      
1770,5.0 ,                       besides the back camera having a little bit of glue showing on the edge  the phone was in good conditions and everything  the phone came with its own clear case and screen protector  very good  i bought this is february           
1771,5.0 ,                       bought this phone to upgrade from my previous android and it meets every standard  mint condition  fantastic battery life  untouched screen        stars for sure      
1772,5.0 ,                       very pleased with the purchase i made   my wife broke her android and i needed a good replacement for verizon   everything has been perfect      
1773,5.0 ,                       good phone no trouble it s what i expected       
1774,5.0 ,                       the phone works great and is a good price  definitely worth the money  no issues so far  also works with the phone carrier tello      
1775,5.0 ,                       everything about this phone is just amazing   i was soooo scared to order at first but i literally scrolled thru all the reviews and was just like why not   and i m glad i didn t listen to the bad reviews i m so glad i didn t   just got my package today i was sooo nervous to open it but when i did i was amazed at how it came in there s not one scratch or dent or any other damage you would describe on this phone   screen is pretty sensitive if you ask me and the camera is beautiful   oh and it also works with cricket guys so i d definitely get it unlocked if you re a cricket customer like me    also i just wanna say i brought this from seller mywit   very good service   and i would show vids or pictures of the phone but i m obviously on it now lol just kno this phone is in great condition almost as if its really brand new   battery life is good too   charges up pretty fast if you ask me and the phone does last awhile i doubt you d even need a charger to go anywhere with it and also i see how some reviews complain about how it doesn t come with headphones    but obviously if you read about the phone and what the seller says about it you d see that it stated no headphones comes with the package but best believe a charger does   so yeah i m glad i didn t listen to the negative reviews even tho i was worried everyday that i was waitin for my package to come   other than that i highlyyy recommend buying a phone from here       
1776,5.0 ,                       this is legit  great product at half the price of brand new  never buy brand new      
1777,4.0 ,                       feels and looks brand new  the battery life was already only      but other than that i absolutely love this phone  honestly my hopes were very very low when buying this phone  but i highly recommend      
1778,5.0 ,                       was somewhat skeptical about getting this phone from them but turned out to be a great investment  found next to no scratches  battery life  at      and fantastic speeds  i would recommend getting the productred edition since there are numerous good reviews of it and pictures showing them looking like new  was afraid of getting a phone with an activation lock but luckily that didn t happen  in the end  it s really your prerogative     
1779,4.0 ,                       cuando lo compr  el anuncio dec a que se garantizaba m nimo el     de vida  til de la bater a  y carg ndola completa sin usarlo constantemente solo dura unas   horas  tengo otro exactamente igual y lo recargo cada dos     d as  el cable incluido tampoco no funciono      
1780,1.0 ,                       did not work  tried to connect to my phone carrier and the imei number wouldnt connect because it was fake and ihad to return it hoping i could get one that does work      
1781,5.0 ,                       it took a few minutes  but i finally found a minor blemish     i m sure i ll add a few more in the coming years  the phone was worth the extra few days for delivery   no disappointments here   phone is well worth the money        
1782,5.0 ,                       came flawless  no scratches or anything  also came with a screen protector on it      battery life  great phone      
1783,4.0 ,                       when i received the phone it was in better condition then i expected  unfortunately it would not acknowledge the sim card  i would of not returned this phone  if verizon had been able to get it to read the sim card         i would definitely suggest purchasing from this seller  the look  quality  and price was more then i expected      
1784,5.0 ,                       love love love it     
1785,5.0 ,                       i got my phone today  and was extremely relieved and satisfied  the phone came intact with a generic iphone charger and block which was fine with me  it also transferred everything from my old iphone to this one within    minutes which was very convenient  the phone has a clean  nice condition screen and back  and the cameras checked out fine  i don t know if i missed this part in the description but it also came with a case for the phone  and it is of good quality  i was the most excited about the battery health  which the settings told me the phone had a     battery life  i was worried when the description of this phone said it would have at least     battery life  but overall i could not have been more satisfied      
1786,2.0 ,                       i have a permanent youtube background imprinted in the screen  i can see the menu buttons at the bottom of the screen when viewing anything dark on the phone     i did buy an ipad from same company but haven t seen any issues with that device  just the phone  fml  just my luck      
1787,5.0 ,                       i received the phone within a timely manner and it is just like new  i couldn t wait until it arrived  it came in safe packaging  with no scratches on screen or camera  no issues with any of the tech  everything is working perfectly   the battery is amazing and so much better compared to my old iphone    i have been using this new phone for over a month now and i am still incredibly happy with my purchase and am surprised at great condition it is for being renewed  i would recommend anyone to buy a renewed refurbished phone especially from amazon  hope this helps anyone who needs it        
1788,2.0 ,                       the phone was obviously used  the edges were a little scraped up and there was a lot of gunk in the speaker next to the front camera  none of this was bad enough to make me want to get rid of it  what made me return the phone was the fact that the front camera quality was terrible  the  st pic is the amazon phone front camera  the  nd pic is the apple store front camera  i mainly bought this phone for the cameras  i feel like most people do   while the back camera was fine  the front one was a deal breaker  i considered asking for another phone from the company  but for      more i would have rather purchased a brand new iphone and save myself the worry  i originally thought i d be saving some money  but it wasn t worth it in the end      
1789,5.0 ,                       love the phone came way before time it was supposed to be here on the   th or the   th and came on the   nd no scratches or scuffs come with charger and cable in good condition i almost didn t buy but glad i did     
1790,5.0 ,                       i love this phone   it is a great phone  battery life is great    lasts all day     
1791,1.0 ,                       lo recib  con un problema del t ctil en un lado de la pantalla  lo devolv  para una reposici n de equipo  pero terminaron por devolverme el dinero      
1792,5.0 ,                       i was very skeptical in buying this  but i needed an upgrade desperately  so i decided to take the risk  i m very glad that i did  it came in perfect condition  full battery  and the battery life is magnificent   no scuffs or scratches  the box was unmarked and white with a knock off charger but that wasn t a concern for me  fast shipping and delivery  worth the money  definitely      
1793,1.0 ,                       left speakers doesn t release any sound      
1794,5.0 ,                       i got my product almost   days then i was expecting which was awesome   the product was also in perfect condition  looks brand new and was unlocked as promised  i was able to just stick my sim card in the phone and it connected with no problem      
1795,5.0 ,                       so every store had the xr but no red i ve had my phone for a month now and i loveeee it the picture quality is amazing the battery lasts all day with power saving mode on and i love the new specs of this phone i would definitely recommend this phone     
1796,5.0 ,                       i m grateful for the quality of this purchase   we have   other iphone xr devices that we bought new and we try our best to take care of them   this iphone xr is on par with those phones   i will definitely look to buy my next iphone from this seller      
1797,5.0 ,                       truely amazed at what a good deal purchasing refurbished items are  this was my first purchase of one and was really hesitant but my phone arrived and it was literally good as new  no scratches  no dents  and no issues  it is refurbished so naturally the battery was a little used      health  but no complaints  would definitely recommend picking a refurbished phone to a friend      
1798,5.0 ,                       awesome phone   don t believe it when they say this is a scam   my phone came to me in perfect shape   took it to verizon and it was unlocked as advertised    best iphone i done had so far       
1799,5.0 ,                       i used it for a bring your own phone   very happy with it   just wish i had a manual for it      
1800,1.0 ,                       i recently bought this phone  it s useless  it does not recognize sim card  it cannot be returned  i live in ecuador  i ve lost money and time  i need a solution     
1801,1.0 ,                       it would jump from what your texting or emailing to other and you would have to start over misspelling words      
1802,5.0 ,                       works great easy to set up   i use it every day for calendar  planning  research  social media     
1803,5.0 ,                       shipped quickly  phone in perfect condition     
1804,5.0 ,                       i was a little skeptical at first about it  however im glad i bought it  its super light weight  reasonable battery life  literally the real deal  i had an android phone but im soooo glad i made the switch  dont believe any of the negative reviews because this product is awesome  also it is fully unlocked so it is compatible with any sim card      
1805,5.0 ,                       my daughter just started using this phone and everything is good so far     
1806,1.0 ,                       the phone in perfect condition  not a stock charger or ear phones but i m not bothered about that  they said fully unlocked and the phone was not  after attempting to connect the phone to my service sprint  they told me that the phone was made for strictly t noble use  t  mobile uses gsm frequency while sprint uses cdma  in other words  it can t work with sprint thus  not fully unlocked  they failed to mention anything about gsm or cdma  i would not recommend buying any product from buyspry      
1807,5.0 ,                       phone arrived early and the packaging it was in was securifor the phone the phone looks and performs amazingly  seller is quick deliver and sells quality product  bravo sir      
1808,5.0 ,                       love it for my first iphone   very much like new  better than what i expected for the price   no scratches and shipping was super fast       
1809,1.0 ,                       blue tooth failure should not happen for this age device and something easy to assess during renew phase  i am surprised that they missed this in their evaluation      
1810,5.0 ,                       as some other people i was a little skeptical ordering a  renewed  phone from an unknown seller  but it was great  fast   day shipping  and phone arrived in great shape  phone itself had a few very very  minor light scratches that can only be seen if u inspect it very closely  cant notice them with a glass screen protector on  no other dents dings or scratches anywhere  phone is valid and official  in fact there is   month factory warranty left on the phone  battery life is great  lasted   days of normal use which is incredible   phone was unlocked as advertised  and worked with my cricket sim no problem  charges quickly  very fast phone  great phone and purchase overall       
1811,2.0 ,                       i don t want my trade in phone worth      to be put on an amazon gift card  i want it on my credit card as a refund   thank you   audrey oswald     
1812,5.0 ,                       was skeptical at first but i m so happy i went through with it   i ve had it for a few days now and it s been nothing but amazing  definitely something to look into if you re looking for one      
1813,5.0 ,                       had it for a while now and still works perfectly fine      
1814,5.0 ,                       this phone is awesome and in           condition  buying an amazon renewed product comes with a little bit of a lowered expectation for appearance and battery life  however  and that s a big however  this phone was pristine  my order was fulfilled by trademore  the screen is in perfect shape and is responsive as it should be  faced works great  the cameras have no wear and work perfectly  the body has one tiny visible scratch that is completely covered by the case  battery life is       i spent weeks looking for a refurb phone in excellent condition that wasn t overpriced and i m so glad i went for this one  it also came with apple branded cable and block which was a huge surprise  note that every phone is going to be different when you re buying renewed  but this was a total win  before this i had ordered a renewed iphone xs  it came from a different fulfiller   kiss electronics inc  and it came with a chipped camera  visible scratches  and the sticky cover on the phone was covered in hairs and fibers  it was a huge disappointment and i had to pay return shipping on it  i m so glad i went for the xr and it far exceeded all of my expectations  i highly recommend      
1815,4.0 ,                       i got my phone at     battery life so not to much aging  overall very nice phone it s certified like it said it is  my experience was great  certified by an actual human being      
1816,4.0 ,                       the shipment didn t arrive on time nor the next day   this survey came before we even had the item  the price of this phone should have had everything it did not come with earbuds for music the charger was not apple it wasa non name brand and dirty       
1817,4.0 ,                       i was skeptical about buying this phone considering the bad reviews but so far  this phone is a pretty good deal considering the low price  this phone is refurbished so it makes sense that it has a couple minor scratches on the front and back side of the phone  nothing too major though the battery life is also really good      
1818,5.0 ,                       this phone is literally the best  i got the black one and red for me and my daughter and they came in a day early  no scratches  in      good condition  we ve had these phones for a week now and it s just like a brand new phone       recommended           
1819,5.0 ,                       this vendor was great  the phone looked brand new  and he even added a case and a glass screen protector   very good experience     
1820,5.0 ,                       i bought it for my father s birthday     
1821,5.0 ,                       this phone came on time and was as promised  unlocked   it says scratch and dent but there were little to no noticeable marks  it was exactly what i needed for my teenage son      
1822,3.0 ,                       the phone overall is in good condition  couple scuffs on the back but not crazy bad  however  the earpiece sounds pretty muffled when taking on the phone  it s difficult to use unless turning on the speaker      
1823,5.0 ,                       this one works well   haven t had any issues so far  ordered the coral one originally and had issues  the phone didn t work after a month  but this one has been great      
1824,5.0 ,                       overall an upgrade from a prior iphone    so far this product has done a great job after a month of use  long term usage has not been determined but expecting nothing less than quality from apple      
1825,5.0 ,                       i hesitated a ton buying this phone renewed  constantly reading other reviews  videos about buying iphones online but i finally decided to go through with it since i had amazon s return policy to give me confidence  once i received the package  i found i had nothing to worry about at all  it arrived in amazing condition  with a charger and wall adapter  i would recommend buying amazon renewed iphones to anyone now  no regrets whatsoever and i saved money      
1826,5.0 ,                       perfect condition   came in factory box with headphones included   i don t know if the iphone xr usually comes with airpods but mine did just kidding no headphones       
1827,5.0 ,                       i know the idea of a  renewed  or  refurbished  phone may seem scary to some people  i was really worried before i bought this   i couldn t believe the deal i got getting this phone and thought it was too good to be true and i d have to deal with a faulty device  well  boy was i proven wrong  my phone came fully unlocked as it stated and all i had to do was pop my sim card from my iphone   into this iphone xr and it worked  it started the setup process immediately  all apps work  calling  texting  settings  are working  i am really glad i took a chance on getting this phone to save a couple hundred dollars on a newer model  if you re considering getting this phone  get it  you won t be disappointed      
1828,5.0 ,                       phone came brand new    i was shockedit had no scratches or dents no scuffs of any kind  came with a certified apple cord and brick and a headphones  unfortunately no screen protector  battery health was on a       it s worth it     
1829,5.0 ,                       i received my iphone xr yellow in the mail a day before it was suppost to be here  everything works like new  there was a little scratch on the glass but you cant feel it and it s not really noticeable at all  over all it s a great phone     
1830,2.0 ,                       the phone was overall good but the camera was cracked and chipped      
1831,5.0 ,                       works as expected      
1832,5.0 ,                       excelente equipo en muy buenas condiciones     
1833,1.0 ,                       dont buy unless you have days to spend getting it unlocked i went to apple verizon tmobile and back to verizon which is my carrier and i was still unable to unlock do not buy this it s a waste of time and money     
1834,5.0 ,                       el telefono lleg  en excelentes condiciones y por un mes ha funcionado a la perfecci n  operador en latinoam rica      
1835,5.0 ,                       i was so hesitant in buying this phone because of a few bad reviews but i am sooo happy i bought it  came in perfect condition and full charge  really recommend      
1836,5.0 ,                       almost perfect condition  two small dings on the top corners but otherwise perfect  great battery life and function  it arrived in two days  which was an awesome surprise  definitely recommend this great deal      
1837,1.0 ,                       i paid extra to be compatible with the sprint network which is  was not      
1838,1.0 ,                       phone worked great but as soon as the warranty period expired the motherboard broke  couldn t charge or turn on  toon it to professional repair and swapped out battery and charging port still wouldn t turn on or charge  would be careful not sure how good their refurbishing is     
1839,5.0 ,                       nice phone came sooner than expected  a little imperfections on the screen that honestly i couldn t even notice until i was putting on the screen protector  battery life isn t as long as some of the reviews say   it lasts all day but it wouldn t last longer than that   i still love it and the price awesome deal     
1840,5.0 ,                       my sister loved it      
1841,1.0 ,                       ven a da ada la pantalla  y hacer el reemplazo desde guatemala es casi imposible  tuve que gastar en una pantalla nueva  mejor c mprese uno nuevo sale igual      
1842,1.0 ,                       this phone is actually not fully unlocked      
1843,5.0 ,                       it came quite quickly i didn t have to wait a month like usual it took about a week it works like brand new  i bought it for my    yr old and if something was wrong he would definitely let me know     
1844,1.0 ,                       it came with so many scratches and dings in it     
1845,5.0 ,                       everything i asked for  this product is exactly how it was advertised  there are no scratches and the phone looks brand new as well as runs perfectly  it even arrived early  didn t rate all five stars because there is always room for improvement  all in all i would definitely recommend buying this if you are searching for a used iphone that is under a thousand dollars  i was a bit worried that the price was a little sketchy considering the newer iphone cost the same amount as multiple car payments  i was proved wrong      
1846,5.0 ,                       my daughter really wanted a coral colored iphone xr for xmas so i came across this site  i was so skeptic of this and nervous at the same time that this would be a bad idea    but it wasn t  the phone was in absolute great condition when i received it  not a scratch one  it also came in a nice plain white box with a charger included  i was so shocked that this phone was so brand new looking  on xmas when she opened her phone she put her sim card in it from her previous iphone and she didn t have any problems with that  she s only had this phone for a couple of weeks now but so far so good  highly recommend       
1847,5.0 ,                       i love my phone    it was worth the price  i have had no problems with my phone or my service and i absolutely love it  i was able to turn my service on which is straight talk with no issues     
1848,5.0 ,                       great phone so far  came with a charger  also came with a phone contract trial which i didn t need because i have att i went from an iphone   plus to the iphone xr which i was not so sure about but still no difference from the iphone    so i m glad  i made the right choice      
1849,1.0 ,                       phone was not unlocked internationally at least  us sprint chat mentioned it was still in their systems and needed the original phone number to make sure there were no missed payments from the original owner  this was my first and last experience buying used      
1850,3.0 ,                       i returned this because the iphone had a bunch of scratches and it looked like it had been through a lot   it didn t look like it was well taken care of andit was going to be a gift for a friend that had a really old phone   i was really disappointed in getting this      
1851,5.0 ,                       glad i didn t buy new  totally worth it  thanks     
1852,5.0 ,                       i like it   its really awesome     
1853,1.0 ,                       phone says it s unlocked but my provider said its locked       bucks spent and i cant even use the darn thing       
1854,5.0 ,                       i was a little skeptical at first ordering a phone from amazon especially a refurbished one at that  i ordered the phone tuesday  and said it will arrive friday but it actually was delivered wednesday  the day after i ordered   i was surprised it came that fast  phone works perfectly feels like new  didn t come in original box or have original accessories but that s okay with me  highly recommend  i got the xr blue    gb     
1855,4.0 ,                       the phone works great  only problem was that the silent button seemed kinda worn off  it switched easliy up and down without purposely touching it but it is not a deal breaker for me  i figured that with my phone case i stopped myself from doing it      
1856,1.0 ,                       got the phone like this    disappointed     
1857,1.0 ,                       the charging port does not work  the screen look fine sometimes it will not sense movement on it  i have tried to contact them for   weeks now and no reply back      
1858,5.0 ,                       looks great works great  battery life don t last but about     of a day but good phone     
1859,1.0 ,                       ive owed this phone for    days now and the battery life is trash     wont charge past     and drains in about   hours flat   now its currently not taking a charge at all and shut off    ive tried   cords   i want a refund       
1860,1.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought two phones for my two sons this weekend  one works just fine  one immediately started spazzing and glitching and putting up multiple screens at a time  it s impossible to use  i ve been on the phone all day with apple customer service and now they say i have to take it to the apple store to verify it s not working  i m very frustrated  i just want each phone i bought to be useable and not have to drive all over creation the day before thanksgiving      
1861,5.0 ,                       i was very unsure about buying this due to all the negative reviews  but i got just what i was expecting  its a good phone in great condition and it came in   days   i ve been using it for roughly two weeks now and i am absolutely impressed with it  a worthy purchase indeed      
1862,4.0 ,                       i liked that the shipping was fast and that the phone came very well boxed and wrapped  i was skeptical about purchasing a refurbished phone off line but this experience has changed my mind completely  i received the phone about a month ago and so far so good   i m happy with this purchase      
1863,5.0 ,                       the phone is bigger  wider  and heavier than my previous phone  the iphone     the battery lasts longer and recharges very quickly   the touch screen is very responsive   i m very pleased with the xr      
1864,5.0 ,                       i was kinda scared to purchase such an expensive device through amazon  but they pulled through  phone is wonderful in great shape no scratches and came with charger cord      
1865,5.0 ,                       this was as new as could be   i think possibly just a store return or something  excellent product  no cosmetic issues and was fully functional      
1866,5.0 ,                       i got the phone yesterday          and i love it  everything about it works amazingly  the set up was easy and the phone was unlocked  my carrier is t mobile and it was easy  the battery life is at        i didn t expect that at all  it charges pretty slow but i m okay with that bc the battery lasts a long time  there s a minor scratch that i can practically not see unless i look really close  dont listen to the negative reviews    yes always take caution but this phone is great        so far      
1867,5.0 ,                       the phone itself is great  works perfectly and is in great condition  the generic charger that came with it did not work at all  so i had to go out and buy a new one  overall  i am very satisfied with phone just disappointed with the charger      
1868,4.0 ,                       great phone  you will not be disappointed  i wasn t sure at first but i gave  it a try and i don t regret it  i don t see any scratches on the screen or the back   overall i am very happy with the purchased     
1869,5.0 ,                       i thought it was to good to be true but knock on wood everything is working perfectly absolutely love it  it also came with a screen protector and a charger which i thought was pretty cool and very helpful some of the negative ratings almost made me not get it but i m glad i did     
1870,5.0 ,                       really great phone if it s in good condition  mine has no scratches   a well functioning system and batteryi highly recommend reviewing your specific seller before buying a refurbished phone hybrid it  is doing a really great job with quality of products and customer service     
1871,1.0 ,                       the phone was not paid off  it would not work for my sim card which is t mobile based the t mobile tech said the phone was unlocked but not paid off when my sim card was inserted the phone keep trying to pull up a previous plan from the previous owner s of the device  the tech said the only reason a fully unlocked iphone wouldn t take a new sim card is cause the previous person leased to own the phone and didn t pay it off and sold it this phone is junk and unusable      
1872,5.0 ,                       i was super skeptical about ordering a phone on amazon and some reviews scared me but i m so happy i did  the phone looks and works like it s brand new and i have yet to have any problems with it      
1873,1.0 ,                       good morning  i have recieved my iphone xr  however i contacted my phone prover  and in them trying to activate this iphone xr i have been informed this product is not unlocked meanwhile  i have attempted on several attempts  i have tried  to contact  amazon  concerning this issue whereas  i have been instructed by metropcs   and apple to contact the company  i e    amazon   to get the appropriate code and or codes to unlock this devices  please contact me  faye gomillion account holder regarding this matter at                thank you in advance for your immediate attention to this matter  i amfaye v gomillionpurchaser     
1874,5.0 ,                       hasta ahora funciona muy bien s lo ten a algunos rasgu os pero sigue funcionando hasta ahora      
1875,1.0 ,                       do not buy from this seller  i bought this for my daughter for christmas and we have spent all morning trying to set up face id  turns out the true depth camera doesn t work      
1876,5.0 ,                       my daughter love everything about this p  hone  it seems to be the best one yet     
1877,2.0 ,                       i figured with the description of such slight defects that may be acceptable by amazon for a refurbished iphone xr it would be worth it to save     by ordering a refurbished for      rather than order a brand new one from apple for      when i first opened the box  updated the phone and got it set up with my apps  everything was great  then i went to the apple store to buy a screen protector and some other accessories  when i was putting on the screen protector i noticed a crack which runs almost the entire length of the screen  it appears the seller buffed this and possibly used a glass filler to hide the cracked screen  i ve taken photos to share i ordered this phone as i m traveling and needed a new phone  well i have no choice but to eat this scam by amazon and the seller because i m traveling and don t have an option to not use this phone amazon should require high quality photos of actual products on sale  not images copied from apples marketing of a product      
1878,5.0 ,                       this iphone was like new and works just like a new phone   it had no scratches and was in pristine condition   i have activated this phone with my wireless carrier and it works fine   takes really good pictures   it s a cheaper option instead of buying a new one for double the price      
1879,1.0 ,                       the speaker did not work so you could hear the other person on the line but they could not hear you  the seller will not send a replacement phone before shipping the malfunctioning one they sent me and it was a birthday gift for my daughter  also it took   emails for them to state that  very disappointing      
1880,5.0 ,                       it s not perfect but it s perfect  cause it came with about   scratches that i didn t even notice  my brother pointed it out  that s literally the only issue  besides that it s just like a brand new phone  i fell so in love with the camera quality  it s perfect for me      
1881,1.0 ,                       this phone was not unlocked when it came in  i tried sim cards from two different phone companies and none of it worked      
1882,5.0 ,                       just received my phone today  so far so good  i was very happy with the condition of the phone  looks brand new  other than a small scratch at the top right corner  i had to look hard to find  came with a screen protector  clear case  and the standard charging equipment  as long as the phone stays in good working order  i ve been using it all day  i will be      satisfied  also  it shipped quick and arrived a day early      
1883,5.0 ,                       what i received was a pretty close to perfect used smartphone   pretty close equates to damn near perfect  no blemishes  no scratches  operates as advertised  glad i chose this phone      
1884,5.0 ,                       this phone looks brand new   i love the size and the color of the phone      
1885,4.0 ,                       so far the phone came out pretty darn good  the battery life lasts me all day and the face id works perfectly  the screen is sensitive  i love it      
1886,5.0 ,                       i was skeptical about getting the phone at first due to the bad reviews i read  but im glad i took a chance and trusted that everything would be great  i ordered an unlocked iphone and that was what i received  the phone is in great condition great battery health  screen has no scratches  glass isn t cracked and it operates just fine  i am pleased with this phone      
1887,5.0 ,                       iphone is in almost perfect condition  no visible scratches on the case or the screen  battery health at      my wife is very happy with the phone  no issues with buying from this vendor      
1888,3.0 ,                       it was working fine for the the first   months that the warranty covered  but then the battery life dropped by      in a matter of weeks      
1889,5.0 ,                       i really love this  it came a day early  no scratches  no dents  it works like brand new and the battery holds great charge  you really get your moneys worth with this      
1890,5.0 ,                       product exactly as description  perfect condiction  including the battery life  original power charger  missing only headphones and original package      
1891,5.0 ,                       it s good  i would buy it again     
1892,5.0 ,                       it is a great phonethe only issue i had was the apple logo not being on the back     
1893,5.0 ,                       my phone is in absolutely perfect condition  i debated buying the phone straight from apple for some time because a few people had left negative reviews  however  i took the risk because of the price and am so glad i did  i ve had it for over   weeks and everything works to a charm      
1894,1.0 ,                       we purchased a phone this august and within two months the phone was dead    zero response   best buy confirmed it was dead   now after returning the phone the company is claiming that we didn t send them the right phone    it is the right phone  they re support is just giving us the run around  we should have just spent the extra money and bought our mom a new phone      
1895,5.0 ,                       this is a great phone  and it arrived quicker than expected  i love the features and how easy it was to set up the phone      
1896,4.0 ,                       very good bang for the buck  it comes with great battery life  is like new with only a few minor scratches  the only drawback that i am currently having is low audio notices  the volume is low for some odd reason  i don t know is it that all the phone are like mine or is it just my unit  i m ok with it tho      
1897,4.0 ,                       the batter percentage is at    percent but it feels like the phone dies within a hour but other than that it s fine  beware though you might have to pay    dollars for a new battery      
1898,5.0 ,                       son loves it      
1899,5.0 ,                       it s beautiful it looks actually brand new not a scratch on it     
1900,5.0 ,                       inexpensive phone because it s renewed but works and looks like it is totally brand new      
1901,5.0 ,                       ordered the iphone xr    gb in coral  when i first ordered it  i had my doubts about buying a renewed phone  but when the product arrived my thoughts completely changed  everything works great and the battery health is at a perfect       great purchase and recommend anyone ordering one who s in the market      
1902,5.0 ,                       i was really skeptical that it would be a real iphone and work and everything  but i was happily surprised to find that it is a real iphone  and is in great condition   make sure you read reviews from which seller you get it from to avoid getting scammed  and check on the return policy beforehand as well  very happy with my purchase        
1903,4.0 ,                       great iphone   really like the coral color just wish it came with more protection like a simple cover and or case for how expensive it was plus the screen had minor scratches on it where it wasn t covered by the screen protector  overall satisfied  thanks amazon      
1904,5.0 ,                       just want to share some up to date feedback for those looking  if i am pleasantly surprised by an experience  i feel i owe the company some good feedback  i took a chance and ordered a renewed unlocked white iphone xr phone from this listing  tech exchange was the seller who fulfilled the order  phone arrived on time in pristine condition  i couldn t find a scratch on it  it had a glass screen protector already applied  this was a nice bonus  the  battery health  indicator in ios showed       i was expecting since it was renewed it would be off a couple percentage points  i ve activated the phone with dual sim on verizon and google fi s networks  so no issues with the phone being sim locked  the phone has otherwise worked flawlessly  i ve had it for about   weeks now i am super happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone on the fence      
1905,4.0 ,                       did seem like the battery drained quickly  but i am chalking that up to the installation process

1927,5.0 ,                       my phone came today  the day i m writing this review  in new condition and it s fully unlocked  it has no scratches or cracks and it was     charged when it was delivered  it also came wit a screen protector on it which was a bonus        would recommend this company as my mom also purchased a phone from them      
1928,3.0 ,                       i purchased this phone as an upgrade from my iphone  plus other than it missing a fave feature of mine  the  d touch this phone is definitely an upgrade the quality of the device i received was decent  no obvious scratches  dings  or issues  the main complaint i have is that every about ten minutes of use or so  my screen is unresponsive  i have to completely click off my screen and reopen my device to regain control of the screen again  idk what the issue is but i have updated the device  turned it all the way off and on again so now my only hunch  is that it was due to this being a refurbished device  i just wish it was disclosed in the product description i feel with this malfunction the value for money isn t quite there  but that s what i get for purchasing online i suppose buyers please purchase with caution and knowledge that you may receive a device that only works sometimes

1930,5.0 ,                       it took me a very long time to find a phone on amazon  coming from boost mobile i was very skeptical but i swear this is not a  scam  you will get your phone and mine even worked with boost mobile  it came with a screen protector  sim removal tool  charger  and a box  and it came   days early  no complaints from me       
1931,5.0 ,                       the phone arrived in good condition     
1932,1.0 ,                       phone is not unlocked to carriers and when you try to add it to any service provider they will say the imei number is invalid meaning it s not a real device  i made the seller aware of the issue and was ensured i would be refunded  i placed the phone in a plain box and secured the phone with foam  after reaching out multiple times  i get a message saying  unfortunately the time is damaged and we can t refund you because we don t cover physical damage   i made them aware that the item wasn t damaged when i shipped it  the whole issue is this phone has a false imei   and cannot connect to carriers so it s basically a brick  all they keep saying is they can t do anything  i m pretty sure the phone was intentionally cracked so that they could continue with there scam and not refund me  i didn t even ask for an actual refund  i just wanted the phone unlocked the way it is advertised  so now i m out of      with a brick    that s now magically cracked  please be careful

1936,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          soooo worth the money  it came in a generic box with a non apple charger and some warranty and return info  the phone itself is in nearly perfect condition with no scratches and just a little dirt around the camera which is nothing  battery capacity is at     which is really good it lasts me a whole day without charging it  i had no problem transferring my sim card either  thank you very much to the seller      
1937,4.0 ,                       the phone is in really good physical condition  only issue was the top speaker being distorted when playing sound  though it is functional and i am still able to make calls and hear them clearly  it is a slight bummer  i can t really complain as the price of the phone was really good and the seller is giving me a     refund  overall  great buy
