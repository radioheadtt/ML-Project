10,5.0,                       good sd card     
11,5.0,                       works well right out of the package  used it for memory back up for my icom      hf radio

14,2.0,                       as other reviewers have noted  the write speed of this card is horrible  i bought it to replace an older sd card and the sandisk performed much worse  here are the comparative benchmarks for both   sandisk   gb ultra sdxc uhs i memory card      mb s  c    u   full hd  sd card   sdsdun     g gn inwarning  only       of       mbyte tested test finished without errors writing speed       mbyte sreading speed       mbyte sh testw v                                                              samsung pro uhs i   gb sdxc memory card   mb sg  d amwarning  only       of       mbyte tested test finished without errors writing speed       mbyte sreading speed       mbyte sh testw v                 this may be fine for some uses  but is unsatisfactory for photo video cameras   one of the main targets of sandisk memory cards  my canon  d mark ii shoots long bursts of raw images at   fps and this write speed is insufficient

64,5.0,                       when you want the best  use sandisk   i ve always used sandisk storage devices and i have never had a problem with any of them  this card is fast and holds tons of your pictures   files   etc   i m using it in a security camera that is outside   no problems with extreme temperatures in winter or summer   what s even better is how cheap they are to buy      
65,1.0,                       it has no tab to push up  it is read only without the tab  unusable for my application      
66,5.0,                       i guess the only frustrating thing about sd cards is that the quality and price of them improves as time passes  this is twice as fast and twice the storage for half the price of the one i bought last year sandisk good     
67,5.0,                       this sd card holds alot and that s the best thing about it  it  is not flimsy and doesn t cause any crashes on my computer or camera  i would definitely rec this to you all

73,5.0,                       great memory card  glad i ordered it      
74,5.0,                       initially  i wrote a review saying it wasnt really    gb  but i realized i had to reformat the memory card  i never had to do that before  but that did the trick and i was finally able to access the full    gb  for            i d say that was a steal      
75,5.0,                       great value     
76,5.0,                       we have a laptop but there was no more space on it  so it was laggy  we needed a memory card      
77,1.0,                       if you re purchasing this for a  ds or  ds xl    it s not compatible   you need to get a micro sdhc of  gb up to   gb      
78,5.0,                       my new car does not have a cd player so i stored all my cds in this card and everything fitted   the media player has no problem recognizing the files and the sound and definition is perfect      
79,5.0,                       quality     
80,4.0,                       read speed is good at   mb s but write is really slow    mb s     
81,5.0,                       using this in a kodak negative scanner  works fine  what else would you want of it      
82,4.0,                       love the film color and quality         
83,5.0,                       i use this with my mpc live   and it loads very fast  i heavily recommend  it s actually a lot more space when being used in that manner

126,5.0,                       i got my sandisc    gigabyte ultra sd card through the mail in perfect condition  i inspected the packaging and labels to verify if i had received a  fake  memory card and everything was intact as well as the accuracy of the labels  the packaging was very tightly packed in with the cardboard and clamshell packaging melted together  the memory card is secured in a clamshell packaging with a plastic film that covers the would be exposed section of the clamshell packaging inside the cardboard packaging  the memory card labels  icons  and finished paint for memory card s sticker is exactly the same as the images online for the product  i had used an external usb memory card reader with     usb ports and used the h w test software to verify if the memory card has accurate memory information  storage capacity  as well as read   write speeds  the test had no errors that had ever occurred and i have exactly      gigabytes which is what your going to get  read   write speeds were about    megabytes on average for me but i m using an external     usb sd card reader  so it s fine overall  the memory card works as advertised i m a very happy customer      
127,5.0,                       great     
128,5.0,                       i will be buying a few more at these prices     i been using sandisk for a while now and will stand by them  im sure there are better but that usually means more
