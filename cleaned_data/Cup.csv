0,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i had been buying a different set of cups for over a year   then amazon switched these to be there amazon choice cups  so i switched   i ve learned my lesson of following amazon choice   its clear they were just looking for the best deal for amazon   my first day with a cup of coffee  coffee drips out of the cup and onto my shirt   i assumed i had not put the lid on well   scroll forward    days and i have paid to have   shirts and two pair of pants dry cleaned and one ruined shirt   they simply don t seal well and the cups drip out liquid even when the top is fully on   i don t know which makes me madder  that i kept using the cups or that i assumed amazon would have fully vetted these before calling them amazon choice      
1,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       we have ordered these cups several times without issue   the most recent batch we received almost all of the cups leaked after a short time filled with coffee   the bottom edge let liquid seep through  cups would buckle at the weak point and leak at the bottom      
2,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       we have these dixie cups on a subscribe and save order  we have been ordering these cups for about a year now  our last order we noticed that the first few cups in over have the packs of holes in the bottom of the cups  this has led to quite a few messes because we don t always notice      
3,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i didn t want to believe the reviews on  leaks  but yup sadly there are some cups that leak and some that are just fine  im disappointed because these cups are so cute    i use these cups for my coffee in the am but might have to replace since they keep leaking update         i said i wasn t going to buy these any more but i came back  i just couldn t find any other better cups  i really love these  i haven t had any leakage problems anymore  i feel like they really listened about the reviews update            okay so now its      and i m still using these cups  i actually subscribed for monthly packages  haven t had a leakage problem since the first time i bought these  im a happy customer we all love coffee here at home so these are used multiple times a day everyday       
4,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       these are great  this particular deal is a great one  i use these every morning during the week day and have not had a spill yet  make sure when you are putting on the lid that the hole on the lid is directly opposite to the seal line on the paper cup  dixie disposable coffee cups are my go to and this particularly style is super cute since it has cute little messages on them      
5,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       good value for the price  but i can t give   stars bc after an hr car ridez any coffee left in my cup is pretty much cold   i m a slow coffee drinker   also  the lids seem cheaply made or poorly put together because they constantly pop off the top and several times i have actually poured spilled some coffee all over me and or inside my car while getting in and out of my car  which really sucks  i have a pretty long commute in the mornings so i was looking for something disposable and that would keep coffee warm for my son for his hot chocolate in my coffee so once i got to work i could just throw the cup away and not worry about the cops at my office or in my car  i recently found that the knock out yeti s for    at walmart are actually amazing at leaving beverages actually hot for hours  so once we ve used it all these cups up  i will probably be switching over to those for our daily routine and just continue to search for a better quality to go cup to use as needed      
6,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is an excellent product  these cups have leak free lids  and when full of hot coffee they aren t too hot to hold the    ounce capacity is just right for most people at my office  i love they aren t made from styrofoam despite feeling like they are  i hate to say that i trust dixie brand for a reason  but yes  i really do the lids attach firmly and are easy to put on  the cups are sturdy enough to wash once or twice and reuse  and they hold up to an overnight with water in them   clients sometimes set a cup down half full and leave it there  if we are in a hurry closing up  we don t always notice until the next morning  these are thick enough that no sleeve is needed  even with piping hot liquid inside  there are no burned fingers      
7,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i m very excited to have this as a subscribe   save option  i was forever forgetting to take clean coffee cups to work  i only have cold water there  so i had to take them home to clean   so this helps me out  the sayings are fun  a step up from the old cups they had  the lids work with the starbucks  plugs  so your coffee stays hot longer  it s not going to keep your coffee as hot as a thermal cup  but it does help  and your hands don t get too hot while holding it  the heat of the coffee doesn t transfer to you hands much       
8,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       update it s gotten so bad with the leaking that s i ve finally given up  i m switching to another brand so i ve been using these for a while  and i ve noticed that lately i ve been having more and more problems with drips down the side of the cup where the seam is  after spending a ridiculously inordinate amount of time trying to figure out why  my best guess is that the seam in the lip of the cup  which has a raw edge  appears to wick up the liquid and when it becomes oversaturated  starts to drip down the outside of the cup  i haven t had the same issues as others with holes in the cups or lids ripping  but i have definitely had problems with leaks and stains on my clothes      
9,5.0 ,                       living in a house of coffee drinkers  we ve bought multiple reusable travel mugs and try to use them when we can    but these are so great for being able to take and toss  we use them most while camping and it s nice not having to wash out our mugs i do try to limit use  as i consider the landfills being filled with my cups  but if i need a quick grab and go cup that i can toss    these are my favs the designs are adorable too      
10,5.0 ,                       my family uses these cups for coffee every morning and they work great  they have a thin insulating layer around them so you can handle hot beverages  note that it is thin so scalding hot beverages can t be held for too long  even a cardboard sleeve doesn t handle that for long i find they hold up well and being packaged in groups of    lids and    cups makes it easy to store the extras until they are needed      
11,1.0 ,                       i went to use my first cup today and the printed pattern is peeling off all over and looks terrible  how embarrassing for me to have something like this at work  also  the lid i grabbed for today with my first cup is cracked  i dripped coffee on my keyboard because of it  i would love to return these but can t since they re not able to be returned      
12,5.0 ,                       these are nice cups   the lids fit fine   the cups don t get hot  so no problems handling them with hot liquids   i haven t had problems with leaky bottoms   my photos are of a cup after   refills today      
13,1.0 ,                       horrible  every time i put the lid on it splits right where you need to take a drink  so annoyed by this  thought i was getting a great deal because dixie is usually a good brand but there must be some sort of flaw in the design with these lids  also the cups are not quite durable enough  they look like they ll fall apart if hot liquid is in them for too long  which is crazy since they are made for hot liquid  i definitely want my money back for these      
14,5.0 ,                       this is my first time ordering disposable hot beverage cups   these couldn t be cuter and they are working well for me   i haven t personally experienced any of the quality issues other customers mention with leaking or lids  however i drink coffee fast   i make my coffee     degrees and drink it within an hour or two   i m loving taking the cups on the go when i m running late for work   the price is great      
15,1.0 ,                       i have been using this brand for years  love them  this order was received and they are totally unusable   the strong scent of perfume is imbedded in every cup and you literally get sick from the smell while trying to sip  most of the lids were also crushed and rendered them useless as well  has to be a seller issue  very disappointed since i can not return them      
16,1.0 ,                       i have used dixie cups at work nearly    years  never had this problem before   this current batch is defective   my coffee group at work has found several cups with small puncture holes  maybe as many as   in    it appears to have happened during the manufacturing process  i attempted to capture one of the punctures in the attached photos      
17,5.0 ,                       good cup for traveling  i reheated my coffee in the microwave several times before i got the little scorch mark on the bottom and the cup didn t fall apart  coffee stayed warm for quite awhile in it  the cover fits nice and tight too  will definitely buy again      
18,5.0 ,                       i love these i gottem to go  but use them in my no dishwasher little house they aren t hot at all to the touch  and the lid stays on  im weird  i like straws and squeeze the straw through it i forgot to mention  got this organizer at amazon   u gotta get one  the cups and lids fit perfect      
19,5.0 ,                       these cups are the best for on the go hot drinks   the lids never accidentally pop off  the outer foam insulation keeps your hands from getting too hot  plus it s comfortable for holding  an all around excellent product and one that s been added to my  regulars  list      
20,5.0 ,                       when i started with my employer  they had some white coffee cups that were hot to the touch  so i purchased these with the lids and everyone loves them  i see more and more employees using these now more than ever  great purchase and i avoided sticking with the white cups   lids   having to purchase sleeves  all that out the window for these which are perfection with the added bonus of the fun designs      
21,5.0 ,                       these togo coffee cups are excellent   lids are strong  cups are well insulated and not hot to the touch   they are also thick so you don t get the leaky bottom if you leave a drink in there for an extended period of time  i e  heat your coffee up for the  th time and then set it down and forget about it for a day or two    any other mom s or dad s out there           i ve purchased several times and i m never disappointed      
22,3.0 ,                       i ordered these  paper  cups as i was hoping to microwave them for a short time to heat up my tea   it turns out these cups are coated in some sort of plastic  making it a very bad idea to microwave them   i wish i hadn t bought a whole case   the packaging says paper      
23,2.0 ,                       i have had two cups leak  nothing visible and cups in the middle of stack so no excuse  have a lot of cups left so how many more i may have a problem with i don t know  never had this happen to any cups ever before      
24,5.0 ,                       love it  holds heat in very well  doesn t seep through after long periods  very nice details on the designs  cute and colorful  expressions      
25,1.0 ,                       i have been buying dixie cups for years  i have always loved them  however  these cups leak   as soon as hot water is poured into the cup for tea  it starts dripping out of the bottom   a leaking cup is worthless  i will not buy these again  unfortunately  i bought multiple packages  i think the seller should give me a refund  i actually wonder if these are  real  dixie cups      
26,5.0 ,                       these cups add that little something to the morning   the little saying on the cups help get you going and provide a little smile to others when they read the cup keeps hands from getting hot  but insulated to keep my drink hot plain white cups got boring  these are way better      
27,3.0 ,                       i find the cups to be durable and fairly well insulated  they are coated on the outside so that they dont require sleeves  the biggest problem with this product  imo  is the lid  the lid constantly  and soundlessly  cracks near the mouth  giving you quite the surprise as you re drinking  this isnt a horrible setback if you re working from home in a tshirt and jeans  however  office managers and people on the go may want to steer far clear of this product  unless your company covers dry cleaning bills      
28,5.0 ,                       i use these for my short term rental  read that airbnb  accommodations   i really like the spill resistant lids that are matched to the cups   makes my guests happy that they can take their morning cup of joe with them instead of having to leave it in the sink   just a little nicety and these are perfect for the job  sturdy and even kind of fun looking   win  win      
29,1.0 ,                       i get these cups often   they are medium weight   not thick enough to stand up to piping hot coffee   but no plastic or cardboard taste   i like dixie hot cups better than cheaper giant store brand or more expensive solo brand      
30,5.0 ,                       these cups don t leak at the seams   i have tried other brands  and they all leak at the seams   the cup is not flimsy when holding it is worth to spend the extra money  to get a better travel coffee cup      
31,1.0 ,                       no lids i m absolutely confused  plus there isn t anyone i can co tact to find out why i received   packs of cups with no lids  the description said cups with lids and it doesn t qualify for a returnable item i never write bad reviews  but this is unfortunate      
32,3.0 ,                       my wife and i have been buying these on and off whenever we are running late out the door and want some coffee  pros  keeps coffee hot for a out   hours  more than i need   additionally  the insulation on the outside prevent you from burning your hands while holding the cup over the past few months the new cups seem to leak after and hour like the bottom kind of tears from the liquid  it sucks because they are arguably some of the best to go cups out there but the quality has been lacking lately      
33,1.0 ,                       i have ordered these many times  but this last batch i received is not good  the cups are leaking  the lids keep breaking   i have now had an entire hot cup of coffee spilled on my daughter  very disappointed this time      
34,5.0 ,                       we bought these to go with our coffee hot cocoa bar at our wedding reception  we have not used them yet but we are very pleased with our order so far  they have fun  cute sayings on the cups and where way more affordable on here than we saw in the stores  it will work out great      
35,5.0 ,                       i was surprised at how cute the cup designs were  these are convenient and sturdy  i can see myself even reusing them a couple of times  i like to keep these around for family gatherings and when i m on the go  these are great      
36,1.0 ,                       don t buy this  it doesn t hold up to putting a cover on it  it collapses  also they will not take it back nor refund your money  stay away      
37,5.0 ,                       i stopped buying these for a little while because i thought they were a little pricey  and bought cheaper cups  after having coffee dribble everywhere whenever i tipped my cup  i relegated the cheapo cups to my craft room for mixing paint  and put the dixie s back on my subscription  i ll never make that mistake again      
38,3.0 ,                       great cups to have on the go  awesome brand  my only issue is  there are never enough lids to go with the cups  i have so many extra cups with no lids  each pack i open always have lids missing  this makes me not want to buy them again but  i just love this brand      
39,5.0 ,                         holds  hot liquids without melting cup  convenient size  lids stay on with a snap  hot liquids can be felt through cup  however  unless scalding hot  i can easily carry a hot cup  i m not in kitchen much so i don t have a high heat tolerance in my hands      
40,1.0 ,                       i bought these locally and they were great   i bought these through amazon and they are terrible   they leak and in order to hold them we have to double them up because of the heat   i can t figure out how to contact the company to let them know      
41,4.0 ,                       love these cups for tea  milk  coffee     i also like the different quotes on them  i always look forward to see which quote i get next     silly but fun lol i must say they tend to feel flimsy once the hot liquid is poured but i havent had any issues at all with leaking or burning myself      
42,5.0 ,                       does not leak through the cup  i use them on a daily basis for coffee  very well insulated  the lid can leak if you line up the hole you drink from on the lid with the joint of the cup  but if you avoid this  the lid will never leak  this is a common thing with these types of cups so i don t really consider it an issue  the issue is when the lid leaks no matter how it is placed on the cup   which is obviously not a problem with this cup      
43,3.0 ,                       nice cups  but do notreheat your drink in the microwave  within   minute the outside of cup started bubbling and melting  the smell was bad too  before i purchased them i checked and it said they are microwave safe  not true       
44,5.0 ,                       my husband uses these at his shop   its the only kind he likes   nice and sturdy   keeps coffee hot and doesnt spill     
45,3.0 ,                       they redesigned the cups with a more juvenile look  and made them more expensive  no thanks  i ll get a different brand from now on      
46,5.0 ,                       temporary kitchen sink snafu    can heat up and drink coffee  soup  etc  from these cups cuz  microwave safe     
47,1.0 ,                       terrible  lysol  smell of all the cups  i don t know what kind of chemical is used to manufacture these cups  but i cannot drink anything from them  the smell is absolutely disturbing     
48,4.0 ,                       all the inner packets arrived with some lids crushed  bad handling  otherbthan that the producto is awesome  i will purchase it again   but need to save and wash some used lids     
49,5.0 ,                       i use these every single day for work  it might be bad for the environment  but for a busy teacher it s much easier than having to wash a travel cup every day  this cup makes the coffee stay hot for a long time  and i ve never ever had a leak in it  the lid fits tight and it s comfortable to hold without burning your hand  these are perfect      
50,5.0 ,                       this is a fantastic deal from this vendor and these are real quality cups i highly recommend them to anyone who s interested     
51,2.0 ,                       this is my fourth time purchasing these cups  my most recent order as well as the one before have been disappointing  as you can see in the pictures  the lids have arrived dented  i learned this the hard way  the lid has popped off while drinking coffee at work  i would say about    percent of the kids are dented and need to be thrown away as they are ineffective      
52,1.0 ,                       cups are fine  lids are terrible  the kids crack every single time when you have something hot  like coffee  in it  you d think for coffee cups  they d anticipate an issue with lids breaking with hot liquids in the cup      
53,2.0 ,                       i ve ordered these for years and they have been reliable  this last box is defective and the cups don t stay sealed on the seam  i thought it was just a few cups but the second bag of cups is even worse  i keep getting coffee all over everything      
54,2.0 ,                       the lids break every time i use them  i can t use these cups without making a mess  unfortunately i am now stuck with a ton of them but can t use them        
55,5.0 ,                       so far so good  i haven t had a single bad one  they work good for cold and hot beverages  good quality  you can hold it while drinking your hot coffee or tea without burning your hands  i recomend      
56,5.0 ,                       great price for the quantity  our kitchen is being remodeled and we needed disposable cups for coffee  these were perfect      
57,5.0 ,                       really enjoy using these cups for hot tea each morning   the lids work perfect on the go too  no spills   good service  efficient delivery   thanks  jim     
58,3.0 ,                       very disappointed in the  lids  that came with the cups  for some odd reason  about     of the lids end up cracking near where you sip  ending in leaks and drips  it s too bad  these cups are have been the best cups for hot beverages to go  i called and emailed dixie  but no one has ever responded      
59,5.0 ,                       got these for use at home and at my salon  sturdy well made cups and lids  i love being able to grab coffee as i run out the door and not have to worry about forgetting my mug at work or leaving it somewhere along the way  also great for clients who don t get a chance to finis their drink  and can now take it with themselves      
60,5.0 ,                       love that these are just the right size for my parents  they enjoy these      
61,1.0 ,                       i have ordered these cups many times on amazon  my most recent order was a terrible disappointment  the cups were leaking and in some cases  the bottom fell out completely  this is particularly dangerous with hot beverages  i have checked multiple packages that were included in the shipment and each one had at least   cup with small holes on the bottom  most had several defective cups    awful and will not purchase again      
62,5.0 ,                       unlike the cups shown in the photos above  these dixie cups are great   they have funny sayings on them and most important  they do not leak  unlike another brand which i purchased  which gave way at the bottom causing leaks   love these  will purchase again      
63,1.0 ,                       the lids don t fit properly  went through multiple cups and lids trying to get them to fit  they just pop right off as soon as you grab the cup  spilled coffee in the car as a result and my   year old spilled hot chocolate on herself because of it  tried to return it because it s defective but amazon says it s not eligible for return  be careful if you buy these      
64,5.0 ,                       great for my home office  keeps hot drinks hot  great designs too      
65,5.0 ,                       there are perfect  i use these inside the house because not only are these convient  but i am required to have lids inside as well as when i m on the go      
66,5.0 ,                          day when i go to my local coffee shop vs  a few cents when i make my own latte  win for me   when i don t have the time to sit and sip  on the go is the only way to go      
67,3.0 ,                       i like the convenience of being able to throw away the cup and they are a good size for me  one disappointment is that they seem to change the taste of the coffee compared to a ceramic cup  i think some of the waxy plastic may wear off      
68,5.0 ,                       i use these daily   great for coffee on the go  quick shipping and product was in perfect condition      
69,1.0 ,                       i bought these cups about    days ago but just opened my first package this week   for   days in a row the lid split on the cup within an hour of putting the lid on hot coffee   like the lid could not withstand the heat   it is too late for me to return the item  but it is defective      
70,1.0 ,                       the latest batch we received has bubbles on the outside and didn t stay cool with coffee or tea in them  can barely hold them because they are so hot   definitely a faulty batch      
71,1.0 ,                       this to go cups are really bad quality  it leask after    minutes  i caccont use these cups and unfortunately they are garbage  i always use dixie products but this time i am really disappointed  i actually just emaile to dixie and lets what will they say      
72,5.0 ,                       adorable designs  comfortable feel  they work well for hot  warm or room temp beverages  like coffee and red wine   for chardonnay or a nice vodka club on a summer evening  you re either going to need a different cup or slam er down quick as the seams sweat quite a bit     
73,4.0 ,                       honestly  they re disposable paper cups  they hold hot liquid with a lid for traveling  they re nothing to write home about  they are not designed to keep your coffee hot for a long period of time but they are good at keeping it from just being poured into your hands  they function      
74,5.0 ,                       sturdy and well insulated  no defects      
75,1.0 ,                       the picture is the very fist cup out of the box  leaked like a screen door  i shouldn t have to go through a sleeve of cups just to have a few cups of coffee  yes  i have and use real coffee mugs but teenagers and visitors don t  this is the  th brand i have bought  if anyone has a product recommendation  please let me know      
76,1.0 ,                       i hate these cups  they feel like stryofoam on the outside  they said they were paper  i would have never ordered this many      
77,5.0 ,                       i love them  they are the best after trying several other brands      
78,4.0 ,                       these dixie cups with lids are a suitable fit for our church kitchen  giving it   stars because even with the extra outside foam it could use a sleeve   our coffee is pretty hot when it s first made  a grabbing the hot cup is a little much for the fingertips  like the look of the cup  fit of the lid  and quality of paper product      
79,2.0 ,                       have ordered these many times but last order the sturdiness of the cup was not good  i use one for several cups of coffee and it was never an issue  now after about an hour  they crumple when i refill and press the lid on  going to try another brand

83,5.0 ,                       perfect size for daily coffee   insulated so not hot to touch     
84,2.0 ,                       the cup is okay and has a decent feel but the lids are super cheap  the lid has a weak point and splits after being on the cup for a few minutes which causes it to fall off which in turns leaves you showered in hot coffee      
85,5.0 ,                       very useful and convenient for beverages      
86,5.0 ,                       these to go mugs are convenient both to send with someone who does not live with you and to take with you anywhere  just toss when you re done  no taking home and washing   they have cute designs as well      
87,5.0 ,                       these cups are great   wish they had a sleeve so it is t so hot to the touch but other than that i like them

92,5.0 ,                       i buy a    pk from walmart once a month and just realized i could buy the    pk for pennies a cup cheaper  the cups are well worth the money     
93,1.0 ,                       these are horrible   every lid has cracked when placed on the cup   it doesn t always happen as soon as you put it on the cup   therefore  you usually end up with coffee on your shirt by the time you get to work because unless you are paying attention you do not realize it has cracked      
94,4.0 ,                       i take a cup of coffee everywhere i go  i leave a cup everywhere i go  it was getting expensive to leave reusable thermal cups everywhere so i started using these   they work  i don t agonize over leaving one somewhere so we have a perfect match

99,5.0 ,                       excellent quality and great price  after ordering these  i read the reviews and thought i made a bad choice  but product was in excellent condition and box was sturdy and not an amazon box  but a dixie one   happy with my purchase and plan to reorder from them again       
100,1.0 ,                       the seem near the bottom of these cups gets saturated  then leaks within     hours   poor quality   the to go cups at costco will stand up all day   can t wait for these to be gone      
101,3.0 ,                       i love how cute they are  they are decent quality  but to be honest i have had some issues with leakage at the seam  it s too bad  because they are so cute      
102,1.0 ,                       i bought these to heat cups of tea in my microwave   they are not usable for this purpose  because they smell terrible and leak if microwaved      
103,5.0 ,                       this was a great purchase as the price was fantastic  they are the same as the ones in the store but way cheaper  will buy again if still available from the same seller      
104,1.0 ,                       i purchased the dixie cups and lids from costco several times over the years  the last   months the lids have all cracked after being on for   minutes  i thought i would try amazon but the same thing happened  going to a different brand of cups with lids  done with dixie      
105,5.0 ,                       came with a few cups unraveling at top but still good cups     
106,5.0 ,                       love these cups and have been buying these for about a year now  they re super durable and great for the price      
107,2.0 ,                       these cups are very thin   you really have to be careful because the cup gets very hot when you add the hot water    i was unable to pick up the cup   i attempted to return but you have to go through so much      
108,1.0 ,                       more then half of the cups weren t sealed all the way so when you pour anything into it  it all spills out

110,3.0 ,                       the lids do not fit well and often crack when trying to put them on   they were not showed on or put on forcefully and they still crack     
111,5.0 ,                       i ve ordered a few different coffee cups over the years and this is my favorite  i use them at home for my keurig coffee to go every morning  they re great because your hands don t burn from the hot coffee  the lids not only fit perfectly but they re easy to drink from  some lids leak or the opening is too high and uncomfortable to drink out of  these are the best  if you re looking for coffee cups look no further      
112,5.0 ,                       my office loves them   co workers have brought other cups  but these are the favorite in my office   have not had any issues at all

115,5.0 ,                       i first got these cups for coffee on the run  but then started using them all the time  i can now enjoy my coffee and not have to worry as much about it getting dumped by one of my little angels    they just love to crawl all over me when i have a cup of hot coffee in my hand  please don t get me wrong  i am still careful not to let them knock it out of my hand  this just makes my morning cup more enjoyable      
116,1.0 ,                       i had ordered these before many times and they were fine   the last   batches have lids that almost immediately crack   this leads to me or someone else getting spilled coffee all over themselves or even burnt   and now i m stuck with a ton of them

136,3.0 ,                       too much writing on the cups  i don t know why companies take the risk of overdesigning their products and expect to sell well please keep it simple  your logo or your name brand is enough on the cup   pick me up  currently caffeinated      won t raise your sales   good luck

158,5.0 ,                       these coffee cups are my favorite   they are easy to hold   they outside of the cup is not smooth like some cups are   the material on the outside of the cup has some grip to it so that the cup will not slip from your hand   it also seems like it would be more insulating than other cups that don t have the grip texture applied to it   i recommend them

196,5.0 ,                       use these for hot or cold beverages  and work great  sometimes after a while of keeping liquids in it  the cup will definitely start to feel softer  but i ve never had it rip on me  the lid also stays on very well   i ve had to run briskly walk to catch a shuttle  and didn t have any problems with spillage

464,2.0 ,                       purchased these for the office  they are cute but not durable      
465,4.0 ,                       good price     
466,5.0 ,                       exactly what you want from cups and tops     
467,5.0 ,                       just like advertised     
468,5.0 ,                       perfect condition  there are six individually packed      
469,5.0 ,                       cute design  easy grip n keeps drinks hot without burning hand  very pleased      
470,5.0 ,                       stop spending money on overpriced coffee  i bought them because i am sick and did not want to injure myself with hot liquids   i  also now use them for cold liquids  much safer      
471,5.0 ,                       i buy this product all the time elsewhere because i tend to lose too many reusable tumblers  these are exactly what i buy at a much better price  i read other reviews stating they did not get the right amount but i had no problem  i am more than satisfied      
472,5.0 ,                       these cups are perfect for travel   they aren t hot to the touch  no matter how hot the liquid inside   great bargain      
473,5.0 ,                       good solid build     
474,5.0 ,                       a      
475,5.0 ,                       they work great  my hubby uses these now  instead of my glass mugs  when working in the yard  right now shoveling  and i get to keep my mugs instead of finding the broken   worth the switch up       
476,3.0 ,                       these do keep drinks warm for a bit  but they aren t wonderful   i was also surprised to find  when i opened the box that there were only     cups and     lids   i see now that there is one picture that says     cups  but the item description says     count  which seems to indicate to me that i would receive     cups and     lids   normally  when i buy this type of product it says something like     cups and lids   which is what each of the six interior packages said    there were    cups and    lids in each of the six interior packages   i guess in summary  these are the same quality that you purchase at the grocery store  and since you are only getting     cups  they may be less expensive at your local store update  amazon gave me a partial refund for my order and has updated the description accordingly   the price is now also lower than it was when i wrote my original review by approximately      so i will be buying again      
477,5.0 ,                       i bought these cups because i hated taking a reusable mug just to find myself carrying it around all day  literally  i don t have a bag or backpack   these cups are the perfect size and keep the beverage warm enough long enough to enjoy it  they do let some heat out  but sometimes i do not want scalding hot coffee  haha   they also have a foamy texture on the outside which helps you keep a grip on it  i will buy more once i run out of these      
478,5.0 ,                       very pleased with timely delivery

499,2.0 ,                       this is supposed to be     cups and lids  that s   packages of    count cups lids  amazon only sent me   package of    count cups lids so yes  the cups themselves are great  but i m disappointed that amazon packed and shipped this partial order  and instead of amazon just sending me the rest of the order  i had to send the    count package back for a refund  i ordered what i needed from another online wholesaler      
500,2.0 ,                       i ordered as paper cups  these dixie cups are not paper      
501,5.0 ,                       awesome  textured cups tops  exactly as described      
502,3.0 ,                       okay cups  i was looking for all paper   i did not want any petroleum products on the cup   when it says paper cups i wrongly assumed they were all paper      
503,2.0 ,                       there s a small hole in each lid  is this normal      
504,2.0 ,                       i specifically wanted paper cups because of their feel  these are paper on the inside but the outside is coated in a styrofoam  you cannot tell this by the pictures   this is not mentioned anywhere  i am very disappointed   will spend more money to get the vegaware ones next time at least those are actually paper  price is ok for the quantity though      
505,1.0 ,                       after about      minutes with hot liquid in them  they leak around the bottom seam  it seeps out and drips all over the place  junk      
506,4.0 ,                       the  product features  says     count cup   but it s really         i guess it says that in one of the photos  but it wasn t super clear when i ordered   anyway  they re good cups that insulate well  and they re still pretty cheap      
507,3.0 ,                       dixie to go hot beverage cups and lids are an excellent idea to have on hand  in case you re running late and don t have access to a reusable thermos  however  there are a few things to consider before choosing them as your go to  disposable hot beverage container pros     these cups do a fantastic job of keeping beverages hot  i m able to enjoy my coffee at a reasonable rate without having to gun it down before it gets cold  that s one of the reasons i use thermal  disposable cups versus reusable  ceramic mugs  i don t particularly appreciate having to rush through a cup of coffee or tea    the plastic lid prevents the contents from spilling  which i appreciate since i m relatively clumsy    each cup contains a funny  unique saying that puts a smile on my face cons    these cups do not have a sleeve to protect your hand  which surprised me since that s the norm  it seems easy enough to include a cardboard sleeve that you can grip while holding your beverage  unlike foam  which isn t recyclable but keeps your drinks hot without burning your hands  these cups transfer a tremendous amount of heat  and within seconds your palm is in pain    these are technically recyclable  but that depends upon where you live if you don t have any nerve endings in your hands  then i suggest you try dixie to go hot beverage cups and lids  but if you re like me and can still feel the heat  then i don t recommend these cups unless they include a cardboard sleeve in future packages      
508,5.0 ,                       i love this product so much that i find myself placing monthly orders   i enjoy the positive sayings displayed on cup  these cups comes with lids and keeps the liquid hot or cold depending on usage      
509,1.0 ,                       disgusting  the cup smelled like burning plastic as soon as i have my hot beverage in it  my drink also tasted nasty as of this burned plastic was mixed into it  will be returning this     
510,5.0 ,                       i fell in love with these cps a few years back   i used to bring my own travel mug to work with me each day but what i found over time was that there was a buildup of residue in the lid of the cup that never would come out   i then moved on to buying these cups from costco  but the issue i had was that costco would sell the cups in packages of         and the lids in packages of       so at any given time i would have extra cups or lids i ran out of cups   yet again   and i found myself on amazon looking for the same disposable dixie cups i love   i found this box with   packages in it for a great price   i would guess it was comparable to the cost at costco when you buy the cups and lids   and you don t have to worry about having an extra     lids or cups at any given time these cups are great for hot coffee   they keep your hands from getting too hot   they also don t drip that much   because i ve gone to work with coffee droplets on my shirt on multiple occasions   the lids are tall enough that the coffee doesn t splash out through the lid either   overall  these are the best travel cups i ve found and i don t have to worry about things growing inside the lid   plus they are also a great value   which makes it all even better      
511,1.0 ,                       these cups are horrible     they are constantly leaking from the bottom and side seam  i m sitting in my office and look down to see my cup leaked through the bottom all over my paperwork  ruined paperwork that i spent all morning printing  my productive monday turned to crap thanks to these cups  stay away  far far away      
512,3.0 ,                       first yes my hand does get hot holding these cups  can only use once  will start to leak come apart around the bottom  i will use up what i have but will not reorder  for a name brand is poorly made i found out do not leave any liquid or leave the lid on when done  i have had less problemwill i order again   no  i have found other on amazon     
513,5.0 ,                       i just use these in the house  great price   can never go wrong with dixie its not the first time i have bought     
514,1.0 ,                       this last shipment of the dixie cups was not up to the normal amazon dixie cup quality  when you put hot coffee in the cups  the coffee starts leaking from the seam on the bottom we would like a credit on these cups and do you have a suitable replacement as we use them every day thank you for your kind attention to this matter sincerely jack a  cohen     
515,4.0 ,                       i have been using these cups for a long time and have always found them convenient and love them  however most of the time now  they start sleeping through and leaking at the bottom  see picture  i hope  i ur addresses it or i will have to change brands      
516,5.0 ,                       these are geeat    have a grippy outer coating  very happy  handy as heck for groggy mornings     
517,2.0 ,                       dixie changed this cup   my family used these cups for years   now  just in the past few months  dixie changed the composition of the cups to a much thinner material   they get hot in your hand and also leak after limited use   i need to find a different kind      
518,4.0 ,                       good cups  does not come with cardboard sleeves for hot drinks  tops fit very tightly  limiting spills  pro   but simultaneously making it difficult to get top on completely  con       
519,5.0 ,                       very good cups at fair price     
520,5.0 ,                       holds heat well without burning your hands      
521,5.0 ,                       we use way to many of these and they are amazing  i love the built in holder   sleeve so you do not burn your hands  you seriously can not beat these and i have tried all the brands out there  the lids are also included and fit as they should  try some generics some time and you will see why you should buy these      
522,4.0 ,                       i find these cups very convenient in a pinch if i want coffee on the go   they are pretty durable   i actually get a few reuses out of them a lot of times  the failure point is when the lid no longer seals properly around the rim of the cup    the one problem i have is there is no hole to let air into the cup while you are drinking  like most normal coffee lids have   this results in terrible flow of coffee which i find annoying   the easy solution is just to poke a hole yourself  which i now know to do   but if you forget or you don t realize that is the problem  you may be in for a subpar coffee drinking experience   if anyone from the dixie company ever reads these things  i would highly recommend that minor upgrade to your product      
523,4.0 ,                       occasionally we have a complaint that the sides are too hot   need a sleeve  kids fit perfectly     
524,1.0 ,                       surprised at all the great reviews  these make coffee taste like plastic  not at all like the great tasting starbucks cups  i couldn t even finish my cup  it tasted so bad  now i have to buy another brand      
525,2.0 ,                       several lids split and cups had manufactured date of           
526,1.0 ,                       been using these cups for   plus years  cup could be used over and over   not anymore   leaks after first cup of coffee  no refills here      
527,5.0 ,                       nice     
528,5.0 ,                       love it     
529,1.0 ,                       these cups have a smell and taste of detergent   it s a shame   the hot coffee further  activates  the bad smell   useless      
530,5.0 ,                       nice coffee cups with lids      
531,5.0 ,                       love these      
532,1.0 ,                       i have bought these cups for years at the grocery store and have had no problems  but i was looking for a better price  the product description says       ct    great deal  right  until you figure out that it s     per piece  in other words it s     for a cup lid set  sneaky      
533,4.0 ,                       tired of your coffee cups never making it back to the sink  then this is the product for you my husband was horrible about taking my coffee cups and glasses to work or hunting  i discovered these while shopping at my local store  i looked on amazon and found them in larger quantities which made it more economical one of the great things about these cups are that they are hot or cold cups  they are thick enough to not be able to feel the heat of the beverage but insulated enough to keep the beverage hot for some time the lids are easy to put on and have a small sipping port so that you aren t spilling coffee down your work shirt great product for the price and i will definitely be reordering in the future these cups are great for hot coffee  they keep your hands from getting too hot  they also don t drip that much   because i ve gone to work with coffee droplets on my shirt on multiple occasions  the lids are tall enough that the coffee doesn t splash out through the lid either  overall  these are the best travel cups i ve found and i don t have to worry about things growing inside the lid  plus they are also a great value   which makes it all even better     
534,1.0 ,                       these cups are supposed to have plastic lids that prevent spills  i used to purchase them from costco because they were larger quantity for less money  however  i stopped buying them there due to constantly cracked plastic and lids falling off  not to mention spills    i hoped that different packaging would mean a different source for the product  but these lids do the same danged thing  i have spilled more coffee picking up a cup that the lid has broken than i have had lids not break  they snap on fine  but within     minutes  they crack and are no longer attached to the cups  time to find a different alternative  unless you don t care about having a lid  otherwise boycott dixie cups      
535,1.0 ,                       i have been using these for years and loved them  i ordered another case in january of      as i was getting low  i recently started using the new case after running out of the last order and there has been a product change  the lids are no longer as pictured  they look similar but are now gray  whenever we try to use these the lids crack and leak  upon closer inspection all the lids have a thin spot near the mouth hole and when you snap on the lid they crack or worse yet the crack half way through the drink  both my wife and i have spilled coffee down the front of us while driving  unfortunately i am past the return window and now have a case of cups headed for the trash as i have missed the amazon    day return window  these usually last me several months so you may also find that when  you get to a new sleeve they are junk also  i will go back to buying local so i have someone that stands behind the product  seriously makes me think twice about buying something from amazon that you will not use within    days  buyer beware       
536,3.0 ,                       i have a lot of experience with different disposable cups  especially chinet and dixie  i bought these thinking they d be reliable  while the cups are mostly fine  the lids are split in the package  making them unable to actually stay on the cup and risking burns and spills the cups themselves feel spongy and can be hot to sensitive hands  but otherwise felt comfortable to use the lids are flimsy  and came with splits where they are meant to seal around the cups  see the pictures for what i mean i am a bit surprised at amazon s no refunds and no exchanges policy on these  i d think defective hot cups would be important  and warrant exchanging for non defective cups as a matter of customer safety if you decide to buy these  be very careful      
537,5.0 ,                       cups hold about       ounces of hot beverage  lids fit onto the top easily and securely  i know they are disposable  but i often write my name on them  when i am at home  and use the same cup     times  even if i have had coffee  i can easily rinse it out to use for tea if i wish   makes my life easier  as it is one less thing i need to wash every day  i drink coffee every day  and if i have more than one cup of coffee in a regular ceramic cup  i need to really wash it out with a sponge  not just rinse it  as i find that the ceramic cups hold coffee residue moreso than the disposables  my family liikes the idea of take and go coffee cups that they don t need to worry about rinsing out and returning home  they don t want to necessarily carry around an empty coffee travel mug all day  and it saves quite a bit of money  considering that the average cup of coffee at the popular coffee spots run       each and this usually ends up costing about    cents a cup including the coffee pod and the creamer      
538,5.0 ,                       dixie to go disposable hot beverage paper coffee cups  lids are included  are clearly the highest quality disposable coffee cup on the market  bar none   i use them every day  often using a single cup       times before disposing it   they keep coffee quite hot  something that is most important to me    they are easy to hold   the cup is never too hot to handle   lids fit perfectly   hold in the heat   these never leak     i don t know what the negative reviewers who claim their cups leaked did to them   they never leak    never   they are a bit more expensive than some other disposable coffee cups  but are higher quality making for a bad comparison   if you want a high quality disposable cup that keeps your coffee hot but isn t too hot to hold onto  these are the cups for you   i will definitely reorder these      
539,1.0 ,                       i m really disappointed with this purchase  i purchased these for my salon and while what i received is similar to what is advertised  they are not the same design or color  what s more important though is not all of the cups are fully lined meaning  when you put any liquid in them  it seeps through to the outside lining  it affects the flavor of the coffee tea and you can definitely feel it  i m not saying you re going to get burned but it s not a pleasant warmth either  i can t allow my clients or anyone else to use them  definitely would not purchase again      
540,1.0 ,                       up until now all has been ok  lids not the best but this last order the lids were damaged bad enough that when you pick up the cup  the lid flips off   not really happy but basic cup was needed even if the lids were bad   i have attempted to contact the dixie company but no reply and it as been weeks   exactly who is the shipper   the lids are constantly damaged i assume in shipping or the storage of the cups before being shipped   would love to have some answers   have bought these cups for years and until recently happy with the product           
541,1.0 ,                       for years i have used these cups with no issue  the latest batch is different  while the photo shows the older model with black lid  i received ones with gray lids  the look to be the same design  but all of the lids crack shortly after putting them on the cup  i thought possibly my batch was damaged  so i tried some left over black lids from my previous order  and those cracked too  all i can come up with is that the size of these new cups is slightly larger and stresses the plastic lid amazon was very helpful when i reported this and gave me a refund      
542,5.0 ,                       these are the best cups  i buy them all the time  coffee and cold beverages  use all day  rinse out between use  and they don t lose their strength   nice grip  hands not slide   microwave for   min    sec to reheat cold coffee  microwave for    sec or so to rewarm cooling coffee with lid on no problem  sipper hole is awesome  not flip open and stick in opposite spot  ya know those that come unstuck and hit you in the nose  just make sure you ve got the lid on right      
543,2.0 ,                       dissapointed as the seams on side of cups as well as at the bottom only hold up for about    minutes  then start leaking through  i love the prints  and the exterior doesn t get too warm to hold hot coffee    i m hoping this was just one defective sleeve or i won t reorder      
544,1.0 ,                       the lids i received came in silver gray and not black  after spending an hour on the telephone with amazon arguing that my lids came in a silver gray versus the    photographs that show the lids in black  a return was not possible      
545,5.0 ,                       i ve ordered these cups several times and have been very pleased with them  i have also dropped my cup several times and the lids do not pop off which is wonderful to me   they are attractive  lightweight and pleasing to the eye  i order the   oz  size and it fits with my keurig just fine  i ve  put it in the microwave for no more than    seconds to re  heat and no issues as far as melting or anything like that   i ve tried several other cups that come with a small black lid and they pop off all the time or they are shortened in the count for cups   that s very frustrating with    cups and    lids  would highly recommend these cups anytime  i love them       
546,5.0 ,                       im crazy about coffee  i created my own in home coffee bar these cups accentuates positively my bar the cups are of very high quality and have grip  its easy to hold even right after pouring a hot drink i have used less than    but so far none of them defective like some buyers suggest  if i do come across a defective one im pretty sure i will swap it for a new one     
547,4.0 ,                       arrived fast and secure  my only problem with these as opposed to getting from a big box retail shop is the lids keep cracking which causes a spill every sip so i ll be short on lids eventually  maybe it was a fluke though because it was only   sleeves   not every one   i lost a good    lids  but i will still purchase these because the price is amazing  it s like buy   get        
548,4.0 ,                       great deal on this multi pack of travel cups  we bought these mainly to use on road trips where you want to take a coffee with you but not deal with the mug in the car the entire time you re gone  but we ve also ended up using these for coffee to go for houseguests too  cups have a nice feel with the integrated insulation  keeps your hand from getting hot and also has a little texture for grip  my only complaint would be that the cups are a little soft  so that it can be difficult to get the lids snapped on securely  but that is a pretty minor issue  once snapped on the lid is very reliable      
549,5.0 ,                       i typically buy these at target or grocery store but ordered on amazon this time due to the pandemic  they are the same quality as i usually anticipate and all of the cups and lids came in normal  good shape      
550,1.0 ,                       i bought the set of   cups and every time we would put the lid on they would split and coffee dropped out  this was not just one package it was all   packages  this could ve been very dangerous if the lid split all the way  if you don t use the lids there good cups      
551,5.0 ,                       as many of coffee lovers  i like to taste several types of coffees from different regions and diverse brands  also  i have my personal equipment at home to prepare expresso  capu  mocha    so i decided to make my own coffee to go in the morning on my way to work after some research  i found this pack of dixie cups and lids  despite the put a wrong price per unit       count   i still make my choice for these talking about the product  the cups are great  the texture in the cup help you to not drop it and could also protects you against the warm contents  i already used all of them  cups   lids  and      were perfect  no spill and nothing wrong until the last sip finally  the design is very good  i just ordered a new box because i can t live home without my coffee highly recommended      
552,5.0 ,                       i still give this   stars for the clean internal dixie material and the reasonable quality   but  why did they change the material that the lids were made out of     so cheap and they all break    i don t use the lids   so this does not vex me too much   but         lol      
553,5.0 ,                       these are my  go to  disposable cups for purchase  they are the cheap  durable and have a cute design  the cup does have a little give when grasping but i have not yet had any issues with quality  i would say this is probably around my  th purchase of the     count pack    the price usually averages to about     cents a cup which is fair enough for me to stock the office coffee station with them      
554,5.0 ,                       i really like the dixie insulated paper cups for the comfort  quality  and amount they hold   these are even better because they are cheery too   i have permanent cups with lids on them too but i m kind of a slacker for cleaning them   these allow me to keep my drink hot and aren t as horrible as some of the other choices   plus made in the usa and recyclable      
555,3.0 ,                       i ordered these twice  the first order was perfect  no leaks and i reused a few cups a number of times without problem  this second order    uughhhh  the lids do not stay on  they leak over the sides and the cups are flimsy  i tried to tape the lids down in an act of desperation and they still spilled leaked  i still have   bags of these left and i m likely to just throw them out  which eats at me since i hate wasting things  the first order i would give   stars to and this second order would only get    so i ll leave   stars in the review and hope that dixie fixes whatever caused the bad cups     
556,5.0 ,                       i always bought these dixie coffee cups but this was a different design which was fine but while i pour coffee in it it gets very soft and starts leaking  i don t know if the design made a difference but i was very disappointed      
557,5.0 ,                       i buy these for our sunday school class meetings   the price is reasonable and the size is perfect using a k cup coffee maker   they come with lids which helps eliminate spillage on the tables and floors      
558,5.0 ,                       these cups look exactly like the picture  they work perfect  i use them for my hot chocolate at work   i put them in the microwave for   minutes with no leaking   no issues  i highly recommend these cups      
559,1.0 ,                       these are flimsy cups that leak really easily weather hot or cold beverage and it doesn t take long as starts seeping from the seams and the bottom  unfortunately cannot return them but i ll just never buy them again      
560,3.0 ,                       love the cups and lids don t leak but noticed when the cup gets hot it can have a very gross smell but the mouth piece but only just started noticing this so maybe it s just this batch  will keep you updated as i bought   months worth                
561,5.0 ,                       i buy these every couple of months so my husband can take a cup of coffee out the door with him as he goes to work  these cups are stylish and sturdy and hold heat  i have ordered them  some several times and have always been satisfied with them  great price for this product also      
562,1.0 ,                       pretty sure we got defective cups  the ring around the bottom of the cup leaks the coffee out after an hour  totally disappointed won t buy from amazon agian or this product from anywhere      
563,1.0 ,                       very poor design and materials    cups leak within minutes at bottom by the seam     materials used affect the taste of product in cup i suppose i could say the kid is great         
564,1.0 ,                       these would be great  if they actually included lids  no lids included despite the description and pictures clearly showing and stating that there are  do not buy      
565,5.0 ,                       nice designs and super convenient for my hot beverages      
566,5.0 ,                       i love these cups  but i do not recommend putting them in the microwave  they are covered in a thin film of plastic foam  that s the best way i can think to describe it  that insulates the cups  so when you microwave them  they smell terrible  they do keep your drink hot for quite a while  though  so you don t really need to microwave it unless it stays out for a while  then  in that case  you might want to transfer it to another cup first      
567,5.0 ,                       i give my kids oatmeal in a coffee cup for school almost every morning   it s healthier then most quick breakfasts and i can use whole oats and then add raisins or fresh fruit        cup whole oats  raisins  and boiling water to cover  let sit a few minutes  and a spoon is all you need  they work well for coffee too   i have had no problem with the lids fitting or drips out the paper   if you have space to store this large box of cups and lids its a better price then buying smaller      
568,5.0 ,                       i really like these cups  they only leak if you leave the liquid in there for several hours  you don t need sleeves with these  they do get warm but nothing bad      
569,2.0 ,                       cups appear fine  unpacked   stacked and then it was when i realized the problem   no lids   every single package i received was missing lids   correct brand  all appear new  no lids   they won t travel well or do well not to spill      
570,5.0 ,                       it s fine  at times the cup fells like isn t sturdy to hold depending how u grab it  feels like it will break the material if u squeeze it while grabbing it  the kids at times can b q problem  come off occasionally      
571,2.0 ,                       these are fairly standard disposable coffee cups and lids  i ve used them in the past and been pleased  however  with my most recent order through amazon  the cups have a serious flaw  the seam around the base is not water tight  and my coffee seeps through the cup within minutes  today i filled the cup just before getting in my car before work  and it was already starting to drip through by the time i did the    minute drive to work  sadly  i ordered in bulk this time and i just have to hope all   packs of cups aren t like this  a  to go  cup isvirtually useless if it doesn t last    minutes      
572,1.0 ,                       every single cup i ve tried in the last two shipments breaks   the lid splits when i put it on the cup   this did not happen before  and i ve been ordering these for over two years     
573,3.0 ,                       the cups are great but don t plan on using the lids  over half of the ones i received were cracked on the edge and would cause you to spill your drink all over yourself      
574,5.0 ,                       nice hot cold beverage cups   has a nice texture on them so they don t slip out of your hand             good cups  bought them again      
575,5.0 ,                       great      
576,1.0 ,                       i ve purchased these in the past and enjoyed them a lot but     of the last bag i purchased are leaking  either from the seam that runs up the side of the cup or along the bottom  none of these was used over night      
577,4.0 ,                       great cups  the only problem i had was the lids  about a third of them are cracked on the lip  so now i have cups and no lids      
578,5.0 ,                       love these for on the go coffee in the morning   solid lids  no drips  insulated cup doesn t need a sleeve   i even stick them in microwave for    seconds to warm up the cream before putting in the coffee  although i do notice the cup gets warm  so i would leave it in there for more than that   i will certainly repurchase      
579,5.0 ,                       these are way better than the other brand i tried  they don t leak  and they stay firm to hold even if the coffee has been in there a while  the other brand i tried seemed to soften to the touch the longer the coffee was in there   and also the lead did not sray on tight      
580,5.0 ,                       purchased for our work office  the packaging of the cups is awesome for storage  but the real highlight of these cups are the phrases on them  they make us all laugh and are enjoyed by our visitors  we require lids on our cups  so we re all pretty appreciative that these came as a set with cups and lids      
581,1.0 ,                       i bought these because my office is under construction for the next few months and the only place to wash a mug is the bathroom   gross  no  these project runway themed cups fall to absolute crap after about an hour  so if i want multiple cups of coffee   i  have to use multiple cups    and i also have to drink them in a  timely   manner           
582,1.0 ,                       these cups are still very hot and would suggest a sleeve with it  but the worst part is that the lids crack from the heat within a few min i had coffee spill on me a few times      
583,5.0 ,                       great cup and lid set  each order comes in a huge box  we used to grab starbucks every morning but that got pricey very quickly  so we decided to use these to make our own coffee in the mornings  these cups are not too big and not too small  this is equivalent to a tall at starbucks i believe  these are sturdy and while the coffee is hot  it does not burn our hands  the lids go on the cups tightly as well with no spillage  these cups will last us a long time but will definitely continue to order these from amazon      
584,5.0 ,                       these have been very handy for our household  i don t normally purchase things like this  i do not like to be wasteful and impact the environment  but i would always send my hubby off to work with a reusable cup of coffee  and he would bring several home  a month later  dirty   unwashed   smelly and moldy  why he wouldn t just wash them out is beyond me  so i purchased these cups to try out and they work perfect  have never had any issues with the lids leaking  if the coffee is really hot   we may double cup it  but it s working out great and i will continue to purchase      
585,3.0 ,                       i found i needed to double these cups for sturdiness   when i used only one cup the lid would sometimes pop off when i would pick up      
586,2.0 ,                       they start leaking just above the bottom rim after the  nd cup of coffee  then you have to get another to use during your commute   the manufacture doesn t want you to get a day worth of use out of it   others have posted pics  check them out      
587,5.0 ,                       definitely not the cheep stuff  the cup is thick and strong  keeps the heat in and away fro  your fingers  great value       
588,1.0 ,                       ordered these for the coffee service in our office   several of the cups leak when filled with a hot liquid   stay away        
589,1.0 ,                       love the cups but lids are too small and crack every time i use them  you can t finish a cup of coffee without have a lid crack and you wither spill it or you can t drink from lid     
590,5.0 ,                       since our company does not supply our items for our coffee needs we have to take care of that ourselves  the price for the quantity fit the bill  therefore it was a great choice     
591,5.0 ,                       love these  you can use in microwave  but stop the microwave and move the cup around every    seconds so it doesn t get too hot in one place  the cup will start to burn if you don t do this      
592,1.0 ,                       these cups are terrible  the bottom always starts to leak every time i put my coffee in it     
593,4.0 ,                       great cups  sometimes lisa break easy so you have to be careful  keeps warm for a while      
594,1.0 ,                       ordered arrived and i did not receive the item described   i got     cups  all the same design  and absolutely no lids  what good is a disposable coffee cup with no lid   i guess i ll have to make the trek to return them   very disappointed      
595,5.0 ,                       bought these previously at another big box store  they work as expected  they do not leak  and they keep my coffee warm  will buy more  next year lol      
596,5.0 ,                       these are awesome  i make hot cocoa for my special education bus driver an aid on cold days  these are perfect for on the go and easy to use      
597,5.0 ,                       we order ever month   we love them and we carry coffee from home everyday to work and saves us alot of money     
598,5.0 ,                       love these cups  lids don t leak and stay on i hate my yeti tumbler because it s cold to the touch and the coffee is boiling hot inside  these cups warm my hands and keep my coffee warm for about    minutes before i start drinking it  great non slip texture too      
599,1.0 ,                       the lids crack at the sippie hole   these are the gray lid ones      
600,5.0 ,                       better than foam cups  liquid stays hot longer and no damage to the enviroment      
601,4.0 ,                       some of the lids were damaged  not during shipping  box intact  but i was able to straighten them out enough so that they still fit on the cups   no leaks  i use the same cup all day at work with no issue   can t beat the price on such a reliable cup      
602,4.0 ,                       contrary to something i d read  they are not really microwavable  by the time i get to work  my coffee is more warm than hot  i made the mistake of taking the lid off   microwaving the coffee for    seconds   there were burn spots   i burnt my finger on one  these also won t work with a coffee warmer plate  yes  i m saving   by bringing my own coffee  but it s been a bit of a pain in the bum      
603,5.0 ,                         stars all around  these cups are great to have near the coffee maker  love the patterns and durability  they are easy to quickly grab and make a quick coffee in when in a rush in the mornings      
604,2.0 ,                       these cups are no good  poor quality  they can be compared to hotel coffee cups  but hotels actually give you selves so your hands won t burn  using these cups for hot coffee isn t ideal      
605,5.0 ,                       first off  let me admit   i have a problem   i m a bulk buyer   and i love coffee   when i got the idea that i needed these cups to use for my daily coffee  i thought   hmm  why buy one   or two   or three   i want more   i have these cups everywhere now   at my house  my office  and even my wife has some at her office now   now  we can all drink coffee whether at home  work  or on the go without having to worry where the damn cup is for my coffee   lid included      
606,3.0 ,                       the cups are leaking that i purchased  of the   packages delivered i have only opened one package so far and they all leak coffee  we will see how the other   packages go  i even started to double up the cups just to use them and after a hour it will leak through both cups edit  i changed my review from one star to   stars  one package of cups leaked coffee  other packages seem fine now      
607,4.0 ,                       have been using these every morning for over a year  they work as they should and fix leaving a cup in my truck all of the time

612,5.0 ,                       i started buying these in      i believe  since i am usually the only one to use them they last a long time  lids fit tight and drink stays warm long enough for me

615,5.0 ,                       i ve been using these cups for several years  every day at work  i ve never once had any of the issues others have reported with leaking or lids  they have been flawless and last at least through   cups  i love that they are eco friendly  and they keep super hot coffee only warm to the touch  maybe i ve been lucky  but i will continue to order them

623,4.0 ,                       these cups aren t paper thin  good cups     
624,5.0 ,                       great for your daily coffee during the commute  or anytime really  would recommend as a single use with  standard  hotness  if exceptionally hot liquid is used  the cup  over time  will degrade at base      
625,1.0 ,                       the lids split and crack almost every single time on my drive to work making my coffee undrinkable through the lid  junky and poor quality       
626,5.0 ,                       i love these cups  they re so convenient when you want to leave for work with hot coffee but you don t want to carry a mug around all day  these cups have a much nicer feel than the solo cups i used to get  and they look nicer too  i prefer a nice look simce i always have some out on my counter next to the coffeemaker  they re not cardboard  more a spongy kind of styrofoam  i will definitely get these ones from now on

635,3.0 ,                       i was very disappointed with these cups   the covers all had slits in them  which prevents them from staying on the cups  i m also not a fan of the sayings on the cups      
636,2.0 ,                       great price  however the lids do not fit well and pop off when cup of hot coffee is picked up   i ve received several complaints from my family and friends that use them      
637,5.0 ,                       a bit pricey  but love them  they keep drinks hot or cold for a good while  the lids stay on  don t easily pop off like some of these types do  definitely recommend

714,5.0 ,                       these cups were an awesome value  shipping was super fast  i ordered them on a thursday and they were delivered the very next day with the   day shipping option  afew of the lids had gotten bent while in transit i m assuming   but nothing was cracked or broken i was really surprised at how fast i received them  i used my first one today and don t have to worry about needing to bring it back home like i used to when i carried a travel mug of coffee to work  this  i can just toss when i m done  i also don t have to worry about my husband leaving it in his truck for days and then returning with a moldy travel mug days later   these should work out well for us      
715,5.0 ,                       can t beat   cents per cup with a lid included   these are big enough for my large size keurig setting with cream added   i have several reusable mugs but sometimes prefer something i can dispose of  and this fits the bill perfectly

830,5.0 ,                       order these regularly for our employees  they re a good coffee cup      
831,5.0 ,                       its a cup made out of thin styrofoam not quite like the ones we have in our kitchen  which are made out of thick plastic or glass  it s safer than the glass ones we sometimes use because if the glass breaks you could get cut  i found out these cup can be thrown in the garbage after a few learning experiences with the dishwasher

837,5.0 ,                       good product     
838,1.0 ,                       ugh   you wouldn t think you d have problems with styrofoam coffee cups  i was wrong  after a bit  the cup leaks at the bottom  causing you to have to use waste two cups  now i m stuck with a bunch of these useless cups  find something else      
839,5.0 ,                       excellent product at a very reasonable price   thank you      
840,2.0 ,                       i make my own coffee for work every day  saves a pretty penny   the cups are great and dont get too hot but the lids dont quite hold it in  no matter how i do it and how much coffee is in there it spills on me every day     
841,5.0 ,                       great cup     
842,5.0 ,                       this is my second time ordering this product through amazon subscribe and save and it has assertive early both times  they are very handy as i have two young children who love cocoa we and i love coffee we use a keurig and are often on the go  these save money from buying beverages out and are virtually the same double insulated cups you get at the gas and convenient stations      
843,5.0 ,                       great cups for a great deal     
844,2.0 ,                       they didn t work for me      
845,2.0 ,                       once again disappointed by a misleading product description  the description clearly says the cups are paper  but when i received them  they looked like styrofoam cups  i researched the georgia pacific website  and the specifications state  perfectouch  cups are made from paper with a polyethylene coating and contain approximately     compostable cellulose fiber by weight   to me  this says that the cups are     chemicals  and since the paper is  coated  with the chemicals  that means the hot liquid can cause leaching into the beverage  not what i m looking for      
846,1.0 ,                       the worse paper cups ever the cup is licks from the buttom the top is not that strong  i will never buy them again      
847,1.0 ,                       we bought these same cups at costco  but i wanted to write a warning review on amazon   my daughter uses these for milk while she drives to work   almost every single time  no matter if the cup is below half  the milk will shoot out the hole when she puts it in the cup holder   because the cup is not as sturdy as the heavier starbucks style cup  it is also easy to  squeeze  you drink out when carrying it my advice   you get what you pay for   cheaper  but easily spills creating a mess   when you re  on the go   it is doubly frustrating      
848,1.0 ,                       this is without a doubt the worst coffee cup ever made   the seal of the lid does not hold with hot liquids   that means it either drips down the front of your shirt when you drink it  or it sloshes out into your car when you make a turn   we actually threw out the rest of these cups due to the poor quality   save yourself the aggravation and use a paper cup with a quality lid      
849,3.0 ,                       great designs and very cute  however  when the hot coffee is poured into it  the lid is expanded and the lid breaks making it unusable   it s also very hot to the touch   will definitely not buy it again   maybe i just got bad lids   very leery of buying it again      
850,5.0 ,                       great quality  great price  adorable sayings  make sure you know what size you re buying  these are    ounce  and unless you only drink a reasonable amount of coffee in the morning  you will want cups that are at least    ounces  i m now stuck drinking my morning coffee in amounts that are safe for a human for a very  very long time      
851,5.0 ,                       i can t start my day without a cup of coffee and i hate carrying around coffee mugs containers  i bought this bulk pack to save money as i use a cup every day on my way to work  i use them with my keurig  which pours out    oz  leaving room for sugar and creamer  the cups are sturdy and the lids fit great  what else can i say about paper cups  they serve their purpose  it saves money buying in bulk  allowing you to enjoy your coffee  tea  hot chocolate  etc      
852,1.0 ,                       got these from costco  same issue as people are having here  they leak  every other feature is irrelevant if the cups leak  which they do and frequently  better down that coffee in five minutes or you ll start seeing coffee rings on your desk  and soon after you will have puddles  terrible product  who designed this thing      
853,1.0 ,                       like clock work  the lid breaks every morning  ugh  they re such cute cups  so disappointing      
854,4.0 ,                       mostly good product experience    such a delight to be able to make your own to go coffee  then drink up and toss the cup as you go about your morning  my only criticism is the  dribble glass  effect of the reinforcing indentations on the lid    they didn t leak  but out of the corner of my eye  when drawing the cup to my mouth for a sip  they look like the hole where the coffee comes out  thence a stream of coffee down my right cheek  mundane criticism for a mundane product    i d still buy it again  now that i watch the lid like a hawk while picking it up to drink         
855,4.0 ,                       after   cups of coffee they get thin and leaky around the base  fine for   cup  but not refills      
856,5.0 ,                       i could never make the cups lids come out even   i get these on subscribe and save for our church coffee bar and they are the perfect size cup  never get hot  and the lids are a great bonus      
857,5.0 ,                       great cups for on the go     
858,1.0 ,                       before buying these cups lids  i saw some reviews saying that the cups leaked  but i figured it must have been a fluke  and that it was probably a bad batch or a temporary issue  so i bought them anyway    big mistake  the cups leak  it s like the lids don t quite seal correctly  so coffee drips out onto your hands  car  or clothes  i emailed dixie and they sent me some coupons and asked me to send back some samples so they can check into it  but unless you don t need to walk around drive with these cups  i wouldn t recommend them      
859,5.0 ,                       just what i needed       
860,4.0 ,                       works well     
861,5.0 ,                       great value     
862,5.0 ,                       love these for hot beverages and buying  the larger amount     
863,4.0 ,                       other than that they are fine   convenient for grab and go  no washing or moldy cups   careful in the microwave  one scorched one time      
864,5.0 ,                       these coffee cups are the perfect size for single serve  the cups are strong and the lids perfectly and tight so the coffee don t spill  i bought   packs of these for a convention i organized and i think it s more practical and less messy than serving coffee on actual mugs cups      
865,5.0 ,                       good     
866,5.0 ,                       great for office use      
867,1.0 ,                       i actually hate it when someone posts a review and assigns stars to an experience  or some system or concept other than a review of the actual item  but here i am sticking my own opinionated foot in my mouth   so to speak the cost per unit shows to be   cents each  but in point of fact  it is actually    cents apiece  a piece is defined here as one cup and lid combo   if you apply the subscription price  and the one time first purchase credit of     it brings it down to      cents apiece  i have sent an email    minutes before posting this for you good folks  to the other good folks at amazon  i assume this will be corrected forthwith  but i am posting this in an attempt to at least save someone from being herded off the cliff as i almost was  on an intuitive whim  i decided to do the math real quick and discovered this error as soon as this gets corrected i will promptly come back and remove my review  as i have not yet had the opportunity of using said item  my one star review is just an attempt to grab as many folks attention as possible to alert you to this error  if you agree that this is an important bit of information  please mark this as helpful so it will find its way up the cue to be noticed by as many people as possible  bon appetit      
868,5.0 ,                       the cups are durable   have a nice feel to them  they look attractive in my coffee service setup      
869,5.0 ,                       love that these are assorted designs  there is never just one person using a disposable cup  and the different patterns help everyone keep their drinks straight      
870,5.0 ,                       great product no problems     
871,1.0 ,                       the coffee lids were made of very thin plastic and they were all cracked  so you use the cup without the lid  dixie needs to make a sturdy lid      
872,1.0 ,                       they are cute  but flimsy   good for cold drinks but not for hot  smh     
873,2.0 ,                       las tapas son bien fr giles  y el vaso no es muy fuerte   si el caf  est  muy caliente  te quema la mano  no lo recomiendo     
874,5.0 ,                       quality cups  easy to hold  caps fit well  however  i wish they retained beverage heat level longer      
875,5.0 ,                       nice looking cups and a fair price   wanted to try another coffee cup that was a good  but not as expensive as what i was purchasing   i was sort of disappointed with the sturdiness of the cups   a lot of give especially in the center of the cup when filled with hot or cold liquids   none of the cups have broken  but you do need to be careful when picking up the cup   the lids fit perfectly  but wish there was a cover for the opening where you drink   overall a rating of
