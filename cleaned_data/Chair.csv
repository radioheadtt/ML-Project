1,5.0,                       super comfortable     
2,5.0,                       similar to the normatec zero gravity chair  works great if you are using normatec leg recovery compression and the price is also reasonable      
3,5.0,                       excellent sturdy product yet great comfort and value overall  hopefully more to come from amazon  have brought   solid products that are amazon  x  so far and both very happy with  would recommend      
4,1.0,                       i bought three of these  and two of them fell apart within a month  they are bad quality      
5,5.0,                       husband is      just had heart surgery and this is perfect for feet up and rest during the day   he s a little long so need a cushion under his ankle tendon   he loves the chair        
6,1.0,                       the chair broke when my daughter was on it  she landed upside down on her head  the safety feature failed so buyer beware      
7,3.0,                       cons  locking mechanism is uselessarm rest are low and therefore useless if you have a tall torsopros cheapcomfyi have mine resting against a big deck box  this keeps me from flipping over  it is comfy cheap and seems sturdy  but the recline is hard without something to rest the back against      
8,5.0,                       i would recommend  it is a comfortable chair for the money  it serves its purpose  i am   feet     lbs   i try and bring it in from the direct sun  i just feel like it will last longer   easy to fold and put away      
9,4.0,                       comfortable enough to snooze in and hey your feet up  i keep this handy for track days  not a fan of the plastic knobs to lock down the chair from tilting too far but they work okay      
10,1.0,                       this product is not safe  do not buy it  when i reclined in the chair the top went all the way to the ground and the foot went up in the air  when i was able to get free of the chair  my investigation revealed that it had not simply tipped over but the joint slipped  not securely fastened   and now the chair will not return to the position of a chair as pictured  i bought this one because of the rating for      in the event that my      dad might use it but it couldn t even handle me      
11,5.0,                       we ve had these for a few years now  and we re very happy with them   they re a little heavy  but sturdy and super comfortable   i definitely wish we would have bought the cup holders when we ordered them   that will be my next purchase      
12,5.0,                       love these chairs  my husband wanted a set for father s day so after researching them on amazon  including looking at reviews  i decided on these  haven t had problems with stitching  the material doesn t stretch or sag  overall so far they re great  would definitely buy again      
13,5.0,                       buy this chair  the other chairs are exactly the same thing only         
14,4.0,                       great product for the money      
15,5.0,                       love them

18,5.0,                       very nice     
19,5.0,                       although it don t seem truly zero gravity i like it and it s well made so it feels like it will last awhile      
20,5.0,                       this chair is amazing      
21,5.0,                       i love these     
22,5.0,                       i m roughly     lbs and i ve been non stop torturing this chair with a lot more than just my body weight  most of these fold up styled lawn chairs would ve broken by now  and this one just has some minor scratches on the parts that touch the ground   so can give this a very strong recommendation one thing to keep in mind  tough i m very rough on it  is that it has some elastic which means it shouldn t be left in direct sunlight  if you don t understand why this is a problem  i d recommend first looking up elastic care  it s cheap and easy to replace the elastic  but also unnecessary if one cares for it correctly      
23,4.0,                       its a little narrower than other brands but its comfortable  it is a littlw weird folding it since it has an extra joint      
24,5.0,                       quality material and construction   good price   very comfortable  what else can you ask for   love them     we take them camping  great comfort after a hard day   cliff williams     
25,5.0,                       work as advertised  priced right      
26,4.0,                       love it  just before warned that if you get black it s a little warm if you sit down in it quickly     
27,3.0,                       the only problem i have with this chair is the locking feature  i have another one that has an easy lock lever  this one has a wheel that you turn and it is kinda cumbersome  other than that  it folds nicely and is very sturdy      
28,5.0,                       i like     
29,5.0,                       these chairs are awesome and were cheaper than several that i had looked at prior to buying them  i think that they are comparable  if not betrer than those that cost      more  i would definitely buy again      
30,4.0,                       overall these are totally worth the price  the only negative i have to say is that its locking feature isn t great  if you lock it and lean back it ll just fall back it really doesn t stay in slace      
31,5.0,                       i love this chair  noticed it on here and the price blew me away  many chairs like this are double the price in stores and probably no better than this one  this chair is comfortable and sturdy  love having it on my patio and am amazed at the value this chair is      
32,1.0,                       false advertising  the description on amazon says it can hold     lbs  the instruction sheet that comes with it states a max weight of    lbs      
33,5.0,                       good chair and comfortable  no issues  perfect for husband with bad back      
34,5.0,                       great chair      
35,5.0,                       as discribed but it s huge  if you re looking for a regular size folding chair this is probably too big for you but if you want bigger this is great  durable     
36,5.0,                       this come in as one  no need to install and very comfortable to lay onto      
37,1.0,                       the lock mechanism does not lock tight  when folded the lock doesn t work at all  i could only get the chair in   positions  straight up or flat i wanted a chair that would lean back only a little with the feet raised   for me it was difficult to get out of bad part  i can t send it back  because i don t have a box it will fit into      
38,5.0,                       well built and comfy for bad backs  perfect combination      
39,5.0,                       this chair is very comfortable and i strongly recommend it      
40,5.0,                       this is s really nice chair  comfy and looks nice  only negative is i wish it was longer since my feet hang over in the recliner position      
41,5.0,                       he loved it   i thought he would keep it in his car for when he goes down to the beach   but he installed in the livingroom and says it helps his back more than anything else      
42,5.0,                       very  very comfortable      
43,1.0,                       cheap junk  don t buy     
44,5.0,                       bought three of them for family  they love them      
45,5.0,                       love this chair  great value     
46,5.0,                       love this chair for watching tv outside  have a bad back and typical loungers are too stationary  this one allows you to change position enough to help elevate pain      
47,5.0,                       this is an amazing chair  very comfortable and relaxing for outdoors  want to buy another so i can have two       
48,5.0,                       these chairs are awesome   i had a couple that the ex took  had to buy two more  we love them for playing video games and i have fallen asleep in them several times         
49,5.0,                       lounging on my deck     
50,5.0,                       we have taken this chair on several camping trips now   my husband has  a very bad back and he says it is very comfy  in fact  he has spent a lot of time napping in it   one of the nuts has needed retightening a few times  but we always have a leatherman with us which comes in handy for that      
51,2.0,                       my chair is  in one word  dreadful  i am returning it  given the reviews  it seems that every chair is different  there must be an issue with quality assurance and control  i hope amazon basics will update with a version ii i am a mellow person  i rarely get angry  this product annoyed me so much i was tempted to throw it out the window  i would not even donate this  i have purchased     beach chairs that are more comfortable about me  i am           pounds  overweight   in my early    s  i maintain good posture  practice yoga  but have had some minor neck problems due to hyper mobility  i love hammocks  my living space       sq ft   i bought this for   reasons     using it in zero gravity mode for relaxing and meditating     napping      watching tv and reading at a slight incline  and    lounging outside when it is warmer  easy to fold when not in use  etc  i really really wanted the timber line xl padded zero gravity chair  but i am on a budget review of the chair  it arrived undamaged  note  if you want it in an amazon box to surprise someone  select that option at checkout  opened the box  the chair comes assembled  it folds nicely  and it was easy to carry upstairs  there are no directions  no paperwork  it isn t difficult to figure out  it opened smoothly  on each side there is a little dial to unscrew to recline to desired level  then screw the other way to lock in position  all good so far then i sat in it  my head rests against the very uncomfortable metal bar  there is a small headrest lumbar pillow  in the lumbar area the mesh hangs down and does not  hug  your back like a hammock  i tried moving up and down  there was no comfortable position  i wanted to ease back into the nasa zero gravity position  no luck  i got back far enough  about     degrees  no change in the lumbar area  i put a mackenzie roll behind me to fill the gap to no avail  my head  using the  headrest   sank into the upper metal bar  i immediately got a headache  so i got out  even my lower back was bothering me  in    minutes i went from feeling fine to a terrible headache in my opinion  my chair must be defective  given so many other reviews where people are tumbling backwards  not reclining  having the chair collapse  etc  i am happy for the people who got a quality controlled recliner for the rest of us  this is a very evil chair that causes pain  i recommend staying away from it      
52,1.0,                       after only the second time using it  i was laying back in it and the thing gave way and i fell back and hit my neck and head on the cement  the reason i bought the chair was because i have two bulged discs in my neck   ridiculous   hopefully my neck is now not worse off   now the chair will not even work anymore      
53,4.0,                       very comfortable chair at a great price  it adjusts easily and stays in place  the only thing i wish that it had was a drink tray      
54,2.0,                       was very happy with this item until tonight it was pretty comfortable  seemed sturdy  have had it   days shy of a year tonight i was sitting in it  i heard a creak and then bolts and washers went flying and i ended up on the ground  very quickly it did last a year  almost  but  while i was not hurt  i very easily could have been  by the way i am       and about     lbs      
55,5.0,                       very comfortable and well built      
56,5.0,                       purchased for me after major surgery  i need to keep my feet elevated and this chair works perfect for relaxing on the deck with the family  easy to get in and out of even on crutches      
57,1.0,                       very danerous product     
58,4.0,                       i bought several of these   they fold up very easily   my only complaint is that they aren t that great about locking in place and staying there   any movement in the chair and they ll push forward from the locked position   above average comfort      
59,5.0,                       these chairs are amazing  love them so much  these are long enough for myself and my guy who is       most of these chairs leave his feet dangling off and these don t  want to order some spares for camping soon      
60,5.0,                       i love this chair  i have lower back pain  but my back feels amazing when i m sitting in this  i ve currently got it set up in my office in front of a tv  much to my wife s dismay        
61,3.0,                       about this chair  i have serveral opinions  first  it was not easy to fold unfold  it requieres some effort to unfold it and even worse to fold it  second  it has a different angle lean back which is great but the problem is that it does not stay still   the angle moves alone your movement  third  the product does not really match the price      
62,5.0,                       no complaints here  i bought the same chair  years ago and paid      for it  now that s just messed up    so       dollars is great     
63,5.0,                       sturdy construction which makes it a bit heavy to move around much  yet  extremely comfortable  best of zero gravity chairs i ve purchased over the years      
64,1.0,                       do not buy this chair    must be very poorly made   broke after second camping trip   also would cost me        plus to return it  so not worth returning   i am very disappointed      
65,5.0,                       left it out on the lawn all summer and hasn t shown rust anywhere  do wish it leaned a bit further back and were a couple inches longer to accommodate my tall size but as it s just an economical clone of all the other antigravity chairs can t complain      
66,3.0,                       nice looking and comfortable     
67,5.0,                       such a great purchase we love this chair  it s comfortable   the adjustable headrest is great and easy to move so that different heighted people can be comfortable  the chair itself is comfy too         
68,5.0,                       very comfortable and substantial     
69,5.0,                       very comphy  good quality  easy to fold and store     
70,5.0,                       great zero gravity chair   super easy to use  stays in place  durable   a great find      
71,5.0,                       the pillow isn t that comfortable but the chair is great      
72,3.0,                       a little too bulky  not real comfortable for me  amazon returned no problem  but charged me return shipping      
73,4.0,                       great product for the price   would purchase again

75,5.0,                       these chairs are sooo comfortable  highly recommend     
76,5.0,                       i purchased this for my son   apparently  his cat loves this chair   my son also appreciates this chair as its cost was approximately    of a wood with leather trim furniture version   i would recommend getting this before buy an expensive version so you get an idea of whether this will work for you      
77,4.0,                       i was hoping that i had finally found a lawn chair that would work for me  this chair was great until i tried to lock it into position and that is where the problem was  would not lock  don t know if it just a design flaw or my chair but it would not lock and that is a great problem  unfortunately i have to return it  great chair and very comfortable      
78,5.0,                       very comfortable  i m             lbs  it s easy to get in and out and to recline  just what i wanted for my back patio deck

81,5.0,                       so comfortable      
82,1.0,                       it lasted about a month before the metal collapsed in the back where the back rest support is  i am      and     lbs so maybe it isn t meant for a bigger guy but if that is the case they should have set a weight limit  i was able to fix it by welding a small metal bar in the spot it broke  but most people won t be able to do that      
83,4.0,                       this chair functions as prescribed   nothing fancy but it gets the job done      
84,5.0,                       great chair  i bought it for my husband to use in afghanistan  comes in handy on long nights and he is able to get some sleep when he can      
85,4.0,                       took this chair to the beach  first use it dumped me on my head   something broke on the chair but an email to customer service and received another chair no questions asked      
86,5.0,                       great chair     
87,5.0,                       great chair    i m so glad i got these chairs they are so comfortable and sturdy  the head rest is padded and there are turn dials on the side that you could turn to sit upright to all the way to a lying position  i purchased two in black and they have a variety of colors i will probably get more but first i want to make sure they don t rust like the other chairs i purchased before but so far i am really liking these chairs      
88,1.0,                       bought two  used one the most  about    times  while sitting back in it  the chair snaps and i went back head first  chair is now broken and it s only been    days since purchase  i ve asked amazon for an exchange    we shall see  update  i emailed amazon about it and have another chair being shipped now  customer service is   stars  we will see if this chair stacks up      
89,5.0,                       literally life changing  i have to many things wrong with my spine to bore the average reader  let s just says  year s of basically bed ridden  i can t sit in a regular chair for more than a a half hour and there s not much past tv or reading you can do flat on your back  with this chair i can sit up  yet sit far enough back to not aggregate the back for an hour  maybe more  i have one in the backyard   the first time i could enjoy the flowers and birds and sun in a long time  i have one inside by a lamp where i have started learning to draw  there portable  so when we go to the beach  my wife parks me in my zero gravity chair by the water while she hikes      
90,5.0,                       i like the ease of use  portably  comfort  price  look  and style  it shipped on time  it works well  i like it  can use both indoors and outside  perfect for every occasion      
91,4.0,                       it is ok but it slowly starts to move no matter how tight the locks are     
92,5.0,                       five stars   as described to a  t       
93,3.0,                       very cheaply made i ll be surprised if it lasts a year i had a better one once that was cheaper in price   keep looking     
94,3.0,                       it won t lock into place so i ll be partially reclined and it will suddenly lay back all the way   feels like i m about to fall over backwards   otherwise it s very comfortable and good quality      
95,5.0,                       amazing value  built well and very comfortable  the only thing is it s heavy  if you re lugging it around  it s cumbersome  not a bad thing but good to know  i bought it for the beach but decided not to bring it because of its weight  but still amazing value and is it for the balcony      
96,3.0,                       awesome chair  but my headrest broke the very first time using it  had it not been for that  i would out five stars  i just used the chair for the first time and while leaving the beach the strap for the headrest snapped  i would expect this from a cheap chair but not for a     dollar chair      
97,5.0,                       i am    lbs its comfortable better than a foam mattress on my back      
98,2.0,                       doesn t recline all the way     
99,5.0,                       it is set up for you right out of the box  so you can easily take it out of the box and enjoy  it is very comfortable and i like how easy it was use right out of the box  it s a great price for the quality of chair you receive  i would definitely recommend this product      
100,5.0,                       chair works great is is very comfortable      
101,5.0,                       you can fall asleep sitting on it  it just needs a cup holder      
102,1.0,                       like other reviews  i had this chair   months and as i was in the chair  something broke and i fell backwards   shocking that this product is no longer available given the multiple safety complaints         
103,5.0,                       so user friendly and relaxing to sit in     
104,3.0,                    la silla es genial  el tacto del textil es el t pico de piscina  la peor parte para mi es la pintura  que se oxida rapido y se pela  el sistema de frenado de la inclinaci n apenas  funciona          
105,1.0,                       this chair is not suitable for anyone over     lbs   broke within   days of receiving  it is also a lot smaller than the description leads one to believe   this chair is also not very comfortable     on the positive side  i like the color      
106,5.0,                       very comfortable chair

111,5.0,                       comfy chair  i have it in the shade  not sure how well it would do on a pool deck or the beach because it s black  but it s very supportive for a   ft   and     lb   man      
112,4.0,                       the lock feature left side lock spin handle is broken

120,4.0,                       no support for your feet unless your short  i m    and it s killing my ankles because they have to dangle a lot over the edge  some sort of flip downsupport for your feet would be worth paying extra for  i ll have to build something myself  as always       
121,5.0,                       more than comfortable       
122,5.0,                       love it      
123,5.0,                       this is very heavy duty   well made and reclines easily and smoothly  definitely recommend      
124,5.0,                       i bought   of these chair and they are great   super nice for sitting in the yard  they fold flat so their easy to store and transport if you wanted to take them to the beach  highly recommend

126,5.0,                       great chair  for zero gravity chairs  you get a great bang for your buck  my boyfriend and i both got them and are very satisfied      
127,4.0,                       love this chair  but doesnt lock really well in the recline position  that would be my only complaint  but other than that  really comfortable      
128,4.0,                       the product was nicely made but a bit awkward to sit in because of the multiply positions  but once in it very comforatble     
129,5.0,                       loved it so much i bought another      
130,5.0,                       recommend the chair      
131,4.0,                       very nice chair   i was worried it would be cheap or uncomfortable since it is much cheaper than the others that look basically the same  was pleasantly surprised how nice it is  the head pillow is eh    hard and really can t find a proper spot to make it more comfortable  but it really isn t all that needed anyways so  all in all  well worth it     
132,1.0,                       item i received didn t match the advertisment  advertised    lb capacity but instructions said    lb     lb difference  after waiting for aalmost a month for this chair      
133,1.0,                       very poor construction and durability  the right side arm completely fell apart after   weeks of use  thankfully i was able to get a refund and am purchasing a more expensive zero gravity chair from amazon that has better construction      
134,4.0,                       just what i was looking for to take place of a cot to evacuate during hurricane season   it is much easier toget out of than a cot and lighter weight      
135,1.0,                       i was too busy to use this the first month i had it  so opened it too late for refund  but that was a big mistake  because it is badly engineered and broke right away  since i only weigh     lbs and have used such chairs a lot  i know my weight and use was normal  so the collapse of this chair means it is badly designed  caveat emptor      
136,5.0,                       wow i love this chair     
137,5.0,                       hope it lasts  i m     and seems to flex a bit  but very comfy  good on our backs       
138,5.0,                       i m very please with this product  the quality is great as well as the comfort      
139,5.0,                       wonderful   i bought it to replace one that cost three times as much   this one is just as sturdy and comfortable   very happy      
140,2.0,                       was great to start after using it for   weeks not daily  handle is messed up  disappointed  tried to twist it back on but it s not working        
141,5.0,                       very comfortable camp chair  a little big if you are low on room  but worth it if you are not     
142,1.0,                       the locking knob is made of plastic and does not hold positions     
143,1.0,                       this chair went the whole way back and i did a back roll out if the chair     
144,2.0,                       not as comfortable as other similar chairs   i hate that when i fold it up and lean it against the wall it wants to fall   takes up too much space to get it to lean   it also likes to pinch      
145,4.0,                       reasonably comfortable  a little short for my   ft  tall body would not want to spend all afternoon in the thing  but feels fine for an hour or so  worth the money      
146,5.0,                       this thing is so comfortable   i have a little trouble with my back and about ten minutes in this thing and my back ache is gone   it s lighr weight and easy to fold   when i have to come inside for the winter  i may keep one in my bedroom for relaxing   for  chilling  in the back yard  reading  or sneaking a little nap   wonderful     
147,5.0,                       so very comfortable    my grandkids sleep on it   lol     
148,4.0,                       a little difficult to use as a chair rather than a lounger at first but figured it out a day later  otherwise a sturdy and quality built      
149,4.0,                       easy to fold  really sturdy  goes   to   mph in   seconds with wheels and a    cc motor      
150,4.0,                       love it  a little pricey but it is definitely more durable than cheaper lounge chairs and it s super comfortable     
151,4.0,                       very comfortable  and the quality is good  but the locking mechanism on these is not as good as some other models  i find that it slips when i lean back unless i really make an effort to lock it down tight   more so than is required on other types i ve used   other than that  this thing is great      
152,1.0,                       this chair has a knob to turn to keep it in place when you are reclined at the position you want   however it is very hard to turn to get it locked down enough to keep the chair in position   so you end up sitting straight up  or try to recline and the chair will keep decking until you are flat on your back   if your looking for a chair like this  be sure it has a lever and not a knob     
153,5.0,                       got   of these for chilling on my balcony  very comfortable  nice quality  very simple look and obviously all black  great support even for me being      super inexpensive as well  have been very happy with all the amazonbasics products ive bought lately  highly recommend      
154,4.0,                       i bought this for my dad to use while he was visiting  and the review is based on the five times he used it  the only complaint he had was it s definitely a little on the heavy side if you re going to carry it far  in this case it was across the street to the beach  but nothing he couldn t handle   other that it s amazing to sit on  very comfortable      
155,5.0,                       comes made in the box  when you sit and let your breath out  it s fantastic  very comfy  one of the best purchases i made on amazon      
156,5.0,                       love these chairs  ive kept them out on a windy deck for years and they still look almost brand new     
157,5.0,                       wonderful chair  easy to get in and out  even for some elderly guests      
158,5.0,                       bought used and came looking great  these are very handsome on the balcony  kind of an odd feel to them when sitting down but i think it s supposed to be like that  the main plus is that they look really cool and it s safe to buy these used since there are no parts that can be missing or easily broken parts      
159,5.0,                       good deal but get the one with cup holders     
160,4.0,                       i bought this for my husband as an early father s day present and the chair looks great and he says it s very comfortable  he does say the locking feature doesn t hold very well in a half recline position though  the reason for a four star versus a five star is because there are some contradictory information regarding the chair s weight limit  the product description online says it will hold up to     lbs  but the paper that comes with the chair says     lbs  my husband is a little over     so it s probably not that big of a deal  but it s still confusing nonetheless      
161,5.0,                       i love this chair      
162,1.0,                       upon opening the box it smelled like urine  only to find that there was a rodent living in the chair  it was smeared with feces and had multiple holes chewed through the chair and the headrest  the bottom of the box was covered in droppings  i sent them back their poop filled box after customer service insisted that i had to send it back in order to get a refund or replacement      
163,4.0,                       i like the chair  i wish it was a little wider and the lock featured was a more secure  i laid back in the chair for a nap and  locked  it but the chair still ended up moving out of its position  i m wide hipped and have no problems fitting i m this chair comfortably but i wish this chair was wide so that when napping in it i could turn side to side easily      
164,4.0,                       would be better with lumbar support      
165,5.0,                       this product was exactly what i wanted  i have extremely bad nerve pain at my tailbone and can not sit up or reclined for more than a few minutes  i usually stand while at work or lay down at home  i wanted to relax in my back yard and needed something that took the pressure off of my tail bone  a normal beach chair won t work for me  this char is perfect  it is easy to maneuver into the fully reclined position and took the pressure off of my lower back  the only modification i had to do was add some padding to where my ankles   lower calves rest on the foot rest area  i m      and    lbs so my legs hang over more than probably what the chair was designed for  other than this everything else is great       
166,5.0,                       quality item  quick ship  reasonably priced  liked that the weight of this chair is under    lbs      
167,4.0,                       i carry the chair around for camping  car shows etc      
168,5.0,                       love the comfort and easy use  very easy to store as well  bought    may buy more for a whole set      
169,5.0,                       i got a pair and i just love them  comfortable and easy to use   they don t take up any more space then a regular folding chair      
170,5.0,                       very comfortable     
171,5.0,                       love this chair   it s not the cheap mesh that so many others use   it has sturdy construction and my      husband is comfortable in it      
172,5.0,                       it was a gift for my son and he really likes it

179,5.0,                       terrific chair    love it      
180,1.0,                       this chair was faulty and threw me on the ground  busting my knee open and forcing me to crawl out of it  it is now in a stuck  upside down  position  i am    lb  be careful  this could seriously hurt you  i was very close to hitting my head on cement      
181,5.0,                       excellent chairs  so incredibly comfortable      
182,5.0,                       very comfortable  heavy  would buy again

186,5.0,                       love them but would not leave them out in the weather for long  i bought covers for mine for when not in use     
187,2.0,                       loved it at first  it broke on my  rd time using it  went backwards and i had to roll off practically on my head     
188,5.0,                       this chair is just what i needed for relaxing on my patio  its easy to set up  its sturdy  and quite comfortable  and i ve lost ten pounds since i started using it      
189,5.0,                       i grew up sitting in all kinds of folding chairs when camping   this thing is like a little piece of heaven when away from home   i have even considered getting rid of my recliner and putting this in the living room      
190,3.0,                       the screw came out of the arm piece and the arm is now loose  the plastic pieces do not hold up well        
191,5.0,                       very nice for the price     
192,4.0,                       i got this as a gift for my wife  she absolutely loves it  sits in it all the time  her only complaint is lack of a cup holder  otherwise it s her favorite outdoor chair      
193,5.0,                       i love this chair  in sll the outdoor chaors i felt safe in it  i waigh     and nver felt this safe alln ther chair would be wobbly or just g ve out      
194,2.0,                       regardless what weight it is rated for  it s likely to tip over backward for those who weigh more than     lbs   i d not recommend it for anyone over     lbs      
195,5.0,                       best price out there for this style chair  we got black because they match with everything  they re wonderful  easy to use and easy to clean      
196,5.0,                       very nice looking an comfortable it reclines nicely      
197,5.0,                       very comfortable  sturdy  and lightweight   easily the best foldable chair i ve owned      
198,5.0,                       nicer chair than i was expecting  i m glad i bought it      
199,5.0,                       i bought this for my mom  she has dementia and when i m working outside she wants to be near me  it s comfortable and easy to move around  the price is better than you can buy in the store

203,5.0,                       awesome chair  i read all the reviews and felt confident that this would be a good value for the price  it impressed me  very comfortable  folds small  easy to operate  all around awesome chair   my only tiny concern is how you the twist locks that keep the chair locked in a certain position  eg  upright  horizontal  quickly get loose and you can  inadvertently or intentionally  swing yourself into a different position  but it s a tiny concern   it moves slowly  so the frustration is more with re tightening all the time rather than any real fear of flipping horizontal  the positives of this chair  and the incredible price  make thins well worth it  i bought a second one      
204,5.0,                       quality chair     
205,5.0,                       this chair is just what the dr ordered  so comfortable and eases my lower back pain      
206,5.0,                       everything i was expecting  very comfortable  would buy another     
207,4.0,                       seems to be well made and easy to put together   time will tell how well it holds up to the elements   wish it was a bit larger for the larger folk      
208,5.0,                       we have purchased others more expensive and this is just as nice      
209,5.0,                       so durable   relaxing good choice of a brand chair     
210,5.0,                       this isn t a sun bathing chair  but it s so comfortable  it s great to sit out on the back porch and read      
211,2.0,                       the chair works fine but it is noticably narrower than most zero gravity chairs in the market  not worth the money     
212,3.0,                       i was hoping it would have been softer  for an older person it is a little hard to get set down in      
213,5.0,                       my girlfriend loves it  but we did have a little hard time getting it to stay open  a lot of play around  we will see as times go      
214,1.0,                       had to return    did not tilt back easily  sticks     
215,4.0,                       sturdy but seat is only    inches wide     
216,5.0,                       great chair and very relaxing helped me out greatly with a broken ankle to recover from      
217,2.0,                       does not recline far enough back   i was looking for something that approached horizontal so as to provide relief for back pain      
218,4.0,                       it works  holds my    lb body  stores flat  and is comfortable  the locks are not that effective so i can t move around much when reclined  i suppose i would have pain a little more to get the thing to lock in place  maybe tall heavy people aren t meant to sit in foldin chairs      
219,4.0,                       nice chair  would buy again     
220,5.0,                       love this product  very comfortable easy to sleep in      
221,5.0,                       i love  love  love this comfortable  easy to recline chair   i wish i could buy    of them but i think they  went up in price  easy to recline with knees in bent position      
222,5.0,                       arrived on time  lightweight  comfortable  easy to open and close  looking forward to doing our next horse camping adventure      
223,5.0,                       it is well built and comfortable  i wish this chair would go all the way  in flat position  other than this  it is a great lounge chair      
224,2.0,                       sturdy but clunky  heavy  and uncomfortable   it s useless for anything other than lounging in the yard      
225,5.0,                       very nice   i weigh     pounds  this chair is professional grade  excellent deal  works smoothly  wish i had this a long time ago      
226,1.0,                       just got it minutes ago  i m afraid to sit in it      
227,5.0,                       this is an amazingly comfortable chair  it allowed me to attend events that were previously not possible due to pain when sitting for more than a few moments  i could be up for hours at a time with no increase in pain  i purchased this for poolside parties at my daughters house  my son in law  who is more than a foot taller than me and twice my weight also loved it  it is a smash hit      
228,3.0,                       once you re in the chair feels great no matter what position you have it in  however  getting into the chair can be a bit of a challenge  especially for those of us who are older  the foot rest  as you can see from the picture  extends past the  feet  of the chair and does not sit flush with the ground  standing in front of the chair and sitting down in a normal fashion is actually quite a drop  straddling the foot rest is uncomfortable  but provides a shorter drop into the chair  i don t want to give mine up  but i wouldn t recommend it to anyone else who is past the nimble stage of their life      
229,5.0,                       this chair is amazing  it s the most comfortable reclining  lawn chairs i ve ever sat laid on  it s portable  and easy to fold unfold  the lock feature gives you the confidence and security that you want and need in a reclining chair  the headrest gives you the added cushion and comfort that you want in a reclining chair  the price is right for this chair  overall i highly suggest purchasing this chair      
230,5.0,                       loving this chair  so comfortable and moves positions so smoothly  the pillow is super comfy and can slide up or down to be used as a lumbar support as well  breathable material makes it tolerable in hot temps  the only thing missing is a cup holder but i can live  highly recommend

235,4.0,                       good product  wish there was padding at the bottom  bar is hard against my ankles   i use a pillow when i lay back   also  needs a better way of locking into different positions
