0,5.0,                       the phone came in perfect condition and first i was really hesitating on buying this phone and as soon as the package came i ripped it open in the phone looked amazing the battery life is at     but i don t mind there wasn t a single scratch on the front and back of the phone if you re looking to buy a refurbished iphone     gb model this is the perfect phone for you        
1,1.0,                       the imei number for the phone is blocked  meaning the phone is not unlocked and was either lost  stolen or unpaid bill   what a waste of time and energy waiting on this phone for nothing      
2,1.0,                       i had this phone for about a month before it just turned off and wouldn t turn on past the apple logo  i took it to the apple store and they told me that it had hardware issues  i hadn t dropped it or bumped it on anything  i had a heavy duty case and screen protector  this phone was sold to me in this condition and i ended up trading in the   for store credit and forking over more money for a new phone  i do not recommend buying a refurbished phone from this vendor      
3,1.0,                       do not waist your money  phone came with a scratch on the screen  phone will not load any pictures on facebook  i have to use a laptop if i want to go on facebook  my old iphone   with a smashed screen works better then this pos  thanks for a waste of time and money  going to send it back   even tried going on the internet facebook instead of the app and still nothing will load  iphone   works better then this  really aggravating      
4,5.0,                       the phone arrived in really good shape  no scratches or damage  battery life is a bit low but to be expected  bought it for my kids first phone and so far works well      
5,5.0,                       bought this iphone renewed because i only use it as phone  and a little browsing  directions when traveling   use my mini ipad more because my eye sight is not what it use to be  iphone is hard to read sometimes   anyway  this was a good fit and buy for the amount of use that i do   did not see spending hundreds  even thousands of dollars for a phone i only use occasionally   so far i have not had any issues with it due to being a used iphone      
6,5.0,                       my iphone   took a swim and i didn t want to             for a new phone   this phone works great  i just transferred my at t sim card and updated via icloud   the iphone   and above are  waterproof    it s the same size as the iphone        
7,5.0,                       so i was verrrryyyyy nervous to buy this as i saw all the bad reviews  i m happy to say the phones in pretty great shape and work well  we ve had for about a week and have had no issues      
8,5.0,                       i buy all refurb i phones they all have held up for   years or more  they usually fail for getting wet or outdated  this company always places a glass screen saver on their refurbs which is a nice touch  i am replacing last iphone i got from them now because i need a larger memory with all i keep adding  my daughter just bought a phone from https   www amazon com sp  encoding utf  asin  isamazonfulfilled   iscba  marketplaceid atvpdkikx der orderid                     seller a  vhtd  s g c tab  vasstoreid   very pleased with amazon and vendor sell renewed iphones well worth it     
9,5.0,                    el sistema operativo bien el porcentaje de la bateria     porq esta bien para el costo del equipo poco desgaste        
10,1.0,                       not happy  brought this for my daughter    birthday and been having problems since then smh now i have to send it back   not happy at all   please be careful ordering     
11,5.0,                       i got the phone on time and was happy to find that the phone was almost brand new  i was skeptical because i had previously purchased a refurbished iphone   from buyspry which turned out to be the model of the phone meant to be used in japan  making it unable to mute the camera shutter noise  by the time i realized that was the issue  the return window had closed  anyway  it seems like one of the best deals for an iphone        
12,1.0,                       as soon as i took this phone out of the box the home button did not work   i tried everything to get it to but eventually gave up and returned it   i was very disappointed      
13,5.0,                       great service  fast response from seller  phone is great quality looks new no issues at all      
14,1.0,                       the phone was working fine   one day was just showing no service for no reason   contacted my carrier   changed the sim card   rest network settings basically nothing worked  i scheduled an appointment with apple   they said it was a hardware problem   there is this program for iphone   with no service problem  they would fix the phone for free   but after they ran a diagnostic in my phone   they said my phone does not qualify for a free repair because it s a refurbished phone   very disappointed i paid      for this phone now it s useless      
15,4.0,                       this phone works great  as a matter of fact i m writing this review on that phone  buttons work great as well as siri and screen recording and camera much more i m so glad i made this purchase  the only thing i was disappointed about is this phone dose not come original box nor with a sim card  not as disappointed as i was now because i have straight talk and the sim cards for this phone i m straight talk is only       at walmart  this phone is definitely worth my hard earned money        
16,5.0,                       so  it is not new out of the box and not the current model however  it provides all the features  looks  and manic a iphone holds mine phone looked brand new without any blemishes  it arrived on time  the price was at the range i was looking to pay  battery life is holding the charge like a new phone  x     
17,5.0,                       i have used my phone for over   months now and really like it   especially compared to the newer ones and their high price      
18,2.0,                       i ordered a verizon phone and got an at t phone  the phone was in perfect condition except for one tiny scratch in the screen  it came with a charger and cord as well as the metal pic to get the sim card out  so all in all  it was a nice phone but i needed one for verizon so i had to send it back  they did approve my return so that s good news for anyone who may need to return theirs like i had to do      
19,5.0,                       i bought this for my daughter after he phone quit working that we purchased from at t and was still paying for   we had absolutely no problem connecting this phone to at t has worked great   we did not purchase the warranty because it cost the same as the phone  so why buy a warranty i may not use and can just buy another phone  the phone is still working with no problems after a year      
20,1.0,                       phone worked good when first arrived  about    days into use the battery health plummeted and after    days  the phones microphone and speaker wouldnt work  my son could only use the phone to text  he couldnt hear anyone and they couldnt hear him  we are returning for a full refund  i believe it is luck of the draw  im sure some are just fine      
21,1.0,                       although claimed to be as good as new  shortly after the    day warrant  the phone s sim carder reader was not working  it cannot connect to service and as such unusable as a phone   basically i spent over      for a phone that lasted barely   months   i contacted the seller and they were not willing to help me   amazon offered product support  but i had already gone to the apple store and was told that it was a       repair   i am very dissapointed     
22,2.0,                       product worked great for three weeks and then would completely shut down multiple times a day  we could not get it to turn back on unless we held the power button and volume down button together  ended up sending it back  the phone did come in condition with an applecharger and sim card tool      
23,5.0,                       i ll give this a   star because so far  so good  and loving it    i had previously put  fair  in a feedback to the seller  simply because i hadn t had time to check it out or look at it for over a week after i had received it  i wasn t used to using an iphone  but was used to using my android   it seems there s however many advantages to having an iphone and having     gb is going to help me out a lot  as it seems i was always having to deal with space shortage on my  gb android  in terms of having to delete and reinstall apps in order to install other apps   and on my android  i was unable to figure out how to make full use of the sd card  so even though i had an sd card installed  i was always running out of space when there was maybe plenty of room left on the sd card   with the    gb  hopefully i won t have to even consider placing an sd card in the iphone   it appears that i received a good iphone sent to me     thank goodness    i ve only looked it over and checked it out as of last night and the person at my network service only looked at it briefly and told me it was a good one  and from all appearances in the short amount of time i ve checked it out  it appears to be a good one    hopefully i won t need to do any updates to the   star i ve given it   hopefully my experience with it remains positive   thank you for taking such care to make sure it was in good shape before sending it    i guess i was a bit worried after i had read different negative reviews  but i also read different positive reviews   i read the reviews after i had sent for the iphone   maybe it s good that i didn t see the negative reviews before sending for it because i might have hesitated and maybe i wouldn t have sent for it   but i m glad i sent for it  as it appears to be a good one    thank you      
24,1.0,                       phone came it looked perfect turned it on and put my sim card in and it would show verizon for a minute then go away so i went to the store and they said i had to go to apple    so i went to apple they said they are not sure what s wrong with the phone that it could be the battery but it might not be but it would cost me money   so i had to send the phone back i was pissed because this was a hassle to do all this   but i was refunded a few days later overall terrible       
25,5.0,                       this phone came in and really was like a refurbished phone  it was like new  no dents  dings or scratches and ran perfectly  it seemed like it came from the factory      
26,4.0,                       wonderful purchase thus far    my daughter loves her phone and so do we   we waited a long time to buy a quality phone   i m glad it paid off      
27,5.0,                       this used iphone   looks completely new  it is in perfect condition  came with a charger cord  and even had a screen protector on it  great product  don t doubt it      
28,2.0,                       the phone looks new and there s no scratches unlike other people comment but the thing is that when i charge the phone it s getting hot and the battery don t last  i just used it for like       mins and it s already half of the battery life and it s getting hotter and hotter when you used it  i returned it anyways coz i m afraid that the phone might explode while i used it or i charge it  i m soooo disappointed coz this is my first iphone and also this is the first time i ordered through online  lesson learned but its a great experience though  i hope this will help those people who s thinking of buying a refurbished phone  my advise is that always rethink coz not everyone is lucky to get a good phone like the other says in the comment      
29,2.0,                       overall phone looks new and works fine  the upsetting part is the battery was at the very minimum advertised     after   weeks the alarm goes off to replace the battery   i just spent     dollars to have a new one installed this was a gift and boy did i look cheap when i had to explain the refurbished purchase condition so pay attention to the small details        
30,1.0,                       very sad to have to return this phone  i really wanted it but it doesn t keep service  apple has an issue with these iphone  s from china and will usually fix them for free but because it s refurbished they won t fix it  had to return it  seeing if i can get a new one from the seller that works  if not i will be getting my money back  was so excited about this phone  now back to my old cracked screen iphone for now  super sad  don t buy the   refurbished it s a head ache lesson learned     
31,5.0,                       wonderful phone  like new  i would purchase another device if needed     
32,5.0,                       first of all  activating this phone has been a long arduous process but is not the fault of the seller i lost my cell phone  so i didn t have a sim card to transfer   i bought this phone along with the sim card from amazon   i then took the phone to my verizon provider  not an actual verizon store  with the sim card inside   i told them i needed the card activated   they told me the phone is not a verizon phone and they could  not activate it   when i got home i noted at the top that it said verizon and had full bars plus internet   after calling verizon they reiterated that it was not a verizon phone by the imei number   i proceeded to put in a complaint to the seller  who promptly called me   he told me that the sim card has to be activated and the phone will work and promised to make good on my purchase   he told me to call verizon again and ask to have the sim card activated and to call him back with my results   viola    a very helpful agent at verizon activated the card and the phone immediately was activated   so    if your verizon carrier says your phone won t work  they may be wrong   i am very happy with the phone and the service provided by the seller      
33,5.0,                       just got this  upgraded from an i phone  s   don t do much on this phone  mainly got newer phone for it s larger ios  than the    so far  very happy  a little bigger  but much thinner than the  s  also  extremely happy with seller   solved a simple problem very fast      
34,5.0,                       i was skeptical   returned the first try  which was for wrong network   they were cooperative    nd try   darn good phone      
35,5.0,                       the phone looks professionally packaged and the battery life according to ios    is        look at the description before you buy though   some how i thought it said cdma but it did not   working with tracfone att sim so far but would have preferred verizon      
36,1.0,                       everything is so bad about this phone i should just have believed in the reviews because i tried contacting the seller and up to date they never answered my my email  so you will wake up one morning and the phone is as hood as new but the next minute it s just like nothing  the screen is good the camera ain t bad either but now the mouth piece and ear peace are the problem coz at times you won t hear not even a single word the other caller is saying and the complain the same too  the touch some times will just freeze  you can t use the phone with a phone case coz if you do you will ruin all your communications     
37,1.0,                       this phone is horrible and the company is as well  they will not allow returns unless you walk through a thousand steps  phone only works a few times a day constantly saying no service  service works for everyone else in the household so we k ow it has nothing to do with our phone company  be careful when buying through this company they will not help or assist in any way  you want to lose your money buy a phone through these guys      
38,1.0,                       i took this phone to verizon and the apple store and neither one of them could activate this phone  it was listed as fully unlocked  the original carrier was at t  it was a waste of time and money  i traded in at the apple store  i needed a phone not a way to waste a day   i will never by another phone this way again  this is a reflection towards the third party supremedealscr com not amazon      
39,4.0,                       iphone works just fine and looks great and with      and a little time will have a very good phone  with a new battery      
40,1.0,                       sent me a verizon unlocked phone and when i called verizon to get activated i was told the phone was reported stolen and lost very disappointed      i want my money back      
41,5.0,                       phone is awesome  when you re on a call the volume is low could barely hear  so we switch to speaker  but over all the phone is great ot looks great no other problems i will be buying again in the very near future      
42,1.0,                       product not as described  was not unlocked   after calling customer service they stated if your not buying from a computer you won t get the full details  who uses a computer these days   so they sell half detailed products on amazon mobile sending out wrong products to customers   don t buy      
43,2.0,                       phone was in great shape   however  the battery kept draining very quickly   i do not run videos or surf the internet and deleted everything i could that showed it used much battery life   even though the health of the battery screen would show max capacity of      after one or two short phone calls  the battery would drain quickly by almost     on the spot many times   i called the seller within my   month phone warranty period to explain i had a bad battery and had done all i could to make it work   they said the battery isn t covered under the phone warranty and that i should buy a new battery   after explaining it came with a battery that drains quickly the seller said they would give my a      courtesy refund    i found out that new batteries cost     installed   they said the max they would give me was     but to this day  i have not received anything   i scheduled and took it to an apple store and paid the     myself   beware  these phones from this seller can come with a bad battery and you are basically on your own to schedule a replacement and pay for it   i had already paid verizon to change my old iphone to this one so sending the whole phone back in for a replacement or refund would mean i would have had to reschedule verizon and pay them again to change phone information   easier for me to have apple put in a new battery   what an amazing amount of scheduling and time wasted      
44,5.0,                       i was a bit skeptical after reading reviews that other consumers had trouble activating with sprint  when looking at the options i made sure to choose the cdma option  i was able to activate with sprint within a few minutes  working well so far  will update within a few months  the business i purchased from also provided a  yr warranty which is amazing      
45,1.0,                       i waited    days for the item to arrive  then it was a recalled phone and i was unable to activate it  seller pretty much said oh well send it back and you ll get a refund  i got an email that my refund is processed but the actual funds are not back yet  i ended up ordering elsewhere and i received my phone much quicker and it costed the same amount of money and it s a brand new phone  i would avoid buying from them if possible  the price seemed right but the item was worthless      
46,5.0,                       i ordered a rose gold iphone      gb refurbished  it works perfectly and came exactly as expected  the phone also comes with a very short charger      
47,3.0,                       only needed this phone to use a specific app that neither my basic android nor my galaxy could handle for some reason  the price made it worth it for the brief amount of time i needed said app     days   otherwise i would have spent   or   times as much on a decent newer model samsung  but beyond that and the storage space  iphones are horrible devices  nothing against apple  love my macbook pro   the love for them is indefensible  and only npcs would even try      
48,5.0,                       it s not been over three months like some of the other reviews said it does at  but it has been about three weeks and it s been absolutely perfect  i was scriptural seeing the reviews but i have no complaints at all no scratches or scuffs  camera is lovely  i even got it in service  perfect      
49,5.0,                       phone is in excellent condition  was able to activate on my carrier without issue  battery health is at     of maximum capacity which is excellent for a used phone   will definitely look to purchase again if i ever need another phone      
50,1.0,                       i recently bought this phone and when i recieved it the battery was significantly degraded  it dies fast  you would think after spending this kind of money on a used   renewed   phone you would at least get a good battery  definately not worth the price or hassle      
51,1.0,                       won t charge turn on i ve tried   different plugs and cables that clearly work with other phones i ve tried forcing a reboot holding down the right and bottom left buttons i ve tried looking in the charging port  no obvious issue  and blowing air in the phone just in case nothing worksneed to return this and can not recommend     
52,1.0,                       this item is not what i expected  i really expected a better item cos the phone was written as  new  but few days after receiving the item the screen started acting up  the screen isn t showing well it looks like the phone was broken and then fixed again using a different screen which is not the original screen of the phone  i need my money back but how will it be possible because our country is in lockdown and there are no international shipment allowed i can t even return this bloody broken phone  i am not happy at all by amazon  i am from south africa and i thought amazon is the best well it just proved me wrong      
53,5.0,                       my   year old lost his iphone and i gave up trying to locate it   looked into various ways to replace it and settled on purchasing an unlocked one online  a walmart clerk recommended going online    i was a bit hesitant to do so  but i did   the phone arrived complete with a cord and adapter along with instructions on what to do to activate the phone   proceeded to the at t store to get a new sim card again absolutely no issues   phone works great  battery life is fine  no issues with either screen or speaker  thus far    i chose the   due to apple s tendency to not push software to older phone models   this vendor shipped in a timely manner  well packaged   would not hesitate to purchase again from them   i gave four stars for battery life as i am not  the one monitoring how it s retaining the charge no issues thus far      
54,1.0,                       this phone does not keeps an battery percentage    i ll just put it on the charge n i take it off for at least   minutes and it s back on    i ve contacted the seller and have not gotten a reply at all and i will not stop writing negative comments until i receive a refund and a reply back from the seller    so unprofessional     
55,1.0,                       i ve had problems with the phone from the start   no service  which would be remedied by turning the phone off on  but now that fix isn t working   calls are dropped and the phone restarts itself out of the blue   i emailed the seller for help but never received a response   i called once in the beginning but didn t have my order number handy to get the help i needed  but someone did answer   i can t really call back because of this phone issue  and even unable to make wifi calls    beware of the iphone   model a       these have known issues and you might end up with one that isn t fixed  which requires taking it to an apple store      
56,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          pretty skeptical to buy this since so many people have had bad luck  however  i have had great luck setting this up  i did run into one small problem trying to update so i canceled out and just hit all the options that allowed me to do it manually  after that  it was a breeze  i provided a video because the quality and everything is working really well  also  this was a phone for t mobile  i thought the packaging was basic for the phone and they crammed it into my mailbox  so i think they should package better  overall really happy tho   d     
57,5.0,                       just the thing for a prepaid verizon account   easy set up and the charging cable and usb adaptor are included in package     
58,2.0,                       this is just like a new phone  took my son about    minutes to transfer everything and get it set up update after having it a few months   the speakers don t work  along with several other glitches      
59,5.0,                       this phone was in great condition  there were minor scratches on the corners of the phone body  but they are pin sized  and nothing i am concerned about  it works perfectly on a verizon plan  i am very satisfied with this purchase  and i would buy again from buyspry  the only thing i would make sure of is that you select the right model of phone  with my first purchase  i accidentally got a gsm phone and spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to make it work with verizon  and eventually i realized it wouldn t  it was my mistake getting the wrong phone  i did not read the product description carefully  it was returned easily  the customer service was helpful      
60,5.0,                       i am so impressed   i was a little nervous because the bad reviews were really bad and i didn t want just throw away       buuttttt amazing  it was unlocked as advertised and i was easily able to set it up with metropcs  the phone looks brand new  it was fully charged and works great  my only complaint is that the home button because i have to press down a little harder then i did my old iphone but its not a big deal  i m very satisfied        
61,4.0,                       at first i was skeptical of purchasing this phone  but i ve been using it since august and i am fairly satisfied  it functions well and nothing seems to be out of place  the only thing i ve noticed that bugs me is that  since the phone is from japan i m guessing  the camera silencing is disabled permanently  so if i take a picture that s not live  it makes the loud shuttering noise  i looked it up and there s nothing i can do about it apparently  this is kinda annoying  but i can live with it      
62,5.0,                       perfect condition  arrived    days early  we switched from an android to an iphone on a prepaid verizon account  it is cdma compatible  the phone was up and running in    minutes  everything transferred wonderfully  bought this phone for my teenager who is a heavy phone user and has not found one problem  overall i am very impressed with this phone and would recommend  battery life is still good      
63,1.0,                       i liked the time frame in which i got the phone  although i didn t get to use it  what i didn t like was as soon as i turned it on it would not update   no matter what i did  so i called apple and ended up sending it to them to work on it and turns out that it was broken from the start  at first they said the screen was cracked and or damaged and i called and said no it wasn t it just had a dent it he back and a scratch on the back they in return had already marked down the original problem and it turns out that the phones board the inside of it was damaged to a point where it had to be replaced and i would have been charged a total of        dollars just to get it replaced  in which i said no thank you i ll be sending it back and i ll spend my money else where  which i did and went to apple and got the new iphone    for        not to bad      
64,5.0,                       my phone looked new in every way when it arrived   my battery may have been replaced  but i m guessing about that based on the item description here which makes batteries sound like they are typically worn   when i look at the capacity health in settings  it reads as        easily transferred my sim card and connected to sprint   so glad i spent      and not         very happy to get the model with    gb memory at this price point   will update review if i have issues      
65,1.0,                       gave it to my dad after checking it for about an month  worked good for about   months and then suddenly stopped working  when gave it to a repair men  found out that the parts inside  screen  are original  never gonna buy from this seller again      
66,1.0,                       this phone had a false front screen protector that was not part of the seven i phone  it came of when i put a rubber case around it     
67,1.0,                       i was cautious after reading the reviews but went ahead and ordered the phone based on the positive responses it was a mistake  fully unlocked was not the case for me  i took time and money in the verizon store   communicating with att to try and unlock it  and no response from multiple emails to support at the vendor  in this case it was breed  i will avoid them in the future for multiple reasons      
68,1.0,                       logic board went out and will not send or receive calls or texts  i ve been fighting with apple support for weeks and no results  evidently certain serial  s have this issue and it has to be sent to apple to be fixed      
69,2.0,                       i ordered an iphone   for my mom as a quick replacement for her older iphone that was no longer holding a charge  after emailing the seller about the shipping delays  the phone finally arrived  upon inspection of the phone the first thing i noticed was a long scratch on the back of the phone  not a big deal  it s refurbished  the sim card tray jutted out a bit and after looking online at images of iphone   s  i figured out this wasn t apart of the design  red flag but it didn t affect the performance of the iphone from what i could tell  the phone needed to be updated  once again no big deal  but for someone who wants a phone that s ready to use  the update time might be an issue now i will get to my   star rating  as i m setting up the phone for my mother  i noticed it was running really hot on the back upper part of the phone  opposite the camera  a software update and transferring data could cause this so i set the phone to the side to cool off a bit when i was done  two days later and the phone barely keeps a charge  this problem with the old phone was the reason i bought this iphone    needless to say i will be returning this product  it could just be a defective one out of the bunch      
70,3.0,                       my review is half bad and half good  it came in almost a week  which i was crazy waiting for it  i was so happy when it got here  i checked the battery capacity and it only charges to     which was so disappointing  it charges really fast  but loses a lot of percent quick  other than that everything was good  it came with a charger and charger block      
71,2.0,                       this phone worked at the beginning with at t  at t customer service told us that the phone contract had not been paid off   that s why it was locked to at t  i don t know if it legal to sell a phone that you haven t fully paid  but hey at least it worked on the at t network  after two years i asked about whether we can unlock it and learned that it was on a  block list  because it was reported stolen   now we gave it to a friend who tried to use it with at t but it won t work anymore the invoice that we got does not list the phone serial number so there is no proof that we purchased the phone  and no paper trail showing that the dealer sold a phone that is reported as stolen   so careful what you buy   i would recommend only fully unlocked phones      
72,4.0,                       so far now this mobile is working fine  the only problem is with camera shutter as you cannot lower it s sound because this particular mobile is having some problems but i am ok with that secondly if you are a moderate user like me then go for it as it s battery needs to be charged twice a day     
73,1.0,                    el celular me vino defectuoso  con problemas de activacion  pens  que ten an un mejor control de calidad  si conpran de buyspry tenga en cuenta que pueden tener este inconveniente  estoy esperando que la devoluci n no demore        
74,1.0,                       this is not certified refurbished but a used phone  the phone died yesterday after using it for a few weeks  the serial number when entered into apple shows the warranty expires in october not like a full year which a certified refurbished phone would be  do not buy from here as they have not owned up to any responsibility for the sale      
75,5.0,                       opened box  popped sim card in  and the phone registered to the t mobile network immediately  the phone looks new  no complaints  a      
76,1.0,                       maybe it was just me  but everything went wrong with this phone   i couldn t get on facebook  messenger  camera  literally none of the apps would open  all i could do is call people so that was unfortunate  i did return it and had to pay     to return it  which was annoying since the phone was soooooo bad      
77,5.0,                             would recommend  the phone looked completely brand new  no scratches of any kind  and the battery capacity was at    percent which is great  if you are in need of a phone  and don t have quite enough money to buy the newer model of the iphones such as the x and above  then this model provided by this seller is perfect for you in terms of affordability and quality      
78,3.0,                       for this iphone   there s some problem on it  first  there are several scratch on the shell of the phone  so it must be someone use for a long time  second  there have some problem with the battery  i can t use it as long time as other normal iphone   third  i can t shut the camera sound even i pressing the  volume down  button on the side  so i can t take picture of notes in some silence place like library  but when you think that it only spend you around     dollars  it still worth with this low price  so i m not that unsatisfied this iphone       
79,5.0,                       excellent seller  refurbished electronics at times may get a bad wrap  and sometimes not everything is perfect  but this seller made everything right immediately without hesitation or a a long process   our  new phone is perfect  working flawlessly   made the perfect gift  thank you hybrid it      
80,5.0,                       we have been using the phone for about a month now    zero issues   arrived in perfect shape   no scratches at all   unlocked and works great in germany   arrives in plain box with charger plug and usb charger   highly recommend refurb over new   great value      
81,5.0,                       the iphone   is a good buy no problems as of now       
82,4.0,                       it came in great shape  and i ve been using it for a month  nothing seems to be wrong  but the packaging could be a a little more professional  it didn t come with the original charger  nor the earbuds  it only came with a purple iphone charger cord with the company s logo   belkin   for the cheap price  i think its really good         
83,1.0,                       this phone has been giving me problems since it has arrived  the battery stays dead even after hours of charge if  even the charger that came with the phone no longer works  it s frustrating because i got it for my   year old autistic son who now doesn t  want  me return it so that i can get a better quality phone if it means he won t have one until then  the battery over heats and doesn t keep any type of charge  and the touch works when it wants to      
84,1.0,                       bought in december quit working in october     
85,5.0,                       i have had this phone for the past   months now and this phone is working just as well as if i had bought it brand new   it looks good  i didn t spend a whole fortune to buy it    in the store brand new  this phone was very pricy   i love the rose color on the phone  the finger print recognition works   i am happy with this phone      
86,4.0,                       received with     battery life   was hoping for morealthough the camera is better than my old apple    the selfie side camera is still low quality     
87,5.0,                       i gave my iphone   to my son when when i got an iphone   that was a bad call  my   went out after only a month and then my new one gave me nothing but issue after issue for the next    months  so i decided to buy a used   and i had never done that before  i read most all the reviews and the description from the seller first  the seller description is pretty clear on the state of the battery and i never let any of my iphones i have owned get below    percent battery health because i use my phone a lot and all day for work and they seem to start working weird below    percent battery health so with that in mind i purchased a battery in anticipation that the battery would be below    percent like in the description  they both arrived quickly and my phone came from seller  techmint  and was listed a verizon phone  so far after about   days everything is working perfect and i am almost done with the second draining of the battery completely before charging back up to condition a new battery and i will do it a total of three times  not sure it really helps but i have either gotten lucky or it does work because i have replaced about   batteries in six different phones for me and my family and they work pretty darn good  as for getting back into a   it is pretty nice not having the issues of the    i could not believe how bad my experience was with the iphone   and after having a   and a   back to back with almost zero issues it wasn t pleasant  i will do an update after i have had it for a while      
88,5.0,                       overall this seller delivered the product as described  it s functional   i m very pleased wish my purchase      
89,4.0,                       used iphone    these devices are so sophisticated someone could probably run a small country with one  if      is enough to keep me happy for the next   years why would i spend         the se      is probably also a good choice at       i did consider se      but still                
90,1.0,                       i had purchased a fully unlocked iphone   as a christmas gift for a friend   i added him to my metropcs account   he has had it for approximately three months now   the issues started early february      where he could no longer add apps  then the battery started losing charge and now he cannot use the phone at all because is shows on the screen locked sim   after contacting metropcs they said i need to contact apple which was a nightmare   i m not sure if others have had the same issue with this amazon approved vendor before  but i will not order from them again   if there are others who have had a similar experience to let mr  bezos know of their situation and urge him to eliminate the supplier      
91,1.0,                       have tried to contact  have tried to return  i have had tried to do everything and no one chooses to help to get this returned or fixed nothing    tired of calling and requesting labels etc very very very poor service and quality        
92,1.0,                       warning to anyone buying a used iphone   when i purchased the phone it worked perfectly  but as time went on the phone started acting up every now and then giving me  no service  after a lot of research i find out that the phone has a known defect that the seller never mentioned to me or had fixed  the phone has completely stopped working on me leaving me to attempt to get it repaired by an authorized apple retailer  the phone is ineligible for free repair because the repair was only offered for free for a certain amount of time  now i am unable to get a refund from the seller due to me buying the phone months ago i am pure out of luck  their goes      down the drain      
93,3.0,                       from day    seemed to have a problem with the phone microphone   it got worse and was returned for a full refund      
94,5.0,                       i will admit i was a bit worried about buying a  refurbished  phone from an online seller   but  decided to take the plunge   i have to say the phone arrived in better condition than i thought it would be   not a mark on it      it looked like new   the phone was wiped and all we had to do was swap over the sim card from the old phone and it worked like a charm       all we need to do is update to the latest version of ios     i would recommend this seller to anyone   great deal and prompt service   best way to save money on updating to a  newer  iphone          
95,1.0,                       does not work  motherboard is messed up after getting it tested     
96,1.0,                       i thought this phone was going to be a great deal  but this is the second refurbished phone that i ve purchased on amazon that died after the warranty period and at t and apple both say nothing can be done   this iphone will not charge   suddenly   at t has changed the charging port and the battery  but neither of the repairs have solved the problem   the phone is just dead   this is such a bummer      
97,2.0,                       horrible customer support   never replied to my numerous requests i received the phone and at first everything looked great  however  anytime i d call someone  they d say they can t hear me well at all  and it kept going on and on  i messaged the customer support numerous times to ask for a return and never heard back  i m very disappointed  i had to buy bluetooth headphones to be able to have a normal phone conversation  when you spend      on a phone  you expect it work perfectly      
98,1.0,                       charge port was loose and fingerprint reader was hit and miss  the charging cable would drop right out whenever you pick up the phone or move it while plugged in   it seems to me like they just take trade ins and put a new screen and housing  probably aftermarket  whatever issues the phone had when the person traded it in dont always get caught and fixed they gave me a hard time with the return too      
99,5.0,                       i saved myself a bunch of money buying this phone     and i couldn t even tell it s refurbished  i recommend this  i had a good experience and   months later it s still working wonderfully      
100,5.0,                       apple iphone  i purchased this it  however  it took a while to get to me due to the mailing personnel  but it has been working quite well it doesn t get hot like my previous iphone  i recommend this seller even though i only purchased one phone  this said at t unlock and i tried at t and it didn t even work         
101,2.0,                       overall  the phone seems in great condition  however a few things i realized afterward  the price is only around     lower than a brand new iphone  and it doesn t come with earbuds or a dongle  it didn t even come with an official apple charger  it was some offbrand charger  i somewhat blame myself for not doing more research on the matter  but in the end i was not satisfied with this purchase and would recommend trying to find a more inexpensive option or just buying the brand new iphone        
102,1.0,                       i bought this phone in july and by december it started having issues  now it doesn t read the sim card at all so the phone will not work  never buying renewal phone from amazon again  what i paid for the renewed phone i know can get a brand new one for a little less  so angry right now  very dissatisfied customer      
103,5.0,                       broke my old phone on a trip and this was a wonderful replacement      
104,1.0,                       i received my iphone today and it said that it s remotely managed by bluecross blueshied of tn  i looked deeper into this  these iphones are remotely managed by other companies  that means all data on your phone  all activity  is viewable by companies  they can sell your data or wipe your phone or hack you  anything even if you factory reset it  you cannot remove the remote management  it is engineered into the phone  avoid at all costs    this is a stolen iphone if they fix my issue i m willing to update this review  very upsetting      
105,5.0,                       great condition  no scratches  no wear and no tear  no nothing  i m writing this review on my iphone now  this is a must buy  the only negative thing i can say is that when you look at the battery under battery settings it says it s max charge is at      i posted a screenshot of what i m talking about to this review      
106,1.0,                       i bought this phone with my prime accounts it said free   day shipping when i ordered it  but it took    when i got the phone  turned it on and put my sim in it it wouldn t connect to the network  the verizon network symbol came up  but it kept switching between showing no bars to saying  no service  when i put the sim in any other iphone it connects immediately  i believe it s the antenna that is defective  i m completely unsatisfied and i m not    for the return packaging and label  i will never buy a phone from amazon again      
107,1.0,                       buyer beware   this refurbished phone stopped working with no fix   thankfully we were able to return it      
108,1.0,                       the external speakers don t work  i bought   of these in a row and the external speakers or mic won t work  i would answer the phone and people would say they couldn t hear me until i scream  every video i took had muffled or no sound      
109,5.0,                       i was very nervous about buying a renewed phone but i got it today and it was perfect  quality was great and it came right on time  works perfectlyvery happy with this purchase     
110,1.0,                       the iphone is not refurbish  from first day  call volume is very very low  must used headphone for each call the iphone screen is not recover  switching on  after a call      
111,5.0,                       this iphone    gold      gb was so great when i got it  first of all it came a day earlier  which was great and it came with its own screen protector and charger  all the buttons work  my sim card worked immediately and i started using it the very first day it arrived  the screen is great  all the sensors are great and the buttons and touch id work perfectly well  the only thing is the phone does not come with its own earphones  as mentioned above  apart from that everything else was perfect and i highly recommend edit  i have had this device for over half a year and it still works very well  no scratches  no battery issues and everything is still working very well  super great deal for this iphone      
112,3.0,                       bought two phones   one had problems with battery initially but somehow resolved   the other had battery problems working about     capacity  company was willing to give us a new one until they realized screen had an unrelated crack   advice is to deal with battery issues as soon as they occur otherwise your kid may drop the phone before it gets resolved our temporary fix is to use an external battery until we head to the apple store to get this issue resolve i would have been very impressed with the company if they took the phone back no questions asked      
113,1.0,                       looked like a brand new phone   but does not operate like one at all       a full batter charge dies within  hrs   this without using the phone  just keeping it on the table   phone stopped reading my sim card on day   of using the phone   phone heats up while on charge   i had apple support run some diagnosis on the phone   i was told some chinese script came back in the report  something is really fishy about this phone  i really doubt if the parts inside this phone is genuine apple products i know you get what you pay for  but its really not worth thinking that you might have your data compromised    i ve returned the product  hopefully i get my refund soon from hybrid it      
114,5.0,                    funcionalidad      el equipo no presenta fallas  opera correctamente en la red claro colombia         
115,5.0,                       i purchased this for my senior mom to replace her dying lg  this was exactly what she needed  she was able to make the android iphone switch after a few tutorials from her favorite daughter  great value      
116,1.0,                       i ordered   of these for my siblings first phone  i was unaware of a pretty big issue that the   s had with updates  apparently companies are capable of fixing the issue but most won t anymore because it s such an older device  so both of my siblings when trying to update were unsuccessful and now they cannot use their service or data on it  it requires the update to use the sim card but fails to update     
117,5.0,                       amazon always had my back   phone is wonderful     
118,5.0,                       seems to work pretty good  just as good as a new unit      
119,2.0,                       got this today i don t understand how my battery said     max but gives a service message    refurbished not bad but i ll b pissed if i need a replacement battery already  update   i do need a battery replacement   all apple stores r closed due to pandemic   breed seller apparently doesn t look at the battery b  sending out phones      
120,1.0,                       this was a mistake to purchase  in the description it stated that this phon was fully unlocked  when trying to establish service on the phone the service provider stated the phone is not completely unlocked and they were unsuccessful in getting service turn on  also  the battery life was horrible  at  am the phone would be at      by   am the phone was already at      refurbished yeah right  not good quality at all  i m very disappointed and this was a christmas gift     
121,1.0,                       me and my family pitched in for this phone for our mom s birthday  the main reason we chose the phone was because it said fully unlocked in the description when we made the purchase  however  once we received the phone and tried to set it up we found out it was not fully unlocked  and we thought we could switch her over to verizon because the phone showed verizon at the top of the screen  but when we called to set the phone up through verizon they told us that they would not be able to do so because it was not fully unlocked  this is the first phone i ve purchased off of amazon to do this and i ve purchased   phones off of amazon  i strongly don t suggest buying this phone     
122,5.0,                       great buy for the money so far   i have only been using if for a day  but so far the phone works great  looks brand new  i didn t inspect it incredibly close before i put it in a case  but the screen is in perfect shape  and the body seemed like it too  love the    gb  as compared to the   gb   i had before  i have always loved refurbished devices because of their value  and so far this one is proving its worth         
123,2.0,                       the one i received worked for every thing except phone calls  would not connect to the service  the  antenna was defective  returned      
124,5.0,                       so i received the phone within two days from which i had placed the order  so far  the phone s overall condition is excellent  the battery is efficient compared to my phone  which was the same make and model  the screen looks new  and i could not tell the difference  the only little notice is that the sim card tray has some paint leftover  revealing possible replacement  aside from that  this phone was the  deal       
125,1.0,                       my husband bought me a phone for my birthday and had it     weeks before he gave it to me  when i got it the screen was so sensitive when making a phone call that my hair made it beep and sound like it was dialing  i had to use the speaker setting in order to make calls the screen also had several dead spots on it  i tried using the phone for   weeks and couldn t make it work  when we contacted the seller they wanted to replace it  however  i had already bought a new phone and wanted a refund  even though their motto is something about customer service they refused to refund our money since it was over    days  i told them it was a gift that hadn t been opened for a couple of weeks and they didn t care  they absolutely refused to refund the money even though there were several emails back and forth i also had to spend     to send the malfunctioning one back and today i got another phone in the mail that i do not want      
126,2.0,                    en general el producto se ve bien y funciona bien  sin embargo en d as recientes me he encontrado problemas con el equipo  a veces el micr fono no funciona bien en las llamadas por qu  no se escucha nada en absoluto y eso estando al aire libre  a la par me he encontrado problemas con el bot n de inicio y ni funciona de manera correcta  a veces parece reaccionar y a veces no  en ocasiones cuando el equipo se calienta un poco deja de funcionar correctamente  y aleatoria mente  el producto se encuentra bien por fuera pero internamente son esos   inconvenientes que he tenido  a la par he intentado contactar al soporte que me vendi  el tel fono pero no obtuve respuesta ni soluci n por el cu l devuelvo el producto  me hubiera gustado al menos y poder hacer un cambio por otro pero prefiero la devoluci n

128,4.0,                       for a refurbished phone its held up pretty good  it s been about two years  anyway it s just now giving out  i don t blame the refurbishmer but i do blame apple for making phones that don t last      
129,1.0,                       i have had this phone for two months  when i first purchased this item it was working perfectly  it had been unlocked  i had activated the phone with my tmobile sim card and the device would make calls  text messages and all cellular service features however there was  other system data  of    gb worth that would not allow me to further update the device  about a month later  due to incapability of updating from the  other system data  i could no longer make any phone calls or messages with the device  i reached out to apple support to learn that the device did not have an update issue  it was not properly unlocked and had simply become locked back to the original verizon carrier  the device cannot activate again after resetting from apple  as i am not a verizon customer nor am i the original owner i can no longer use this phone  it is a brick  it is stuck telling me it cannot be activated  buyer beware this seller does not unlock their phones from the carrier and later after purchase it will become locked and bricked      
130,5.0,                       bought this iphone with a guarantee from icertified  the seller  that the product would work with my carrier  verizon  and that it was fully unlocked  i have experienced no issues since inserting the sim card  i understand some reviews state that the iphone was not fully unlocked for all carriers  but again  i experienced no issues  this iphone is a great price for the condition it is in  it came already factory reset and looking almost new  it did come with a lightning cord and usb to wall converter from apple  it even had approximately     battery when turned on  no issues with delivery either  overall  this iphone is a very good product  has a good price  and is in good condition      
131,1.0,                       does not make or receive calls or texts  sim card is in and activated   i had bought this as a gift and now i have to return it  the battery is crap  does not go over      and the camera was cracked  the sim card tray doesn t stay in either  amazon needs to remove these phones from sale      
132,3.0,                       first of all  everything has been totally fine except for the camera  so i can t complain too much  however  the rear facing camera didn t focus well and took pretty blurry pictures  i didn t want to go through the hassle of sending the phone in and setting a new one up so i just got it fixed at a local place for      the guy who fixed it for me today said probably the screen was cracked on the old one  and then dust and debris got into the phone and wreaked havoc on things including the camera  after he worked on it he was able to identify that the camera bit was replaced with a cheap model that doesn t work well  he replaced it with a better camera bit and now it works fine  of course  i don t know exactly what happened before i got the phone  but i would recommend using better products if this was in fact the case  although i am not returning the phone  i probably wouldn t buy another one from them  the   out of   stars for value for   was purely because of this and because i had to find someone to repair it and pay additional   for that      
133,1.0,                       apple technician at the apple store noted the inscriptions and coding on the back of the phone and told us it was not an iphone  and likely a chines replica  so although it looks and smells like one   and is advertised and sold as one  it is in fact not an iphone   which is fraud  on top of that  the battery capacity is already down to      which means it will have to be replaced soon  and the charging cord sent does not work   i knew there was some risk getting a renewed phone  but didn t expect that risk to be that the phone wasn t even originally made by apple      
134,1.0,                       buyer beware  this company charges a     restocking fee and it is definitely not something you would be aware of unless you happen to return it  in my case it was about      they need to have the info regarding their return policy much more visible for buyers      
135,5.0,                       love this cell phone  works perfect  no problems  love love love        
136,1.0,                       literally  after   minutes of me using the phone  i plug it in to charge and it s already burning hot  the first thing i checked was the battery health which was around      only after reading the one star reviews on this product  i realized how bad this product is and how it is a japan model that is either a fake replica or stolen garbage  do yourself a favor and actually purchase this product new from apple if you don t want any disappointments      
137,5.0,                       the phone arrived in pristine condition  you could not tell it was refurbished  but more importantly what i like about the seller was communication  the seller has a very high approval rating  i see most third party sellers    to    points lower in approval  if you read the reviews the majority of the negative reviews have to do communication  they were a few bumps along the road with a sale but the sellers communication was almost instantaneous every time i wrote a message  i have had my phone for a week now  it works great  good battery life  i am extremely happy     
138,5.0,                       so far so good  i like it a lot  it seems to perform very well  but the big test occurs when i pick a telephone carrier  that should occur soon and i have little doubt that i will be more than satisfied  yes  i now have a carrier and my phone is performing very well      
139,5.0,                       the phone i received was in very good condition  with no noticeable scratches on the display  the battery health on mine was      meaning that the battery doesn t last a full day  but that s to be expected with a phone that s a couple of years old      
140,4.0,                       i completely love the phone the iphone   works great  comes unlocked like they said i live in latin america and works excelent  its seems almost like new with no scratches or smashes for be an refurbished one  the battery comes with a     of battery health  maximun capacity  is excelent  the only bad thing and is the reason why i not give five stars to the product is that have a small gray dot in the camera that appears when i took a picture with the back camera is very very small but is a little uncomfortable  it is still an amazing product      
141,3.0,                       the silence button sometimes works and sometimes doesn t  the screen touch has some issues  it has some glitches like when i try to select a specific word in google search chrome  but it just won t select   try it many times  then i had to restart the chrome app and start over again     
142,1.0,                       i ordered a replacement apple iphone       gb  silver   fully unlocked  renewed   for my daughter  i took it down to at t to switch the sim card and install and new glass protector  well they put on the glass protector and then tried the sim card    it did not work   the associate told me there were sim card issues with that model  so i sent back the phone to kiss electronics   next  i get an email   saying this is not the pone we sent you this is the wrong serial   and    g phone   sorry cant help you   first of all  the email came off accusing me of trying to defraud this company   really for       i contacted kiss electronics  stating sorry i do not know what is going on   i was immediately refused a refund or exchange even though kriss electronics would not that there was quality control error be for shipping   poor business and customer service  take you money somewhere else      
143,3.0,                       we ordered   phones  and everthing would be great  but can t figure out how to mute the camera sound when using the snapchat app  arrived on time  looks good  but this glitch with the sound could be a deal breaker      
144,1.0,                         received i phone   but i was not able to activate it  although its written features of phone that its unlocked and it will work all gsm carrier all around of world i put   different gsm sim card but it didn t work  and i am asking to both amazon and platinum deals why do you deceive people  why do you waste my time      
145,1.0,                       before i even turned it on i tried to put it in a case and saw that the screen had popped out of the casing  the phone wouldn t turn on so i tried to charge it  the cable was loose in the charging port and the phone never powered on       
146,4.0,                       good phone came packaged very nicely   charged and performed as expected   love the new features of the   especially the translation and text of voicemails so cool   a few dings on the corners but they are covered by case anyway   love my phone and did not have to call tech support i set up up myself   love it      
147,4.0,                       everything was great  phone was nice  it functioned well but the battery life was terrible  once you hit     it drops to     within the next minute  for this i am returning the product  the battery health was at    which does  make it sellable by the company however i can t have a phone that dies so quickly especially when i m out an about or traveling      
148,5.0,                       i was in the market for a replacement iphone for my  s  in which the battery was on its last leg   not to mention i maxed out the   gbs of space on it because of the apps i use for work and pleasure   so  i decided to go with the iphone   with more space and did a little research on google   came across this seller  saw this iphone      gb unlocked and read the description and reviews   after seeing many positives and the overall rating being high  i decided to take a chance and order it       i was extremely impressed with the condition it was in when i received it   it was beyond mint condition   not even a scratch or blemish on the screen or the back   nothing   it was like it was brand new   i was absolutely delighted   i wish i had taken pics of it when i first got it   but  trust me  it was beyond mint condition out of the box      the battery was at     when i received it   i obviously expected this  as the seller clearly stated in their description of the phone   therefore  i don t know why some of the people in the reviews were complaining about this  when the seller clearly stated this in the description   although the battery life was so so after i started using it  i decided to go to an authorized apple repair facility near me that does   hour service and have the battery replaced for       now the battery is at      and my iphone   works as if it s brand new from apple   so  overall  with the cost of my phone purchase        and the cost of the battery replacement        i ended up spending      total   you can t beat the price for a used iphone      gb black   i couldn t be happier    i definitely plan on buying another phone from this seller in the future   i highly recommend them   i would give them   stars because of the battery  but i gave the   stars because they were upfront about it  not to mention my phone was in nearly brand new condition   thank you           
149,2.0,                       this phone has worked great for me for the few months i have had it   the return date was up in july and it is now august and the phone is giving me lots of trouble   it loses service cellular regularly and will not make calls   i can sometimes receive and send texts  sometimes not   i went through every trouble shooting possibility with my carrier and through apple support  i confirmed that all trouble shooting attempts had been made   so i ll be deciding what to do next but i will not be buying refurbished phones or through this seller again      
150,3.0,                       product only has     battery health and has issues charging but other than that it works  also had trouble creating an apple id but i got it to work      
151,1.0,                       i can t even use the phone because it won t read any sim cards    can t make calls or text anyone and can t use data  super irritated and probably will never do this again  i m returning my today      
152,2.0,                       an iphone battery that falls under     is best to be replaced through an authorized apple location  this device along with many others sold that are  refurbished  come with a battery that s less than      mine was at about      if it was my primary device i would be livid  i needed a phone when my iphone x stopped working and i would much rather have spent an extra      more for something newer  you can t use this phone for anything without it needing to stay on the charger  everything else works normally  as it states expect cosmetic damage  nothing that has impact on functionality though  ask for the battery capacity before you buy it  anything over     should last at least   months year before needing a battery replacement  anything under will be an immediate  issue      
153,1.0,                       this was not a fully unlocked phone   the product description is as follows  features   detailsfully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice  e g  at t  t mobile  sprint  verizon  us cellular  cricket  metro  etc    however  this phone is not fully unlocked as stated   it s is only compatible with at t   still pending my refund        
154,1.0,                       i was really sad and disappointed with my purchase  i honestly felt ripped off  they sent me an iphone with a broken microphone      
155,1.0,                       received a defective device as you see  n the pictures   the sim tray is broken the device has alot of scratches  when turning the device it starts to getting very hot and hangs as hell  requested paid return and full refund   they took too much time to refund me around    days   so my advice don t buy the device from this seller      
156,1.0,                       i received this item today and it s nothing more than concerning and frustrating  this item overheats to the point that it seems like it s going to catch on fire  it hurts to hold  not only that  but the phone itself is so fucky glitchy it hurts to use because its so slow and problematic  for the topping on the cake the fingerprint scanner worked for half a day and then stopped  i just got this phone today    this shouldn t be happening  you are selling broken phones  this is ridiculous  scammers      
157,1.0,                       do not buy this  renewed  phone   it has a known antenna issue   if it is working for you  beware that you might be one ios update away from owning a brick   my family got this for me for father s day and it bricked at ios       went into a constant  verifying update   when i did a hard reset  a message  can t connect to carrier came up    too many issues   took it to apple and they very kindly agreed to try to fix the known issue but warned me the phone may have after market parts that might preclude them from the repair    we will see in    days   either way   dont do it   or   spend some extra on extended warranty if it s available   this phone will fail      
158,1.0,                       i got this phone for my wife  she kept telling me the phone held a charge for     of the day  i had her charge the battery all day just to make sure it was fully charged  next day battery was out of juice by     which is about two hours of it just being on with no heavy use  i contacted the company  xs  no reply  so after getting g everything on my wife s started up i didn t know what to do  so i changed out battery   that worked  but last week my wife was trying to go somewhere unfamiliar and put in the address and her gps wasn t working  i youtubed this problem and checked out all the software possibilities nothing worked  i checked to see if i could return and i m past the date   these phones are not renewed      
159,1.0,                       the product appearance wasn t in new condition  there were scrapes on the sides  possibly from drops and it looked like who ever had it before may not have had a screen saver  no major scatches but lots of swirl marks on the screen  it wouldn t make phone calls so it wasn t fully unlocked and the fingerprint access didn t work right      
160,1.0,                       the phone i received in the mail was for my little brother  when we got it seemed to work fine but then the sim card stopped working in it so we updated the phone like it said and it stopped working again  i know the sim card works because i put it into my phone that i got on amazon through a different seller  so obviously that wasn t the problem  overall not happy with the product and i don t recommend this seller to anyone      
161,5.0,                       recieved the phone on the day it was scheduled  it was in a surprisingly good condition beside a scratch on the back  the phone is good except it cant connect to my network but i called apple and they said it is a common bug in the a     modelcand i qualify forbath good model  so all in all i got my money s worth because apple will be giving me a new phoneedit  the phone is in service the day after it arrived  i went to apple store and they scheduled an appointment for me  i waited    mins and they tested the see why why sim card didnt work and it was because they said the sim card that works for my galaxy s  doesnt work in a iphone  the person called sprint and idk what they did but i left with a new sim card and my iphone has connection with sprint  i thought the back of the iphone had a scratch but my eyes were deceived  everyone i showed the phone to says it looks brand new  i would buy this as a gift     
162,5.0,                       really happy with the quality  this is the  nd renewed iphone i ve bought from this seller  it s worth the money  the phone works great  a few small signs of wear  but slap a new screen protector on the phone and it feels brand new battery life at     upon arrival  still lasts me all day      
163,5.0,                       units were like new  no scratches  no dings  battery life is great  just make sure you buy from hybrid it i bought another set from a different seller and theirs had scratches and battery was junk      
164,5.0,                       my wife doesn t typically care about her phones so we usually buy used  her iphone   lasted a few years but this is by far her favorite so far      
165,5.0,                       this has been a great phone  it has a good sized screen  not to big but big enough for video and cames  camera take good pictures  battery life is strong  bluetooth range is larger than earlier models  this was a refurb that looks and behaves like new  i will buy this for the next wave of family phone upgrades      
166,1.0,                       i dislike the charger cuz different colors blue and black what a combination sorry too bad someone buy a phone from you  and that s the combination you giving them     
167,4.0,                       welp  when i first got the phone i was shocked that the box it came in was half opened but that could ve been the delivery person  also i m confused how it says the condition is  new  yet when i first examined the phone there were scuff marks and little scratches on the apple logo but other then that the phone works great  the battery may run down a little fast but as long as i m able to type this message and do my business on this phone then it s all good also i love that this phone already had a screen protector on it already thank you      
168,1.0,                       i bought this phone because  i have a cracked screen on my current phone  it worked for a few weeks  one day it kept saying searching for several weeks  i tried everything  so  i talked to my aunt about my phone situation and she told me that it was because my phone s antenna was broken or bent  i have been using my cracked phone since  i m not happy about this product  i ve bought phones from amazon before but this hasn t happened to me  well until now  i honestly don t even know what to do with this broken phone      
169,1.0,                       the phone is complete garbage  the phone says no service    the sim card is not the issue it worked on   other iphones  the battery literally doesn t hold more than   mins  don t waste your time and money      
170,4.0,                       all of the reviews that i have seen on this product are at least   years old  i had just bought this phone  which i m using right now  and it s working fine other than a slight discoloration i wouldn t have noticed if i didn t have my old phone sitting next to me  my battery health was     when i received it which really isn t a problem for me since i m not on it all the time  it does take a lot longer to charge but not a ridiculous amount of time  i think that amazon probably has a better product inspection set in place rather than   years ago  but it all comes down to  as with most products on here  whether you bite the bullet and buy it or don t  all in all i m really happy with this phone and mine almost looked like new when i received it      
171,3.0,                       purchased  amazon renewed    from buyspry   returned the next day after receipt  battery health below stated  not renewed  return process could not have been easier refund could not have been faster  tied again from another vendor     
172,1.0,                       this phone was a  renewed item  so it fortunately had a guarantee   when i received this it would not power up   i took it to a cell store and there was a trick to get it to power up and it worked for a day before it would not power up   this unit was defective   just shipped it back for my refund      
173,1.0,                       first  i d like to say that i received the phone   weeks after it had been marked as delivered whatever  no big deal right well  we ve had this phone since april  and around mid may the speakers on the phone stopped working  both microphone and headset audio devices  dead who the hell at amazon still allows these retailers to sell hacked phones  i could tell from the get go something was off about the speakers  but just figured it might ve been a part that was replaced as it was refurbished equipment ok  sure  annoying as hell  but whatever  but now  trying to finally get around to requesting a refund or a replacement for the phone  my warenty has disapeared way to take advantage of people during a pandemic  absolutely shameful      
174,5.0,                       i bought it for christmas for my   year old  it is true what it said it was unblocked  i am usually very skeptical about that  but i was happy to find out i was unlocked  i was just able to and add it to my plan without any issues  he is very happy with his  new  phone lol  and we haven t had any issues yet  at the moment i am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it      
175,1.0,                       couldn t get it hooked up supposed to be fully unlocked and its not i reached out to them and they haven t replied at all never again     
176,1.0,                       the product itself its trash  it has like   big scratches  very big a visible dents  the home bottom it s not working properly  and the worst part it s that the phone its ni able to connect to any wifi  i m really angry because i feel scammed buy this unprofessional seller honestly for     you get the new iphone se just save some extra money and get a brand new iphone  because this is trash i m not going to be able to return the freaking phone because i m not in the us and i won t be back on time to make a return      
177,5.0,                       the iphone   is one of the most stable  solid phones that apple has produced  if you were bags then iphone   and more technology than iphone    my wife actually prefers the iphone   to her iphone xs      
178,1.0,                       update  upon further research i learned the a     model is not even for at t or t mobilei an a     model iphone      gb  this model phone is known by apple to have a defective chip dealing with mobile service  apple put out a statement and is repairing phones of this model and reimbursing costs to people who have paid for repairs  i am very disappointed as my phone has been stuck on  no service  for   days  going to apple tomorrow to see if i m eligible for a free repair  if not i will be asking for a refund      
179,2.0,                       the phone came in great condition and everything was working great until about   month after using the phone  and when i needed to depend on it   on a recent trip i needed to use the maps either google or the other maps app and found that it would not catch up  i tried holding the phone on the dash  by the window  it s january  and i was in the middle of newark so there was plenty of signal   the phone was always reading the directions   minute behind or showed the car driving in the median or off to the side so it kept trying to update directions causing me to get lost a number of times  there is not time to pull over on a highway to allow the gps to catch up in the locations i was traveling  i would like to know if this is an individual phone issue of is it perhaps covered since i just bought the phone      
180,1.0,                       i recently purchased this item and recipe edit in good condition  everything on it worked great for the first    hours or so  i woke up the next morning and it couldn t not connect to any network no matter what  then when i tried to update the device it failed halway through and got stuck in a  safe mode  in which i couldn t use it in any way  i returned it and currently waiting on my refund they didn t seem to concerned with the fact that they sent a product that did not work and it just seemed like regular business to them  do not recommend     
181,3.0,                       i just got it for two hours  so the review would be changed after a couple of days using    it is pre owned  no scratch  but wear can be seen around the back camera  speaker and mute button    the model is a      which is a japanese version  due to the japanese law  it cannot be mute  even you turn off the sound  when taking photos    it really annoying me  it is a basic requirement in my mind    i really did not expect amazon would ship me a japanese version    so    star    the battery is not healthy  it shows     maximum capacity in the battery report  compares to my own iphone   which has been used for almost years  it is      so    star    extremely hot    i m not sure whether it is a common issue for iphone   but this one got extremely hot when i recover all apps from icloud  will keep monitoring it and update the result later      
182,5.0,                       if you re looking for a great device  this is the place to come to  receiving this device i worked immediately and came brand new looking  i m in the us so for me this device works with verizon  this company is the best to buy devices so purchase here if you re looking for a great device      
183,2.0,                       the phone came with not working microphone and speakers  service center checked and fix price is      amazon compensated      so think twice before you buy i bought previous iphone from another amazon seller and it was locked  i think i never buy again from amazon any phone ever  because of  seems like they economy on service center forcing us to check and provide them exact problem description      
184,3.0,                    no est  desbloqueado  para usar con otras compa  as y en otros pa ses        
185,5.0,                       my first iphone    renewed  by amazon means it has been tested by a qualified supplier   in my case qc actually laid their hands on the phone   it works   photos are impeccable  but they show up rotated in emails  wtf     apps work nicely   alarms are not loud enough for my liking   battery lasts all day  but i often hook it up to a charger  e g  at work   at home      
186,1.0,                       this is the second time i have bought a phone from this company  the first time was a complete disaster i returned and went with a different company  almost over a year later i decided to give them another opportunity may be the first time was just a bad experience  they sent me a trash phone again  i specifically asked for a sprint phone they sent me a phone that is not compatible with sprint  they are a waste of time and i am telling you to please please please take it from me do not waste your time or your money with this company there are way other better companies on amazon that you should go through      
187,1.0,                       the screen came chipped on this  refurbished phone    then when i had to wipe the phone it wouldn t work again because apple considers the serial number of this device to be destroyed   it doesn t exist   apple won t preform any warranty service on it  and i only found out about this problem after   months of having the phone   now i have a      paper weight   you might get a good phone from this company  or you could be lucky like me and get ripped off  don t risk it      
188,1.0,                       it s a scam    the screen doesn t respond properly so and the battery dies within one hour   i highly  recommend that no one gets this product and it should be taken off amazon immediately  i don t want everyone to make the same mistake i did by buying this horrible product      
189,4.0,                       i ended up searching on amazon for the iphone   after my original was non functional and two of the replacement phones the at t insurance vendor sent were also individually non functional not to mention they only had black when i originally had a silver white that matched my case  they sent me a check to find my own and so i got a refurb here in my desired color everything is pretty much equivalent to my original phone in wear and tear  minor scratches and dings  aside from the fact that the screen lifts on the bottom left a little and i feel it may be effecting the touch screen efficiency i was also surprised to find it had a screen cover already on it when i received it which i bought separately with the phone not expecting that bonus  so i was very pleased i also received a charging block and cable with the phone      
190,1.0,                       received the phone only to not be able to use it  called my carrier to find out if it was a problem with the network but it turns out that the phone that i purchased had a blacklisted imei  basically meaning that the phone was stolen  locked for use before being sold to me  very upset to be receiving a product like that and returned it instantly      
191,1.0,                       i bought this iphone for my grandson for christmas   he was all excited until the phone locked him out and he could no longer gain access to the phone   this made him very sad and his mom as well since it was a used phone   thru this experience i will never ever buy another used phone again   the apple store could not unlock this phone          
192,1.0,                       this phone did not work  it did not connect to the tower no matter what  and it would start up strange  it would flash apple screen twice  used it one time to send money and credit card number stolen in another continent soon after   coincidence    asked amazon for refund  and refund directions were sent via email  used code in email to return via ups location  and item was  on its way  back to amazon as seen online amazon account     weeks later  checking to see if my refund was on my amazon account  the refund was not there  tracking information and shipping status removed from online account after quitting prime membership    will be taking further action  do not buy        
193,2.0,                       so the iphone itself on the outside was good looking  small scratch on the bottom of the screen  software seemed to work okay but i only had it a few hours before i decided to return it  this is why  i went to test out the camera and it couldn t focus on something even when i tapped on the screen to tell it what to focus on  the screen when using the camera  jiggled  and my husband pointed out the clicking sound coming from the hardware of the device  then i noticed the camera was shaking  then we couldn t hold the phone because it overheated  so yeah it got sent back  true review with no lies      
194,2.0,                       if it was unlocked  then there is something else going on because it wouldn t stay connected longer than    seconds   and then it wouldn t connect again until it was reset the positive  looked nice  and came with everything it said it would  seller refunded without issue and i went elsewhere      
195,1.0,                       no     
196,1.0,                       this phone does not work with verizon     
197,5.0,                       this arrived   days after i ordered it  it came much earlier than expected which is amazing  i see many reviews that say it isn t compatible with different networks but it worked perfectly when i activated it with sprint  and despite its price it works great  it s not slow and the battery doesn t drain too quickly or anything like that  i  honestly  highly recommend this product     stars all the way      
198,2.0,                       battery discharges within   hours with no use  can t seem to keep a charge  microphone does not pick up voice during phone calls   people can t hear me but i can hear them  it works with voice texting and notes but not for phone call  with or without the  speaker  option during call  although it looks nice  i cannot use this phone      
199,1.0,                       if i could go lower then one star i would  i had the phone one week  before it went black with the loading screen  would not turn of  or reset  i requested a refund they accepted it cost me     total these people refunded me a      for a faulty phone i did nothing to and was in great physical shape  do not buy from here     
200,5.0,                       came fed ex  looks brand new without the box      
201,5.0,                       i bought this model because the size is perfect for my small hand   it took a while for me to get used to the apple product but now i am very satisfied with my choice   the battery seems to take a charge quickly and last      
202,5.0,                       the battery life on this phone is great  it holds a charge for days      
203,1.0,                       the most terrible and worst decision ever made was to purchase a phone from this seller  they sell models of the phone which eventually fail because of antena issues  it just constantly says  searching  or  no service  when there clearly is service   i didn t know that this specific model was actually a recalled model back when they initially released the phone  i do not recommend buying from a seller who sells recalled items i contacted them and they couldn t do anything about it  this was their reply    i am sorry this has happed  however  the item is no longer covered under warranty   at least learn how to type correctly  such a rip off  i would give no stars if possible      
204,5.0,                       i bought a red iphone  s from mywit and it works great  also in brand new condition  no issues hooking it up either  definitely worth it  i was sketchy at first seeing a few bad reviews  but i certainly can vouch      
205,4.0,                       when i received the phone  it had about     battery health   got a new battery from apple and it s at      battery health   months later screen has a few tiny scratches  not bad at all  otherwise great shape   everything works perfectly      
206,5.0,                       great phone  the only thing the scream coming with a few scratches  but the working still very good       
207,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          when i received my phone it was scratched and in the photos it had when i bought it looked like the phone was in tact     
208,1.0,                       scam    the iphone was supposed to be a phone compatible with sprint  tried to activate with sprint but sprint told me the phone was a boost phone  that boost mobile would have to unlock it  that s frustrating enough but when i called boost mobile they told me the phone was still activate on an account  i told them how i purchased the phone from amazon and he tells me i got scammed  don t buy from mint mobile        
209,4.0,                       i really wish you could have made clear that this works with everyone but straight talk which is the only reason why i bought the phone on amazon instead of in a store really numb cause that s     i won t be getting back     
210,2.0,                       phone was not like new as described plus battery quit charging while plugged in  returning for a refund      
211,5.0,                       i don t usually write reviews but i just got my rose gold   yesterday so i don t know if it will act up or anything but so far everything is perfect  the battery life is so much better than my old android and everything is perfect  just a really small scratch on the screen but other than that everything is absolutely fine  the battery runs out fast due to my using it but this is such an upgrade from my old phone  i have been looking for an iphone a long time and if i were to buy another one i would definitely buy it from here again      
212,4.0,                       this phone seems perfectly functional and is cosmetically excellent with just a few small unnoticeable scratches from perhaps attempting to open it up   the battery was only at     capacity with mid     cycles   that is probably not unexpected for an iphone     it did look like someone tried to open it up  but gave up  as the adhesive strips holding the display assembly to the body were intact i replaced the battery with a leevee      mah better than oem battery to get the battery life back to normal  the poor battery is why i gave an overall   stars battery replacement of iphones after iphone   is much more difficult due to the adhesive holding the case together   being more challenging to open  replacing the adhesive is also tricky   you can omit the adhesive strip  but then you lose the water resistance      
213,5.0,                       bought this iphone for my son and it works perfectly  he loves taking pictures and the camera take amazing clear pics  great volume on the speakers  touch screen works perfect  the battery lasts for hrs      
214,5.0,                       i have bought refurbished electronics from amazon in the past and have been very happy with the condition  price  and quality      
215,5.0,                       phone came in really nice condition it just has like a little scuff in the corner but in really nice condition i wish it came with the regular charger for the apple pay  i wish it came with the regular charger for the apple and the wall charger aren t that awesome     
216,1.0,                       wifi went out after two days they will exchange if we delete icloud  cant delete icloud without wifi  they say send ur password so they can or no refund or exchange   gfys  scam        
217,5.0,                       this is my second buy from this seller  light scratches on top of the frame  no dents any where  crystal clear screen  battery service health is     which is much better than my last purchase of      same seller    sim tray rubber is bit loose  tends to stick out when closing tray  had to carefully push the rubber in while pushing the tray  tmobile sim works fine  updated to latest ios smoothly  good responsive touch  sound  camera and microphone all are in great shape  as new   would highly recommend to buy from this seller  just watch out for battery service health  you don t want to spend another      replacing battery few months after buy      
218,3.0,                    el celular lleg  intacto  pero estaba bloqueado  lo intente desbloquear con doctor sim y en primera instancia no pude porque supuestamente pod a estar reportado  el vendedor no tuvo la m s m nima intenci n de solucionar el problema  finalmente dr  sim me env o un chip y pude desbloquear  pero todo por mis propios medios  el vendedor no aport  ninguna ayuda ni soluci n         
219,1.0,                       horrible worked fine april  th to july   th then boom   sound stops working  can t use messaging  checked sim card and volume controls all work fine  it s an issue with the phone apple tells us  contact seller and they say  sorry we only guarantee for    days    funny      days after guarantee it stops working   makes sense now   save your money   do not buy these   it s a temporary solution as they ll only last the warranty   poor poor customer service      
220,1.0,                       i bought this phone amazon refurbished and paid a premium for it since i figured it would be a better quality phone that would perform like new  boy was i wrong  anything you buy that says refurbished means it was once broken and will most likely still be broken when you receive it like in my case  they tell you they fully inspect the phone for faulty hardware but they don t at all  if they did they would realize that the earpiece was blown and now i can t hear anybody clearly when on the phone or when i play a video it uses the earpiece as a speaker and sounds horrible  the proximity sensor also never worked and my screen doesn t turn off when i make a call  i am constantly putting people on hold because my cheek presses the button every time  the battery came in at     capacity so right out the gate it needed a new battery because the speed of the phone is lowered by apple if you have a worn battery  all of these defects were present as soon as i received the phone and should of been tested for  buyspry will sell you a junk phone that looks nice but is unusable as an actual phone  amazon just turns its back on this practice and defaults any questions or repairs back to buyspry instead of backing their    day refurbished electronics gaurantee  the phone has numerous glitches with the software as well  all around i feel duped to have bought this phone and paid extra for the  amazon refurbished  seal which does nothing for you  don t buy  go to apple directly for refurbished phones      
221,1.0,                       my son purchased this phone in october  now in january it has no cellular service  i spent   hours doing every suggestion there was to get this phone to work again to no avail  i will be bringing it to apple to hopefully get it fixed  according to many sites  after the last update at t did certain iphone   models no longer work  apple is offering a free fix but only if the phone is less then   years old  being that i have no idea when this was first purchased i am hoping it will get fixed  very disappointed    year old that bought this phone with his own money that he saved for a year to buy and it now doesn t work and he has to now wait to save to buy another one      
222,1.0,                       i was never able to activate it  because the software was so far outdated  i would have had to take it to an apple store      
223,5.0,                       very happy    i bought this as a gift for my husbands birthday and he was so happy with it  the phone works great and came in pretty quick without any issues  i have also purchased two other phones prior and haven t had any issues   very pleased      
224,4.0,                       ordered an unlocked    gb iphone    looks great with no scratches at all  there is a very small bump on the back but you can not notice it  everything works great as it should  the only reason i gave this a   and not a   is because the battery health is at     though it says there s nothing wrong with it  either way for the price  i got what i needed and it was a great buy  i would recommend this instead of paying close to      for a new one      
225,4.0,                       i ve had this phone for a week now and while it did not come in the original box  it did come with no visible scratches or damage  it loaded up properly and all seems to work well  the battery life is     and a charge lasts the expected    hours as detailed on apple s website  fingers crossed that all stays well      
226,1.0,                       no stars  phone was not fully unlocked or not for cdma carriers like it says  i was online with sprint forever and they couldn t get it to work      
227,5.0,                       i was a bit hesitant to buy this iphone   based on the mixed reviews but decided to give it a try  the phone arrived in like new condition  during  the backup restore the phone froze solid and got concerned it could be a defective unit but figured out with google it was a documented issue with solution  aside from that hiccup  again not seller fault   the phone has worked flawlessly  in summary  a very good buy      
228,5.0,                       this iphone   black was exactly what i ordered  it looked like new  there wasn t any scratches  any visible wear  and it came with a shattered glass already installed this phone was purchased for my    yr old son and it works just as long in comparison to  my phone when it was brand new from the store  only difference was the price       vs      easily hooked up with at t and can t beat the price  especially for a first phone for a kid and it was delivered sooner than notified  which was a major plus      
229,5.0,                    como nuevo    este iphone parec a nuevo  ya mismo le compro otro  gracias          
230,1.0,                    buenos dias  por medio del siguiente correo necesito hacer la devolucion del iphone que compre ya que me vino defectuoso  a tal punto que no quiso encernder mas el dispositivo de ninguna manera estare atenta a sus comentarios saludos        
231,1.0,                       screen was all scratched up battery wont even last   hour  goes dead  extreamily fst  def not worth the money   id have to say never again i got scammed     took for ever to come to even tho ima prime member still took   weeks     
232,2.0,                                                                                                                                                     amazon renewed  just used goods   it was a lot of scratches and dusty   even the battery performance was       i can t refund it because i have to use it right now  but i m really disappointed  note  there was no explanation  so i thought it was just black  but jet black came      
233,1.0,                       i ordered this phone  i wouldn t work  got a replacement  my extra monthly paid warranty was cancelled with the replacement  which i thought was weird  i got the replacement   it was fine for about   months  now it is a brick  before it bricked the guy apple sent me to said my serial number date was      and it might not be an apple product at all      
234,1.0,                       the phone no longer connects to the cell towers  we get no service  the buttons get stuck  and it freezes glitches all the time  since we re past our return date  we re out of over      and stuck with a raggedy phone that doesn t work  this is so disappointing      
235,1.0,                       just received the iphone   and it physically looks great  but when powered on gave me no setup instructions and continued to say  no service  called verizon and they told me this model the a     has been recalled by apple for continually saying no service  i have a tight budget and i need a phone in case of medical emergencies and i am so frustrated that after spending over      i am unable to use the phone in received      buyer beware        
236,1.0,                       the phone was really dirty when i open the package so i return the phone     
237,5.0,                       honestly was expecting this thing to have issues and be complete garbage for the price  i was pretty happy to find that the phone worked immediately when i put my sim card in and it had good battery life  it came with a third party charger and a pin key to take the sim out of my old phone  there were only some very small nicks on the edge which you can t see with a case on  i would    p recommend this seller  i really don t know how they are making money      
238,4.0,                       the phone came packaged very nice  the plastic container holding the phone is very tight so it wouldn t be thrown around in the box no cosmetic damage that i can seebattery  it s max charge is     but it s a step up from    so it should be fine for now one annoyance was the sticker type used on the back  it doesn t peel off easy and will leave residue and ripping of it  so it took some time cleaning and scraping it off with something plastic overall  seems fine  will update if something goes wrong     
239,5.0,                       i think this is a new phone without the new phone charger or box   no indications of ever being used   battery charges to        att provided me with a chip and hooked me up to my account at no charge   speedy   day shipping       
240,5.0,                       i love this product  i was a little scared because i ordered this and then started reading a lot of the reviews and saw a lot of bad ones  but i ve had this phone for   days and it s worked perfectly fine  the only issue i can see think of is he battery life is not the greatest but honestly that s expected of a used phone and it s only     to get a new one at the apple store so once i do that this phone will seem pretty much new  there was some pretty noticeable scratches on the back but they are not huge and barely noticeable and once you have a case on it s not a big deal  overall this is a huge upgrade from my last phone it s fast and bright and works perfectly fine     
241,1.0,                       i bought this phone   and after maybe one good month   i couldn t receive cellular connection or make calls as if the phone was locked   i couldn t receive calls or text messages   and taking the phone to get looked at in the store was pointless because they couldn t get into it with it not being from them   the phone is unlocked once you get it   but afterwards it is locked      
242,5.0,                       i love this phone   it is perfect for my son   it was unlocked and i was able to use it for my safelink tracfone account   i had no issues with activating  i just had to call my provider to activate because i was not sure who it was unlocked from   my provider was able to tell me that it was an verizon phone but was unlocked and it simply had to be changed over to at t since that s the sim card that i picked   it took nearly   to    minutes for them to do so   the phone itself came with a tempered glass already on it so i was pleased to see that   the sound quality and picture seems to be excellent and i am very pleased  there are no visible scratches dents or defaults  this phone looks like it is brand new  this seems to be an excellent product for a very excellent price      
243,5.0,                       i am writing the review because i was leary to purchase after reading reviews  the phone looks new  had a screen protector already  and great battery life  i m glad we went this route      
244,3.0,                       the first day i received the phone its battery life was terrible  poor battery lifethe battery went from      charge to     charge in an hour      
245,1.0,                       as it says in the title  this piece of junk broke completely after   months because of a hardware issue  the battery life was at     capacity when i received it  after   months the battery became a serious issue and eventually gave out  on top of that there was a hardware issue      
246,1.0,                       just powered up for the first time and it s so hot to the touch while doing an apple update i actually had to put the phone down  hoping this is just a fluke for the first time powering up but if this continues i ll have to return it      
247,2.0,                       the phone looks very nice but it doesn t has a good working photo camera   i was really exited to have this great value product and i got so disappointed when camera wasn t working properly      
248,1.0,                       do not buy       this phone is defective it does not work  on top of that it took me   weeks to get a refund  and they don t give you back the full amount you paid they basically sold me a phone that does not work so i sent it back and didn t get back the full amount i paid for it  don t waist your time and end up like me  don t purchase this product      
249,1.0,                       this phone would say it was changed at      and soon as you took it off the charger the phone would die  did not hold charge and some random button was on the screen and there was no way of getting rid of it  if i could give this item zero stars that s what it would have got  seller on the other hand responded quickly and was very understanding      
250,2.0,                       very disappointing  the phone was represented to be reconditioned and in fact cosmetically it was perfect  however the home button was broken rendering the phone to be inoperable  some inspection  to add insult to injury purchaser must pay return postage      
251,4.0,                       so i bought my second unlocked iphone  it took about   days to receive  i simply took out my old sim card added it to this new iphone   new to me  and called metro    m later i was activated for free  so far seems great extremely minor scuffs new like feel  and camera and battery so far seem good  luckily i have extra chargers because the charger sent with the phone does not work   i will update asap if anything changes      
252,4.0,                       i ordered   phones  first one is perfect i ve had no problems with it however  i had to send back the  nd device as it wasn t fully unlocked  which is the kind of phone that s advertised  understanding it was a mistake i spent     to send it back and get a different phone the replacement just came in and is  for a second time  not unlocked  this product is labeled as fully unlocked and this is the second phone i ve received that has been falsely advertised  both problem phones have been verizon i m very disappointed and now i have to spend another     to send back a phone  again  i will not be ordering a  th  and i m frustrated at how long this is taking  considering i was supposed to be buying fully unlocked phones      
253,1.0,                       i needed a phone and wanted an iphone so bad  i order this phone and had it shipped to belize  where i live   i can t hear when i got calls nor can i be heard  i took it to several phone technicians and they said it s the audio ic on the motherboard which none of them want to touch  i can t record voice messages or anything  i do not appreciate this and i am not happy about it  do not buy this phone     
254,1.0,                       this product was advertised as unlocked   when we tried to use it  it was locked and was not usable i would like to exchange it for the same product but please test and see that it is unlocked      
255,1.0,                       bought this item for my wife   amazon renewed  label gave me a false confidence and i purchased the iphone   with    gb memory in june       apple provided an ios update second week of december and i got the dreaded   no activation  message  apple gave me an appointment to meet a technician  he told us the phone was a japanese version and that if we could not provide the original carrier s sim card then the phone is a brick  after multiple attempts to fix it we are unable to get past the activation screen  amazon seller has been unresponsive to requests provide assistance and we are past the    day warranty  buyer beware  you do not get the whole story on refurbs renewed  apple tech told us that any refurb phone is not eligible for apple assistance or send in repair  they won t touch it you let me down amazon iduped     
256,5.0,                       i love all the storage  if you want an iphone quality at a reasonable price  this meets all my needs  it has nice clear video  great sound  awesome storage and easy features  it took a bit of a learning curve since i ve never had an apple phone before  the battery can go down quickly  but i found great tutorials on what to turn off to preserve battery life  i recommend it highly  i use a stylus because it is smaller than what i m used to  i bought an adorable case   so many cute choices for this model and earphones are easy too  i was pleasantly surprised i could use wireless and sing on my karaoke ap  right away the transition from android to iphone went smooth  i just transferred the sim card and had all the features of my old phone in my new one  there are aps to help with the transition  most importantly there wasn t a single flaw and   weeks later it s still performing perfectly      
257,1.0,                       this phone is garbage  took two hours just to get it on  then wouldn t stay charged had to stay on plug until i paid to get a new battery and now won t hook to cell data only wifi worst purchase ever     
258,1.0,                       the phone itself works as i expected  i was expecting the headphone connector cord that is required for the phone that was not included  plus there was phone damage on one of the corners  the most frustrating part is i have had to purchase a new battery   days after i received it  i thought a refurbished phone should have come fully operational  especially when you spend        not very satisfied      
259,5.0,                       i love it   it s just like my old iphone but it actually takes a charge  it downloaded all the information easily and i just switch the sim card  great speed on shipping and a great product      
260,1.0,                       this phone was stolen  ridiculessending it back and i better get a full refund     
261,5.0,                    el iphone llego en dos d as  excelentes condiciones no rayones  completamente desbloqueado  solo compre la sim card aparte  la instale llame a servicio al cliente de la compa  a telef nica y listo    no trae aud fonos el cargador que trae no es el original  pero para mi eso no importa  este es el segundo iphone que compro con esta compa  a y todo muy bien  jamas comprar a un tel fono nuevo son muy caros  este es buena opci n        
262,3.0,                       phone has glitches  appears up to date but things don t run properly  i purchased more storage for the phone but it still says i don t have enough storage  screen freezes  turning the phone on and off only works temporarily if at all  among other things i am noticing more and more day by day and it s only been a week      
263,1.0,                       battery charge did not last the optimum time cell phone was returned with a request to send a replacement with adequate battery time instead the money was returned mean time the price has gone up it was a frustrating experience      
264,5.0,                       after two months it just died wouldn t take a charge wouldn t power up even with it not on the charger it was very hotworked fine until that happens     
265,2.0,                       the phone looks really nice but the camera on the first phone i recife did was defective  so they sent me a replacement very quickly  but then the second phone i received had the worst battery and wouldn t even last   hours  told the seller about it and waiting to hear back  hope i can get a phone that is as good as new like they promise with their warranties  not likely to order from them again      
266,5.0,                       simple to use no new learning skills to operate    my wife loves it         
267,2.0,                       i was extremely excited to get my iphone    but it turned out to be a very frustrating situation  i went through the process to start up the phone and get to the home screen  the first thing i tried was to put my sim card into the phone  but it didn t work  it searched for minutes only to say  no service   then i tried using the camera app  but it glitched out every time i attempted to take a photo or record a video  i looked up the problem and the articles said to check voice memos to see if you get  recording failed   no audio devices found     unfortunately  i had this problem  the only good aspect to this phone was its look  nothing else  overall  the phone is broke and unusable  i bought my phone from electrowireless  they ripped me off completely  i expected a working phone from the description  but instead i was shipped an exact opposite of it  i am very upset      
268,5.0,                       my fiance ordered this phone and she has had it a little over a year now with no issues at all  don t waste your money by getting a new phone  amazon certified phones are totally worth it  i got one as well for myself a month ago and it s an iphone    neither phone had any damage at all and work perfectly fine      
269,5.0,                       the phone got here n its perfect from what i can see i m not yet sure about the battery thing because i ve only had it for about   hours but as of now everything seems okay      
270,5.0,                       the phone is fantastic  but there is only one speaker on the bottom  i was going to start a return because i thought that there were supposed to be   working speakers on the bottom  but i found out that there is only one  if you want stereo  you must position the phone in portrait mode  apple is very odd sometimes      
271,3.0,                       iphone   black came in excellent condition  like new  no scratches or scuffs  works great  was happy for couple months until phone started to develop issues with hearing callers and vs versa  callers can t hear me and i can t hear callers  checked settings   disabled wifi calling  hard reset phone  updated ios  happens randomly  suspect possible known defects on iphone   with audio ic chips      
272,4.0,                       the iphone   came in good and nice condition  it is unlocked as described  the screen is flawless  came with a glass cover  all functions work as described  there were very minor scuffs on the top  the only thing i concern about was the battery health of the phone is      which is anticipated giving it is   years old  overall  it is a good solid buy for its purpose      
273,2.0,                       device looks absolutely pristine  functionally there are several issues  battery life is quite poor and was clearly not replaced as part of the refurbishing process as i had anticipated which means i will need to pay for a replacement  the home button is extremely temperamental and works about every other time and every third or fourth time when attempting the double click feature  about every tenth text notification will repeatedly chime until i actually open the text  lots of little annoying things that i would not expect from a phone that had actually been refurbished  pretty dissatisfied with advertising of product compared to actual functionality of product  i doubt this product was even serviced before being sold edit  included in my package was a slip of paper saying i could get a     amazon gift card for leaving an honest review  i followed the protocol and never received my gift card  this seller is pretty terrible  will not use again      
274,5.0,                       love this phone  i am so glad i bought a refurbished one i took it to the apple store just in case to do a diagnostics on it and said that it was refurbished and bought through amazon  and apple checked it and said everything is great  very happy with my purchase      
275,5.0,                       can t comment on battery life  as i bought it as a gift for someone but the phone appears to be in excellent condition   i powered up the phone and the screen looked very good through the screens protector      
276,4.0,                       the phone was in excellent condition  everything worked and it was super clean  fast  etc  i would have given it   starts but it doesn t work on verizon  i had to return it  but the phone is like brand new there were no scratches or anything  i just couldn t use it and was really bummed about it      
277,4.0,                       purchased this for a friend and as i know it is used it did come with quite a few blemishes  scratches etc  the screen had been replaced as you can see where the home button and also edges don t completely line up  making the home button harder to depress  phone works fairly well other than maybe a small software glitch  every time she opens her email the phone rings twice like someone is calling but no one is  took us awhile to figure that one out  lol  battery and function otherwise is acceptable  a bit over priced for a used phone     
278,5.0,                       this iphone had serious trouble with it s gsm functionality  i don t blame the seller  they delivered what was advertised  had to send into apple for a repair  this is a common issue with these phones and apple fixed it for free  they even put in a new battery      
279,1.0,                       this phone worked up until it was no longer eligible to return it  it could no longer connect to the service provider  i even went to my service provider and changed the sim card and it had no luck  these people covered up the issues of the phone until it can no longer be returned  if you want a phone that actually works either buy it from apple or your phone provider  don t waste money buying it on amazon unless you want to get scammed by trying to save money      
280,5.0,                       i purchased this phone from  prime mobility   the phone arrived on time  it looks brand new with no scratches on the body or the screen  the battery charges to       i can not verify the battery life yet  but i have used it several hours every day and i have    to     left at the end of the day      
281,1.0,                       the phone arrived in great condition without   scratch  however  the description that this phone was compatible with verizon was not true     
282,5.0,                    excelente  con gran capacidad        
283,1.0,                       the iphone    renewed  sold and shipped to us was broken  unusable  it couldn t do the necessary ios update  couldn t operate as a cell phone properly  couldn t  wouldn t connect to wifi  home lan  or my verizon carrier  apple offered to replace it for        it should have never been sold and shipped to us  generally speaking  it sucked      
284,1.0,                       i bought this phone to replace my identical iphone   which i accidentally broke  it is terrible    the battery last a few hours tops  the home button is barely responsive and the phone is super slow    i brought it to apple to ask if they could look at it and they said the battery is functioning at less than     and the home button should be replaced  the combined cost will be almost      dollars  i wish i could just return it but i can t be without a phone for work and don t have time to set up another      
285,2.0,                       all seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not     or above as stated in listing but     the biggest issue with this was having to pay  send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promised this just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending  then what else are they not checking with these phones      
286,5.0,                       after reading reviews on both ends of the star spectrum  i was apprehensive about the arrival of my first ever refurbished phone  i worried that it might be a lemon  but it exceeded my expectations  i was delighted to find a complementary screen protector and clear case included in my package  i checked the battery health right away and was happily surprised to see that it was at      peak performance capacity   the exterior of the phone was unscathed and could have been mistaken for brand new  i continue to monitor everything to see if there are any quirks or bugs that will appear with time but  so far  i have no complaints  i d recommend a refurbished phone to even the most skeptical buyer      
287,4.0,                       so far so good  my sim card did work when i put it in  was texting people as expected  i was worried at first seeing the older reviews but as far as i can tell  first day  first impression  buyspry gave me a well working  apple iphone touch id worksspeaker workscameras both workmicrophone worksi tested everything i figured could be a problem  happy so far came with screen protector on it  sim tool and a charging cable      
288,2.0,                       bought   phones  same  beautiful condition  one with a screen protector in place  the other without problem  not for us market  japanese phone   not a problem  except    can t get a battery change in usa  apple store said they are grey market  and somehow locked to at t despite being from another country  can t silence the camera  ever   so unable to use social media selfies  important to the kids  not a big deal for me  but makes the phones not useable at their school attempting a return through the vendor      
289,4.0,                       was a bit confused and worried with it at first but i came to find out it was just my internet that wasn t allowing some apps to download    after i got that figured out the phone worked great have to take a star away though because the charger doesn t work and had to buy one but overall very happy with this purchase there are some noticeable smudges and stuff but it s nothing to big i won t say don t listen to the negative reviews because all phones are refurbished differently   but my t mobile sim worked perfectly fine      
290,5.0,                       i was nervous about buying this phone based on the other reviews i d read  but i figured i d risk it and just return it if the phone was busted  but it is wonderful  it feels like new  the screen is perfect  the technical aspects of the phone all work great  the battery could be better  but maybe i have unrealistic expectations for a refurbished phone  i d buy this phone again      
291,1.0,                       this iphone   model a     has a known loss of service issue that can only be fixed by apple  apple will not touch refurb  phones  further  the screen showed symptoms of failure  passcode numbers disappearing when pressed  screen icons moving from side to side and having to be pressed multiple times  this phone should not have been sold      
292,1.0,                       my phone worked for   week until suddenly it started restarting itself multiple times for no reason to the point where i couldnt even use it  the only good thing about my phone was the battery  also  one day my phone started having no cell service in places that i always have service  the next morning  i woke up to a system message saying that the phone could no longer use the cell service function and to install an update to fix it  no surprise  the update did nothing so i had to return the phone  i do not recommend this product      
293,2.0,                       i had requested for a refund  before i even received the phone  but when i received the phone i decided to turn it on to see how it worked   surprisingly the phone would not go pass the screen when powering it on  it was stuck on the same screen      
294,1.0,                       tried to use with verizon and found out the phone sent will not work on verizon  the in store verizon rep told me that the iphone   is notorious for  fully unlocked  versions not working on non gsm networks  he said the older iphone   s were manufactured to be carrier specific and cannot connect with other carriers  even when fully unlocked  however  newer iphone   s can  so i guess i wasn t lucky enough to get a  newer  refurbished iphone    it seems like breed  the seller  would know this and make changes accordingly      
295,1.0,                       aside from all the issues i like the phone  but right off the bat i noticed the battery had     capacity when the product description says it comes with      when i contacted them about it they told me i could go get it replaced and send them a picture of my receipt  instead of replacing it themselves  i just bought a new battery myself  fast forward a while and i m listening to music when the phone decides to shut off suddenly and restart  when it restarts the wifi will not work  the option is greyed out  and the bluetooth option is just a spinning gear that doesn t stop so i cannot turn it on or off  since then it s been restarting constantly and i m tired of it  so once again  i wouldn t bother buying from this seller  their product isn t worth the money      
296,1.0,                       i was happy with the phone  but as soon as the    days were up  return window closed on       and i started having problems on        i am unable to take pictures anymore  everything is running slow  the touchscreen doesn t respond properly  calls don t go through  both incoming and outgoing get a few seconds in and then it says  call failed    and i m having to reset the phone every couple hours  i am so upset update  i contacted the seller and was told they won t do anything  do not buy from this seller  at   months and   day after your order  you ll be stuck with a non functioning device     
297,1.0,                       awful  paid      to get a defected camera that does not work  would not recommend buying from this  rd party seller  every time i try to take a picture my phone freezes  have been trying to reach out to the seller for awhile now and have been unable to contact them      
298,1.0,                       ordered the phone came on time  the battery wasn t holding a charge  we had to take it to apple to have the battery replaced out of pocket cost    day later it wouldn t connect to cellular  called apple they had us send it in  this phone has been nothing but a nightmare and i will never purchase from this seller again      
299,3.0,                       this phone is definitely worth the price  my phone came looking brand new without a scratch on the screen or the back  i know that some other people have reviewed phones that have come with scratches all over them  but mine wasn t like that  it also has all the buttons and systems working perfectly  including the fingerprint reader  that being said because of the price that means you have to make a few compromises  my battery health is only at     so the battery does not last as long as a brand new phone only about   hours   but it still lasts pretty well for me  also the camera shutter sound cannot be disabled on my phone and that may be because my phone is from korea or japan where the shutter sound cannot be disabled  i thought that my phone would be coming with a lightning cord power adapter dongle   like other apple phones because the wording in the description was a little confusing  but instead it came with a different cord  it also does not come with headphones so so i had to buy them separate  my phone also came about a week later than expected but i think that was more to blame on the mail shipping service  i would say that as long as you are willing to make some compromises for the price that this phone is worth it  i felt a little nervous buying a pre owned phone without seeing it first and felt like it was a little bit of a gamble  but it was worth the risk      
300,5.0,                       i know some people have had problems with their sellers but i had a great experience  fast responses answering questions i had from the company  and the product was phenomenal  microscopic hairline scratches on the front glass  but with a      battery capacity rating from coconut battery  an already wiped icloud  and an undamaged phone for       come on      
301,1.0,                       my apple iphone   blk    gb stopped working after   months of purchasing it from this seller trademore i found out that my model qualified under the apple repair program for the  no service  flaw and apple will fix affected devices free of charge under the no service replacement plan affected devices were manufactured between september      and february       and sold in china  hong kong  japan  macao  and the us  if your iphone fits this timeline  you ll next want to match the model number  in china  model numbers a     and a     were affected  hong kong  macao  and the us will be model number a      and japan will have model number a     i submitted my phone to best buy geek squad and they sent the phone to apple on           for repair or replacement and they responded on          stating that the phone was deemed to be  tampered  and was sent back unrepaired  they also sent a letter stating   our technicians carefully inspected the product you sent to us  they determined that the product is ineligible for service  so we re returning it to you now  the reason your product isn t working is because of unauthorized modifications that were made to it  our warranty doesn t cover issues caused by unauthorized modifications i contacted the seller trademore and they responded saying we provide a    day warranty for our devices from the date it was purchased  unfortunately  your device exceeds the warranty window and we cannot provide a refund i m now left without a working iphone   covered under any warranty because the seller is conducting unauthorized modifications that disqualifies the phone under apples warranty and is now considered tampered  i should have gotten a replacement iphone   from apple since this model was an affected model  i believe the seller was aware of this warranty issue and is scamming buyers not aware of the manufacture defect  please beware of this seller moving forward            shady business practice      
302,1.0,                       despite the clear claim in the title  the phone was not unlocked  i have found it is locked with at t  and they are unwilling unable to unlock the phone as the original contract that the phone was bought under has not been paid off  if you re relying on the phone being unlocked  careful shopping here  for my part  i m now abroad with no easy way to return the phone      
303,3.0,                       the maximum capacity of the battery was on     when i received the phone  i can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead  other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great      
304,3.0,                       cosmetically the iphone   i received was near perfect  couldn t connect to cell carrier despite   tries and   new sim cards  took this iphone   to apple genius bar and was told the antenna was defective  a problem well know to apple and us carriers however during the gryphon commerce then amazon inspection  they failed to fix this well known problem before being sold as  refreshed  also  a lithium ion battery with a capacity of below      should have been replaced li  batteries diminish in orders of magnitude when they fall into the   th percentile  this particular battery requires a charge every   hours   despite a broken antennae  incapable of background data refresh  cell network search  gps or any of the other know culprits for quickly using battery storage  i ve contacted both gryphon commerce   https   www amazon com s me a  shkyiznlrwj marketplaceid atvpdkikx der   and amazon customer support by email and phone days later  no resolution  i m simply asking for a return and refund      
305,1.0,                       product is a japan model and not meant for us sales but no wear in the description does it say such  japan laws prohibit certain features to be silence with the side button or at all  make the phone inferior to the product i was expecting to receive  replacement of the phone is proving to be more difficult than it should be  do not purchase from this supplier  also i have never written a bad review before      
306,1.0,                       july            i hooked my re newed i phone   up to charger last night for first time   it was at     charge when i plugged it into charger  it hadn t even reached     charge  and it was too hot to hold in my hand also  see screenshot of battery  maximum capacity  of      this is not to be confused with the current state of charge  but is instead a measure of how much battery capacity is left compared to when it was new  expect battery would have been replaced  it s supposed to be a  renewed phone  number one enemy of cpu is heat  same for battery  with this intensity of heat  phone bound to fail prematurely  returning      
307,5.0,                       i have at t and i put the sim card from my old phone into this one and there were no problems at all  it was super quick and super easy  even came with the tool to remove the sim card  ive only had it for a day but so far so good  no complaints at all other than the battery does go down a bit quick  definitely would recommend buying if you are thinking about it  i was expecting maybe a scratch here or there but nope  no flaws visible      
308,2.0,                       purchased a gold iphone   last week from this seller  the iphone looked and felt great and it was in very good condition upon arrival  the first couple days using the phone  i had no problems  after those couple days  no service  began to appear in the top left with a triangle     symbol next to it  this occurred almost every other day for a week  i would go from having great service one day  to all of a sudden no service for a day  it was very frustrating having to deal with this malfunction  i give this iphone seller   stars because i was overall very disappointed with my experience and product  the thing about buying refurbished phones is it seems like a hit or miss  i m sure there are plenty of happy customers here  but i m not one of them  i m just hoping the return process is speedy and i receive my full refund soon      
309,4.0,                       we first purchased a phone from another vendor but had to send it back because the imessage and facetime feature would not work  so  after receiving a refund  we ordered from this vendor and received the order in a timely manner  had a little difficulty trying to connect my mom s apple watch  but after several attempts  it finally connected  overall  i believe my mom is satisfied with this purchase      
310,4.0,                       it came right on time  i did miss the package  because i had to sign for it but i just went to pick it up from the post office  it came nicely package  very basic  not really packaged safe but it was just fine  other than a few pre existing scratches that are barely noticeable on the screen its perfect  i love it  it comes with the basic charger but nothing else  i didnt expect much more  love it all the same      
311,1.0,                       pdi mobile is a scam  i received two different phones from them  both  amazon renewed   but apparently that does not mean anything  the first iphone i received was horribly scratched from the back and had a malfunctioning ear speaker  sounded like an echo all the time  red flag for water damage   after getting a replacement the first one looked incredibly new but the camera did not work  shaky  double image  unable to focus  and the ear speaker had same issue as before  water damage   both phones where not factory reset and had calls from around a month ago on them  amazon customer service was incredibly helpful and i am in the process of getting a refund  proceed with care      
312,3.0,                       battery life sucks  i understand refurbished   but the battery was even less than the description stated  working through a few other cliches like some mishaps with the facetime capabilities  but it is still able to be used  and wasn t extremely expensive so        
313,3.0,                       the product worked as expected up until a week after the warranty period ended   it began glitching and now it will not power on at all   kiss electronics would provide no customer service because the device was past the warranty period      
314,5.0,                       just as described  i took a chance with a refurbished renewed item  being skeptical mostly about the battery life  but so far so good  item arrived well protected  with little  to no cosmetic wear  no problems using my cellphone carrier  pretty good deal for the price  as per the description there are no earphones included  it does come with a charger  would take the chance again      
315,1.0,                       bought two as christmas gifts for my kids  the battery life was very poor and one of the charger ports stopped working within    hours     
316,5.0,                       when i had orders this product i had just lost my other phone so i didn t have one for a couple days i had read a couple of the reviews and saw a lot of good ones and a few bad ones so i was on the fence but went ahead and bought it  when it came i was shocked about how fast it came and that it was packaged very well and safely   it came with a new charger and box and the phone had a cover on it to protect from scratches and fingerprints which im thankful for since its glass so it collects a lot  just extremely happy and satisfied with the quality of the cameras and the phone itself  definitely trust this brand  i m glad i did      
317,5.0,                       prompt shipping  phone looks brand new  works great  but it has only been a couple of days  the battery is only      but that is to be expected on a refurbished phone  and can be easily replaced in the future  all good so far       happy      
318,2.0,                       seller misrepresented item as being at t locked  called at t and it is not theirs  belongs to a japanese company that will not unlock unless u are original owner  company will not help     
319,2.0,                       good     day return policy  the phones themselves looked clean and presentablebad  i ordered two refurbed iphone  s  mixed results  somewhat bad the first had a dirty recharger unit that i had to clean  and an existing screen saver that looked like an amateur install  it was also missing the sim card tray  so i had to order one for    on amazon  because i figured that was easier and faster than contacting amazon seller   the phone works fine the second was defective and would not make calls or texts  even after swapping an existing and working sim card  part of the return process was an option to call amazon for help troubleshooting  that resulted in an immediate and friendly person who also put apple support on a three way call  who confirmed it was defective so i returned it      
320,1.0,                       be careful ordering from this seller  do not buy  when i received the phone  i went to turn it on at the boost mobile store and he was able to give me a new sim card   which i paid for  and a number  the boost mobile store guy then told me it was not picking up a signal and he tried updating the phone  and it did not work  he told me that it was a known iphone   problem  and i had to go to the apple store  i went to the apple store who first told me they would send the phone out  to i am guessing apples corporation because they could not fix it in the store  and give me a phone to use until i get mine back  another lady then came to me and said since the phone was refurbished that they would send it out but the corporation would just send it back unfixed because it is refurbished  so they gave me another option to trade my iphone   in to them since it is in perfect condition and it is worth      off of whatever phone i buy from them  i then looked up the  problem  the iphone   s are having  and it says some iphone   s apple has determined that a small percentage of iphone   devices may show  no service  in the status bar  even if cellular coverage is available   due to a component that has failed on the main logic board  the seller also lied and said thathe checked everything to see if it works  which he lied he knew it would be like this  now i am going through all this trouble teying to figure out what to do  so beware you will be waisting your money  and time      
321,1.0,                       nightmare   after getting it activated at the verizon store  the boy was trying to show me the functions  then told me the battery is junk and i need a new one  good me to go home  let it did then charge a full      charge to reboot the battery  well  the phone won t charge   nearest apple store is two hours away  now i am left without a phone until i can get somewhere to get it fixed  this should be against the law      
322,1.0,                       so i bought this as a gift and was suppose to be fully unlocked when i went to go set it up with my provider they said they couldnt because the product was locked to other cell providers and would only work with at and t  weeks go by i send in my product for replacement and another   weeks go by and no word as of yet needed this in june already going on august      
323,1.0,                       it does not work with verizon like it was advertised  i need to return it  i researched it and it was suppose see to work but no  i even bought new verizon sim card and still didn t work  i took it to verizon store and they said it was not compatible      
324,1.0,                       apple iphone    with a three month warranty   within two months of purchase we began having issues with this phone   a week ago the phone completely locked up and shows nothing but the apple sign when powered on   i have contacted the seller twice through recommended email and i still haven t received a reply   completely dissatisfied with this purchase         
325,5.0,                       dont listen to bad reviews   my phone came        perfectly fine  like new  works fine  unlocked  and all  no hassle  went with simple mobile      
326,5.0,                       i purchased this phone as a gift for a younger sibling as he was still using an iphone  s  i was a little worried about buying a renewed phone but this arrived in excellent condition  i immediately restored the back up onto this iphone   and had zero issues  i have an   pro and side by side the   still has a nice look  very simple and sleek while having the dearly missed home button  a  to this seller and a  to the product i received      
327,2.0,                       the iphone arrived and the screen was placed poorly and the screen was not original it was a cheap screen i searched it up iphone   and it didn t have   bubbles near the camera but the iphone that i had did so in conclusion it was a cheap screen and the home button was really bend  i am unsatisfied with the product and i feel like i wasted   days waiting for the package i want my money back and want another product   i still don t have a phone to use im writing this opinion on my laptop      
328,1.0,                       horrible product and horrible customer service  i went through two of these pieces of junk and now i m out      because the printed label didnt have a correct tracking number when i returned the second one because they had so many issues  i bought the first one and it had a serious microphone issue so i returned that one and got a replacement one  then that one had a software issue that couldn t be fixed and i had to return it too  swearing off this seller and their shoddy product  turns out it wasn t over because even though i printed the label and sent it on it s way  it has disappeared and the number given is not a tracking number  i emailed the seller and they want the tracking number that isnt a real one  i called ups and checked  there is no correct tracking number  tried to talk to amazon about it and they give me the run around and sent me back to the seller  i ve been swindled out of      by some guy named jesus andrade in tx after spending weeks of pulling my hair out trying to get these phones to work  pieces of junk and an even crappier seller  should be banned from amazon  save your money and sanity and dont buy from them      
329,5.0,                       the phone looked like new and works like new  no problems so far one week old     
330,1.0,                       it only came with the phone and charger  no earbuds  but overall i really can t complain  it seems to be working as it should so far and only has a couple scuffs on it  nothing super noticeable  even came with a screen protector  so that was a nice addition  it s only been a day so far  but i m pretty happy with my purchase that was my originial review   this is after dealing with the seller  i was having issues getting a credit they claimed i would be getting and this is their response to me good morning sarah we saw that your feedback was submitted just now and this is what we asked for in order to issue the credit of      you have decided to criticize us with your feedback while it is your own fault not knowing how to submit a review even though i have provided the steps to do so  we have issued more than        gift cards to the customers who submitted reviews so far and if you go through the reviews you will see that no one is complaining about not receiving the credit except you good luck jasminemy reply ok first off    it was not done just now  i had done this the day that you asked me to          i actually have the e mail i sent to you with the feedback email and i emailed you   times since then    this was not my fault    i was frustrated because i had e mailed first  saying i didn t see the place to do that   then again i when i did see it  i responded the same day  with said picture then i sent a new e mail because i was unsure if you were receiving the other      with another picture   and still did not hear anything back    which is why i was frustrated    to attack me when i stated why i was frustrated is unnecessary   i had actually changed my feedback review because i was frustrated with not hearing back  when the card you sent in your packages states i would hear at least something in    hours    looking back  i replied back to you on the  st  the  st   this is the  th    so yea    i was frustrated please check your e mails before you attack one of your customers for not following instructions with regards sarah     
331,4.0,                       the phone itself is great but the microphone quit working on the one i received  it is december and i ordered the phone in february of the same year  i loved the phone when it was working and the price was good but i guess that is what you get when you order a refurbished phone  now i am on the hunt to replace my phone once again      
332,1.0,                       biggest scam there is     nothing about this phone worked   not sure how a      phone gets sold off that s broken and the trade in value is       phone will not work at all   buyer beware    a total loss of money  buy new at apple or nothing at all  these companies cannot be trusted      
333,5.0,                       no scratches came with charger     battery life  i can pull my sim card out of my other phone and use in this if i need to but i just use this for my dji mavic mini for my screen and it works perfect      
334,5.0,                       it s a great product  i am really happy with my brand new iphone  it s was good deal  i highly recommend privi  thank you so much and god bless you       
335,1.0,                       i took this phone to the verizon store to switch it over from my old phone  and i was told this was a faulty model that was recalled by apple  very displeased  and upset that the company probably knew it was a bad phone and still took my money  and sent me an unusable phone  please do not buy from this company  they are not here for customer satisfaction  only to steal money from people      
336,3.0,                       in less than a month of receiving the phone  the side silence button switch broke  i called customer service and besides the fact that the agent was very unfriendly and seemed confused as to why i would call about a defected product instead of going to get it fixed myself  she said i could return it for a refund  that would obviously leave me without a phone so i decided to wait and see if i could get it fixed at a shop for cheap  update  it s not a cheap fix   now two months into having the phone  the phone randomly restarted overnight and became locked again  after calling my carrier  they  and a local phone store  said that the phone s contract must have expired overnight and the phone was turned off   so the phone wasn t actually fully unlocked  i keep trying to call customer service but even when i leave a message  as told to do so when the lines are busy   no one gets back to me  it s been a headache update  i changed it up to three stars from one star  after one customer service agent saying they were simply too busy to talk on the phone and trying to explain what the problem was and how to fix it despite me telling them that i had already tried that and it didn t work  another customer service agent called me and told me they d issue me a refund and then ship it back with a prepaid label after i was able to find a new phone  the phone did work with tmobile  as mentioned by other users  though the fact that the button broke less than a month after i received it was still frustrating  i do appreciate the last customer service agent s help      
337,3.0,                       i bought this for a july gift   it stopped working   months later   it would no longer receive a cellular signal   it took about a week to troubleshoot with the mobile carrier before they said it must be your phone   i took it to a phone repair shop and they said the motherboard crashed        
338,5.0,                       i got this iphone because my daughter had the same phone for years  i wanted to reward her for straight a s and other things too  this is the perfect item to buy  the only complaint is that the charge that came with the phone doesn t work unless you put it at a certain angle  the phone doesn t come with earbuds  which you can buy separately with no problem at all  i really recommend this item      
339,4.0,                       i ordered from trademore to get a refurbished iphone    and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest ios version installed  all i needed to do was add in my sim chip and sign on with my apple id  and icloud backup restore did the rest  the unit i received works like new and was actually flat  as opposed to some other refurbs i ve had   it had some scratching on the glass  but not over the actual display area  trademore and amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere  but it s worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas      
340,1.0,                    muy malo  no coge la se al en ninguna parte  solo para llamar a alguien se queda pensando por un buen tiempo y si quiere agarra se al o sino no  p simo celular    very bad   it does not pick up the signal anywhere   just to call someone  he thinks for a good time and if he wants to  he gets a signal or else he does not   terrible cell        
341,4.0,                       though it is refurbished  i am very surprised to it s condition it looks like it has never been used also for people who are looking in the review section yes it is unlocked  i am also very pleased to see an warranty inside the box   if they gave me an option to pay more  for a screen protector  case  earbuds  and sim card remover tool that would be perfect  ps they are legit       
342,5.0,                       i put   stars on the battery because indeed the battery on the iphone   is not very good  when the phone arrived  the battery quality was      i contacted the seller  kiss eletronics inc  and told him about my concerns  and they answered me super quick and solved my issue about it  there are some marks on the back  back nothing that a case can t cover  but overall it is an awesome product and the best thing is the support that this seller gives to you      
343,3.0,                       arrived a day early which is usually nice  but i planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date  it had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must ve been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen  i didn t like it in this condition  so i returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that      
344,4.0,                       important manufacture update at the bottom    only reason i didn t give it five stars just got this product today  came in perfect condition  honestly way beyond my expectation  all the buttons work  the silent loud switch is in good condition  can visibly see it a little worn  but it works fine  so far nothing wrong with this phone  i m really happy and satisfied with this iphone  there s nothing wrong cosmetically or with the functionality of the phone one week update battery works      fine  definitly an upgrade from my previous iphone    still an iphone battery  will last all day  but dont expect more also important   this is a china made phone  they do have restrictions on the shutter sound on the camera   there is no muting it with the phone on or off silent mode  the only way to take a silent photo is using the  live  photo mode in the camera  it will still make a little  beep  when finished capturing  its one minor flaw to get such a good phone at a decent price  third party camera apps still can t get rid of the shutter sound  so its just one thing to keep in mind before buying this phone      
345,1.0,                       wi fi button doesn t work  so you can t connect to wi fi even after restarting the phone  battery shows different digits every minute from charged     to    in just a minute  the phone would turn off and on by itself  after purchasing this item i sent it back and got a refund  although after about a month my card was charged      from amazon and i didn t make this purchase  this phone was the only item i used the card for this website  so yeah terrible phone and possible fraud on the card from this account      
346,5.0,                       wore out my iphone  s to its death      loved that phone and didn t want to spend a lot to replace it  bought this  got a hundred dollars off for getting a amazon credit card and boom it was pretty cheap at     bucks   it was the same size as the  s but more memory and feels faster  i don t get the latest and greatest  family of   needs bargains  phone had over     battery health and zero scratches  every is positive about this purchase      
347,3.0,                       it was indeed an a      which worked fine for cdma  however mywit seemed like they sent me a seller refurbished and not apple refurbished  also it was almost immediately malfunctioning and needed to be returned      
348,1.0,                       this product was offered from an amazon retailer breed products   the phone was stated to be at least     battery life   this one was       i have attempted contact at least   times regarding this issue and have received zero response   i am disappointed   think twice before buying a product from them      
349,4.0,                       so at first i was  a bit skeptical because of all the old reviews but the phone seams to be working grate  i have tested everything and it all works  the only problem i ve had is when i put my att sim card in it would not receive data  a error message would come up and say that it could not activate cellular data  found out after i called att that when i put my sim in it wasn t updating my imei number on my account  it was still using my old phones imei number but once i got that fixed it works like a charm  another thing i dont like is it comes with a screen protector already on the phone  and my only concern for that is if its getting shipped in hot weather the screen might heat up and the protector getting missed a line  then when you get the phone its already hardened again and then you have to try to find away to get it re a lined  but other then those two things its a good phone  comes with power block  sim tool  and charger      
350,5.0,                    el producto lleg  durante los d as pautados y era lo esperado  la vida  til de la bater a es media  pero lo correcto considerando que es un producto usado        
351,1.0,                       i don t normally write negative reviews  because i understand mistakes get made  but this is a different story  i ordered a    gb jet black iphone    when it arrived   days later it was actually a    gb rose gold iphone    not a huge problem  because i just needed a cheap ish phone to replace my old iphone that broke  nd issue  the battery showed at     usable life and needed to be serviced  according to the amazon renewed information  all phones will be shipped with a minimum of     usable battery remaining  literally holds a charge for about an hour or two  rd issue  discovered a dead spot on the screen at the bottom right in the middle  making it impossible to select anything  again  amazon renewed states all phones are inspected and in full working order  missing a large dead spot on the screen makes it seem like the phone was not inspected at all beware buying amazon renewed  i was given piece of mind by the guarantees laid out in the quality of the phones  however the reality is that is just not the case      
352,1.0,                       iphone   was a good phone  until the software crashed for no reason  apple  scammers they have become  pushed an update that caused my phone to go into recovery mode  after days of trouble shooting and discussing with apple   i still have no phone  apple would like me to pay      and hour to asses the hardware   software of the phone  they have stated this phone was most likely not refurbished correctly  and this is why it died out of no where   either hardware not from apple was used  hardware was damaged   still refurbished  so  buyer beware  these  refurbished  phones may not actually work for any reasonable length of time to be clear  this phone was      functional with no issues until  it could not take the update   restore  it had been in a lifeproof case since leaving the sellers box  no damage of any kind      
353,5.0,                       these come cosmetically perfect and work really well  i get mine from buyspry and havent been disappointed yet all phones i bought in the last   years were refurbished unlocked phones  i have had some sellers shipping poor quality products that i have promptly returned once you find that good seller that ships you a proper refurbished phone sticknwith them and let others know      
354,1.0,                       i never write reviews but customers  beware  i just ordered an iphone   from this seller  and the noise on my phone when i make calls does not work   specifically  phone calls only work when i put the call on speaker so if i do not have the speaker on  i cannot hear the person at all   but for some reason  they can hear me no matter what  i have tried restarting my phone  playing with volume  resetting my phone  and doing everything in the books to try and fix this  but the phone clearly arrived broken  i want a refund and a different phone      
355,2.0,                       didn t come with any kind of paperwork and it s working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times      
356,5.0,                       i was very worried about the reviews but i saw it was sold by verizon so i give it a try and i very glad i did i like my iphone ii doesn t have any scratch at all looks brand new     
357,5.0,                       great gift for my younger brother  everything runs as smooth as a new iphone he has been using it for about a year now  havent had a problem yet so its good      
358,5.0,                       the phone works very well  it s almost like a brand new phone my dad loves it  i recommend this product      
359,5.0,                       bought two  one for me and one for my teenager  as advertised  solid battery life  good condition  quick visit to the local at t store once they arrived     each for sim cards and our numbers were quickly ported over  no problems after months of use  happy i saved so much buying quality refurbished phones instead of laying out too much for new ones      
360,1.0,                       scammers  the phone only lasted six months and they will give you the run around for a replacement  i bought the insurance  and still had to pay     not for a replacement  but in order for them to refund my money because they  don t have the inventory  save your money  save your time  full of crap      
361,5.0,                       the phone came with a screen protector which i wasn t expecting so that was a bonus   the only negative thing i would have to say is that the volume when making calls is not as loud as i would like it to be but it is something i can deal with   everything else seems to be working great      
362,5.0,                       older  but is working like a charm  and good storage capacity too  i just recommended to a friend      
363,5.0,                       i was a little bit nervous to order this online sight unseen but we got lucky and everwe was a little bit nervous to be ordering this online site unseen  but we got lucky and everything was as expected went as we hoped   if you do you  homework and make sure you re buying one that works with your carrier  all should go well     
364,5.0,                       i brought this as an early christmas gift for my husband  this phone came earlier than the estimated shipping  i also think the cost was inexpensive  the condition was great  no complaints from either one of us  my husband loves his phone and now on team apple  i will definitely be purchasing again when it s time for an upgrade     
365,3.0,                       the phone was in excellent condition  however  it did not work on verizon s network even though the description says it was unlocked for all networks  sending it back      
366,1.0,                       just over   months after purchase  product stopped connecting to phone lines  i can no longer place or receive calls  apple allowed me to send in the phone and determined it had been improperly tampered with to unlock from prior carrier  so it is now useless   gm deals has a policy of no returns  refunds  or replacement after   months  fixed   or more accurately  broken  to allow temporary use on another carrier  just enough to get my money and refuse return  but not really fixed  apparently was originally verizon phone altered by amazon seller gm deals  without apple authorization  to be t mobile ready  but the alteration didn t hold and broke the phone i ve bought plenty of used phones through amazon  not refurbished   but never again  pushed me to do some research though  so grateful for that  never again trusting amazon sellers  refurbished phones  going to backmarket com from here on out     months   but also avoid gm deals phones there      
367,4.0,                       i was a bit nervous about buying this phone since the reviews seemed to be hit or miss but i decided to give it a shot  so far everything about it works great  it has a bit more scratches to the body than i thought it would but i keep a case on it all the time so it s not bad  i haven t tried to put service on it yet so i might have to update this review when i do but so far its great      
368,3.0,                       the shipping was faster than expected  but i wish i would have read more in depth before purchasing  i have bought refurbished phones before that worked great but this has very poor battery life i charged to      and within   hours my battery was dead and i didn t realize it would come with so many scratches      
369,1.0,                       i ve owed the product for over a month or two this product is clearly used  it s not even shipped in the original box  often the phone is still dirty as if is was just taking out of the phone case for years  the cord is not iphone original some weird off brand  ashley   the speaker for phone calls must have been damaged i can t hear much  i resort to speaker a lot unforcefully  which leaves no room for privacy  the touch screen is iffy  not sure if it the phone case and or the new abilities with the    touch sensitive   either way it doesn t always respond to my finger  or it ll erase what i just typed in     maybe the previous owner allowed water damage  there no prier info on these phones either  which would be greatly appreciated  lastly the home screen  button  clicks when i just touch the bottom parts of my phone  i don t know ppl this was supposed to be my new forever phone  unfortunately with the prier damage i ll have to buy another phone in the next year to come       is not a joke right now in our times      
370,2.0,                       i recieved the phone on the correct date  when i started the phone everything seemed perfect until i got to the part where i needed to put my information in and the screen stopped working  it was so weird cuz it was just working and letting me push buttons and then it just stopped  sent it back to get a refund and now getting one from ebay  cheaper and better quality      
371,1.0,                       like new  great processing system    no headphones or apple wall piece  but came with temper glass preinstalled   edit          this phone does not connect to a network whatsoever  we were able to use this phone for   week when first purchased  following that the network is down  needing computer updating  did it  and still to no avail       
372,1.0,                       i highly recomend all of you  not to buy this products to the buyspry seller  its a big fraud  i bouth a cel iphone    fully unlocked and refurbished  the cel works   months  but later i did not work anymore  we don buy cels just for a couple of months  i wrote them about this issue and they answered that the warranty period was    days  in this pandemic time  in el salvador  all was closed since    march  the cell displays a message and no technicians have could to solve it  the cel does not call and receive  so i feel cheated  and warmed all of you about this seller  amazon should take care about them  because i have seen other bad reviews     
373,5.0,                       first  seller did a great job and i think i got a good price for an iphone    i just think all cell phones are way way way too expensive  when a cell phone costs more than a good laptop computer that is too expensive   second all smart phones have horrible battery life   apple s iphones are no exception   there is a mode on the iphone   to allow for an extended battery life setting   but i see no difference between the extended setting and the normal setting   i do not use my phone except for emergencies so i would expect the phone to last     days between charging  but i am averaging     days between charging   i am having an issue that the wifi doesn t see both of my wireless networks  dual band router   seller tried to help but apple s support said if it sees a network that s all they care about   phone appears to be working fine and so far i am happy with it      
374,1.0,                       got this phone thinking it would be refurbished  like brand new  iphone   because they re my fav model due to the size  but the battery was bad and the phone would shut off at anywhere from        and have trouble turning back on  but when it did come back on it would be in the red and need charged immediately  not what you d expect in paying      or more for an iphone    i have sent in to return the phone  so we ll see if i get my full refund   if so i ll update the review for sure  but at this point it s just been a hassle  i d like to say if the battery would ve been good  the rest of the phone was flawless and i loved it      
375,5.0,                       i was nervous upon buying this however it did not disappoint  the phone was in perfect condition  however did not come with the original charger  there was no damage  works perfectly and doesn t seem to have any functioning issues      
376,4.0,                       i m very picky with my phone cases which means i keep buying them until i find one that s jut right  this phone case has everything i m looking for  it s not to bulky and has a slim fit  it s enclosed and has a built in screen protector  the front plastic trim doesn t cover top and bottom front of the like some cases making the screen  appear  smaller the rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over time one reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out  well this is not a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier  i m wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the  st place  are you bathing with it  tip  instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up  try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself  just enough to coat it  then use that to clean the screen another reviewer stated the back falls off  if you don t snap it in correctly this will happen  solution  go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape  it s very thin and extremely strong  it will keep that back on if it s a defect      
377,4.0,                       i didn t like the box that it came with  otherwise it was in a very good condition      
378,5.0,                       i will buy from this vendor in the future  phone came full day early  neatly and securely packed with instructions for returns  and a usb wall charger and lightning cord  not any sign of use either  looks like new  i put my mintmobile sim card in and have not had any problems  the battery health shows     in settings  says battery severly impaired  not a problem  very reasonable price and service as good as it gets      
379,1.0,                       this was certified as refurbished  however it has been junk since i received it  i tried for many weeks to give it a chance  updating it and resetting it but the phone would lock up from time to time  usually once a day  and you couldn t do anything with it  it would restart and flash the apple logo over and over and eventually would come back on  i returned the item  not worth dealing with      
380,5.0,                       i really liked on how bright it was  i used to have a iphone  s and the iphone   is just way better in my own opinion for the value and money  even though it did remove the headphone jack  i was able to buy a dongle for   bucks at walmart or i could get one on amazon kinda of a disadvantage      
381,1.0,                       i bought this and can t even use it because at t said that whoever owned this iphone hasn t made all their installments on their plan aka never paid for the whole thing and they try and make you pay off the remaining balance what a joke      
382,2.0,                       phone seemed to be in excellent condition until i put it on the charger to start syncing my icloud  the phone immediately ran extra hot to the touch  i had a   before that did same thing bc something was wrong with it  then screen wouldn t touch properly  common issue with this model and why i got rid of my last    returned it immediately and was refunded very quickly  seems like a decent seller but needs better quality checks on refurbs      
383,1.0,                       according to the product description   fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice  e g  at t  t mobile  sprint  verizon  us cellular  cricket  metro  etc     that is not true  tried to swap out phone with sprint  why would i use the sprint network    that is a question i am asking myself as well  terrible coverage and terrible customer service but that is a separate topic  and for the record  i m not a negative person  i have nothing but positive things to say about verizon where i have my business line   anyway  frustrating experience to get a phone that is not unlocked to any carrier as advertised and now have to go through the return process and find a new phone  based on other reviews it appears this would work with at t or t mobile  the phone did arrive in great condition and if i was using this as a decoration or ornament i would certainly keep it  but as i would prefer to use it to text and make phone calls  i will be returning it      
384,5.0,                       i love everything about this phone from the design to the specs internally  initially i was skeptical about placing an order for a phone that was preowned or had faults possibly  thought i am not necessary interested in the superficiality of being the first owner either  the phone feels new and personal  i am really attach to phones the way i am with this iphone s   the only fault i have with it is that siri is not as intelligent or as timely as google      
385,1.0,                       the phone was not in good condition as stated and you could barely hear out of it  you could tell it was not refurbished at all  it was just someone s old broken phone        
386,5.0,                       i can t remember if i did a review or not but i bought this phone back in april and in the beginning it was such an issue getting it to work with my network carrier  after wasting a few hard earned dollars  i finally got it working and it s been my favorite iphone yet  considering i ve only hade the      i love everything about this iphone   i love how it vibrates when i do certain things   it s worth it       
387,2.0,                       the iphone isn t fully unlocked and it doesn t accept all carriers  i returned mine within a day because it wasn t compatible with my carrier      
388,1.0,                       it doesn t even work this phone sucks     
389,5.0,                       the phone arrived in fairly pristine condition   performance has been optimal  with no flaws or defects i m pretty psyched with it    great price   and the fact that i m  upgrading  from my iph   to the   means that even though the iph  is several generations behind the most recent x release  it s all still new to me      
390,2.0,                       since i got my iphone   the connector for my charger wasn t working or charging my phone i have bought about   new chargers thinking maybe it was the charger well april         i bought a brand new charger worked for a bit to charge my phone after it stopped working i have no phone again is ther anyway i can resend this iphone maybe get another one iphone   or what exactly do i do in this condition      
391,1.0,                       biggest scam ive ever seen  phone is locked      
392,2.0,                       ordered   phones  each came from a different seller  each had low battery health         and      one of the phone came with    gb storage  whatever  device repair shop has them at     for battery replacement  so the phone end up costing almost           minus tax      
393,3.0,                       the iphone gets a  no service  status too often  no reason  since the first test  with my simcard allocated correctly and working perfectly in a previous phone  this is so frequent that i can t use it  i have gone at my mobile operator to see there were some problem with coverage service and or simcard and it was none  my simcard working normally in other iphone  while other simcard inserted in my iphone have had the same problem      
394,2.0,                       the unlocked phone would not up to my company s system  it kept stating i needed to get an update but the phone was updated to       i returned it for a full refund      
395,1.0,                       i just bought this iphone   unlock  i have made the purchase on the   th of january      and had just received the iphone on   th of january      i ve paid        to clear the phone  when i received the phone it was dead so i put it on charge with the charger that came with the phone and the charger was not working so i had to use an old iphone charger i had here  the phone finally came on for me to set up my icloud  while setting up my icloud it carry me to a page to load all my information so i rest the phone down so it can finish load all my information  when i went back to the phone i noticed that it was turned off so i tried turning it back on with the power button and it did came on so i unplugged the charger and plugged it back in and leave the phone  the phone came back on put my fingerprint on to unlock it and it didn t recognize my fingerprint so tried to put in my passcode and noticed the screen was not working  i emailed the people to put in my complaint before leaving a negative reply and no one replied to my email  i m advising everyone not to waste your hard working money  i had to carry the phone to a technician here to fix it and he told me the screen was not the original screen and had to pay an extra     to get it fix      
396,5.0,                       phone had     battery life  two weeks in works great  battery does deplete faster than the    might be due to the use of wireless headphones   but the screen is bright and beautiful  good purchase      
397,5.0,                       i waited several months before transferring the data from my iphone   plus because i was reluctant to give up its larger screen  but not being able to update its ios convinced me to take the plunge  and i m glad i did  my  new  iphone   was still in the nice box in which it was shipped and was in perfect condition  with newer models going for        i m thrilled to have gotten an upgrade that does everything i need for less than       i definitely recommend techlobby to anyone seeking a good deal      
398,5.0,                       great phone to replace my old phone  amazon delivered quickly  but know that i still prefer going into a store to be able to see the quality of what i want  amazon will never be able to fulfill that  i only purchase on amazon when i can t find what i want in store and then by that point i realize maybe i don t need it      
399,2.0,                       this was a christmas gift for my daughter  she has verizon  we went to   different verizon stores to get her iphone  s switched to this phone  iphone   both stores said that the phone was locked and they were unable to transfer her account  they said it needed to be unlocked by the original carrier  whoever the hell that is   what a headache  we went to my carrier  at t  and crossed our fingers that they would be able to transfer the account  thank goodness they could  because by the time we had an opportunity to get this taken care of our    day guarantee has expired  so all in all  my daughter had to switch carriers in order to get this phone working  it worked out in the end  but it was quite an annoyance getting to that point  the phone itself seems to be working fine at this point  but not enough time has passed to really know that for sure since all this happened today      
400,1.0,                       at first i noticed the phone s touch screen didn t work as well as my iphone    calibration was a little off  sometimes dead spots  i thought maybe it was a quirk of having a lot of apps transferred over so i just lived with it  then i dropped it once  not a big drop  the screen didn t break  but afterwards the vibration became unacceptably loud  then the second time i dropped it the screen cracked  seeing as this was the result of my own clumsiness i ordered a new screen and vibration unit and went to work repairing it  when i opened it i noticed a screw was missing on the existing vibration unit  it became apparent this phone wasn t just a repackaged return  it had significant and sloppy repairs done to it after that i wound up getting a brand new phone of the exact same specs  iphone      g and it is like night and day  the brand new phone only cost      more than this piece of junk  i will never buy another refurbished phone again      
401,1.0,                       this phone was great for a while  after     months it died while it was on the charger  i tried a soft reset and could hear it trying to reset  but just kept turning off and on with the apple flashing for   days straight  i took it to a phone repair place and they said there was no hope don t order a phone from them  you ll waste money on a phone that will last just as long as the time in which you can no longer get a refund  not reccommended     
402,5.0,                       bought this item after my iphone   got water damage  didn t want to spend a lot on a brand new iphone  the reviews were kind worry some but i have had no issues  i have at t and just had to swap out my sim cards and set it up like a new iphone  over a month with no issues      
403,5.0,                       my daughter loves her new phone  and it is a apple  made good no damage when she got it has great sound and i put a good screen protecter on it and a good case to protect it and i called track phone to see what service they have in are area it only cost a dollor to buy the sim card from them get fast and you can buy cheap plands from over phone      
404,5.0,                       i got this phone for my dad and we live in the caribbean   i was honestly nervous because some reviews would say that the phone wont work with certain mobile companies but it arrived on time   it is practically new no scratches or dents  it came with a screen protector already  the phone battery life is at     so pretty good  the best part is it works with the local phone company all in all a very good deal     
405,5.0,                       ordered this phone and so far it has been working wonderfully   it is a refurbished phone but it looks new and in perfect cosmetic quality   grandson was so happy to receive before christmas   thank you      
406,5.0,                       i love the whole thing  some of the reviews were scaring me but i got it and it works perfectly with my verizon network  the battery is good and in all it s in perfect condition        
407,4.0,                    peque os escraches despu s todo bien        
408,2.0,                       i m returning this item as the battery from the get go did not last long at all  it would be at     after using it for an hour or two  it would also do weird things like be at      then i d turn it off and then back on and it would be at      it sometimes will shut off when the battery is at      the last thing it started doing was the touch screen doesn t work sometimes and sometimes it scrolls or zooms in when i m not even touching the screen at all  i ve heard that can happen from having a battery that is expanding and it somehow effects the touchscreen      
409,4.0,                       it s a good phone and in good condition   wish the battery life wasn t down to     like it is  but it still works     
410,5.0,                       i had been wanting a rose gold iphone for years  at first i was gonna go with the  s because it has the headphone jack  but the battery was the only issue for me  the  s plus has a bigger battery but then i decided on more updated  hoping it wouldn t be more than       after hours of searching  i found this one  iphone    rose gold     gb  for       i went through the reviews of the seller  more good than bad  so i ordered it  ordered on friday  delivery for thursday  but it came a day early  i was happy   even though i had to deal with fedex because of delivery issue    i was nervous that i would get a beat up phone and that the battery would be horrible and that i was gonna have to send it back  but it came with an     battery capacity  which i was surprised  it has a few scratches that are very small but can be covered with a case  i didn t see any scratches on the apple logo  the screen has no scratches  i just put a screen protector on it  the charging brick looks new lol  but the charging cord is the original and brand new because it came in its original packaging  overall a great buy for those who give negative reviews about minor scratches on the screen or huge scratches  dents  or breaks or it s popping up no matter how many times you pop it back in  or the charging port isn t working just send the phone back or ask for a refund  for minor scratches around the edges or the back just put a case on      
411,2.0,                       i bought this phone on          today it is          the battery was never great but i could live with it  for the last month it has been getting worse and worse and of course i m out of the    day warranty period  at first i thought maybe an update would fix it  nope  maybe background apps are sucking my battery  nope  hotspot usage  bluetooth  no  the battery just sucks  it gets down to about     and it dies  it dies suddenly and without apparent cause  something happens around     to make it drain quickly to    it doesn t even warn me that the power is low  when i bought the iphone  the max capacity was      now it s      gr      
412,1.0,                       item froze up during setup repeatedly tmobile said they think that it had not been deregistered with apple     
413,5.0,                       i recieved this phone the next day after ordering and it came today just as expected  doesn t come in orginal box or with any of the adapters and headphones but it comes with a sim card slot tool and an off brand charger  you can get lightning adapters and other accesories cheap online anyway  i got mine for     and a glass screen protector and popsocket to go with my new phone  it s unlocked  i have straight talk and got my service up and running with the phone activation kit and kept my old number and everything  appearence wise it s in perfect condition  no scratches  dents or issues  started up immediately with half battery life  would reccomend this product if you want a      discount as opposed to buying new from apple      
414,1.0,                       personal hotspot  wifi wireless network  and the mobile phone is very hot during use  sometimes the mobile phone suddenly shuts down  when i long press the power button  sometimes it won t turn on    you covered up the flaws in the internal hardware of the phone with the perfect battery and perfect appearance     
415,4.0,                       after a month s use everything seems to be working as promised and expected  the reason why only   stars were given is that the finger print touch id works sporadically  my previous iphone   worked every time with touch id but this one seems to have issues  i m not sure if it can be re calibrated  i will try to do so and if things change one way or another i will update the rating      
416,1.0,                       horrible    went to the store to activate phone only to find out it was reported as stolen  does not come in original box nor with original accessories  only thin received was phone a cable and charger box     
417,3.0,                       i bought this from buyspry in september       the battery was just    higher than the cut off limit for the free battery replacement from apple  until the first week of       when the battery replacement wouldn t be free anymore   now  april        it s at     max capacity and doesn t last for long after just casual use it arrived with a little chip out of the side near the volume buttons  it s just cosmetic but it still irks me the screen is also starting to mess up  it doesn t always sense when i swipe across the screen to answer a call or when i type so now i m going to be down another     at least to get another digitizer and battery i gave it   stars for value for money because i m still not sure if it would ve been easier and cheaper in the long run to just buy new      
418,3.0,                       just got the phone for my kid  using tracfone without problem  phone looks like new  not sure about bettery life  but so far so good update cannot use earbuds  take the phone to apple store  the audio data connector is damaged  too bad  the phone looks great      
419,2.0,                       i was really disappointed with my purchase  i am usually not when i buy from amazon  but this time i am  i bought the iphone     not with high expectations  but i was hoping for better  i bought it because i wanted to upgrade from my  s  i m not big on bells and whistles  but i wanted an upgrade  i bought the phone because the battery in my   was dying really fast  i have had the phone for  i think  three years now  and my battery life was terrible  i had to keep it on charger a lot  so  i decided to purchase the    which was planned for about   months  i received it when i was told i was going too and i was pretty excited  i turn it on on the charger and transferred all the data from my    then  when it was all transferred  i noticed that the battery on the   was low  as i have been using it the battery life in the phone is the same as my   and i m constantly having to charge it  on the plus side  i just got and i have    days to return it       i m returning it and getting my money back  it s a great phone otherwise  just battery is terrible  wish it would ve been better  but nope  i may just buy a new battery for iphone  s from amazon and put it in my six and see how that work instead of getting another one      
420,4.0,                       ordered this phone for my daughter and it came quickly  the phone was in very good condition  she got it set up and started using it  she noticed that the camera shutter sound wouldn t turn off no matter what she did  after some research we found out it was due to the phones original country of origin and where it was made for  the japan and korean market requires that sound to be on when taking a photo  there was no way to change it  it wasn t a defect in the phone  rather a feature we didn t want  i contacted the seller and returned the phone for a full refund      
421,3.0,                       the phone is over all nice  however  i ordered the excellent condition iphone      gb which unfortunately it s not excellent  there were massive amounts of dings   scratches all over the sides   back  the paint is badly scratched   they aren t extremely noticeable unless you look for them because i put a case on it  however  when i ordered excellent i expected excellent   with the price  i should have gotten what i paid for   unfortunately i did not   there are no scratches on the front where the screen is or on the camera but it s the principle  battery life is at       my husband will make due  thanks        
422,4.0,                         stars because the packaging was kinda sparce  almost concerned of damage  when i opened it   but  these guys must know what they re doing because the product i received was excellent    hard to believe it was used   battery life is       no scratches on the casing or screen  actually had a screen protector on it   exactly what i wanted  thanks and i will definitely look to  buy from this vendor again      
423,5.0,                       i received the phone a day earlier than expected  i have had it for two days now  and it has worked beautifully  there were no blemishes on it at all  and it came with a screen protector  it was easy to transfer data from my old phone as well as move the sim card from my old phone to this one   i had a wonderful experience with this seller and product  hopefully it will keep performing well      
424,5.0,                       we cannot use this phone and need to return it to apple to see if they can fix it  i have never had an issue like this before      
425,1.0,                       i m highly annoyed  i have an iphone   at the moment and it is completely shattered  so i got this phone to replace it only for it to be locked by at t which is fine except when we go to unlock it  which mind you should be free  there was      owed on the phone  that s almost       for the phone because it s      to buy  such a scam      
426,1.0,                       after about a month of use phone started acting up  when phone would ring the screen wouldn t come on for my answer the phone screen it would stay on my home screen  apps keep shutting off  have to rebut at least once a day  words are on top of each other  freezes up      
427,1.0,                       waited awhile to review this  product is advertised as fully unlocked and compatible with several carriers including verizon  mine wasn t  tried online  took it to closest verizon store guy there said it was not compatible and that the phone was locked possibly due to it not being paid for by previous owner or it could be stolen  spent   hours on phone with verizon customer service  they could not even find the phone  ok bust  got return label  erased phone back to factory reset  took it off my icloud  mailed to cts warehouse  they refund      the money and i then went to amazon guarantee process  short story cts said the phone was icloud locked and would only refund the remainder if i gave them my icloud password  that was not going to happen  so  after several attempts and emails  my iphone savy wife tried the  find my iphone   which it did  we erased data and removed from icloud account there as well  then got the rest of my money back   my beef is  instead of asking for my icloud password  which made me very suspicious   they could have sent me instructions on what they wanted to do in my icloud account and i would have taken care of it   the guy told me i sent them back a usless brick  true but i was returning the brick they sent me   so while we worked it out finally  their attitude was business only  like it was my fault  they never did reply to why the phone wouldn t activate ps  wife ordered another refurbished phone from another vendor  worked no problems      
428,1.0,                       i waited several days for this item to arrive  i received it today and the phone won t charge  i tried four different cables and different wall mounts and nothing works  i took it to an at t store and they confirmed either the charging port or battery was bad  i m so very disappointed   this item was marketed as an  amazon renewed  product that they verified worked like new  i was already unsure about ordering a used cell phone from amazon and this just confirms my suspicion      
429,3.0,                       received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in  shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cable phone came with one long deep scratch  a cracked home button  and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches  enough that it was off putting for me  battery life showed     which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with it phone was unlocked as stated and i had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away  overall a decent phone but i will be returning it because of the the cracked touch id button and deep scratches     
430,3.0,                       my phone works well  touch screen responsive  there were a few small chips on the sides of the phone by the speaker and near the volume buttons  the back of the phone however  was nowhere near excellent conditions and frankly a bit disappointing  i keep it in a case anyway so that part of the phone is not displayed  all in all the phone part of it is    out of    but the outside body of the phone is a hard six      
431,5.0,                       iphone works great with t mobile and keeps a good charge screen is clear and good no blemishes  touch works just fine  good replacement     
432,1.0,                       unusable model number  this is the second time i ve had this issue  it seems to me sending out foreign phones should be considered a scam      
433,5.0,                       always go with the refurbished phones on amazon  good value for the money  nice phone  works well  better camera  i did not like that for it being refurbished that a brand new battery was not installed  it did have     life but i think that a new battery should always be part of the refurbishing  it should come with      life  otherwise no complaints     
434,3.0,                       the phone is ok am gonna have to get use to some of the things  but the charger was damaged and will not work  am not real sure if i am happy with my purchase or not  the battery goes down real fast  and it doesn t go into a sleep mode      
435,5.0,                       this iphone    is in perfect condition  literally like new phone   my daughter bought her first cellphone few days ago and  she safe penny by penny to bought it so i m so glad that this used cellphone looks and works so good  thank you so much      
436,3.0,                       being a used phone watch out for battery life the batteries are not changed out on used phones so they won t have the normal battery life      
437,5.0,                       everything is working great  but the camera isn t working well  but i snapchat no worries about normal pictures     
438,5.0,                       so far so good   case and glass were perfect   not anyscratchesat all     
439,5.0,                       extremely affordable price especially for   of the    gb memory storage  ilmy sister was just going to buy me one as a gift but when i noticed the price for   she said that was a deal and may not find it anywhere else when the phones arrived they were very well packaged and even included a small tool to be able to open the sim card location that was a plus and thoughtful add recommend this sell for everyone      
440,1.0,                       horrible battery  at      at  am   and by    am is at      would never buy again  nor do i recommend      
441,1.0,                       i bought a refurbished iphone   in september  it worked great for   or so months  then the first week of january  the battery stopped working entirely  it was in a life proof case for it s entire life  never got wet  never got dropped  just one day decided to only charge to    and die immediately after being unplugged yes  i ve tried different charger bases  cables  etc  the batteries they use to refurbish these things must just be very low quality  there is absolutely no reason for a battery to go out like that  conveniently a couple weeks after the return window closed      
442,5.0,                       size is much bigger than my last phone which makes it less practical and bulky  however operation  speed  features  voice clarity  camera  etc   is far superior to my old phone      
443,1.0,                       don t buy it    great price  i know  but after about a day and a half of it being in use  it completely stopped picking up signal  it now just says  searching  on the top left  i tried everything i could  including bringing it to the t mobile store  there is absolutely nothing that can be done to fix it and i have to return it  total waste of time and money      
444,5.0,                       it fits perfectly in my hands got ample amount of storage  one problem my iphone series a something does not accept apples update it made my phone inoperable had to seek further assistance  now it is perfect      
445,2.0,                       the iphone was clean and in good shape but it was not fully unlocked therefore i waisted a whole afternoon trying to get it activeted  i called and there was nothing you where able to do for me no exchange available  very disappointed     
446,5.0,                       it is has been an excellent phone so far it looked like it was brand new it works flawlessly my wife loves it we bought a watch to pair with it and she s hooked on apple i phone  we had ipods and etc for years but the phones we re not really affordable for the way we use our phones it s very fast and easy to operate i will likely buy one on the plus size sometime this year the phone is that nice it operates with any provider  it was totally unlocked   the price was fair  packaging was great the only thing you might need is a headphone   jack wire as the refurbished one we bought does not supply one  they cost about   bucks for a  good one      
447,2.0,                       i loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it  however  i got a message saying my sim card could not be read  turns out that this is a known iphone mistake when iphones are built  when i brought it to the apple store they said that because it was originally made in japan they could not fix it or send me a new one  i am now out for a new phone  however it worked very well when it did  i just wouldn t risk it      
448,2.0,                       the phone has a deep visible scratch back and forth across the upper bezel that ends an eighth of an inch into the screen  definitely visible from     inches away  and definitely does not  look like new   any defect that directly effects the screen is not a minor cosmetic defect  the screen is main way of interacting with the device and it will effect watching movies amazon states   amazon renewed is your trusted destination for pre owned and refurbished products that are inspected and tested to work and look like new   and  the products will have minimal to no signs of wear  no visible cosmetic imperfections when held    inches away         this is not the case      
449,5.0,                       the phone works amazing i got it about a week ago and i havent had a problem with it the battery health was at      and the phone does not get hot what so ever i would for sure buy this if u are looking for a good phone to use     
450,1.0,                       this phone will not hold a charge nor will it backup to your icloud    some of the functions are disabled and will not work with your carrier even though it says it will i received this phone   days ago and it will not hold storage nor stay charge  i needed a phone asap and was hoping this was a temporary fix until i could get the phone i wanted    i have never been so disappointed in a product  amazon should not even allow these products to be sold    it says it was tested by amazon    i highly doubt that  i will be returning this item        
451,5.0,                       replaced my old iphone   with a renewed iphone     arrived looking like brand new   my granddaughter fired it up and it works perfectly   considered a new phone through my carrier  however the renewed phone was much cheaper and works as well as a new phone   i consider my renewed iphone   to be an exceptional value      
452,2.0,                       the iphone looked very good turned on n functionedbut could not activate with straight talk   this  nd iphone i sent backit was supposed be christmas present   i bought my iphone refurbished through amazon n perfect i think depends on whose selling it on amazonunfortunately i can not remember the namebut no hassle return   so received refund     
453,1.0,                       the phone connected to the network only for a few minutes  then mobile network went down with an error advising be to update to latest ios  attempt to update failed  and the phone freezed with a message  verifying update   i tried to update with itunes the phone was up again for a few minutes  then the same problems error messages happened again      
454,1.0,                       i would not recommend this product to anyone  it came scratched  with imitation charger that didn t work  no accessories at all  don t loose you money      
455,3.0,                       the phone was nice with no outside damage   however  the microphone did not work unless the phone was connected to a bluetooth speaker   this being said  i was unable to make or receive phone calls  i could not hear the other person  nor could they hear me   siri did not work  and voice keyboard did not work   the only form of communication i was able to use was through text message   therefore  i had to return this phone for a refund   i was rather disappointed because i was really looking forward to having a new phone   i have bought all of my iphones refurbished from amazon  and this was the one time i had received a major let down      
456,1.0,                       the phone only worked for one day after purchase  i installed the updates and set my phone up after hours and hours of time to do so  then the cellular function stopped working due to a critcal error   so  i had no way to use my phone without wifi  also  i was annoyed that the phone came pre installed with seller s app instead being able to turn it on from a factory reset  i returned the phone and purchased a one from a different seller      
457,2.0,                       the phone we had received came in excellent condition  no signs of wear and tear  the battery health was great  about      and everything worked on the phone except for cell service  even though the listing said it was for verizon  we took to a store and it would not work  even when they put in a new sim card  the verizon worker even said it could have been a antenna issue   luckily  we were able to return it and get a full refund  i would not recommended buying this phone      
458,1.0,                       don t buy from kanga supply  i bought this phone under a year ago  phone has a factory defect and won t work  so convenient that it happened when the return period is over  because i m not the original purchaser apple won t fix   not a bit happy not sure i d risk purchasing this if i were you      
459,5.0,                       i purchased the iphone   as a christmas gift for my grandson  i looked for a seller with a high customer satisfaction rating and purchased from hybrid it who had a     customer satisfaction rating  the phone looked brand new  not a scratch on it  all functions worked perfectly and battery health is      i am very satisfied with my purchase      
460,1.0,                       i ordered this iphone and immediately noticed that the battery dies within an hour   while only listening to music  i tested it multiple times over the next few days  and it rapidly died each time the seller states to email and call before leaving a negative review   i must have called     times  and i emailed  but no answers  i m returning the product and definitely expect a refund  i ordered from another seller      
461,2.0,                       when i got my phone the battery capacity was at      it s been a good three months with semi decent performance  it had several glitches and quirks but i could deal with it  unfortunately i need to replace the phone now because the screen constantly glitches and won t even let me type  i think the screen wasn t attached right  it s a lazy refurbishing job  go somewhere else to buy your next phone      
462,1.0,                       phone currently not working due to a hardware issue in it  it just shuts off when it feels like and disconnects cellular service telling me error in the cellular settings  currently saying no service and the signal bars just searching for a signal when i have a fully paid cell phone bill  apple care said it s a hardware issue  can t even reset network settings to try and fix  everything is frozen when doing that  bought this phone in june       battery goes from    to     in an hour or so  i m a maintenance tech on call and can t rely on this refurbished phone and luckily best buy had stocked phones  waiting on my refund now  contacted them this week still no responseupdate  been a few weeks and still waiting  they never contacted amazon back either and amazon has been unhelpful as well  they finally got me a return label  they re sending the piece of junk phone back to this company  terrible and they haven t removed this company from the vendor list yet talked to multiple supervisors and representatives with little help  because it s third party they couldn t help much they need to update those policy to be able to refund customers especially after waiting     weeks for any response  i had to call they submitted a to z claims but every new representative couldn t find the claim info      
463,5.0,                       i thought it was gonna show up damaged or something honestly cuz i never buy electronics on here but this phone is the best thing i ve ever bought on here thank you guys it s cost efficient and works properly i m so happy i took a chance     
464,1.0,                       this is my first refurbished phone i ve purchased  unfortunately  the battery is not holding a charge  therefore not much use unless it s tethered to an energy source      
465,3.0,                       so i ve bought a refurbished phone before but at times you end up unlucky with them and this was the case for me  i came back from europe to lose my iphone  s  straight up disappeared and i wa alike alright it s strsight no worries  it s just a phone  till you realize you have everythinggg in your phone  anyway i ordered the     gb iphone   for only      it came in the mail within a couple of days  the moment i booted it up w a sim card the message popped up  cellular update failure  so my phone wouldn t receive texts or etc  it disappeared after an hour so i was like okay no worries  it popped up again and stayed liked that for   days after so i sent in to apple for a diagnosis  they said that the first generation iphones when upgraded to ios     somehow the sim card doesn t come in contact the cellular module which doesn t allow for connection  they mentioned something with soldering too might be weak but yeah  only the first generation iphone   have this issue  ended up buying the iphone xr          
466,1.0,                       i would check   stars if that was a option  first phone arrived   wouldn t connect to the network   was told it needed a apple update  spent     getting that and that wasn t the issue there was a problem with the chip   amazon was great as usual getting a replacement   the replacement connects in and out of wifi  and the speakers don t work so round   returning  will not be replacing through this seller       
467,1.0,                       this product s battery life has always been unsatisfactory  but since i ve been home during the pandemic it hasn t been too much of an issue  however  the headphone jack of the phone stopped working randomly  no drops or damage  about    months after purchase  as that was one of my primary uses for this phone  it has now rendered this phone mostly useless  disappointing      
468,4.0,                       i ordered this iphone   locked to at t network to replace my iphone    i am completely satisfied as if it was brand new  i only saw one little scratch in the screen but it s so light you can t even see it unless the phone is off      
469,1.0,                       this phone was advertised as an att unlocked phone   att had no record of this phone on their network   i contacted apple and they identified this iphone as being assigned to a japanese cell carrier   since the phone is not unlocked  the sim card does not work and the phone is useless be very leery of this company   the phones sold on here are possibly fraudulent or stolen   i have flagged the purchase with my credit card company and am returning the item to amazon      
470,5.0,                       seems to be in very good condition   battery was around       functions as expected      
471,5.0,                       being honest about my review  this product is incredible  it is the same as the description  excellent quality and the seller sent it quickly  thanks     
472,5.0,                       this was purchased for my husband who wanted a smaller size phone  comparable in size to his previous iphone  s  he really likes it  so we re very happy with this refurbished phone   really like the reduced price too compared to the cost of a new phone      
473,3.0,                       phone worked great for about   months  then it stopped connecting to the cellular service  trying to update it and the phone says that i can t  called apple support and they can t do anything since phone is no longer under warranty      
474,5.0,                       so far so good bought refurbished iphone     gb from ekings i received this product within a week  it came in a plain white box  it did come with brand new apple charger  the phone looks brand new  no scratches  the screen and back have a protective film on it which i appreciate  so far from what i have tried everything works  i did notice a little dust in the charger port and speaker area but that s no big deal  i did notice the phone got hot when i used an off brand charger i will try to update this post in a month or two      
475,5.0,                       showed up on time through amazon  phone looks perfect out of the box  in the box i also got a charger cord and charger block for the wall  i was able to take the phone into t mobile right away and they added it to my plan with no problem  no issues so far      
476,5.0,                       i m cheap   that s why i was in the market for a  renewed  iphone   i m not a phone junkie  i don t need the newest tech   i simply wanted a cellular phone that was reliable and would be supported  reliably  for the next couple of years   android phones have let me down in several ways over the past few years   nothing worth a long tirade  but enough to make me willing to try the ios wish i had done it years ago   value is the biggest point here   for the same price as a brand new        a  e or a stylo   with   gb  i received a like new    gb iphone   unlike the stylo or a  e  it will not need to be replaced in     due to it turning into a nice paper weight   i won t go into greater detail here  my personal arguments for and against are the same as most of you   this is not a debate forum i received the phones   i bought two   within amazon s   day shipping timeframe  even at the height of christmas season   thanks  amazon   they were in great physical shape   no scratches  not even small ones that were noticeable but forgivable   battery was at     on one      on the other  capacity  not charged to    both have been exceptional thus far   have had them and used both for one month at the time of this writing i have had an interaction with the  rd party seller also   long story short  the issue was in an os update  not the actual phone   battery life showed    after a full night s charge   turns out the battery was not draining quickly  the icon had a glitch   fixed easily after exploring apple forums for two minutes   an e mail response was received within   days of notifying the  rd party company  through amazon   the response  essentially  was   have it fixed by a certified apple technician  send us the bill  and we ll be glad to reimburse you    very pleased   will not hesitate to purchase products from this retailer  through amazon  in the future      
477,5.0,                       i refuse to pay for the newer high dollar ones  it might be whatever the others aren t  but it s better than the others companies big boys  that s my frugal opinion  i will not pay hundreds and hundreds  of dollars for a phone  glad they make the newer ones those  that how i got this one at this price  it s the truth  great phone      
478,1.0,                       the phone was in great condition and worked but the camera noise could not be shut off  it appears that the phone came from a country that doesn t allow you to shut off the camera shutter sound  sending it back for replacement  i m hoping the replacement will allow the shutter sound to be turned off      
479,5.0,                       this was was like new  worked great  no issues  the camera on iphone   isn t great in general  so that s a flaw of the product and not from being refurbished  perfect as my son s first phone      
480,1.0,                       advertised as unlocked for all networks  only to have it arrive and have an actually be an at t phone  inaccurate description  they don t know what they are selling or what they are sending     
481,4.0,                       the phone works well it s in great shape i have to get the battery changed it doesn t hold a charge long other then that it works great     
482,5.0,                       came in today  i set it up pretty fast working perfect  my maximum battery capacity is     which is perfect  definitely looking forward to another purchase       
483,2.0,                       wasted time setting up  transfering apps  etc  then found out the charging port had an issue that caused cycling on and off  had to request refund         
484,3.0,                       looked great and performed well during use  unfortunately  phone reported     battery health  while actual battery life was terrible     minutes of talk and phone went from      to         
485,2.0,                       it came in the mail  one day late  i might add  i got it  completely content with my purchase  it looked completely new  no imperfections whatsoever  i set it up  unwrapped everything that came with it and was seeing the different features  as i opened the camera  the front view was perfectly fine  nothing wrong and then i turned the camera to take a picture of the wall to see quality and so forth and it couldn t focus  it was shaking uncontrollably  it was frustrating because my old phone had broken and i needed a new phone asap  i thought  buying this phone that i d have a phone after   days but nope  i ended up returning that and bought another one from the same company   i m hoping that i get lucky with this new one coming but if not  i will be very disappointed in this seller     well more that i already am      
486,2.0,                       product came early  which was great  however  it has a mind of its own  it powers down when in use  it doesn t hold a charge   i plan to return it      
487,5.0,                       iphone   was just like new  no scratches or marks and a very clear screen  great buy  received sooner than scheduled  came with charger and cord  everything works on it and full battery  would buy from this company again   i bought the rose gold      
488,5.0,                       i was apprehensive to purchase a refurbished phone but this one did not disappoint  it was in excellent condition   appeared brand new  it arrived well packaged and with a new charger  not apple  that works just great  no problems with battery life or function  great phone      
489,1.0,                       first off i d like to say the phone was perfect  everything was perfect  it was the color i wanted  the size i wanted  it all worked great  i even activated it with my phone carrier  it worked for a few minutes  connected and all  i even bought my fianc  a phone and activated his  from a different seller   i tried to order a car service and realized that i didn t have service  it started searching and kept saying no service  i took it back to my carrier and they took a look at it again and apparently this is a problem of yours  the phone constantly shuts off on me and it won t connect to any sim card  i m getting my money back   annoyed      
490,1.0,                       this was a terrible product  doesn t work  the phone constantly says no service in the corner and we went back to verizon and they cannot figure out why  so we are returning the iphone    it s a piece of poop      
491,1.0,                       i should have read the reviews before i purchased this phone  many people said the same thing that i experienced   giving it a one star rating  the phone kept shutting down all by itself  and the internet just kept searching and searching and searching  never being able to load  oh well  i m going back to a moto   android  same price  bigger screen  better phone      
492,2.0,                       the screen was scratched at the top left cornerand the back side has  seberal white spots bad condition        
493,4.0,                       great phone  defiantly recommend  it s a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and i can t have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason  it would black out parts of it but i only had that problem with two of my pictures  other than that for a refurbished phone it s pretty good      
494,5.0,                       i ordered this refurbished phone after my previous phone broke and honestly i was so worried to order off amazon  i read other positive reviews and felt a bit better  the true test was actually having my own refurbished phone  i took the phone out of the package and it already had a glass screen protector on it so i was pleasantly surprised  the phone runs so smoothly  with only a few issues here and there  overall  amazing product and i am so satisfied with how it works  great product  thank you  certified refurbished       
495,5.0,                       this seller was awesome the first one i got after ordering didn t work properly after a few days and the seller replaced it quickly and with no issues  both devices i got were nearly brand new as far as looks good and work excellent  i would definitely order from this seller again if i m ever in the market for a new device  as too the device there is nothing wrong with it  operates smoothly and the way you think it should  no complaints at all     
496,5.0,                       the phone was in perfect shape  but it did not work with my xfinity account  uses verizon network   too bad  nice phone  they did a quick refund  about a days turnaround  pretty incredible      
497,5.0,                       phone seems to work well and is fast  arrived looking great  the battery how ever is bad  per the phones battery health the battery is degraded and will not hold a charge  i can not even use it for an hour      
498,1.0,                       i bought an iphone   on july           it just stopped receiving a phone signal since jan          the phone is literally less than half a year old since i purchased it  i tried to contact the seller to see if there is a solution  but i haven t heard anything from him her  really really bad customer service and terrible products he she is selling      
499,5.0,                       worked perfect for metro pcs     
500,1.0,                       revised review  phone stopped working after   months  apparently  its that model of iphone that was recalled  do not buy      
501,5.0,                       i began using smartphones when homeless several yrs ago  either samsung or lg    it was an  obama  phone  or george bush  receiving food stamps made anyone qualified   so having a connection to     was a really important utility  nowadays my smartphone collection has both one refined version of android samsung    another pretty cheap samsung  i guess apple has been known to provide tier   software   updates  so buying my iphone   was because i finally decided an american company  although assembly for iphones takes place largely in china  might handle private data in a more understandable way  software updates for this old version won t last that many more years  but the price of the  renewed  phone is also worth the more exact manufacturing result  the touch screen really is user friendly     anyone will like aluminum cases  android software has a lot of programmers   i don t think they are as easily integrated  samsung needs a lot of user data just to enable you to do some important things with its android  so like windows  each company interfaces with one another easily or not so much  android is better with window tethering for phone apps  but apple is dependable as a stand alone system    works with windows if you re mostly tethering      
502,1.0,                       i bought this phone and within   weeks  the motem had totally failed  which prevented me from getting any service at all  i bought the same phone again through this listing but from a different vendor and had the same result  just spend the extra money to get a brand new phone  these refurbished phones aren t reliable      
503,4.0,                    el tel fono llego en una caja com n  tiene bater a     con funcionamiento maximo   f sicamente tiene s lo los detalles en el lugar donde se enchufa el cargador propios del uso   funciona perfecto  fue una muy buena compra y recomendar a a este vendedor  todo lleg  como dec a en la compra         
504,1.0,                       worst costumer service  contacted them and they just don t want to helpe because    day gap has passed  in spite of pandemic  which is the reasson why i just received the phone  as i was out of the us     
505,1.0,                    compre el tel fono para enviarlo a venezuela y resulta que all  el tel fono no permite actualizaci n en la compa  a telef nica me dicen que tengo que mandarlo de nuevo al comprador a n no s  c mo resolverlo        
506,5.0,                       seems to work pretty good  the button at the bottom does not always work first time     
507,5.0,                       good condition and i just went to walmart and got a straight talk sim card      
508,5.0,                       this phone worked perfectly right out of the box   simply put the sim card from my old phone in and immediately got service   looking at the phone you would never know it was refurbished   no scratches or scuffs at all  overall a great purchase at a great price      
509,5.0,                       seller gave a full refund i m not even going to rate it because we sent the phone back because it kept turning itself off and on  we could never get it to stop doing that to see if it worked      
510,5.0,                       omg i finally got it  now i know why kids will stand on line for iphones for hours  after fooling around with motorola smart phones for   years  none of which were particularly impressive or worked particularly well  i have finally come away from the darkside of cellular and into the light  this thing is great and it wasn t very hard to set up  the security on the phone is outstanding  i bought this iphone       gb  for myself and the iphone         gb  for my wife for less than   k    all my kids  and grandkids told me that the iphone    with loads of memory  and an upgrade to the ios    operating system was the way to go  they were right  these phones are an outstanding value      
511,1.0,                       just received this iphone this week and it came broken  the silence button does not work  will be asking for a fully functional iphone like they describe in their product description  such a bummer      hopefully this seller is willing to help resolve this  other than that the phone is scratch free  very clean  still have to go with one star since it is a broken product     
512,1.0,                       this  renewed  phone obviously had a broken camera lens which wasn t replaced properly  it wasn t waterproof and the lens fell off shortly  after the    day warranty was up  also the battery life has not been good at all    but we conspire that a solvable issue  would not recommend this vendor or their products      
513,5.0,                       very good condition and phone has performed as expected   some minor damage when it arrived but nothing major and not a big deal considering the price we paid   would buy from seller again      
514,1.0,                       i purchased an unlocked silver   gb iphone    phone appears to be in great condition  however i received a rose gold phone that is not gsm unlocked please advise   i really need to have this phone unlocked      
515,3.0,                       my son purchased this phone because he broke his phone  the phone was not charged at all  and the charger they sent with it was not an apple accessory  it would not charge the phone  i had to charge it with my charger before i could do anything  it just seemed like a very cheaply done refurbish  won t purchase from them again  it was still expensive and should have come with the proper charging equipment      
516,3.0,                       good phone so far  got it about   weeks ago  kind of irritated though because this phone was supposed to be unlocked but doesn t work with my carrier  boost mobile  when i tried contacting the seller about it  i was ignored  very disappointed that i need to go through all this trouble to use my new phone      
517,2.0,                       it took courage to decide to buy a  refurbished  unit through amazon   this seller was rated high  but it became very apparent there was an issue which would have been identified by even a simple systems check   the audio didn t work   neither the external microphone or connection of headphones via bluetooth or with a dongle   i did receive a full refund but it took   weeks and the additional hassle of finding an alternative   i would not recommend this seller   apparently not very thorough      
518,5.0,                       perfect phone to upgrade a iphone  s that was damaged  works just as good as new with only a few scratches and scuffs on the back that nobody sees anyways with a case on it  received in a few days from fedex  sure beats paying full price for a new phone  refurbished is the way to go   purchase from a seller that has a solid track record based on reviews      
519,3.0,                       spendy for how small it is but apparently all the kids have to have iphones or your just not cool  always looking for a charger  im happy with my samsung but my kid is doubly as happy with her iphone  so if shes happy im happy      
520,1.0,                       this was to be my  st iphone  i tried it with   different carriers and it wouldn t work  very disappointing  returning it      
521,5.0,                       i ve been using my new old iphone for about two weeks and can say categorically that this is a great value  are you purchasing the latest and greatest  absolutely not  but you knew that already   is the phone in great shape  it really is  a very  very minor scratch on the screen that is unnoticeable when the screen is lit is the only cosmetic callout that i have  and it really is minor  one thing that you should absolutely be prepared to do when buying this phone is to replace the battery  my phone arrived with a     max capacity  which translates into a much reduced carrying capacity and some reduced performance  if you re able to plug your phone in all day then maybe this won t be an issue for you  as someone who lives in a large metropolitan area and takes the train to and from work  i need a little more flexibility  so i decided  to replace the battery for     at my local apple store and it made all the difference  from both a performance and longevity standpoint   that paired with mint mobile has reduced my all in mobile costs to soooo much less than where i was previously that i honestly have no idea why everyone isn t doing the same tl dr if you don t need a phone with seven cameras and are prepared to make the additional investment in a new battery then this phone is for you  i m pairing with mint mobile and i couldn t recommend enough  don t listen to the dummies who didn t check whether their phone would work with their carrier   yes  you should do that prior to purchasing but don t let it be a barrier      
522,1.0,                       the description on this item reads   renewed products work and look like new  it did not  the iphone had a serious dent in one corner and some scuffs near the camera  the screen was also scratched  which had to be a really hard fall to be able to scratch an iphone s screen the battery life is also down to      which means i ll probably have to replace it in   or   months i know i was buying a used item but it is clearly stated  to this date  that it will look and work like new  excuse me but i ve never seen a dented or scratched new iphone nor one with a worn battery in my life other than that it works fine i guess  the touch screen starts freaking out from time to time  but i think that s an iphone problem as it also happened randomly with my previous  s if you re looking for an iphone that looks and works like a new one  pass on this one  just get a new one  it s worth it  i m very careful with my stuff so a hard dent on the corner really made me hate this purchase i m never again  in my life  buying a  renewed  item from amazon as they allegedly certify this item to meet certain standards  which must be really low      
523,1.0,                       after   months the phone began to have trouble receiving and making calls and texts   at the same time  the call quality worsened   both problems were hit or miss   sometimes not present  other times fairly consistent   in communicating with prime mobility  i was told to  bare with me while management approves a resolution return    i haven t heard anything since  cannot recommend the phone nor the seller      
524,4.0,                    problemas en el parlante auricular  se escucha muy baja la voz en las llamadas  debo poner el alta voz para escuchar en algunos llamados        
525,1.0,                       very bad experience  stopped working after   months and seller won t do anything past    days  two issues  camera won t take pictures and phone calls stopped going through  could see incoming phone but each time got cut as soon as i pressed talk  when went to apple store  they said that it s defective motherboard and to my shock  they also discovered that the charging port was not original as the apple s diagnostic cable won t dock  sorry to say i am cheated by some smart guys i strongly discourage any transaction with this seller      
526,5.0,                       first day of using it and the screen is in perfect shape with some scuffs in the back but thats expected  battery life seems to be really good  and everything is working as it should  if anything should change i will update this review    update          still working fantastic no problems at all  highly recommended      
527,1.0,                       phone in great condition with no screen scratches  it came with screen protector  and     battery health   after ios   installation no cellular connections can be established or reset   cellular menu under settings is only black screen with error message   cellular provider can not fix after multiple phone calls   apple says the phone needs to be repaired at my cost oat one of their stores       big runaround instead of exciting gift of first phone for my daughter  i am attempting to return the defective phone since it is under    day warranty   seller wont answer phone and voice mail is full   amazon initially defers all returns to seller      
528,4.0,                       everything works great  except for a few problems  the battery life is awful if you use a lot of internet cellular usage  the text tone ringer chugs up occasionally  and lastly  if you try to use a headphone adapter with this  since this phone does not have an earphone port   it gives off an ear piercing screeching sound  been using bluetooth headphones and so far no problems      
529,5.0,                       bought renewed from chubbiestech   had a little bit of trouble towards the end of the warranty period but they switched them out seamlessly  can t be more pleased with the seller  thank you so much      
530,1.0,                       do not buy from this seller  camera quality is not so good  also when you re talking on the phone and you have the phone on speaker other person cannot hear you on the speaker  calls drops and automatically hangs up  worst device ever      
531,5.0,                       starting off  when i first received the phone it had a lot of labels on the packaging  exterior plastic and on the device itself  all with different mismatching info on them  one label for a   gb iphone    and   other labels for a    gb iphone    which i ordered the    gb model     besides this little confusing part  i still got what i paid for  an iphone      gb  presentation of device was fine  i didn t like the sheet of glass that was added onto my phone so that was quickly taken off  with sheet of glass off  or glass screen protector  there are some minor scuffs all around the glass of the device    which is to be expected  it s used  no s    sherlock   battery health upon arrival  july   th       reported     health remaining  which to my expectations was pretty f       awesome especially for the fact that this is being sold as a renewed device  needless to say the battery is degrading quick    also expected  but even though i have the more power intensive features turned off it s still degrading at a quick pace  i mean     to have apple replace a phone battery  why not  currently battery health reports     max capacity as of september  nd           
532,1.0,                       i purchased this phone for my son   he had to wait to save his   to get service on it and we got to the phone store too add service on his new phone  i paid for service  sim card and activation fee    and wait for it   either the phone wasn t fully unlocked   or it was defected because it didn t work it would not operate    i couldn t even use wifi  so i sent it right back to the dealer  except now i left my new sim card in the phone  and i m hoping through all that trouble the girl i spoke to about the phone said monday she ll try to intercept it and take control of the sim card and return it to me     
533,1.0,                       my refurbished iphone arrived on time but not quite refurbished enough  by which i mean it didn t work  after some communication with the seller i returned it  and two weeks after my order i had another refurbished iphone  it worked for three weeks then gave up  i advise making sure the seller is reputable before buying a refurbished phone  i ve had good luck with a refurbished iphone i purchased directly from t mobile  but will be much more selective if purchasing from amazon sellers again      
534,1.0,                       i wasn t able to make or receive calls  i couldn t hear the other party  and i wasn t able to use the speaker button nor was i able to speak to siri   it s wasn t available to me  and the charger it came with wasn t charging the phone  also  i tried connecting to my wifi and for some reason it wouldn t stay on   it automatically turned it off of this phone      
535,1.0,                       i looked at this phone and   mins later i initiated a return  the phone was getting really hot while charging  that made me curious about the battery so i checked it in settings and sure enough it was at     performance and the phone was prompting me to seek service  these phones are not refurbished  they are simply sold again and the company selling them is just hoping that the sucker that bought the phone will be too lazy to return it      
536,1.0,                       don t buy this phone if you reside in the us  we bought this for my mother in law and she had repeated problems  somehow she found out that it is created for the japanese cellular system not the us cellular system so at t told her she would continue having this problem and there is no fix so we returned this      
537,1.0,                       worked great two weeks  now stuck in a reboot loop  tried to troubleshoot  does not work  will not even open home screen  i just want my phone replaced not a refund  i m not sure what to do  dies before i can even get to the home screen  battery life was     when received update  i tried restoring to factory settings and even waiting days to try to start again  still restart loop  i will be returning      
538,5.0,                       had reservations purchasing this from anyone other than a big name cell company   the iphone works perfectly   i am no longer tied to one cell phone company as this is my personal phone and it was much cheaper than getting one from verizon   i highly recommend this company      
539,1.0,                       it s a good thing that amazon offers a    day guarantee  because this phone worked well at the beginning   after a while  it started glitching occasionally   after about   months  the sound would not work at all for many apps or for videos  etc   i have purchased another one through the same company  due to what is currently available and my budget    hopefully  it will work better than the one i am returning      
540,1.0,                       the first few days the phone was working real fine and when it came to the  rd day the service went out and i went to tmobile and they said its been reported stolen  then the day after the charger won t fit all of a sudden and also the screen would randomly go black  i hope i get my money back for all this      
541,5.0,                       had i not purchased this phone myself  i would ve never believed that it wasn t brand new   it truly surpassed what i thought i d be getting   absolutely no complaints here    it is for my    year old son and he also absolutely loves it   happy kid  happy mom        
542,4.0,                       overall a great product  came in almost perfect condition with a glass screen protector already on it  i did have to get the battery replaced  no big deal  shortly after the battery was replaced the camera and flashlight stopped working  apparently this is an issue with the iphone  s in general  that s a risk you take when buying a refurbished phone     i was able to get it replaced as well though and i have a perfect working phone      
543,1.0,                       do not buy this  i ve been trying to fix this phone and it does not work out of nowhere stopped working  it only works with wifi and that s it  today i got the answer from the last place i took it and it s unfixable  thank you very much for wasting my money     
544,4.0,                       i received this phone last night it looks good as new    it kind of clicks when pushing the home button  other than that it works perfectly  i switched my straight talk sim card over from my old phone and it activated it perfectly  i can send and receive texts and phone calls with no problem  my camera doesn t have the shutter sound problem as has been stated in past reviews either good purchase  if anything happens in the near future i will update this      
545,4.0,                       i iterally had to get an updated itunes on a mac in order to update the iphone s software  to be able to active it  the sound on the speaker was muffled so i had to watch tutorials on youtube in order to understand how to clean the speakers with a toothbrush and be able to hear what they were saying to me when people called me  i suspect this phone was stored in dust for a while  so after this i could use this phone properly and i was even able to use it outside the us with any sim  taking into account the time that all of this took me and the fact the iphone s price was less than      it was worth it  the iphones sold here are second hand  i ll post an update if this one breaks down   i use it for personal use and  for developing so i am super happy  i feel i can help out the planet by re using something that nobody else needs anymore and still save money update  the sound breaks down continuosly    i am quite unhappy  it s not even been a week  i guess i ll just return it  anyway there goes my experience on amazon        
546,4.0,                       the iphone physically was in near perfect condition  i did find that the battery health had a maximum percentage of only     which can be expected for a used phone but does require it to be on a charger if used even just moderately in order to last a typical    hr day     
547,1.0,                       i bought this product and couldn t it to verizon s cell system   it turns out that the iphone model   is not technically compatible with verizon s phone system owing to a change in the antenna design of this particular iphone model   there was no problem returning this purchase to amazon      
548,1.0,                       phone broke in three months  have been emailing them about it  they won t do anything  the wifi sensory went out and won t fix it     
549,5.0,                       excellent supplier excels in timely delivery  report of phone unit condition  cosmetic perfection  no scratches  and ram upgrade  thanks      
550,5.0,                       i was nervous to buy this but  my girlfriend desperately needed a new cheap phone  this was the answer  works absolutely perfect  no issues  seems brand new      
551,1.0,                       there is a problem with the volume  call quality  there s a cracking sound during calls  calls are also being dropped and it s not network related  the screen lighting fluctuate from dark to light and when i m on a video call the screen goes dark and the person can t see me but i can see them  this all started happening within days of activating the phone   this is my  nd fully refurbished iphone  i had no problems with the first one for years  i m really disappointed this time      
552,2.0,                       the battery life on this phone is terrible  in the settings it says that the max life is      but my last phone was     and lasted much longer  i have to charge the battery multiple times a day  i will start a run with      battery and at the end of the run  it will be at     or less  i m very angry that this is what i paid for  don t buy      
553,4.0,                       i bought this phone for my mother and she loves it  it was in great condition and functioning great  also came with a tempered glass cover on it       
554,1.0,                       from ecuador i bought an iphone      gb and my daughter brought it to me and when i tried to use it i realized that the headset did not work and the speaker option was also inactive    i took it to a technical center and they told me that they would have to check it his repair would cost between               so i do not know how to proceed since it is the first time this happens to me     
555,5.0,                       i m not sure why there are so many negative reviews  i received exactly what i was expecting  hardly any wear n tear even though it is a refurb item  it looks brand spankin new  it was the exact model listed and is a global unlocked model that works with gsm and cdma  battery life is a smudge below      in the settings  i m glad i ignored all the reviews and just ordered anyway     gb iphone   for the price is even better then paying for insurance monthly and making a claim  thank you      
556,4.0,                       i like the phone but the only problem i have is that the camera s shutter sound will not turn off  i silenced the phone and even that didn t work  it s still a great phone     
557,1.0,                       i ordered this phone to replace my daughters phone  shipping was relatively quick   however the phone itself had a recall  it was a sprint phone which is what i needed  sprint could not connect it  despite a new sim card which i had to order and wait an additional   days for  turns out that the model number for this phone had an apple recall  my option was to go to apple store and have them repair  with the coronavirus  very few stores were open and i could not schedule an appointment  after a week of trying to do everything in my power  i had to return the phone to the seller      
558,1.0,                       received phone quickly  and a note in the package said  this device is      unlocked and will be compatible with most gsm carriers    in fact  it s a locked asian phone under the carrier japan kddi   after big pain to figure issues out with all parties involved  my carrier t mobile  at t store  amazon support  apple support  the root cause was identified   eventually  i have to return the phone      
559,1.0,                       sold as like new but phone has screen protector to hide the screen scratches  if your like new phone comes with screen protector please remove to verify condition of screen      
560,1.0,                       bought this iphone refurbished  wrong move on my part    months later broke on me   i couldn t get incoming calls or make any kind of calls  tried to go fix it  they told me the motherboard was fried and recommended to get a new one  remember if you are going to buy renewed find out the warranty first  the people that sold me the phone said they have a   month warranty so be aware of the warranty as well  good luck     
561,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this product to send it to my home country ecuador as a gift to my cousin  i was sad to know that when it got to my home country it had a broken screen  i couldn t check the phone simply because i m a college student with a job and had to much stuff in my hands to check it   i wouldn t recommend the phone simply because of that  but that s up to each one to buy it or not  good luck  hope you don t get a broken screen like mine     
562,4.0,                       the call volume is incredibly low  after going online to trouble shoot  we found a whole forum on how this is a common problem in iphones  we were unsuccessful in adjusting the volume and just decided we re not ready for a iphone  other than that the phone is perfect  not one scratch  i will be using this seller again      
563,3.0,                       worked ok for about a week and then could not get it to work   had to return it   watch out  you cannot return this like other amazon items at kohl s  this requires a return back to the vendor via their preferred method which is ups   it was a bit of a hassle and i had to reach out them more than a week later to get my refund processed  even when i believe they had received it back days ago   oh well at least i got the refund suggest getting a higher level renewed iphone next time  not a scratch   dent level      
564,5.0,                       i like the functions of the iphone    one would not know this is a used phone  it did not have any cosmetic damage and works well  i will say i primarily use the phone for calls  text  checking mail  taking pictures and reading the news  i occasionally listen to music  so in other words  it meets my needs  i have not played any games using this device  i would highly recommend this purchase  it was well worth the price      
565,5.0,                       great phone for its price  my    year old uses it  it came looking brand new   we ve had it for several months now and there has been no problems      
566,5.0,                       arrived on time and i ve had no problems  set up was easy and battery life has been good so far     
567,5.0,                       i dropped my old phone in the water when i went kayaking this weekend   so i was in market for a new phone  went with the iphone   for the best value and the water resistance rating of ip     it was sent to me with two day shipping  via usps arrived in my mailbox  i had it set up with no issues through at t within    minutes   this is at t gsm only phone   which was clearly labeled in the description   a major concern for people is the how much has the battery been used or depreciated from prior use   you can find this out in iphone settings very easily   my arrived with     of full capacity   which when you consider it is a     year old used renewed product  that is great   it came with an installed screen protector   which great because i also want one on there but have a lot of trouble putting them on without air bubbles   lighting cable and genic charger were also included   very pleased to have my phone back up and running on the first try   i think that everyone is a little intimated about buying used phones  mixed reviews  bad reviews   i couldn t be happier with this purchase   i ll write a follow up review after i have had it for     months after having it to show how the battery and phone hold up  over a year later addition to review    this came with a screen protector applied which at the time thought okay the seller slapped on a cheap screen protector cool   i have always used a otterbox defender series case because i am that guy  the guy who drops everything all the time   i decided to lean up so as to be more comfortable in my pocket and travels   i went with the commuter series by otterbox   it took a drop after using it for about year  i thought that i had cracked the screen  when i felt the corner it had dropped on it had little sharp pieces of glass on it   so i have been going with the thought process that i cracked the screen and the screen protector is keeping the screen attached and in tact   so for the last serval months i assumed that it was just a matter of time until the crack grew and the phone screen was eventually be on its way out   today i picked at the corner a little bit just to see what would happen   as i pull up  it cracks further  as i look its actually all the screen protector itself   it was on of those really nice like glass screen protectors that the seller or vendor had put on and it ended up saving my phone in the long run   so that little extra ended up saving the day and when i bought it i didn t even know it was there for the most part   excellent thanks for have that preinstalled  who knows what could have happened if i had lagged on that      
568,5.0,                       super reliable  no visible guards  simply amazing  my customer was very satisfied  and aki gives a hint  new  new  mobile  phones  and some remodeled manufacturers  are the correct ones to buy  take care  investigate well then do not say bad sellers       
569,3.0,                       first iphone   order  arrived on time  had no scratches or any cosmetic damage  ios not up to date and device screen started pixeling  really pretty obvious  even though box indicated it was  refurbished  and  rigourously tested    updated with new software    after much discussion with hard to understand amazon support reps  i negotiated an immediate gift credit  since i paid via cash on a debit card  and thus ordered a replacement the same day  while the first was sent back to initial supplier  dealfisher     otherwise amazon returns menu note suggested it would have taken   days to get credit  second iphone arrived a few days later from buyspry  sooner than expected  it had a few very small nicks on the metal case  and nearly invisible hairline scratches on screen corner  and was not up to date on ios  but did update  seems to perform well so far    days in use  as expected after activating  battery showed     capacity on ios beta battery health  but seems to hold a charge all day  will give it a try and see what happens  have    days to return and    days warranty  also  purchased   year square trade warranty      
570,5.0,                       iphone looks and works like new  no scratches or defects works perfectly  definitely reccomend      
571,5.0,                       so far  only had it a couple of days  the phones look great   camera quality is great  battery live is great  and the physical condition of the phones are outstanding   totally pleased with this company      
572,1.0,                       the model a     has a known issue that the modem goes out  will not connect to cellular network  since it is refurbished it is out of the coverage time for it to be repaired for free and apple will charge you      to repair  the phone functioned fine but they are a time bomb  they will go out at any time and while everything else works fine it will no longer with any carrier  look up iphone   carrier service failed to update  so buy at your own risk      
573,5.0,                       i ve read a lot of negative reviews on this iphone    specifically that it doesn t work with verizon  i had a iphone se through verizon and decided to upgrade to the    i received this phone in excellent condition without a scratch on it and when i transferred my sim card from my se to this one it fired right up with no problems whatsoever  great purchase      
574,1.0,                       i bought this phone as a spare for my large family   it was more than    days before it was needed  so when i discovered it wouldn t work with my carrier  i was out of the return window   the device was not fully unlocked  as it was advertised   i went to activate it and found that it s not compatible with the verizon network   in retrospect  i should have tried to activate the phone immediately to discover the problem while i could still return it   my fault for trusting an amazon seller to deliver a product as advertised      
575,5.0,                       when we went to the apple store to update the iphone   we had purchased from him  it ended a new battery  one he understood the situation  through a couple of emails  he promptly reimbursed for the new battery from the apple store  i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend him highly      
576,4.0,                       maximum battery capacity came as     instead of the guaranteed minimum of     the charger was broken  but the phone came without cosmetic damage and a screen protector  definitely recommend for the price  works with verizon      
577,2.0,                       purchased this phone late january       it s mid july      and started to have problems with the speaker and mic when placing calls  it started to get really staticky and then just stopped working  survived for about a week resetting the phone every time i needed to make a call and then that stopped working too  i know this is a  renewed  phone but was hoping to get at least a year out of it      
578,1.0,                       i know it s a refurbished phone but this is in terrible condition i didn t even go further to try powering it on  this should t even be for sale the phone speakers are filled with dust and the filters by the charging port is disgusting with dirt build up   i immediately ordered a phone on t mobile i rather pay the monthly premium but atleast i know i ll be getting a phone that isn t dent and scratched everywhere  plus it came with a sim card to activate wth disappointed       
579,1.0,                       do not buy this phone  there is no way it s certifiedi am now   weeks after my return window and the phone stopped workingi took it to get fixed and they said it s under no warranty as it was just mashed up from different parts     
580,5.0,                       bought this phone as a gift for our daughter  we did not want to spend crazy money on a new iphone so we looked into purchasing one here  my daughter loved it and it has not given her any issues  had minimal scratches but nothing too big of a deal  would definitely buy from here again and would recommend to others      
581,5.0,                       phone in excellent shape   looks like a new phone   there were no  instructions or earphones    came with charger only as the amazon description said   with the help of google and friends i am learning to use the phone   very happy with the purchase      
582,3.0,                       iphone    phone looks good and works  haven t added service yet  it does get pretty hot during use and when its charging  battery is right at     total health  barely passed amazon standards  and battery drains very quickly  have never owned iphone before so idk if this is normal  will be taking it to apple store to have it checked out soon while in    day window  will update after that happens      
583,5.0,                       ordered a renewed iphone   and that s just what i got  so far so good   practically new condition  works great so far  will update if anything goes wrong  excellent experience overall      
584,5.0,                       this phone is like new  no scratches  i have at t  so i bought one specifically for at t  works perfectly  sim chip dropped right in  up and running instantly  would buy from them again      
585,4.0,                       iphones are pretty well known now  and this is a good  hardworking member of that family  the one thing about buying them online is that there are special compatibility issues that i ve run into from time to time  it may say it s a verizon phone  or whatever carrier   but if it doesn t meet their compatibility requirements around the imei  it won t work  that can be checked on the carrier s website  if the seller will give that to you  otherwise  it ll be a       shot of getting the right phone  in my experience      
586,5.0,                       i had no problem connecting it to a plan the device was clear of scratches   looks like probably had the screen replaced  but looks nice works as advertised      
587,1.0,                       bought iphone in july this year already stopped working  tried contacting seller hyrid it no response  do not buy from this seller      
588,5.0,                       great phone my wife is pleased      
589,1.0,                       bought this for a birthday gift in september  the phone died before thanksgiving      
590,1.0,                       needed update within first few weeks   apple genius  directed me that my best bet would be to try to sell as i pod ordered phone early december and with in several weeks of use an update was prompted that if not able to make  the phone would be incapable of using   apple was unable to do anything with the phone and directed me that they see this from time to time and told me my best option would be to sell the phone as an i pod for whatever value i could salvage phone worked great prior to update needed   still cant help but to feel as if i was conned      
591,1.0,                       the phone sent was in excellent condition  however it was an at t unlocked phone which uses the gsm standard and not the cdma standard   the apple spec page indicates that the intel powered a     and a     phones won t support cdma  or code division multiple access   a cellular technology used on some lte networks  that means an intel powered iphone   simply won t work on cdma networks  such as verizon s and sprint s      
592,5.0,                       the phone looks and works like brand new  not a scratch anywhere and the battery life is great  much cheaper than a new one from at t  yet it performs just as well      
593,1.0,                       i bought the iphone back in march       with very moderate use  the phone battery drained out very fast  i always kept a portable charger with me until november when the battery issue becomes worse   the camera stopped working one day  the other functions worked well so far  i contacted the seller but was told they cannot do anything after the product is sold after    days  so you can expect to pay to repair yours as soon as it stopped working on the   st day after you bought it      
594,2.0,                       i bought this phone in august of      and less then a year owned and it is shutting off when it feels like it and even if i am on the phone  very disappointed i didn t even get a year out of it      
595,5.0,                    el iphone   para m  que estaba estacionado en el   es un excelente equipo  se lo recomiendo        
596,1.0,                       this was supposed to be a fully unlocked phone  able to be used on cdma or gsm   when we took it to our carrier  sprint  they were unable to connect this phone to their network   the phone was pre paid leased to another company   this is the  nd time we ve tried buying a used iphone from amazon  and the  nd time we re having to return a supposedly fully unlocked phone  that would not connect to our network   the amazon renewed program is a joke   i would give zero stars if possible   updated    seller did refund my purchase promptly      
597,4.0,                       the phone seems to work pretty well  the negative is the screensaver what is of poor quality and i had to peel it off within the week  also the calendar had subscriptions for virus removing software which i found a pain to try to remove      
598,4.0,                       this phone came with a glitch that is common with iphone  s  i wasn t able to activate it because of it  but otherwise it was in great shape  the seller accepted my return almost instantly  thank you      
599,1.0,                       i ordered the phone for my daughter in august  everything came fast and worked fine  two days after the warranty expired is when we started to experience battery issues  how convenient   my daughter kept her phone on the charger all night and it went from    to     now i have an upset   year old and no phone  a phone should last way longer than three months without expiriencing these type of problems  very upsetting      
600,1.0,                       phone came with scratched screen  it had problems from the start  the silent mode switch broke  and now the microphone stopped working so i cannot make calls  i have had the phone for four months  but since it  doesn t fall under the    day warranty  they refuse to do anything  don t buy from this merchant        
601,5.0,                       the phone arrived on time   it was in like new condition   the battery life is much better than the iphone   it replaces   the only problem i had was updating the os   somehow my facetime and siri were removed by the update to version      it took the geniuses at the iphone store   hours to figure it out   i was kicked around like a soccer ball until one of the staff figured it out      
602,5.0,                       great case for the price  delivered as promised  happy customer     
603,1.0,                       like a lot of the other reviews said  unfortunately  it is not verizon compatible  whoever is in charge of writing the description should fix the fact that it is not verizon compatible      
604,1.0,                       i purchased this phone and all was ok for a while  after a month or two it suddenly couldn t connect to wifi anymore  due to a protracted illness i couldn t do anything about it at the time  recently i took it to the closest apple store after being pointed there by my provider noticed it was one of a number that were recalled for just this problem  the serial number was clear on it and this is one of the problem phones so they should have been aware of the problem  apple refuses to fix it because they claim it was sold as an   as is  phone despite being their defect and the company saying they were recalled  the repair price is more than i paid for the phone so now i am stuck with a very expensive paperweight      
605,5.0,                       great value for    gb   phone was in excellent shape no scratches or marks  also came with a charger   it was easy to change our existing sim card from the old phone to this one  i purchased this as a gift for my son and i had to re box it because the box was in bad shape  but the phone was totally fine  definitely worth saving the hundreds of dollars for a new phone  especially for a teenager      
606,1.0,                       the description is misleading   renewed products look and work like new  drilling down into the details of amazon renewed   refurbished phones yields the info that the policy actually only guarantees the battery to have something like     of the original capacity a device that  works like new  would have a battery that is      of a new battery capacity       of a new battery capacity is not  like new  additionally  my phone was not fully functional   my callees repeatedly could barely hear me on speakerphone   even apple support said it was not functioning correctly when i called for help with troubleshooting   so  obviously the phone was not adequately  inspected and tested by amazon qualified suppliers  amazon refunded the purchase  but for the hassle of having to test and diagnose the phone myself  a substandard warranty period  a  less than new  battery  missing headphone adapter  and a return  to me it s worth just buying the phone from apple      
607,5.0,                       love the iphone  s  i got the black and black screen and it s perfect  the camera is awesome  shipping was fast and phone even came with a screen protector on it  only complaint is the speaker could be better  quality of the speaker is not bad but kinda low at times even with the volume on max  besides that one little complaint it s an awesome phone      
608,1.0,                       this iphone is worse than a slice of cheese on your face  the battery would die after two minutes of use  the screen would freeze up  the phone restarted after    minutes of use  even if left on a charger it would shut off  refurbishing did nothing obviously  if anything they just replaced the screen and called it a day  worst iphone i ve ever bought  i am returning it as i m typing this      
609,2.0,                       i ve had this phone for a year and have had multiple problems with it  it overheats often  at one point it was turning off every night while i m charging it  i had to take it in for service and do a factory reset which temporarily resolved the issue  right now i can t get any cell service  and i am at home with my family who has three other phones on the same phone plan  they all have four bars      
610,1.0,                       pretty annoying when you spend a couple hundred bucks on a phone and cant even control ur ringer     
611,1.0,                       this product was promised to be in  excellent condition  and was supposed to have only minor cosmetic defects that are not noticeable when holding it at arm s length  i received a dirty  scratched iphone  sending it back has been a nightmare   no mailing label is provided so you will be expected to print your own  do not buy from this seller   horrible product and horrible experience  gigantic headache      
612,2.0,                       a month after activating it  started having issues with data connectivity  a few weeks later  voice quality deteriorated  when speaking to people  they hear a very distorted voice from this phone  and it cuts out a lot  it sounds like severe electronic interference in an    s video game  if you switch to speaker phone  the quality is crystal clear  i would not recommend any iphones to anyone  i ve had nothing but problems with them  and each of my samsung phones have been fantastic  i just can t convince the rest of my family to switch      
613,4.0,                       i ordered two of these and although they were cosmetically perfect each had an underlay issue   one had a weird thing where when i went to take a picture    the camera was blurry and so were the pics   the second  although i don t make a lot of voice calls  from time to time i do  this phone earpiece speaker was so low i couldn t hold a conversation   perfectly imperfect phones      
614,1.0,                       i m so frustrated  i bought this phone and i was never able to use it because it won t activate  i put a sim card in and it keeps  searching     but never reads it       thrown away  what a waste of money and time      
615,3.0,                       the phone came in much better quality than i thought it would  they got the color and storage right  and it was incredibly easy to transfer data from one phone to another  just like buying from apple  the differences are that the charger and adapter are off brand and don t really work  easy fix  just buy another from absolutely anywhere   the screen came with a few  scratches   not deep or anything  just apparent marks when you look at it   some dead pixels in the middle of the screen and one actual scratch that makes me more nervous about the screen cracking  it doesn t come with a screen wipe or anything  but you can also get those easily  in the package is a little sim card pick  which is especially helpful and something lots of people forget to throw in  apple doesn t even send one   overall  the phone is nice where it matters  but has small issues one can t help but notice      
616,5.0,                       the product was everything that i expended  works great  i ll report back after a few weeks  haven t taken many pictures with it as it was purchased for business use  battery life is great for how it s being used      
617,5.0,                       i was nervous buying a  renewed  phone  but it was truly like new  i couldn t find a scratch anywhere on it  the battery is at     of original capacity and lasts me all day with heavy use  after a month of using it i have found no issues or flaws and i couldn t be happier      
618,3.0,                       upgraded my mom from a   to this model for mother s day and we are both disappointed   mainly in the battery life   her old phone could go     days without needing a charge  and she has to charge this one on a daily basis   ps my mom uses this only as a phone and occasionally takes pictures or googles something   so for as little as she uses it the battery life sucks   i expected more from a phone that was supposedly  renewed    next phone purchase will be new      
619,1.0,                       a zero rating             purchased this unlocked phone from  amazon  but really from prime mobility  unit worked for a while then just before cutoff date for returns it failed  took it to apple for repair  but they couldn t fix it because it was not unlocked  called amazon and texted prime mobility but just got the same answer  can t help you because it s past the return cutoff  i explained that apple took time to try to fix it and that s why we were a few days past the cutoff  but i got the stock answer from multiple people in india  i asked for a manger in the us and he tried to help  but gave me a number for prime mobility  which of course  didn t work  i texted prime mobility and they answered once  but there was now way to reply to their question of what s wrong  which i had clearly answered in the original text  there was no way to talk to anyone prime mobility at all  totally the worst experience ever trying to get some satisfaction in a return for a defective product  a big shout out to apple for coming through in the end with a free replacements phone when they heard of all the problems we had with amazon and prime mobility     
620,4.0,                       my iphone was delivered a few days earlier than expected  it was in perfect condition  no visible scratches or dents  the only way i could tell it was a used iphone was because the battery can only hold     charge  it shipped on ios       so i will be able to jailbreak not too far in the future  overall  very happy with this purchase      
621,3.0,                       this iphone   would have been great except for the following issues ring tones are low kind of muted  if the phone is in the next room away  i barely hear it vibrate intensity is even worse  the phone can be on my body or right next to and never notice its super low vibration  this is a feature that i really wanted since i hate having my phone ring out loud also  apps crash often and when that     
622,5.0,                       everything came as described  it was described as unlocked and it came unlocked so all i had to do was put my old sim into the phone  battery read came at    percent as said  the phone virtually has no wear  basically new  for the price and the refurbished condition and the space this was a great deal  very happy with this purchase  very satisfied with the seller      
623,5.0,                       great phone  it was sprint compatible  i took it to my local sprint store and they put a sim card in for free and got it all up and running  it s easy to use  all the apps and things i need  works great  really pretty rose gold  looked brand new  not a scratch on it  loved it so much bought one for my husband      
624,2.0,                       this phone seemed to be in good condition  not scratches  started just fine was advertised to be used with at t  however  was never able to activate the phone  at t did not know why the error message was showing and apple support was unable to help without sending it in for service  i have requested a refund and return of phone  will edit and update if refund is received timely     
625,5.0,                       this was a great buy for me  the phone come in an apple package  but was still wonderfully packaged  nice clean white box  with a third party charger  sim slot opener  even a case and a screen saver  since using it i haven t had any issues  works like brand new  this was a great buy and i d seriously purchase again      
626,2.0,                       the plus side is that the phone was in brand new condition and came with all iphone accessories  it was also packaged extremely well  the down side is that this supposedly  fully unlocked  phone was not actually unlocked at us cellular  do your homework beforehand  get the imei   of the phone and check compatibility with your carrier before purchasing      
627,1.0,                       phone was sold to me being claimed unlocked  after a couple months the phone because locked  i paid almost      for this and now i cannot even use it because its locked  it worked fine for about a month and then just became locked  horrible customer service  i would save your time and not even bother buying for them      
628,5.0,                       i m so happy  i have been long overdue for a new phone  the price was too good to pass up  the phone came perfectly packaged in the protective wrapping  it even comes with a mfi certified charger  i would rather it have came with the headphone charger adapter but oh well  was super easy to set up and swap out my old phone  i m hoping it continues to work properly because i usually don t get new phones often so this will have to last me quite a while      
629,1.0,                       do not buy    got the phone december and it stopped working end of january  it wouldn t connect to any network then it said to update after up dating it said the phone is unable to activate and that message won t go off the screen so u can do nothing  i am an international customer so i took it to a dealer and they said there is nothing that they can do the phone is useless  i can t send it back because i am international so i just waste      for a   month service      
630,3.0,                       the phone came with its own screen saver and had no cracks on it  was worried about getting a broken one like some of the reviews  but it works  for now anyway   but there s a camera shutter sound whenever i take a picture  iphone camera  snapchat  instagram  etc   i looked online and they said that phones in other countries have it illegal to have the shutter noise on silent  but in the us it isn t like that   so if anyone knows how to silence that it will be great  everything else on the phone is fantastic      
631,5.0,                       bought this for my son   so far all has been as advertised   good screen  unlocked phone  etc etc   i was a bit concerned before purchasing b c of some of the negative reviews  but i m glad i went for it      
632,1.0,                       it glitches   it overheats   i can deal with that   but at my grandson s baptism  i was so embarassed that every picture i took came with a loud shutter noise   i went to the apple genius bar   they verified  this version was made for the japanese market where it is illegal to take a picture of someone without notifying them  hence the  shutter sound on off enabler  has been irreversibly disabled permanently      
633,5.0,                       fast shipping   did not expect it for another week but than boom it s here  says it used but it looked mint to me so whatever they did they did a good job     
634,3.0,                       turns out one model  a      from within the iphone   product line does not support a sim card   as far as i can tell  there is no way to know which model is being sold on amazon   this may not matter to everyone   may even be an advantage to some   but i needed it for my prepaid carrier   i think it would also be important for some who plan to travel internationally and need to use a sim for their destination country      
635,5.0,                       i bought this phone for my daughter  this phone is reconditioned but it looks new  although it is an older model  it has enough bells and whistles to keep her happy  for the price it is an excellent phone      
636,1.0,                       the phone was shipped on time  looked great and functioned correctly   however  it was not unlocked and i am unable to get my current carrier  at t  to unlock it so i can switch carriers   i now have to call the other major carriers to see if i can convince them to do it or just purchase another phone that is for the carrier that i want to switch too   ultra frustrating      
637,1.0,                       stopped working won t turn on i got no satisfaction from seller or amazon it s now just a paperweight     
638,1.0,                       these folks are selling phones that have broad recall due to a bad mother board  according to apple models a     should not have been resold when apple pulled them from the shelf    weeks after the    return policy  of course  my son s phone began exhibiting the classic issues directly related to the recall  when inquiring appealing with the seller they told us there was nothing they could would do and suggested we take it to a local repair store  super discouraging  my    year old son worked really hard this summer mowing lawns to purchase this poc  it s a tough lesson to learn that some people businesses operate this way      
639,2.0,                    el iphone lo compre para regalo hasta hoy que se abre y me di cuenta que no es el iphone   plus sino iphone   es m s chico que el iphone   plus  ten a protector de pantalla hasta estuche para iphone   plus y no me sirve  respecto a la carga se calienta de sobremanera cuando lo conecto y tiene un juego en el enchufe del cargador tengo que moverlo para que cargue  la verdad me decepcion  porque la persona a qui n le regale ya tiene un iphone   solo cambio el calor  no lo puedo devolver porque ya lo di como regalo  espero que el vendedor sea m s serio con los env os que les solicita sus clientes         
640,5.0,                       i replaced an iphone  s with this phone  it works much better  and i appreciate the water resistant feature so i don t feel that i have to encase my phone in a waterproof case      
641,5.0,                       love the phone perfect for a teenager  shipping was fast  only thing i didn t like was the back of phone was scratched when we opened it  but all in all good purchase     
642,4.0,                       i  originally bought this phone to upgrade from my old  s i absolutely love it   however i am not able to use it with verizon  as the description states   was hoping i would be able to because some of the other reviews  said that it would work with verizon but   mine doesn t  also it would be  smart to pay attention to the seller   i bought mine from dealfisher   the reason i m not going to return this is   because  i m absolutely in love with the phone    the camera is awesome and the sound is awesome   and    because i already bought a phone case for it  every gigabyte i ordered is on there  and the phone was exactly as described  so   i guess i ll use this phone for facebook  and use my old  s as just a phone   i would suggest if you re on verizon don t buy this phone  unless you re using it for social media and things of that nature   if anything changes i ll come back and update this review      
643,1.0,                       phone itself is great  purchased in february still no issues  i am in the process of transferring from att to xfinity  just got off the phone with att and this is not an att locked phone  and i can t find which carrier this phone is linked to  do not buy unless you want to stick with att for the life of your phone      
644,1.0,                       when i received the phone it only had     of the battery health  the advertised battery health was supposed to be at less      the phone goes into limp mode and it was slow and unresponsive  i try charging the phone and it took almost a day for it to fully charge and loose charge by the end of day without using  so i decided to return the phone  the phone was not refurbished it was just repackage from multi return  i don t normally review my purchase but this seller is not refunded my return after receiving my product      
645,3.0,                       phone worked well  no issues there   they are not kidding about the battery capacity being at least       that s exactly what mine was   this phone is for my son and the battery barely lasts   hours    i ve bought a new battery and a water tight seal and i will install myself   just letting people know they may need to spend an additional     for a new battery if they get a phone like a weak battery like mine i struggled with the rating because this product is exactly what the seller said it would be   giving   stars so people might notice this review and know they will likely get a weak battery and have to take additional steps to replace it like me      
646,5.0,                       i read a lot of reviews here  some of them pretty bad  so i wasn t sure whether to take a chance on buying the renewed iphone   or not  my boyfriend pointed out that i could check each seller s feedback  i didn t realize that  if you look right under the  buy now  button in the right hand sidebar and you can see the seller s name and click on it to read their feedback  if you look further down the sidebar and you can see who else is selling the same phone  and click on their names to see their ratings   i can vouch that hybrid it was awesome  but don t just take it from me  read the reviews  look for     positive if you can find it  the phone i got was truly in like new condition  not stolen  never submerged  fully unlocked  and everything on it works perfectly  happy shopping          
647,5.0,                       i bought this phone in july      for      from kiss  ply  it is beautiful  it has worked perfectly ever since  i ve had it for almost a year and love it  i had an lg before that   and liked it except that the phone part was terrible  no one could hear or understand me unless i was on speakerphone  the iphone phone is excellent  so is the camera  battery  everything  except the bluetooth  which i don t really care about anyway  it didn t work easily so i didn t bother to figure out why   i had to buy an adapter to use my earbuds  and i recommend the ugreen adapter  for about      it s worth it      
648,1.0,                       the phone looked great and had no visible damage  my so was so excited to get this after having saved for months to purchase it  imagine his devastation when it stopped working after less than two weeks  this was such a disappointing transaction  but kudos to amazon for promptly handling it      
649,1.0,                       the phone arrived with one tiny scuff on the top edge  but looked great besides that   apple will charge you for that little scratch if you ever need to send it in for repair using the replacement program   this phone has so many problems turning off and on on it s own   now it will not connect to my cellular service and confirmed to be a problem with the iphone   this    day warranty is the only time period where this phone is sure to be usable   after any iphone is   years old from brand new  apple admittedly intentionally programs all iphones to weaken and even become possibly completely unusable  to save the battery  according to apple   it is a total waste of money to buy an iphone if you want it to last longer than   years from brand new   battery life is poor  phone breaks very easily if barely dropped  if an update is failing  you will have to use an apple mac pc to get the proper updates as it is intentionally designed to only work with other apple stuff   pathetic   any android will likely be a better choice      
650,3.0,                       battery life sucked and the phone overheated at very high temperatures  i felt like the metal was going to melt  i tried to do a refund and the seller didn t reach out to me so i had to contact amazon  i ll be returning the phone soon     
651,1.0,                       buyer beware  iphone model a       when i bought this phone i was so excited  it was my newest upgrade to my iphone se  it looked beautiful and it felt great in the hand  little did i know that a certain model of this phone that was built in china would start rejecting my sim card  every so often it would tell me that i had no service  i would take the same sim card out and put it in another phone and it would work just fine  please make sure you research the model and where it s made so that you don t end up like me spending money on a phone that doesn t work  even when i took the phone to the iphone store they said i was not eligible to get the phone recalled or even fixed  such a waste      
652,3.0,                       the phone visually looked great but unfortunately i wasn t able to activate the device  the phone had some kind of bug which honestly i m not sure if it was the sellers fault or apple  either way i took it to apple and they sent it to be repaired free of charge  it turns out apple replaced the main board  battery and the screen    in other words they replaced the phone so it worked out in the end      
653,5.0,                       i received a gold iphone   today  everything worked and it looked brand new  it cane carrier unlocked for me i believe as i saw no carrier logos when booting up the phone which was a nice plus side  the only negative thing i would say would be that it was only on     upon arrival  but totally isn t a big deal  just was the only thing i noticed as a negative      
654,5.0,                       the iphone i received was in great condition   worked great  no damage or marks on it   only negative was battery maximum capacity was at       it was used so i didn t expect a new phone   it s a non issue as the battery lasts all day for my level of usage   i would buy another phone from this company   very satisfied      
655,3.0,                       overall the phone functions well  there were minor surface scratches on the screen  the battery is bad and the phone dies very quickly  since this was a christmas gift  we decided not to attempt to return exchange and instead paid the     for apple to replace the battery   i hope on future refurbs that the company tests battery life before selling  the battery drains when not being used so the issue would have been easily identifiable      
656,1.0,                       should of researched this seller a little closer and read more reviews   this iphone is not fully unlocked as advertised   tried to activate with verizon and they said phone is not recognized   verizon states it will take       hrs to get this iphone on their network   next time i will only purchase a phone if it says  for verizon network  or whatever phone service i have at that time   despite the false advertisement of fully unlocked  the phone is very clean and functions as it should   i chose fully unlocked b c it was    cheaper   i won t make that mistake again        
657,5.0,                       i was skeptical on the condition it was going to be in due to past experience with identical products   but this one was beyond anything i could have asked for  practically a brand new phone arrived  not a single scratch   blemish or dent   was tremendously satisfied with purchase      
658,5.0,                       this iphone   was like new when i opened the box  everything works perfectly  i am very pleased with my new device      
659,5.0,                       great item with original accessories  fully functional and looks as new  this is my second attempt  unfortunately first attempt was not so great   so be careful when picking a seller  i purchased good one from dncl techzone and it came as described   fully functional and looking like new      
660,3.0,                       i wouldn t recommend this bc after only     months the battery is dying in a short amount of time  i now need to either buy a jew phone or some portable battery charger to make it through being out and about another downfall is that when o have the phone in a running belt the home button is t really a button   it s only a fingerprint read  so i have to take it out to see anything on phone    otherwise the phone was in good condition      
661,1.0,                       this phone took me days to try to get to work but even topeople at the network store cold not get it to workand they have only refunded me half so far saying that i had not taken it of my cloud even tough it is not listed as on of my phones     
662,5.0,                       so far  i love this phone  looks like new  everything works as it should  battery holds its charge great  no issues whatsoever  even the clerk as tmobile commented on what a great phone it is  and at such a terrific price      
663,5.0,                       this review is for one week into ownership  wanted an iphone but hell no am i paying        for a new phone  after reading reviews of this renewed iphone   i was very skeptical of a few sellers reporting dead phones  poorly  renewed   or bad customer service  mobilespree had some decent reviews  so i took a chance  the phone arrived in a box that said  don t bother stealing me  there s nothing interesting in here   nothing but the phone and a  rd party charger   but both were in great shape  setup was painless on mint mobile  battery health was     which seems reasonable for a refurbished iphone    works well  customer service   the seller the phone started getting hot while using it with the charger plugged in  i asked the seller what was up with this  and got very prompt responses and a heads up that that is a no no generally for iphone  s overall       if you re skeptical of buying a renewed iphone on amazon i d recommend mobilespree this review will be updated if it all goes belly up      
664,1.0,                       this phone was advertised as being completely unlocked and useable on all mobile provider networks   it is not  i have verizon  when i spent a few hours trying to get the phone set up i could tell something was wrong  the phone partially worked but consistently dropped calls  and would not connect to the internet  in addition  the phone was advertised as having     or better battery life  this phone when received had only      when i took the phone to my mobile provider  they told me that the phone was not totally unlocked and that it was originally sold by att  as such it will not work properly on the verizon network  everything about this phone was a lie      
665,3.0,                       this phone was not unlocked as described  verizon could not recognize the imei number and it could not be registered  it was returned      
666,1.0,                       complete scam  iphone would not work  took the phone to the apple store and confirmed that the iphone would not work  the best part was that the apple store was able to pull up the past history on the iphone and told me that the iphone was brought into another apple store for the same reason  be prepared for a non working if you decide to purchase  complete scam  not sure how they are still able to sell on amazon      
667,2.0,                       the phone in itself looked great  and worked well  however the battery life was severely lacking  dying every two hours  the battery health in the settings said the battery needed replaced and with apple would ve been     after already paying hundreds so i sent it back  the company was really great and fast about giving a refund      
668,1.0,                       i purchased this from the seller  kanga supply   avoid them  i requested a phone with higher battery health and received a unit that was literally      this is unusable  in addition  the charging port was disgusting and so filled with dirt and lint to the point that i couldn t even plug in a charging cable  it took me    minutes to clean out the nastiness from someone else s grime to be even able to charge the phone  how can amazon consider this  certified refurbished  when the phone is notifying you that the battery needs to be serviced right out of the box  absolute waste of money  i am returning  avoid kanga supply    side note  i have purchased from the seller hybrid it in the past and they have been amazing  i requested a unit with higher battery health and they sent it to me with       the phone was flawless  they are very good and i would highly recommend them      
669,1.0,                       i should have researched before buying this iphone   it wasn t completely compatible with my carrier as mentioned in the description      
670,4.0,                       overall  happy with the value  spectrum wanted to charge      for a new iphone   and no way was i going to pay that for a phone   generations old lol  so i looked for used unlocked phones and found this it seems you either get a great one or a broken one based on the reviews but i got a good one  turned on right away with about half charge  no problem areas in the screen or any of the buttons  even the touch id  no scratches i ve noticed  in the picture you can see it has about     of battery capacity compared to new but it is used so i m fine with that number i was able to use it with spectrum right away  just plugged in the sim card  call and text working can t speak to reliability yet  as i ve had it for like   hours but happy with my purchase      
671,5.0,                       my new phone basically is pretty amazing  it was worth every penny to get this phone  it came practically perfect  no scratches or cracks or anything  i ve had this phone now for months and it s so reliable  also the battery life on them is practically new  so glad i bought this phone from this seller on here      
672,1.0,                       the phone gets so hot when charging and the battery might last    min from      to dead if this is a renewed phone it s  garbage at least you all could have put a good battery in it i don t even think this phone is a real apple it s just a tad smaller in length than my real apple iphone    i think y all make copies of the real apple products and fake them then sell the junk to us i ll never buy another item from amazon again i m deleting my account just think how much your going to lose i buy a lot well that s all if anyone wants to no how good this phone is just go to the dollar store and buy a cheap a   go phone and it will be better than this     
673,5.0,                       the iphone   arrived promptly and just as promised  i happened to lay it on my desk  next to the iphone   that i was replacing  when i started to select language and country on the iphone    the two phones started talking to each other and accomplished the set up almost without my intervention  i m sure this is a feature of iphone  but i have to commend kiss electronics for having the iphone   that i purchased all ready for a set up and update  it was so easy to do that it made me chuckle  and  now  i have a fully functional iphone       
674,4.0,                       overall i m quite happy with this purchase  it looks brand new  without any major scratches etc  it s easy to set up  despite being an older model  i m satisfied with its working speed   it hasn t shown signs of slowing down  however  the battery life is not as good as i expected  the battery drains quickly and sometimes need a recharge after a few hours  not constantly in use       
675,5.0,                       this iphone is amazing  there is next to no scratches on it and it works perfectly  my biggest concern was that it wouldn t connect to metropcs and it did      
676,4.0,                       everything was great but i notice the battery drains very quickly  it was priced decently  but i don t last through a day on a single charge and my usage hasn t changed much      
677,2.0,                       microphone didn t work  no one could hear me speaking on the phone  return was easy and quick though      
678,4.0,                       home page button is not sensitive enough  most times i have to press hard to activate when i text iget the letters cb popping up  i have to go back and delete      
679,1.0,                       problems with the phone straight out of the box   i noticed the tempered glass screen protector on the phone was cracked in no less than   places  but having never ordered a  refurbished  phone before i just assumed that was something that came with the territory  that was until less than   weeks pass and i now have a  basically  useless phone on my hands     the battery dies      every    seconds  so within an hour  the phone needs to be charged again  the original charger that came with the phone only lasted about   days before it started needing to be held in a certain position the entire time  just to charge  buying a new charger helped somewhat  not with the battery life   however  the charging port is showing signs that its on its last leg  i ve had similar issues in the past with other  much longer used phones  phones  and every time  the charging port just stops working all together  i ve had the phone for       weeks      that s it      and i m already dealing with a phone that has maybe    days left before it graduates to its next role in this life       which is     a paper weight     i know the phones refurbished  but       is a lot of money to spend  for me  on something that s only going to  work  for   weeks  i say  work  because the definition of the word doesn t really apply to this phone      
680,1.0,                       this was a waste of money  nothing but problems   it won t back up it says not enough icloud  even though i have     gb  it doesn t hold a charge  unfortunately was a little busy with covid   to deal with this piece of garbage and now can t return it     
681,1.0,                       when i brought the phone to t mobile it was locked because the previous owner had debt and still owed money on it   t mobile said there was nothing they could do but it was a useless phone for me   i had to repackage it  go to ups and ship it back and i had no present for my daughter for her bday   very dissapointed      
682,1.0,                       bought in september and almost two months to the day  the phone turns off and on on its own and won t charge  the apple store ran a diagnostics test that revealed that the phone has a battery from      that is  full  and was never wiped  there was nothing they could do for me except tell me how to buy an old iphone   straight from them they told me amazon is not a certified refurbished re seller and i won t make this mistake again  attempting to get my money back      
683,2.0,                       i got this phone in jamaica last week  and i was quite disappointed after discovering that one of the speakers are not working  the body of the phone is in excellent condition  but what s the sense buying a phone  where the headphone jack was removed to provide an extra speaker to make it louder  and the extra speaker is not working  for this i am quite disappointed      
684,2.0,                       this is not the phone  description     
685,5.0,                       fantastic phone  sprint compatible  we kind of panicked when we saw a verizon sticker on the back of the phone but it was unlocked and compatible with sprint  looks brand new  not a scratch on it  i bought this as a fathers day gift for my husband  i have one too  battery life is great  took to our local sprint store  they put a sim card in it for free and got it all up and running      
686,5.0,                       i ve had this phone now for almost a week  the reviews  though high stars  were concerning but i ve had zero issues  battery life is great  it has     health  there s no overheating  phone looks brand new out of the box  no camera issues  i don t know if the shipper has anything to do with phone effectiveness quality  but i got mine shipped from  cell savers  or something like that in ny and now it s changed to someone else      
687,1.0,                       froze over and over during setup  touch screen wouldn t work  battery life showed     but it went from      battery to    in about    minutes  i m sending it back      
688,1.0,                       i have gotten a japanese or korean phone and i m in the states  my camera shutter sound will not turn off because it s illegal there to have the shutter sound off   the phone will not stop glitching and crashes a lot  it looked like it was in great condition but it was not      
689,1.0,                       they used after market non apple replacement parts so touch id does not work  i wish i would have not spent     on this because it was amazon certified  i tried to cancel this after purchase and the seller rejected the cancellation  touch screen is iffy  freezes     no cracks in screen  that s the most positive thing i can say about this phone      
690,1.0,                       this device was a lemon   battery lasts less than   hours with minimal use and audio hardware stopped working within   weeks  i had already thrown away the box so i couldn t return it  what a huge bummer      
691,1.0,                       iphones of this model number  mnam ll a  are faulty  but not until after their   month return window  it can t accommodate software updates and won t connect to any cellular networks  additionally safari and w few other basic apps crashed  scam  avoid      
692,1.0,                       i just received the phone and unfortunately it is not working   i cant make phone calls because it has not sound and the network is unstable  i e on and off   i took it to a local apple store and on comparing with a similar i phone    they were a number differences and so they advised that the phone is fake    this is very unfortunate and disappointing because i purchased the phone based on the strength of the amazon brand and the good the reviews i saw on the site and now i have lost faith and trust in the products here   please advise what steps i should take regarding this issue      
693,1.0,                       i ordered this phone in september       it is now march      and it no longer works i understand it is a refurbished device but the supposed     pt inspection  is obviously faulty  everything was fine  phone was in great working order until the past month or so    mo  mark  when the battery  would drop drastically and soon  my phone had to be plugged into a power source to even turn on  now  it does not turn on at all  even when plugged into a power source i contacted the seller and was told it is not their problem as  we have no way of knowing when issues will arise  and there is only a    day warranty  aka just enough time that once it breaks you are right outside the warranty i would not recommend this phone or seller  it is a cheap refurbishment that will break in less than a year  and possibly a scam completelybetter to spend           more from a better seller      
694,4.0,                       this is my  st iphone and i am in love  had a galaxy s  that was problem ridden  this looks and runs brand spanking new  great bargain only complaint is that it didn t come with the headphone converter  this is the model that discontinued normal headphone jacks      
695,5.0,                       this phone is in perfect condition  works perfectly      
696,1.0,                       this phone developed a hardware problem and the touchscreen stopped working less than    days after i received it  took it to an apple store and was told it was not worth repairing  the supplier offered no help  i now have a piece for a time capsule that can be dug up in     years  terrible outcome  no support  thanks      
697,4.0,                       i got the iphone   black and i have nothing bad to say about it  i was scared to get it cuz of the bad reviews but i believe that some ppl just get unlucky  i have been lucky so far and my phone has been great  have nothing to complain about so ppl just go for it and hopefully most of u get lucky and get a good phone  i always hate to read any review  i shouldn t read any anymore   i just ordered a digital camera so i hope that it will be great too  my laptop that i ordered was great too so i can t be complaining  my mom s phone that she got on here too is so great and looks so new  can t complain  thanks amazon     
698,5.0,                       i purchased an iphone   renewed  from this company  this was my first iphone and i only purchased it in order to facetime a family member in a nursing facility  i was perfectly happy to stay with the old android  my son told me about renewed iphones available on amazon  i found one that fit my needs and ordered it  i had an issue with the battery life and after contacting the seller  they advised me to send it back to them for inspection  they always took ownership and explained to me it was operating at        capacity  which was normal given it was a renewed phone  i thanked them and asked that the phone be returned to me and i would pay the postage  the phone was promptly returned at their expense  i am beyond pleased with my purchase and especially impressed with their rapid responses to every question i presented  i think they went above and beyond to accommodate me  i would rate them    stars if possible  i will patronize them again      
699,2.0,                       ordered phone and battery drains very quickly  got a replacement and is the same   i bought several refurbish phones from amazon and i and surprise these are sub par      
700,1.0,                       do not buy   battery quality is only       more important the phone cannot pick up cellular signal after one month of use   apple identified the issue as defect in hardware   luckily it happens so quickly so it is still within warranty but unacceptable for a certified product to fail so quickly   what a waste of time     
701,1.0,                          the phone i received was not unlocked    the battery was defective and i had to buy a new one on my own  i do not trust them to take care of it what i need now is to get it inlocked on my own can anybody help i know nothing about i phones      
702,4.0,                       okay so i got the phone about   weeks ago  i decided to do this review now because i think gave this enough time  omg did i  it s amazing  i was looking at buying new phone from amazon for a month  so i really did my research on which one for me  i suggest you don t pick the first one you see  really look at the reviews  pros vs cons and what you want in a phone  so for me this was the phone for me  this phone is definitely good  don t take my word for it tho  look and try and find if this phone is for you     
703,5.0,                       the phone arrived yesterday and everything is as described  the phone is in excellent condition and everything works  great value for an iphone  will update this review if anything changes      
704,5.0,                    a pesar de ser un iphone renovado  el exterior estaba completamente impecable  realmente parece nuevo la funci n beta de apple para medir la bater a se ala que est  al      lo cual est  m s que perfecto por el precio en general estoy muy satisfecho con la compra         
705,5.0,                       so far i loved this phone when i read the reviews i was very septic on it because it said that the phone don t work with verizon but it dose perfectly fine i have loved this phone so much it has a amazing camera on it and   it works like brand new couldn t ask for anything better     
706,5.0,                       first off is the negative reviews  i started noticing a pattern  they would say  not compatible with verizon  or  metro pcs says these are defective     read the description people    at t phone    i bought two phones for my wife and i and we couldn t be happier  transitioning from cheap android phones  we both found the iphone to be superior  we simply put our sim cards into the new phones and we were off and running  awesome product      
707,5.0,                       bought from the seller hybrid it  i was skeptical of buying a refurbished phone but my iphone   s touch screen was beyond unusable and i really needed a new phone  i m really happy i bought from this seller  it arrived   days after i ordered it with free shipping and works great  no problems with my t mobile sim card  some nicks on the apple logo but doesn t bother me  i ve noticed that the phone has a tendency to get warm if you use it when it s battery is low but it is overall a fully functioning iphone    i m satisfied with my purchase so far  hopefully it continues to function well      
708,3.0,                       im only giving it a three star because the item came in with a good exterior condition and i cam able to do normal functions with the added issue where the screen would randomly start selecting things after pressing the screen a few number of times  aka  play a game    so i took it to a electronics repair store and they claimed that it needed a new digitizer so i looked up how much that would cost to  buy and it turned out that it cost as much as shipping it back   so i just bought another screen assembly and am waiting for the item to come through      
709,1.0,                       right off the bat  the screen had a gradient brightness  did they even test it      
710,1.0,                       did not last a year     
711,2.0,                       check the battery health for the first time today and the phone operates at a max of     of its total battery abilities and it dies on me so incredibly fast  at first i thought it was the case in which i had purchased as a battery charging case  which is what i always use on any of my phones that i have had previously  and thought that might ve been defective however the charging case is fine it is the phone itself and i have noticed increasing number of glitches as to the screen seeming more and more at any random time for no reason to freeze or ask non responsive to touch  as well as other system glitches such as app crashing and having webpages not load and just no rhyme or reason but noticed problems this early  not something i want to get screwed over as to paying that much for a phone in which touted such reliable sounding claims as to its  very good and well inspected and deemed in fully great  and totally intact and working status as to be all but basically good as brand new and thus passing to be of  renewed  quality    hardly      
712,1.0,                       terrible  i bought two iphones from them and the same picture both phones were used and in horrible condition     i returned its immediately     that took my time and money     never trust photo was fake         
713,5.0,                       when needed i have always purchased used phones for myself and my kids off of our neighborhood fb buy sell pages   when my phone broke a few weeks ago i couldn t find anything good on fb so i decided to try a refurbished one through amazon   good move on my part   this will be what i do from now on   i love the fact that i received a    day warranty which obviously i don t receive when i purchase on fb   this particular phone that i purchased was in excellent condition and works fine so far   i am very pleased with this purchase      
714,5.0,                       our iphone   s charging port was faulty  however apple wanted us to pay them      for us to send that phone in  and they would in turn send us a refurbished iphone    so i knew amazon would have it cheaper  this was much better      
715,4.0,                       the charger provided is cheap and makes the phone extremely hot going to have to throw it away and buy a real iphone charger also the touch on the screen stalls very often i purchased this for my   year old for christmas the stall was during set up going to give it a few more days to stop if not i m returning     
716,5.0,                       this is my first time buying a used phone other than from the apple store  so i was a little bit hesitant  but i needed a phone quickly after i swim with mine in the lake   however  i ve had my iphone   now for nearly a week and a so far it has been great  if there were any problems with the phone i wouldn t know it by now  we shall see overtime how the battery holds up      
717,5.0,                       the phone had a bad battery when i got it  but the customer service is great  the best i have ever had on amazon  got back to me immediately and worked with me  i can assure you that if you have a problem with the product  they will help you get it fixed  i recommend this product and seller        
718,1.0,                       first phone i was sent was scratched  replacement only lasted   months with minimal use    do not buy from this seller if you want to get your money s worth  i cant begin to say how disappointed i am in the quality of this purchase     feelingscammed  wasteofmoney update  turns out the seller is selling non usa iphones which cannot update their ios which makes them unusable   phone not activate without this update   hence it is a complete waste of money      
719,2.0,                       don t buy from this user  i purchased an iphone   jet black  not black  know how to place an order next time whoever is in charge for selling these phones on amazon  the speakers work fine and the phone in general as well works fine  just honestly know how to place an order next time dude  if someone chooses the color jet black give them the color they want  just don t scam them it s not right that they are spending like      something for the phone and color they want  meanwhile your giving them a color they didn t even ask for      
720,2.0,                       i ordered the iphone   in gold  it worked for the first day  however  within    hours i was experiencing errors with updates and connection  the phone claimed that it had not been updated and disabled me from accessing cellular data  or sending receiving calls  the device itself was in great condition  but did not function as a cell phone i had tried updating  backing up  and completely restoring the phone several times using itunes through my laptop   but the error notifications persisted  this purchase is a hit or miss   perhaps the phone i received had not been refurbished properly  i would recommend buying an apple certified refurbished phone before going through other buyers  you just never know what you re going to get through other companies      
721,4.0,                       i ordered   phones with this seller  they came on time and well packaged  i have noticed batter life is not the greatest it only lasts half the day unless recharged  but that is how it works with iphones so it was to be expected  one of the phones has an issue with the camera not focusing unless you close app several times   reopen  absolutely no problems with the touch screen at all it works perfectly  also both were ready to step up   half way charged when they arrived  only real complaint i would have is both chargers have stopped working in the matter of   weeks  both have been plugged into the wall outlet  phones have not be in use while one charger either  no misuse of chargers at all   they both have completely stopped working  i would purchase from this seller again in the future as long as chargers were better quality      
722,4.0,                       the visual quality is perfect  you cannot tell it s a used phone   the battery was at     however it started saying no service around   months after buying it   it also is not the model i ordered i ve discovered   i ordered a      but received a a       i m contacting the refurbisher now to see what they ll do about this      
723,1.0,                       so it s been about   months and this phone just gave up  nothing works  can t get an update so i tried to reset  now  it can t even start  says it can t get the sim card or activation info or some garbage  maybe it s this company not doing a good job or maybe it s iphones  i don t know  i m pissed      
724,1.0,                       bought this phone   and it quit working after   days   found out this model was recalled by apple  but is still being sold   what the heck amazon       
725,2.0,                       the phone was in great condition and worked well  but the charger port could barley hold a charge  you had to hold the phone at the most awkward angles and still most of the time it still wouldn t work  customer service wasn t much help either  they acted like i was lying and it should have worked just fine  i wouldn t suggest buying a refurbished phone  if you re looking for an iphone   or newer  spend the extra money and get it new  this is way to much of a gamble      
726,4.0,                       this phone looks and acts new with one exception  the battery life is abysmal  apple showed me how to see my battery health and actually did a remote phone  health check  which indicated a battery capable of charging up to about      the issue is the rapid discharge rate  just sitting idle next to me the battery typically goes from      to about     in four hours or so  again  while sitting essentially dormant  apple will replace it for     but i don t feel i should have to take a phone that is inspected and sold as like new and immediately perform maintenance on my end  maybe amazon would like to split the cost of replacement with me  sure don t want to have to return it and go through authorizing  activating another phone  yikes      
727,1.0,                        inspected and guaranteed to have minimal cosmetic damage  which is not noticeable when the device is held at arms length  bs    this phone is in horrendous condition  i didn t bother trying to charge it so i don t know if it will power on  it is so scratched up that it s useless anyway  there is the typical screen protection film on it so  at first  i could only see ow dinged up the back was  that was really disappointing by itself  then i remove the film and  omg  the screen was a mess  you can very easily see the damage at way more than arm s length  the phone is going back and i will also leave feedback for the vendor  blue beat digital cr  thanks to amazon for their painless return policy      
728,2.0,                       the phone i ordered came with a tempered glass screen protector on it with is grate  there were little to no signs of scratches on the metal back  the best part was i ordered a   gb model and they ended up sending me a    gb model the main reason i gave this review   stars is because of the battery life  it could hardly hold a charge  i checked the battery health in the setting on the phone and it said      batters severally degrade  my battery only lasted me about   hours total before it need charging      
729,1.0,                       no  despite   session with verizon and   with apple consultant  and repeated attempts to get an appointment at the apple store i ended up spending a week trying to get this phone  that looked great and was advertised  as being suitable for verizon  to work  finally mailed the phone to apple and got the phone back  days later with a note saying that i needed to take it to an apple store  no explanation  another week to get appointment    hours at apple store  they said phone was corrupted  in frustration ended up buying new phone that day  have bought other rebuilt phones that worked fine  for years  lots of hassle and time  no cell phone for      weeks       extra dollars  not so great     
730,1.0,                       when i received the phone it worked good for a   days now i cannot hear when anyone calls me or i try to call them  battery life is good about the only thing that is good now  everything is acting weird on the phone volume is doing weird things i updated everything on the phone ios etc  took the plastic film off the phone is in good shape but i feel like it will cost me more just to go get it fixed for whatever it is wrong with it if you want to order from this i would do some better research than i have done  go somewhere else when shopping for a phone      
731,4.0,                       i just received this phone today and its pretty good although it was very dirty on the back of the phone and all the features seem to be working just fine also it doesn t come with the original box  it comes with the apple usb cord though  but i m dissatisfied that it didn t come with the apple charging box and instead it came in a random white box with a random box charger  i m still happy with the phone but for      it s not worth for no other utensils except the actual usb cord  hope it hep         
732,2.0,                       have this phone just over six months it glitches  turns off all the time  battery drains fast  phone won t shut off even when the battery is at       the amount of money i spent on it i should have gotten more than   months use  wouldn t recommend      
733,1.0,                       phone was not unlocked when it arrived  was still locked by at t  had to call apple care and at t before i could get the phone unlocked and operational      
734,2.0,                       phone was fine but it was locked to wrong carrier after contacting them and them saying it would work but still did not  so i just switched to tracfone  which the phone was programmed for i ordered  fully unlocked  which was one of the available options and out of   only recieved was a fully unlocked phone     
735,1.0,                       i ve bought two of these one for myself one for my fianc   hers completely died about two weeks ago  took it to my electronic repair guy and we tested the whole phone and it had no power no matter what we did  now mine continuously gives me a cellular data error and from what i ve researched means that the cellular signal receiver is dead      
736,5.0,                       this was a gift for my granddaughter   appeared to be in excellent condition   i charged the battery before gifting   i don t know about battery life  touch screen or camera quality at this point   price comparable to the other phones i considered   received it from the seller sooner than was expected      
737,1.0,                       i was very upset that this phone shut off every     minutes  the phone appeared to be in good condition from the outside  i called apple to help fix the issue but they were unable to find a solution so i had to return it  i am disappointed because i had to wait for the phone to come then wait for it to be returned to get my refund  however i did get a full refund      
738,1.0,                       i bought this phone for my son for christmas and it wasn t unlocked  i m still waiting on seller to respond  i may return the phone  what a hassle      
739,1.0,                       i had phone problems almost immediately  the phone worked for about    days then it started having issues   by the time i got sick of the issues i called about the warranty and was turned away and told to go to apple  per apple the phone was fraudulent and there s nothing that they can do to help me they refused to touch the phone and they sent it back to me stating they detected on authorized modifications  this phone is listed as stolen fraud       
740,5.0,                       pick this company tech venture when deciding on a refurbishment phone   mine is a replacement phone for one that was insufficient from another refurbisher  that transaction  will not get a   star review   this is absolutely the company to go with  it came out of the box and set up just like iphones  from the apple store  decent battery life  and the rest of the components  including the camera facetime are flawless   it is clean  the power cord is not original  but i could not care less  it works      
741,1.0,                       i was sold a defected phone and i will never buy from this seller again  my daughter back camera jumps when you turn it around to look through it and now her phone is saying no service at the top   so i go to best buy to see if they can tell me what s wrong with it to find out that there was a recall on these phones because of them having a the no service at the top  i don t recommend this seller to nobody      
742,2.0,                       battery life was depleted when i got item but was bearable  haven t had the phone very long and now says it s battery life is critical    got less than   months out of this phone  almost uses the entire battery life from one phone call terrible idea to buy used phones apparently      
743,5.0,                       i got exactly what i thought i d get refurbished iphone    works great  fully unlocked  no issues as of yet  and it came early      
744,5.0,                       i never owned an iphone before  to make a long story short   i got iphone from ebay was no bueno  i m glad i sent it back and bought this phone  its great  it looks brand new and no problems  easy setup  thank you      
745,5.0,                       if only i had known about buying smart phones this way  i have wasted many hundreds of dollars over the years  as long as you make certain that the phone you want is compatible with your service provider everything should work well  the exact phone i received was in perfect condition  had a battery health at      and and a perfect screen  i am very very happy with it      
746,1.0,                       the phones cellular did not work and had no service  but return was easy      
747,1.0,                       i bought this phone to be use out of the states because it says fully unlocked  well  is not fully unlocked and the battery doesn t work  i could not have a full battery  every time i charged the phone it last less tha    minuets  i had to pay the international shipping and the a domestic shipping to return it  the worse experience ever      
748,1.0,                       when i received the order the phone wouldn t charge at all   with the charger they sent or any charger  i was so disappointed because out all things why would you send someone a phone that will not charge  that definitely could ve been avoided no doubt     
749,5.0,                       received the phone about  a week ago and was very impressed when i opened the box   i was expecting to find a phone that had some normal  wear and tear  like scratches on the screen and camera lens  some wear on the case  etc    i found none   this phone is new as far as i can tell  even the battery life is at       i ordered a full unlocked phone and upon arrival  dropped my sim card in and we were off and running  no hiccups   from now on   i will buy a renewed phone for me and all of my family   thank you amazon       
750,1.0,                       really hope you guys stop u stop selling these models a      there is a supposed hardware issue with these models that came up with apples recent        update and it will suddenly say  no service  tried to restore phone because of frustration and now cant even use apps nor activate phone with itunes or aftermarket ifix it style apps  extremely unhappy really should have returned it when it came and immediately said battery life was at    percent at its fully charged capacity  they claim that is the threshold of minimal battery life needed for them to get rid of these  kinda wish they put that in item description  benefiting off peoples lack of knowledge is cold and im sure company s will just point the finger at eachother this point  save the hassle  dont buy      
751,5.0,                       bought this for myself and i worked amazing just had to charge it when i got it but my at t sim card in and had no problems at all it even came with a screen protector on it  definitely worth buying no cons about this iphone i got it in mint condition     
752,5.0,                       great phone  i had an issue with the enclosed charger  but the supplier was great about it and sent a new charger without any further hassle  received it   days later  loving the phone      
753,1.0,                       i got   of these to replace   of my phones  the first one would not hold service  i took it to my provider   times  i d have to keep restoring factory settings and turning the phone off  after about a week of trying to push through it  i had to return this phone for a refund  it took a while to get the refund  but it was given  the  nd phone had to be sent back because it was not unlocked like it said that it was  that refund happens fairly quickly and easily  great experience with the seller  just not great with the product  i ended up having to just spend the extra money and getting the phones from my provider      
754,5.0,                       we knew it was a refurb and expected a scratch or dent  but no  i could not tell any difference between it and my recently purchased brand new from apple iphone    we have not yet tried using the international capability with a foreign sim  which was why we wanted this model  but i commend the seller for clearly identifying the exact model   a huge issue with the iphone        
755,1.0,                       this phone is one of the models of that have  no service  issues   buy from different seller or have many issues with your phone      
756,5.0,                       like everyone who s looked up on these iphones i was spectacle but honestly it s kind of a game of chance  some people get really bad phones  some people don t  i was lucky not to get a bad phone from buyspry  good screen and over all look  no battery issues or shut off moments  sign up was great  speakers and camera works  all buttons work  no complaints so far  i ll keep you guys updated if something becomes off or anything negative happens update  phone description changed after my purchase to at t and the phone was not compatible with my network leaving me iphone less because i m returning it  way to waste your money and time      
757,2.0,                       the phone was a japanese model which has some restrictions  for example  you can t turn off the camera shutter sound  this is really annoying and can t be changed with phones sold into japan      
758,2.0,                       i bought this phone because i needed an i product  either an i phone or an i pad so that i could change the settings on my fitbit charge   watch   it does do that   however  as a phone  i liked the lg stylo   better   it is a matter of personal preference  and there are a lot of people who are very happy with their i phones   i am simply not one of them   the phone works  and i am using it   that is the best i can say for it      
759,1.0,                       very low quality control screens scratched phone is scratched as well   was supposed to be unlocked to any carrier but that is not the case phone will not program  definitely would not recommend and definitely will not purchase from them again      
760,2.0,                       worked fine for awhile then got  buggy   i tried several times to get it to load the new operating system     but it kept locking up  had to factory reset a couple of times  i tried again and basically the phone has turned into a paperweight   so  i got from september to almost april with it  i give it two stars for that     buyer beware    a refurbished phone may be great     may be ok    or it may be bad      
761,3.0,                       the phone i received has a loose charging port that should have been replaced  it was at     just now and i plugged it in and opened an app  now it just gave me the under     notification so it s obviously struggling to keep the cord in place      
762,1.0,                       haven t even had this phone a month and it it won t pick up service anywhere anymore i have had to switch back to the iphone se i have had for years  even without the sim card in this phone all it will say is searching for service  i left it on the charger and let it search for    hrs and still nothing  buyers beware this product is faulty update  apple wants me to pay      to repair a product that was faulty when they released it i did some research and apparently this is a common problem with the iphone   but they want to charge me to fix their mess up  i will never buy another apple product ever again  nor will i ever buy a phone from amazon if it isn t brand new i don t want it  also i cannot return the product due to the corona virus outbreak delaying delivery s so it didn t make it to the seller within their allotted time and they sent it back  in other words buying this phone screwed me out of           
763,5.0,                       i ordered this for my husband since his was so old  came quickly and so far seems to be in great working order  i would definitely buy from this seller again      
764,1.0,                       the home button was broken  it was very disappointing to get a phone that i could not even set up to use  this caused me to be out of a phone for weeks and out of money while waiting for a refund      
765,1.0,                       i bought this product for someone overseas   i trusted it because of the amazon renewed guarantee   before leaving the country  i powered the phone up but nothing else   fortunately i was very clear with the recipient that the phone was second hand   upon receipt  the new owner found the camera did not work   in time this was joined by the main button  the sim card connection  and more   a local apple certified repair specialist said the phone had been stripped and filled with knock off parts  poorly installed   he offered     for the shell   by this time i had continued my travels and was no longer in the vicinity of the phone  so i had no opportunity to bring the phone back and return it   i suspect the amazon seller  supremedealscr  of behavior ranging between bad faith and outright fraud   i think the amazon renewed guarantee is worth nothing but a guarantee that you will engage with their returns department   a total disaster      
766,1.0,                       the phone was locked   therefore unable for me to activate  sprint told me it was actually still connected to the prior owners account  i returned it   was sent a replacement which had the exact same problem      
767,5.0,                       the phone looked almost brand new with no defects that mattered   it was unlocked as promised  and the battery has at least     of the life of a new battery   i use total phone  and it worked perfectly right out of the box both in setup and copying information from my iphone   to this one   you can t go wrong with this phone and especially for the price      
768,1.0,                       this phone was not as described at all  when i went looking for a fully unlocked iphone    i was specifically looking for an a     model  and that s what the page said  when i recieved the phone it worked fine at first  but later in the evening when i was adjusting the audio from the phone  i couldn t mute the shutter   no matter what i tried  i did some googling  and one suggestion on an apple forum said that japan   korean model phones cannot mute the shutter sound  they have privacy laws in those countries  due to excess upskirt photos  i went into the about setting in the phone and saw that the model number ended in j a  a japan model phone  here in the us having your shutter noise not muted is socially unacceptable  i think it is dishonest advertising on their part  obviously a japan model phone is going to be cheaper  because nobody wants that extra restriction  and they were charging just as much as other iphones that were completely unlocked  the whole experience was awful      
769,4.0,                       i needed a heftier phone rather than my iphone   but i didn t want a huge screen or a       price  i ran into a difficult problem that high level apple support eventually solved   this was a configuration issue because of the multiple apple products used in my phone  this would have happened even if i had bought the most expensive new iphone  it was difficult to eliminate the phone itself and the carrier as issues  the point here is that apple rendered first class support free for a used phone  the basic installation was easy and fast  the phone appears as if it were new  and i saved a lot      
770,1.0,                       bought this phone from kiss electronics  had a defective camera   i had to pay for return shipping  what         
771,5.0,                       some bad reviews but i bought one anyway and it is just fine  have not had any problems at all with a refurbished phone  i would buy it again  it did not come in the original box but it did come with a basic wall  charger  no earduds  i ve had it for four months and no problems so far with operation or battery      
772,5.0,                       perfect condition  great new phone for my    year old without the heft price tag of a brand new phone      
773,1.0,                       had to return  could not get phone imessage facetime to work  battery health was also only at      seller did work with me to try and resolve issues and ultimately issued a refund  maybe i got a bad device  ended up getting a device from gazelle  i ve read some reviews and it seems that some devices come from asian markets and that could be why they don t work as advertised or expected      
774,3.0,                    el tel fono es muy bueno pero tiene problemas de bater a  aparece un mensaje de problemas con la bater a  se calienta demasiado r pido y se descarga demasiado r pido  es lamentable que vendan productos que est n en malas condiciones  uno entiende que es renovado pero  que tengan ese tipos de pron sticos es lamentable           
775,1.0,                       i got this iphone     gb gold  as a gift not expecting a new phone as it had a small scuff on the top left which i can live with but could of done with out    just my luck  my main issue with the product is if you are claiming something is renewed or refurbished and amazon is putting their name behind it it should be just that  the ear speaker where you put your ear to listen was full of dried up crud from god knows what  i assume it was a mixture of pocket lint and ear sweat that i had to carefully scrape off with a tool  just to be able to see the actual mesh screen underneath and get good sound quality  that was not the only location where a had to do this procedure as the bottom speakers mic area also had this gross crud covering the screen and affecting the sound quality  all the little circles had to be cleaned out just to see the mesh screen underneath and get better sound not to mention the lighting plug socket was also full of lint smh  another area where i had to clean some of this same crud was on the silence button on the bottom and top of it  i could not see the red strip that lets you know the phone is on silence  i didn t return it cause it was a gift for the same day that it arrived on  so i didn t have that luxury  but i would of  amazon needs to do a better job with setting standards to these third party vendors as they are tagging these items with prime shipping and warranties using the amazon brand which i ve never had an issue with till this product      
776,5.0,                       don t know haven t traded it over yet      
777,5.0,                       the iphone came in a one condition no scratch no nicks damn near looks like it was brand new battery life is     that s ok other than that great buy     
778,3.0,                       battery life compromised from day one  charging port appears to have been replaced with a low quality port that is inconsistent with apple quality  charging now requires  special handling  to achieve positive connection      
779,1.0,                       the phones battery is garbage  aren t these suppose to be refurbished  when i asked the seller he gave me a link to troubleshoot the problem like what        
780,1.0,                       bought this phone for my daughter   th birthday  she cried she was so excited only for it not to work properly  the battery wouldn t stay charged  couldn t access certain options due to the defected of the screen  if you touch certain area on the screen it will not work      
781,5.0,                       i ve used this phone for almost a whole year  this was a great phone  and i m now upgrading to the   plus  it came with     battery life  the only thing that was weird with it is that turning off all volume options didn t silent the camera shutter sound  other than that  it was great  came with a screen protecter  no sim card  no scratches  it was unlocked  great phone in general  i had my time with it      
782,3.0,                       the product is good  i honestly read the reviews and saw that everyone wasn t having pleasant times with this phone and it stressed me out  my phone has been working fine for months  although my charger hole is slightly messed up and my charger tends to fall out  the battery life wasn t too good but everything else worked  i think it was a steal for the price      
783,5.0,                       my first time buying a refurbished phone  i spent about      for the iphone   with    gb and it came totally intact  fully charged  and with a complete phone charger  it also arrived two days early and i had no problems setting it up  will update if anything goes wrong  but so far  super good       
784,5.0,                       i m still within my    warranty from amazon renew   the unit arrived well packed and i cannot find any blemishes or scratches on this iphone     it was reset to factory settings so migration from my iphone   was simple   battery life so far appears to be good i ll update this if there are issues within    days      
785,4.0,                       as an android user it s been hard to figure out  but i m learning  it s just different than what i m used to  the camera is awesome  but i thought the battery life would be better  as i m on my phone a lot  a lot    but still have to be cautious and always have the charger when i leave the house     
786,1.0,                       just go look up  iphone   model a      and tell me what you come up with  the device had a known issue  whatever  i m not happy about it  but i strongly feel like it s something that the seller should have known about before sending me the device it needs an update that it refuses to install  install new update so you can use cellular data    cannot install new update without cellular data  when you google the errors and the model  you can see that their only resolution is to send apple back the device  preferably before march of       which means it really should have gone back at least   years ago  but you sent me a device that is supposedly working   hmmand then i m paying for the shipping to send you back the garbage you sent  i want a refund plus the    i spent for shipping it back  if i can get that back  then i ll gladly change my review to say the seller was great but apple sucks as much as usual      
787,1.0,                       after purchasing in july and having a completely enclosed case it won t charge  the apple emblem flashes briefly but doesn t charge and until it ran out in battery it displayed a very almost imperceivable dark gray screen and could not even shut it off   tried with   emails to the seller hybridit    no response  after talking with an amazon customer service rep i m currently waiting another       hrs for that inquiry results        
788,5.0,                       after reading reviews i was nervous purchasing a refurbished phone but i am so happy i did  this was a gift for my ten year old daughter and it was a hit  she said it was the best present she got  so much storage  color was so pretty   it was flawless and had no issues  will purchase again  looked brand new      
789,5.0,                       i took my chances and ordered this phone despite all the negative reviews  it arrived on time   days after ordering  came with a glass screen protector already on it  a power adapter brick  and charging cord  i updated the phone to the latest ios software using itunes and it took a little longer than expected because the cord provided would sometimes disconnect but that s not really an issue with the phone  i work at a certified iphone repair geek squad  so i ran full apple diagnostics on the phone  it passed all diagnostics and the battery health was at     which doesn t really bother me because apple only recommends a battery replacement under      no issues activating the phone through metro pcs after providing them the imei number and then transferring the sim card  the phone has a very minor ding scratch on the bottom of the enclosure but that can be expected from a refurbished phone  overall very happy with this purchase  i ll provide updates if something comes up though      
790,1.0,                       brought this phone into t mobile  stolen phone  and could not activate it      
791,4.0,                       i received the iphone   on july          a few days earlier than expected  the packaging was good and when i seen the iphone for the first time i was impressed  the iphone came with a glass screen protector already in place  along with iphone i received a lighting cable and a standard apple charger  no lightning adapter for the earbuds  in fact no earbuds at all  my iphone   shows little signs of wear  no major dents or dings on the aluminum casing  that s the good news  now for the bad news when i checked the battery health  it was at      this iphone   charges normally  but drains quickly  time to take a trip to the apple store and replace the battery  when the battery is replaced  i should have a device that will receive two or three years of ios upgrades      
792,5.0,                    en primer lugar deberia decir que cuando lo compre y luego lei algunos comentarios me puse nerviosa  no sabia que esperar de este producto   pues dire que me llego   dias antes del tiempo estipulado y que  el producto fue lo esperado    por mi parte lo recomiendo   para quienes necesitan ya salirse del iphone     s      un salto al iphone   seria lo recomendado   si no quiere gastar mucho dinero   espero este comentario ayude a otros a tomar su decision         
793,1.0,                       the phone sent to me did not have battery life of at least      it was at      furthermore  this model has an active recall and i had to take it to the apple store for them to replace the logic board so that i could actually use it  this was done for free  but the hassle was from being sent a product that may not have been properly checked as amazon says it does for renewed products  disappointed with the product that was sent however  now that i have a fully functional iphone    i love the phone      
794,4.0,                       this was a good buy  not a great buy because the battery was beyond its lifespan when i got it  the seller was very generous and offered to cover the cost for the repair so everything turned out good  the phone is in good condition and everything else is on point  other than the battery i have no complaints that are related to the purchase  unrelated to the purchase though  if you have big hands like i do you should probably get the   plus or something because i ve have some trials with this keyboard  in that same thought it is better than the se i had seeing as it is even smaller      
795,1.0,                       i gave everything   star because even though i know these phones are used you would think the phone would last longer than   months after paying over      for it   i emailed the company only to receive an email back telling me they are closed so i looked the company up and sure enough it says they are permanently closed   next step is to contact amazon but since i didn t pay the     product warranty i m sure i m out my money       
796,1.0,                       i m working with the seller to return the item the item was received with a dark area on the bottom of the screen  my daughter said she was ok with the dark area  it s a used phone  so not a deal breaker over the last several days  i have installed three different sim cards trying to activate the phone   tech support from my carrier worked diligently to help me rectify the situation  i decided to take the phone to a repair tech  sure enough   the phone is defective these things happen   i guess  it s still frustrating  the only problem i have at this point is i believe that the seller s description is misleading  this phone could not have been  renewed  or even thoroughly inspected i m hoping the return process is simple        
797,1.0,                       i purchased a  like new  iphone   in august      from breed  the iphone   i purchased from breed was missing several internal parts that caused the battery electronics to fail but not until after the    day warranty  the phone was missing the internal frame dust seal and two metal brackets that helped to hold the battery in place which i provided a photo of to the seller  these parts are impossible to know are missing unless the phone is disassembled the seller did not accept responsibility for providing a defective product      
798,1.0,                       the model i received was a faulty model  it took me forever to figure out what was causing the phone to not connect to sim card networks  it started to happen right after the return policy ended and would just say  searching  or  no service  even when i was definitely in range  i was about to give up when i found that apple will repair phones from this model  amazon won t let me post the link but if you google  iphone   no service repair  you should get the info  the people at the apple store knew exactly what i was talking about so it seems to be a common problem the phone is fine but be prepared for this headache if you end up with the model that has this issue      
799,5.0,                       my fianc  s other iphone s screen was cracked and went down from there  i got this phone for him as a replacement  took a couple of days to arrive but it was well worth the wait  after getting it to a shop to activate it  he s loving it      
800,3.0,                       phone arrived with only     maximum but capacity and after two weeks had a major hardware failure on the motherboard and had to be returned  the glass was in good condition little to no scratches  camera was operational and took good pictures  speakers were nice and loud  all in all it was a good phone minus the defects it arrived with  i m returning this one and ordering another hopefully this one isn t a lemon as well      
801,1.0,                       purchased item for my preteen  put on my phone plan and everything worked great for about a month or two  then stopped working to make calls to devices other than apple  took in to phone service provider and they informed me that someone has reported the device stolen  and no other features will work  attempted to contact seller a week ago and still nothing  as it is past the return date i am now stuck with a device that we can not use  and am out nearly          
802,1.0,                       it s a crap  this iphone is having so many problems  battery life is very bad  speakers are real bad  i barely can hear from speakers phone is slow and takes forever to open anything from websites  so many miner damages on screen and body   i want to return it and i want my money back waste of my time and money  very horrible seller      
803,1.0,                       phone doesn t even work for at t  i took it to the at t store and they don t even know what service it s for  i have to return it now     
804,5.0,                       i bought this even though i did read a lot of the negative reviews  my phone came four days early  had no problems at all with it  the battery isn t that good but can always be replaced  however i did buy the phone specifically for verizon carrier  i think most of the negative reviews are for the unlocked phone  if you do not want all these issues just get the one with a certain carrier      
805,5.0,                       perfect phone with a great price  it has an awesome battery life and was completely cleaned and had no scratches     
806,5.0,                       the phone came very quickly  with cheap shipping  when it got here it came with a charger  a sim card key  the thing to open the slot in the phone   the thing i liked the most was that the package also came with an unused bubble wrap pack as well as a packaging label in case you needed to return the product  phone was already charged to     when received  and set up easy  i m using it to write this review and probably would have never guessed it was refurbished unless the listing said otherwise  looks and runs like it s new other than a slightly quicker battery life  definitely would recommend the seller     the whole purchasing process and the overall quality of the product just seemed very professional to me      
807,5.0,                       i have a hard time hearing and i found that if i hold the iphone on edge  i can hear very clear  it was like new and as for working condition  my headline tells about it for now      
808,1.0,                       after using it for about six months it had a glitch where no calls or texts can be done on the phone apple stores were closed googled the problem was due to a corrupt update tried many things came down to resting the phone now its just a useless brick     
809,2.0,                       the phone mic  speaker stopped working after two months  the wifi is spotty at best and the screen was replaced with a low quality one   i don t recommend buy any products for this seller      
810,5.0,                       great price  works great  battery fully charges  my daughter has had it for over   months   have not had a single problem with it   it was unlocked we just stuck the sim card in and no problem      
811,5.0,                       updated           the phone stop working after     months because of the antenna  it had been sitting in the drawer for   months until i brought it to apple to fix and replace a new battery  it work again i got the phone and spend couple hours to test it out to make sure is ok  the phone is in excellent condition looks and works like  brand new  excellent value  it was     brand new when it first came out  everything works fine and very easy to connect to carrier  only suggestion to seller is to replace with new battery  i m ok to pay more if it comes with new battery  overall  excellent value for what you get          
812,4.0,                       i just left seller feedback that the battery gets drained in three hours after only having the phone for one month   it appears that the crew had a scada app running in the background   sorry for the bad review it was my error   if there are any other issues i will be in touch  however  it does it appear it was our fault   thanks     
813,5.0,                       camera is a huge step up from the iphone  s  very please with the price and quality of the iphone   that came to my doorstep in one day      
814,1.0,                       i have bought this cell phone one year ago  two weeks ago the cell phone had problems and we took it to mac apple store in panama but they told us that this product had factory problems and in usa apple warned about this and people needed to return back to mac but when i bought it i have never read about this mac warning or vendorsaid about this  now we need to buy a new cell phone      
815,5.0,                       when i got the phone it looked great was very happy to see in such good condition only problem i had was battery life was only     i contacted seller and came to agreement of partial refund to be used to replace battery would buy from seller again as they were easy to deal with     
816,4.0,                       the phone came in with a couple of scratches but hardly noticeable and it looks like new but there was an issue with the model type  iphone  s has two types of models that had network issues   no service  maybe the seller should ve known about the issues with these models and not sell them but i don t put them at fault  be aware of models a     and a     i received the a     model when i purchased this phone and had to bring it to apple and took a week to fix and they did it for free now the phone works wonderfully and basically brand new      
817,5.0,                       had to order a sd card for it  as it does not come with one as stated  other than that so far this phone has been really good      
818,1.0,                       this review is for the amazon  renewed  program product iphone       gb gold phone sold by jemjem   amazon renewed   battery was shot   came completely depleted of its charge   if you google information on lithium ion batteries  you ll find that letting it go completely dead is a really bad thing   the sad thing about  renewed  products  as opposed to apple s own  certified pre owned  is that the battery isn t changed out  jemjem is particularly guilty of leaving the product in a vulnerable condition   apple puts a will put a new shell and battery on its refurbs device s screen had noticable scuff pits but when the screen is illuminated  i don t see deformation of the graphics   as soon as you put a screen protector on it  those defects will show     there was an inconsequential scuffing on corners but that was tolerable   dirty too   damage was easily visible at arm s length i fully charged the iphone    disconnected the power and let it sit with no functions  no wi fi  no sim card  no use  screen off    the battery stayed at      for nearly   hours   within    minutes of web news reading  no video or animated ads  etc   the indicator was down to      the battery is a bust the apple battery condition indicated a maximum battery capacity of       not a minimum  the description of the renewed products made     sound like a hardline minimum i see documentation that the refurbishment  renewal  was done             just short of   months of my receipt   with a shut off phone  the battery drops to     that s a bad harbinger i guess you can just plan on taking the phone you just bought to the apple store and pay an additional     for a new battery     i m on a budget but stuck also  there was dirt in the ring silencer area and around the bottom speaker holes  i was grossed out and wiped it with electronic device cleaner  groooooossss  the charger looked a little rough but my kid won t be putting that up to her face  this was my first amazon and apple  renewed  purchase     pretty disappointing  having bought a handful of amazon warehouse returns in past years  it was hit and miss  this was definitely a miss   one final tip     do not be desperate like we were   if i had an additional week to buy  i wouldn t have messed around and rejected this minutes after seeing the quick battery drop  update   a few days have passed    amazon will be getting a call     this experience will solidify my distrust of their  renewed  program and the vendors involved        
819,5.0,                       apparently it is thought that every iphone purchaser is a seasoned user  this is my first iphone smart phone and the fact that the phone came with no instructions was quite disquieting  thank goodness i have good friends to help  what i really need is a    year old grand child      
820,5.0,                       my package came on time and the iphone   looked new  there were no scratches or marks on it  it s unlocked so no bundled apps to bog down the system  it works great with t mobile  i paid     of what i would have paid if i went to the a store  it has the larges memory and the best price and functions well so far      
821,2.0,                       i am very disappointed that i purchased this and when i arrived at sprint i was told it was not compatible  this phone is not compatible with cmda certified for claiming it was unlocked  also the phone cord that i received with it was not an iphone certified cord and when i plugged it in the cord was so hot that i could not touch it  it was undersized allowing it to heat up from the current passing through  and the phone was not detecting the cord was plugged in      
822,3.0,                       it arrived late and thats why i am giving it   stars  the iphone it self arrived in a great condition      
823,4.0,                       could not put it on booze the mobile but only get it on verizon someone did not pay off that bill     
824,5.0,                       i refuse to  lease  a phone through a provider  so i take my chance on third party sellers  amazon has an excellent return policy  so this is where i come  i was very happy with the condition of the phone when received  very little cosmetic damage  as said  phone speaker seems a little wonky  but i use blue tooth headphones  and don t stage concerts for those around me  so this hasn t been a real issue  just sounds a little staticky when on speaker  battery needed to be replaced because it drained pretty fast  husband did that wit a     battery off amazon  so  less than      for an iphone with     gb makes me happy     
825,1.0,                       my phone worked for   hr and then wasn t able to connect to cellular data  i tried updating it and restoring it and it won t activate  seems to be a stolen or jail broken phone  asking for a refund or a replacement      
826,1.0,                       day   when i made calls people said it sounded like i was under water and my speech was muffled   day   the video function stopped working and day   i couldn t hear anyone calling in or out   then when calls came it it was pure static   this refurbished phone is junk      
827,3.0,                       phone appeared to be flawless when it arrived  it stopped recognizing any sim card after   months  even though it was a few days out of warranty when it died the seller still took it back for a full refund      
828,1.0,                       battery life is good  but not like the new one         update after   months of purchase   don t buy this renewed product  iphone that we purchased got into a motherboard issue and so i cannot use it anymore      instead of spending money on this   better buy a new one by spending the extra money      
829,2.0,                       i actually never write reviews  i am a business owner and i know what it feels like to have a bad review posted  that being said i want to warn the consumer i ordered the phone it being factory refurbished i new it was risky but  the savings was enough to consider  the phone worked for a total of two days  then began to shut of and continue restarting and then saying on for about   second and shutting down again  i then had to go a verizon store and just get a phone because i needed a phone by that time   hear is the biggest hassle to return the phone you have to take iphone cloud off  i couldn t do that because my phone wouldn t turn on  i called them and they sent me a link  i had to login and switch the phone to no longer in use  for most people that may not be a problem  i m not very tech savy so again it was just more of a hassle the company did have amazing customer service they picked up right away  that why this isn t a   star  they also had an easy solution to turning the iphone  cloud off      
830,5.0,                       got this for our    year old middle schooler to replace his old iphone      he is happy with it        
831,1.0,                       iphone   had a dead lcd screen out of the box  it would make noises and vibrate but the screen was black  the seller doesn t answer their return phone number and doesn t return emails      
832,4.0,                       it s awesome and great value    the only problem i have found is that i can t hear anyone on calls unless i use speakerphone and it won t adjust   guess good thing i don t call a lot      
833,5.0,                       i bought this for my son for a birthday present because his iphone   was outdated and he needed more memory  did not want to buy him a      phone so i took a chance on this and i gotta say i am impressed  phone looked new only hairline scratches on screen and not noticeable  very happy with purchase  will be purchasing again for daughter      
834,4.0,                       hey  it s an iphone  i did have to buy ear buds for this unit as none came with it the phone is ok  but the battery is horrible      
835,5.0,                       the phone arrived looking and operating as if it was brand new with a working power supply  as stated in the description it does not come with a sim card  i simply took it to the local at t store and then moved the sim card from my iphone   to this one in a matter of seconds free of charge  the price and experience were so good  that i may never buy a brand new phone again      
836,5.0,                       this was a gift for my granddaughter   the price was in line with others i considered   i don t think the cord was an iphone cord but it did charge the phone before i gifted it   unknown about the battery life at this point      
837,1.0,                       speaker is messed up have to put it on speaker phone to talk to anyone also already actived the phone with my cell phone carried never returned it cause they charged me     to activate then     to inactive it and then another     to active my old phone again and by the time all that would have been said and done this phone would have charged me almost and extra      on top of the      i paid for it         
838,1.0,                       phone operates ok however u do not get what is advertised  it s advertised as an at t phone  upon calling at t one will discover the phone is not an at t phone it is from a carrier used in japan called kddi  if the phone i get is locked there is no way to unlock it  the seller does not respond to messages and offers no resolution whatsoever  extremely disappointing      
839,5.0,                       i was skeptical to buy a phone after all of the bad reviews i saw and the broken and shattered screens    my phone came perfect and the battery lasts long  this phone looks brand new and i love it      
840,1.0,                       came out defective  after sending it to the facility to get fixed they sent it back still defective and didn t reimburse my money  wouldn t recommend      
841,4.0,                       the phone is well functioning  the battery health is      looks like new  no visible scratches but does have dust inside the speakers  holes and the front camera seems to have dust inside as well because the pictures are not as bright as on my wife s phone  same model   came already with the protective glass  i had this phone for   weeks and overall satisfied with my purchase      
842,2.0,                       when the phone arrived it was loose in the box  it appeared ok so i didn t send it back  i bought it in april at the beginning of the pandemic with very limited choices to buy a phone and my old phone was not working  i contacted the seller letting them know how the packaging was in case of problems later with no response  i have had many problems with the phone  i contacted the seller again with no response  i would not recommend this seller      
843,1.0,                       the phone i ordered was defective so i had to return it but the seller was prompt with the return     
844,3.0,                       i ve bought two of these  but not for a good reason    the first one i got from a seller named buyspry and unfortunately it looks like they don t repair the phones they work on correctly  i didn t really take concern about this until after i spilled a glass of water on my table  some of which went onto the phone  these phones are rated ip   water resistant  but this particular phone repaired by buyspry was not properly sealed if you do a little research you find these phones require you to remove all the old adhesive between the phone screen and the phone chassis and install a fresh new one  this is one of the primary things maintaining water resistance among a few other details  anyway this phone clearly had not had its screen adhesive replaced  there was chunks of it exposed going around the edges of the screen   which left just enough of a gap for water to ingress the big sad thing here is this happened i m not kidding one day after the    warranty ended  i contacted the seller to inform them of the problem and asked if they could do anything  they didn t at all seem concerned their phone wasn t repaired correctly  nor did they offer any form of compensation for their poorly repaired device so i ended up buying a new one  from a different seller named hybrid it  it has been over a month now and i so far have had a good experience  the first phone i got had a poor health battery as indicated in iphone battery information  i contacted the seller about it  and they immediately corrected the problem  they sent me another phone which has a      battery  so far this phone has been perfect and i haven t had any issues with it  i also can clearly see the screen adhesive looks like it is brand new  hopefully this one will hold out moral to the story  if you at all find anything concerning with your purchase of an amazon renewed phone    don t hesitate  don t take chances    get them to make it right  some of us are more picky than others  but my main concerns on repaired phones are the water tight seal and the health of the battery  it is going to be very difficult to find a perfect condition used phone  so you have to pick what you care about most  good luck      
845,1.0,                       did not operate properly for much more than     days   apple took it back and we got another one for just a bit more money      
846,5.0,                       when i first received my phone it would sometimes lose cellular signal   with ios updates  or just as time passed  the issue got worse   i googled the problem and discovered that it was included in a free repair program offered by apple because some models had faulty components   the repair included a battery replacement too  i m happy with my purchase from amazon and with my repair from apple   this was a nice upgrade from my iphone se which only had    gb   the size of the iphone   is very comfortable and with     gb i no longer have to delete some photos to make room for new ones   the condition of the renewed iphone was as described by amazon      
847,5.0,                       works great so far  had it about a month and have had no issues at all  it was for my daughter and isn t connected to a network just wifi and seems perfect     
848,4.0,                       bought this phone for my nine year old granddaughter who loves to dance and sing   she tapes herself in different situations dancing  singing  gymnastic positions   she loves it and i love to view her videos      
849,1.0,                       when we received the phone it was in great condition and worked wonderfully  however  within a few months it began randomly dropping service which would drop calls  then  the problem progressed until the service was dropped permanently  we took the phone to the apple store where they explained there had been a  manufacturer defect  with the hardware and said they would replace it  when the replacement phone came in  apple told us they found  other  issues with the phone and would not replace it  with no other choice  because the phone could not be used to make or receive any calls   we had to purchase another phone from apple  very frustrating      
850,1.0,                       i purchased this watch in late april      and the logic board failed in december        the phone cannot be repaired since it no longer can make phone calls the serial number on this phone  at the apple store showed it was fixed in jan      for the logic board  and sold on amazon  after that repair   i warn buyer beware when purchasing a  refurbish phone from a third party seller on amazon      
851,5.0,                       my    gb   got knocked over by a   year old the other day and some wonky pixel lines messed up my screen  so that i couldn t even unlock it   i got this     gb black    and now i have tons of room   it looks and feels brand new  charged like a champ  battery life has been great  camera is wonderful even using my iphone   case   i could not be happier   seriously  i m dancing around about this purchase      
852,5.0,                       price was among the best i found for an unlocked iphone     the phone arrived in excellent condition with no scratches nor noticeable defects   delivery was earlier than originally scheduled  arriving in just two days   this iphone   replaces an iphone  i ve had for several years   touch screen is excellent   responsiveness  in general  is a huge improvement   battery seems to be holding a charge well   haven t taken video or pictures yet  so no rating on camera      
853,4.0,                       bought this phone after destroying my other one  this phone was a great little thing and had good battery life  the reason i give   stars is because it was not water resistant like my old one  i got water on it and half the screen went black  but rice did the trick and it lasted another   months after that  the phone was still good when i traded it in      
854,5.0,                       no issues at all  my son said it worked perfect and we had it set up with the phone carrier in minutes      
855,5.0,                       by reading a lot of people rating  i decided to take a chance to buy something is not new   the result is great   the phone is perfect to work with t mobile and iwatch series     almost like new   delivery is very fast during covid    difficult time   thank you for all your effort to make customer satisfaction      
856,3.0,                       worked out of the box  found it was hard to charge  cleaned out the charging port with a toothpick and found a lot of pocket lint  hmmmn  not really a thorough refurbish  tho it gave me hope that the prior owner had dumped it on that issue  battery life not great regardless a month later it started giving a  no cellular service  and i find on research that there is a documented factory flaw in one of the chips  by restarting the phone cell service can be restored  but an intermittent irritation  took it into the apple store and they found no issue  only recommended replacing the battery  which i had them do  interestingly they charged the same as mr fixit in the strip mall      gave me a phone with real battery life the problem however continues to crop up about once a week  apple said it was fine so they own the fix if it becomes chronic for the price not a bad deal  love the fingerprint entry feature      
857,1.0,                       the product is listed as unlocked and available with straighttalk  it is not  i sent the first one back after the store rep told me it was linked to verizon and the second one was linked to at t  luckily they were able to resolve the issue for me at the store but it was such a waste of time  my interactions with the seller were not great  they did not seemed concerned with their errors and took their sweet time responding and getting a replacement shipped to me  i have been using the phone about   months now and am already having problems with the notifications glitching  the screen freezing   and more recently my phone will randomly decline to make calls    i will probably be looking for a new one sooner rather than later  though my original plan was to keep this for at least two years   not a happy customer      
858,2.0,                       my phone was having issues with the microphone  so i could not make calls   i thought i could delay getting a brand new phone by getting one refurbished   this phone was in worse condition than my phone i had issues with the home button only working sporadically   i could not take a screen shot   the phone features worked  but everything else was so random   between the apps shutting down and the camera not always working it was just not good enough to use for the price i paid      
859,5.0,                       this phone is awesome    i use it everyday   when i got this phone it was in perfect condition  everything worked perfectly   the only thing that didn t work good was the battery life  it came with a pretty bad battery  but all i had to do was order a replacement battery on amazon and change it and it was only      so i would highly recommend this phone      
860,1.0,                       phone arrived in prestine condition  with a new charger to boot  however it is defective  my phone doesn t pick up signal from any sim card that is inserted  it is a known issue for iphone   s that start with serial   a      my iphone starts with that serial number and because i m not the original purchaser apple is charging me      to fix the issue  fix this      
861,1.0,                       phone connected to the phone provider for   days then it would not connect again  product was in good shape and seemed to work good  for the first couple days      
862,5.0,                       i upgraded to the iphone   from the iphone  s  this phone works great  all i had to do was move my sim card from my old phone to this one and set it up as you would in any other phone  the battery life on this phone was at     when i got it which is the only thing i m a little iffy about  the phone comes with only a charger and a screen protector so you will need to buy a headphone adapter and headphones separately  it also doesn t come in the original box  otherwise no complaints  would definitely recommend      
863,1.0,                       no stars here  after a week of trouble with this phone i finally took it to the apple store where the diagnostics revealed a defective antenna  the seller should have known that the iphone   with the serial number of this phone had this defect  apple offered to repair it free of charge but it would have taken up to    days and i was leaving on a trip and had to have a working phone  so i had to trade it in and buy a replacement  i lost     overall and many hours at verizon activating the first phone and many more hours at apple resolving the problem and getting a replacement working phone  i willnever buy a phone fro amazon or one of their sellers again and i suggest anyone considering it to beware      
864,5.0,                       i bought this phone as a christmas gift for my dad  when the phone arrived  i noticed some cosmetic flaws on the back  i wrote a brief  complaint  online  i received a response from the seller  electronic deals  immediately  the gentleman i received an e mail from was albert  he urged me to call him and albert left his personal cell    i called and got an apology right away  no excuses  he asked how he could make my experience      satifactory  albert offered to send me a replacement phone right away  after talking with albert i decided to keep the phone  knowing i would have a case on it and the flaws would not be seen  we decided on a fair compromise that we both could live with  albert  electronic deals  was the utmost professional  down to earth and understanding my dilemma  he done everything he could to make me happy about this purchase   albert offered me choices with no restrictions  i wished all sellers could be more like electronic deals  i recommend to everyone to buy from albert and this outstanding seller  i will definitely be a life long customer of electronic deals  thank you albert      
865,1.0,                       had to return iphone  did not work with tmobile  took it to tmobile to make sure it ll work  they tried everything they could and couldn t get it to work i m going to order the other refurbished   that isn t on this page but on amazon for     more  hopefully that actually works      
866,2.0,                       after having it for a short time the phone no longer turns on  it died once plugged it in and the apple start screen pops up but it never turns on it stays this way     phone has never been dropped and in a super protective case not sure what happened  very disappointed though      
867,1.0,                       i am very disappointed that this is not a truly unlocked phone as advertised  i tried to get service through verizon to find out phone was purchased through sprint  sprint will not unlock the phone until there is a    day service use with sprint  i use verizon      
868,5.0,                        i have only had it a few days  i love this phone transferring all my info and pictures from my old phone was easy  and the screen on this phone is a lot bigger than my old one   and i love it        
869,4.0,                       shipped as promised  nice packaging extra items which were nice  so far so good  will update if there is a problem with the battery life or anything after i have used it awhile      
870,4.0,                       i was confused by the packet  i received with item  it said iphone  s   i was ready to return im a new iphone user  i was kinda disappointed with charger not working   had to buy additional one to use phone   overall its a great item       
871,2.0,                       bought   of these phones   first one was good  not issue   the second one came and battery health said battery was at     and should be serviced   returned to amazon and they replaced it   the replacement had same issue   the description states the phones will have a battery health of     or better   two strikes     ended up sending back and will go with a different seller or store      
872,2.0,                       i had reached out to their support directly both through the email provided in the packaging and also directly through amazon and have gotten no response after   weeks i am very confident this phone has had it s screen replaced and with a substantially lower grade panel than the original from the factory    battery health out of the box is showing as only      even though the listing specifically says it will be at least       the screen has a burn in mark all along the lower edge   the color seems very pale and washed out compared to my other iphones which have more bold colors   the screen appears to have been replaced  there is a very obvious edge along where the screen meets the phone s frame  i can feel this with my fingers every time i hold the phone  my other iphones are smooth along this edge    touch sensitivity is noticeably worse than my other phones   i purchased this phone specifically to play pokemon go  so i have constant side by side comparisons of how it performs compared to other iphones otherwise the phone performs well  is very stable and cosmetically in good shape  but the defects with the screen stand out a lot      
873,5.0,                       great product  was so excited it got here early      
874,1.0,                       great product to start off with  but i buy a phone for it to last more than    days    when warranty ends after    days and then the product fails  it is based on them knowing that having warranty lasting for more than    days is too much of a product risk better to buy an android phone for the same money from a proper store than a used iphone that you have to throw away after just over    days      
875,1.0,                       iphone speaker didn t work properly   seller lied and said i returned iphone broken   i didn t   seller only issued     refund   amazon made it right though and issued full refund   i still will never buy refurbished again  this was my first time   good thing the phone acted up during my warranty period   luckily i had a   month warranty   the whole process was not worth the hassle though      
876,1.0,                       i received mine from cr land the first phone had scratches all over and only static came out of the speaker grill during calls my replacement had muffled sound and a faulty battery      
877,5.0,                       they were great and the iphone was in excellent condition and would buy from them again  there service was great      
878,4.0,                       nice product works fine but the battery life is not like they said i think it s a matter of chance to find a battery life over      the gets discharged real quick  everything else works fine     
879,2.0,                       from my assumption these renewed phone are old broken phones built back up with new parts then sold well i got the phpne looked great but the battery health was only    and it would go from full to dead in   hours my crappy    phone lasts   hours full charge  it also would not sync anything bluetooth  i worter the seller and got nothing back so i returned it and they accepted the return   weeks ago but never processed a refund so i had to call amazon to get it  literally doing their job but if you want a good phone look elsewhere      
880,1.0,                       i got my  renewed  phone on my birthday  i was so excited  opened the box and put my at t sim card from my old phone into the  renewed  phone  everything seem to work fine until i tried calling someone  it would call but i couldn t hear them  tried turning it off  then back on and it worked for about       minutes then i couldn t hear them anymore  tried several ways to make it work but no success  amazon approved a refund but now i have to go through the process of printing off a return label  taking it to a shipping company and waiting up to   weeks just to get my money back  not an ideal outcome for the consumer  a lot of time wasted for nothing with zero compensation      
881,1.0,                       the phone iphone       gb   black  came with a fried modem  within    hours an alert saying  carrier update failed  popped up  after that i had no bars  instead it was replaced with  no service  and a warning icon besides the defective internals  the outer casing and glass were in good condition  only minor nicks in the aluminum from the previous owners case i m currently sending the phone to apple for the iphone  no service  repair program  as it is still eligible      
882,3.0,                       the phone itself looked great and everything works as it should  that being said  the battery life was only     so it needs to be placed on the charger throughout the day  for the price paid it should have been much better     
883,1.0,                       don t do it  got the phone in december  it is only march and it is literally falling apart inside the case  came with tiny cracks and a  screen protector  already on it  but i watched a crack expand across the phone right in front of my eyes as i was using it  even with the screen protector on  it worked for only   months  not worth it      
884,5.0,                       the phone is in very good condition  the carcass did not have any type of scratch  mark of blow or damage  the touch screen works without problems  the quality of the audio is very good when making calls  apple s own functionalities work without problems  it includes a generic charger and does not include headphones     
885,1.0,                       ordered the phone for my sisters birthday  was very excited  the phone didn t come in an original box and did not have earphones  nor the original charger  purchased a total wireless sim card for it  and appeared to be impossible to connect to total wireless because the phone was still under verizon  tried to contact the seller several times  but the seller hasn t responded  very disappointed      
886,1.0,                       listed under  unlocked phone   phone is not unlocked and the prior owner still owes money on it so it cannot be used at all      
887,5.0,                       we had bad luck with another seller   an unsuccessful set up that took hours ending with returning the phone  looked and reviews and saw the high percentage of satisfied customers   i  too  am one   phone was in great condition  as described and set up was done in a blink   phone and battery are doing fine with no issues   would buy here again      
888,5.0,                       great phone love it   great pictures      
889,5.0,                       i love this phone  looks brand new and was a great price  the battery is decent  maybe a little low to some people      i believe  but i always let my phone die and leave it alone until it s finished charging  my experience with iphones is the older generations are designed to have poor battery life whether they re used or brand new  so  really  no complaints there  it works great  feels and looks like i got it from the store  i love it all in all  i give the phone   stars      
890,5.0,                       after reading both terrible and great reviews for this iphone       gb  i decided to give it a shot  it arrived   days before it was expected  and was sealed nicely in its own little box  albeit not an original apple iphone box   the phone had protective plastic on all sides and came about     charged  the phone had   scratches whatsoever  sim card slot and insert fit perfectly  no wiggling buttons  no obvious signs of  non original  replacement screen  buttons  etc  aesthetically the phone is     clean besides just a teeny scratch on the back  called to my service provider and had the phone      operational within    minutes the   negative point i would like to make  which was clearly explained in the product description  is that they only guarantee up to     battery capacity  personally  mine has     battery life  keep in mind  when purchasing a refurbished iphone  you will have some capacity lost for       this phone is spot on  i recommend to anyone      
891,5.0,                       came unlocked and use it on cricket  just as it says  the quality of the phone  even refurbished  is very good  not a scratch on it  battery life is very good  charger that came with it works well also  satisfied      
892,5.0,                       my wife and i have ipods and ipads but have been using android cell phones for years  i wanted to switch to apple phone but with the high entry cost have waited  i decided that i wanted an iphone   renewed so i check the feedback on various sellers  i chose to buy from buyspry and could not be more pleased  i could not find any scratches or marks anywhere on the phone  it appears to be new  the phone was unlocked so i had no trouble moving it to my old carrier  i actually use tracfone and moving was an easy process  i highly recommend buyspry and will use them again when i purchase a replacement for my wife s android and she moves to iphone      
893,1.0,                       i ordered this phone specifically because it said it was compatible with verizon  after a long and tedious process  it turns out it is not  the employee at verizon who was trying to help me said this often happens with phones purchased on amazon  i decided to check around and see what carrier it is compatible with  and could not find any  do not buy this phone or any phone from amazon  as they are not practicing truth in advertising edited to add  i learned now that the problem may actually be with all iphone    evidently the iphone   had a major problem on some sort of internal chip that makes it stop reading sim cards and messes up the iein      
894,5.0,                       great phone nothing wrong works perfectly no dents scratches no nothing i would have thought it was new if in original packaging you should buy i recommend     
895,5.0,                       phone came in great condition and with accessories  i bought the     gb for less than the price of a new    gb so i m very satisfied with this phone      
896,5.0,                       got these for my kids starter phones  they were able to be used with our verizon account  which mailed us free sim cards and then activated them over the phone      
897,5.0,                       was a little concerned by some reviews stating this was not compatible with verizon  this one stated that it was cdma   gsm compatible  so took the chance   and glad i did   it took about    minutes to login to verizon account  provide the info they needed about the new phone and make the switch from my old android phone to this new  refurbished  apple phone    easy peasy   also  as a refurbished phone  i was expecting it to have a few dings  scratches     when i inspected it out of the box   not even   scratch or ding on it   very clean   it looks brand new   the only thing that indicates it was pre owned   refurbished was that it already had a screen protector on it  which i wanted anyway and now did not have to buy or hassle with putting it on   so  overall and hopefully without jinxing my wonderful new phone  knock on wood   this was one of the best purchases i have ever made on amazon   the phone is fantastic  works and looks great and i did not have any compatibility issues with verizon      
898,2.0,                       the phone we ordered was delivered very promptly and the overall physical condition was as described in the product description   however  after using the phone for   weeks  we found that it will not maintain a battery charge   has to be plugged in  in order to use it and since we are in rural vermont with no apple stores  we have to travel to a best buy store over an hour away and hope that we can get the battery replaced when we get there     disappointing     
899,1.0,                       like many others have warned  do not buy  this product came terribly shipped with none of the original packaging  the phone was seemingly in  ok  condition  however after powering it up was a completely different story  the phone had a electric crackling sound  would randomly vibrate  was extremely hot to even touch and had stress pixel fractures all over the screen amazon claims that this is  certified refurbished  however it isn t  a   year old kid would know its broke  really ashamed amazon puts their name behind this one  do not buy and do not buy from breed     
900,5.0,                       i am very happy with my reconditioned phone  although the battery health rating is only      other than that everything is working well and it was in perfect condition  no scratches at all  fingers crossed that it will keep on working  the price for the    gb was the best i found  shipment was super fast  thank you  i am a happy customer      
901,5.0,                       love my phone  on it right now as i m writing this review  have had it for about  months or more and it s still going strong  only thing is the battery  like almost every iphone battery  it eventually starts to die sooner then usual and seems like u have to keep it on the charger constantly  but other then that i m very pleased with buying this and would      do it again     
902,1.0,                       ordered a  fully unlocked  iphone and was completely unable to use it  i contacted both my carrier and apple care and no matter what it wouldn t work with the sim card from my old phone  i also had to go to a verizon store and an apple store where in the end i lost out on     and a lot of time  apple ended up just buying the phone back from me and i bought one through them instead  the tech at the apple store also ran a full diagnostic on the iphone i ordered from this vendor  the battery was only at     capacity      
903,1.0,                       this company needs to be closely watched because i made a purchase and they said the phone was fully unlocked but it was not i want to at t to try and get it unlocked and the apple store and they told me to send it back to where i get it from it was no good they could possibly unlock it but it will cost me an extra      to have it unlocked they are charging me to ship it back to them when in the fluid off the phone was locked     
904,1.0,                       the phone did not work  inserted sim card and got an no service message  would not make any calls or text unless on wifi  so basically i had a ipod  i took it to the apple store and they let me know that the no service was a known issue for a couple of years now of a certain amount of iphone     so that would have meant that the seller would have known of the issue and failed to disclose the problem       
905,2.0,                       i bought two phones intending to give it to my kids as a gift  phones took a verizon sim card with no problem  and i confirmed that they was able to make receive calls   one bonus was that they both came with screen protectors already on them   what completely ruined both phones was the battery life   i charged both phones to full and turned them off  intending to wrap these up  when i powered them on the next day  the battery percentage was at     on one  and     on the other  on the silver one  i noticed it was blinking an apple logo on and off every minute or so   mind you  this was with both phones being powered off   this is downright appalling  and if it does this when the phones are off  then it means that the battery life when the phones are being actively used is next to nil  this is not       i am not buying corded phones   i m giving an extra star on this review for customer service  as the seller approved the return almost immediately  and issued the refund when the products were returned      
906,1.0,                       i ordered the phone mid february  and it worked perfectly fine until now  it s may  three months later and the phone has a  no service  issue  i had to get in contact with apple and i m gonna have to ship it out to them to have it fixed  i paid      dollars for a phone that broke after the    day guaranty was over  do not buy this       
907,5.0,                       i hesitated buying a new iphone because i have been so addicted to my old one  but i needed more storage and battery life  this has proven to be a jewel      
908,1.0,                       i purchased and received an at t compatible iphone   in black   days ago  and it appeared to be working just fine during setup  not the case    at the end of the activation process  the phone needed me to update to ios        before it would transfer any of my data  contacts  messages  etc  or even read the sim card  after the update installed  the phone restarted and went to a black back lit screen just after the apple logo appeared  i tried to do a forced reset  holding power button and volume down button for several seconds  and the same thing kept happening over and over  apple logo popped up for a second   and then back to black screen  i dealt with amazon troubleshooting customer service as well as apple and i was told to just return it   so now i m going to have to return this item with no ability to wipe my data from it because before the black screen of death appeared  the phone had me log into my itunes account to restore a back up from the cloud  so  needless to say i m really pissed off and nervous about my data being out there with this random effing phone   will definitely be changing up some passwords      
909,2.0,                       we ordered three iphone   to replace older models  each of them came from a separate amazon vendor  all of them were advertised as being refurbished  all of them look fine on the outside and seem to function well  but  all three of them have batteries that apparently were not replaced or refurbished  the worst of the three is the one being reviewed here  the battery health feature within the ios reports  your battery s health is significantly degraded  and displays that the maximum capacity is      down from     when i first received the iphone   when i recently tested the standby time  which is supposed to be up to ten days for the iphone    the result was that the battery was at     of capacity in two days the battery health feature on the other two iphones reports     and      respectively  not what we expected when we ordered refurbished devices  can we get the batteries replaced  yes  should we have to do so shortly after receiving them  no you have been warned      
910,5.0,                       i bought this to replace my old iphone    old phone would drain the battery in a few hours  and would constantly lose cell signal even when i was in an area that had good service  only way to get it working was to turn it off  drop it  and turn it back on  after replacing the battery and the cell antenna  no change  so i broke down and bought this refurbished one  and so far am very happy  looked pretty much brand new out of the box  battery life seems as good as a new phone  and it works perfectly  swapping phones was easy  just updated ios on my old phone  did an icloud backup  powered off old phone  swapped sim card into the new phone  went through setup  and restored from the icloud backup  presto  i have a newer version of my old phone  with all of my same  stuff   and it actually works  and for far less than buying a brand new iphone  couldn t be happier      
911,5.0,                       had this bad boy  iphone   product red    gb  about     months now and it s all been smooth sailing  i have a lot of music and a couple hundred photos  still over a hundred gigs of internal memory left tho  and it runs fine  phone looked and works like relatively new after an update to current ios  haven t encountered any issues  surely nothing any rational adult wouldn t expect accept from a phone that isn t brand spanking new and the envy of their friends  i m more than satisfied with my purchase now that i ve had it for a while and no bad things have happened  oh and i kept it raw for the first two months and dropped it more than a few times  from i guess hand height  without too much of any cosmetic damage  i d definitely recommend a fiber glass screen protector though as it has really saved my rear  case is optional           
912,1.0,                       upon use of the device  i discovered that the microphone and speakers did not work with any application  i tried all the tricks  factory reset  double checking sound levels  permissions  flight mode  etc   and nothing has worked  contacted service provider  but they said it was a faulty device  contacted gadget replay asap and they said they would forward info to techs  who have not replied  i spent a lot of money on this phone and expect it to work like a phone  i am a medical provider and need a reliable device for when i am on call  very disappointed with the experience and hoping a bad review will get the company to reply to my emails so we can arrange a refund replacement     
913,5.0,                       as described  no marks  no scratches  charges completely to     per cent  i am very well pleased with my purchase  i got the larger memory    gb for less than the asking on the smaller others  reviews were mixed but took it  to att  they popped in a new sim and it is like a brand new phone  great deal  works like a charm      
914,1.0,                       the phone worked wonderful only for a week then i started receiving the message iphone can no activated because it is require ios update  even the phone has the latest ios  then i search to fix the issue and this is a very common issue for a     phones  so please before selling renew items check all this details  because this is consider as a scam        
915,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          like most people  i tend to look at the reviews before any purchase  i can simply say this  those bad reviews can either be fake or whatever is wrong was self inflicted  my only issue thus far is the brick isn t exactly a best one  and that the battery drains semi fast  my solution for the battery is to let it hit zero then recharge it to a hundred without touching it update  i ended up replacing the battery which wasn t an issue for me  runs amazingly  speaker quality great  video runs great  no lag  never had it freeze on me or  shut down    i say this is a great buy  go for it update    it s been   months and here is the phone itself with a screen record of it running well      
916,1.0,                       worked great until i updated it and the cell modem was broken  the phone couldn t recognize some cellular part in its system so it refused to get signal or anything  it was handled by a third party so it completely screwed up the phone  apple refused to repair it because of the third party parts in it  waste of money  i had to buy an entirely different phone     
917,1.0,                       keeps going to no service   very upset     called my carrier and it is not on their end     took out sim card cleaned it   turned phone off  on    works for a short time  then goes to no service     
918,1.0,                       pos   i bought this assuming i was getting a decent phone just a few gens behind but the price was constant with others only   terrible first off i had to send it in to get it to update because something was wrong with the o s and secondly the battery life is pure garbage not only does it only last made an hour and a half on a full charge before dying but also runs super hot   don t not buy from this seller cause they clearly don t test their products or don t care about their customers  what a waste of                   
919,1.0,                       i am livid i purchased this product despite negative reviews regarding the quality of their phones due to more recent positive reviews  leading me to believe perhaps they d learned from previous bad transactions to perform every necessary quality assurance test prior to shipping their product to the buyer with this product being a phone  one would think the most basic check this seller couldve done would have been to make absolutely sure this phone was able to make phone calls first  it took     ninutes just to boot up  it was stuck on the white apple logo screen that entire time  my first indication that i was mistaken for having given this seller my benefit of the doubt once fully loaded  i do that very basic test one does when they acquire a new phone   i attempted a phone call there was absolutely no audio in the receiver and on top of that  the speaker phone button was greyed out and unable to be selected as an option so i checked all the volume settings and tried it again to no avail i restart the phone and still no audio i googled the problem and much to my dismay discovered that this is a common hardware issue with the iphone  s and it requires opening up tbe phone and using a soldering iron on the audio chip  in other words  not a simple software solution i can perform myself for the life of me i cannot fathom why after so many negative reviews regarding the quality of their phones this seller would choose to not do elementary quality tests before shipping to customers or why theyd send me a defective phone that i cannot use  i am beyond upset      
920,5.0,                       compared to the latest models this is an inexpensive way to get a decent phone without a contract  we have had the phone a few weeks now and it works like a new one      
921,1.0,                       the condition of the phone looked perfect  very great quality  it would heat up quickly after barely any use  and the battery life was short  about   hours  i will return it and decide if i ll take the gamble again  the return process seems straightforward      
922,5.0,                       i bought this for my grandma since she needed an upgrade  she had the iphone    this was the best price and value i could fine  when i got it  it looked brand new no scratches no issues whatsoever  all i had to do was switch over the sim cards and just back up her old phone to her computer then just transfer everything to this phone  she absolutely loves it  incase anyone wants to know it comes with a new charger and wall plug and a sim card removal tool and that is it no headphones  those are sold separately with this unless you purchase straight from apple   only buy this phone if you have at t and this phone can t be used for other carries it specifically says in a note card that comes with the phone     
923,2.0,                       i bought one of these phones and within a few weeks it was no longer able to make or receive a phone call  i ended up contacting the seller who told me they didn t have one for me to exchange with and that they would allow a refund  looking on the website there was another one for me to get so i ended up biting the bullet and just bought another of the same phone thinking i just had bad luck  i ended up having to pay     to ship the old phone back but at least got my refund  the second phone i bought was more expensive by     than the first for the same exact phone  which is probably why the seller wouldn t exchange and lied saying they didn t have one  the second phone i got at least works and can make calls still  but the battery is     unlike the     minimum as promised  i m not going to lose even more money to send this back so i ll deal with the bad battery  but definitely would not recommend buying from this seller  i ve bought two phones and had poor experiences both times      
924,4.0,                       purchased as a backup phone for my daughter  in case the touch screen went out  the purchase price is almost equivalent to replacing the glass on the iphone    battery life is at     when received  her current phone is at     after owning it for several years so not much difference  the generic charging cable that came with the phone does not work  at all  the wall charger is generic and works  i threw the cable away as it would not charge any iphone we have  it says  accessory may not be supported  when plugged in to the xr    plus and    overall everything on the ios works as usual  it did arrive completely erased  but only with    battery charge  the back of the phone did not have any scratches  the glass has one small scratch  but not noticeable after a screen protector is put on  after the initial start up and logging in  i made sure to update the ios so it is current  everything else works as it should  pricing fluctuates constantly on these  so keep an eye on the price before purchasing  if color isn t an issue  check pricing on the other colors as well      
925,1.0,                       no shade to amazon  because this is an apple hardware problem but the iphone   has a hardware problem where it stops connecting to your carrier after a few months and cant make calls texts  use data  get a different model      
926,5.0,                       the phone was really good and did not look used  it came in a box that only had a charger box and charger cable      
927,5.0,                       purchased this phone for my son and ended up getting one with issues activating due to receiving a bad phone from t mobile  the seller responded very quickly to issue a new phone that worked perfectly  the seller also sent a screen protector and a small credit  free of charge and without asking  quick response times  got what i ordered  and professional  i would buy again  thank you      
928,4.0,                       perfect phone  unlocked and works with t mobile  battery  no marks and functions exactly as it should  one complaint is that the previous user did not fully clear the phone  their apple id keeps showing up here and there and i just try to ignore it      
929,5.0,                       this phone was has adverticed used very good  i feel very satisfied      
930,4.0,                       came exactly as described  it looked brand new   the battery life was      it was a gift for my    yr old daughter and she said it works perfectly  i would recommend buying from this seller      
931,1.0,                       i returned my iphone  to amazon after   weeks because of repeating no service and self restart problems  i tried to fix the problem twice by restoring the phone using i tunes  first time  the phone was having problems to activate after restore  but it was finally able to do so after a good number of tries  it worked for several days and then failed showing a permanent no service problem again  then  i tried to restore it using i tunes once again but this time it was not able to activate after many attempts i found out that this was a known problem with iphone   s and that there was a recall by apple regarding this issue more than   years ago offering to change the logic board in all these faulty phones  so  i decided that it was better to return it      
932,5.0,                       i have been using the phone for a few days now and it s worked fine  the only issue is with the touch screen  since i had the same  sluggish response occasionally  issue with my last iphone  i assume it s the design  not this particular device  battery health is as advertised       there are a few minor cosmetic flaws  nothing really visible unless looking for them and they do not affect the operation of the phone  so  again  a few days in  i am satisfied with the phone      
933,5.0,                       an excellence so far  no damage to it  it s an unlocked to t mobile for prepaid service  i am working on getting my my iphone to connect to hearing aid compatibility service so  i can talk and hears from another line with a person easier with baha processor        
934,5.0,                       received prompt delivery of the phone  i inserted my  sim card  and the phone was functional with no issues and i could make and receive calls right away  so far so good  i received the phone which is cosmetically in very good condition and i am quite happy with my purchase with exception of two minor issues which i believe someone could provide me guidance to resolve or trouble shoot     sometimes the person i am talking on the other side complains not being able to hear me clearly  likewise  sometimes i cannot hear the other party while receiving calls  this doesn t happen always  may be     of the time  note  that my bluetooth headset works fine  and even when phone earpiece and microphone are not working  i could use bluetooth headset to make and receive calls  with no issues  however  i cannot carry my headset with me all the times  especially while i am  working outside       even though the  battery health  shows     but the battery drains very quickly  i am running in low power mode and turn off all applications that i don t use  also i don t use web browser or watching videos  i only use my phone to talk and text  why the battery drains so quickly and how i could remedy that   i ve been using phone for just few days  i ll update my review as i do further testing note  how could i find out which particular model no  of the phone i received   it shows mn l ll a  whereas i expect to see something like  a     or a      i am thinking of contacting apple support if they could  offer any help thanks so much      
935,5.0,                       i bought this phone for my   year old wasn t looking for it to be perfect just work  i m very satisfied with this phone  screen works with no scratches on it or the back  it came with a charger and that looks new and charges the phone  i haven t checked the battery life yet but it seem to work ok because it s not draining fast and my son is on facetime most of the day  the only issue i m having is the front camera i can tell has a scratch or something on it making the picture a little blurry  i expected something to be wrong having refurbished phone  all in all great phone happy with purchase  waiting on sim card from phone company so not sure if the phone is fully unlocked yet like it says  i ll write another review later      
936,2.0,                       something is wrong with it  phone overheats very easily and gets to a really hot temperature despite very minimal usage  the battery also drains out oddly fast despite the fact that i did not even touch it for a day to test it out  but it does charge fairly quickly  i have not kept more than one app on while using it  i use it for precisely   minutes and it starts to overheat in my hands  i got a case for it  and i still feel a lot of heat burning it up  i avoid using it while it is charging and i don t leave it in hot environments  it  just  overheats like crazy  also  there was an empty slot in the package  as though an item  that was meant to come with the phone  is missing  i don t know what was supposed to come with it  but i got a charging cord and the phone and that is it  i will research later about the missing item  anyway  i expected an upgrade from my iphone   because of various issues but it seems as though i purchased a  better  phone only to run into new and more concerning issues      
937,1.0,                       my phone just stopped working after about   months  it said the sim card had been stolen even though the phone was next to me the whole time  my carrier couldn t figure it out so the phone is defective      
938,5.0,                       excellent condition for a rebuild  looks and sounds brand new  arrived with a tempered glass screen protector already on it  easy to add to service  no issues at all      
939,5.0,                       i bought the device as excellent  grade a  but the device requires maintenance of the battery which has a maximum capacity of    i am waiting for a response from the seller the seller was super honest and refunded the battery as i had requested recommend          
940,3.0,                       the phone itself is awesome besides the fact that the shutter sound never turns off  every time i take a photo the entire world knows about it  i ve taken it into at t to get fixed and all they could do was factory reset it  this got rid of the shutter sound for about five minutes  then it continued again  it s an annoying situation that i unfortunately have to deal with  the only solution is to constantly reset it  this is the price you pay for a refurbished phone i guess      
941,1.0,                    no puedo creer que me haya mando un tel fono que no puedo activar y era el regalo para mi esposo        
942,1.0,                       this phone came with a defective batter despite the seller being in  the amazon renewal program  it failed to meet the program s standards  my daughter had to charge it four times in a day despite limited use   we had to return to phone      
943,1.0,                       not fully unlocked  went to the verizon store and told it was not compatible with verizon     
944,1.0,                       received with     battery capacity  it dies after    min off charge  my apps don t open  if i try to make a facetime call my phone does immediately  i go to get a refund and i have to pay for shipping  they sent me a defective phone and now i have to pay to send them their broken phone  ridiculous      
945,5.0,                       a truly great phone  i wouldn t hav known it wasn t new if i hadn t ordered it myself      
946,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          let s just say i purchased this item for my daughter  i turned it on one and tried to activate it using the quickstart option to merge everything from her previous iphone to her new one  something seemed off because when i did that it wouldn t connect to the wi fi but i didn t think anything of it  i went to set it up manually and the wi fi does not work  i have reset the phone multiple times and still nothing when i first placed the order it got delayed by a few days i was tempted to cancel the order but all of a sudden it had been shipped with two days express shipping   i assume they sent me a faulty item because they didn t want to lose my order  i will be returning this item expecting a full refund and will not be purchasing from this seller again zero stars       
947,4.0,                       looks new  came with a charger and screen protector on it  works great  only problem that i have is that i thought i would get a gold color like the picture  instead i received a rose gold      
948,4.0,                       the phone came a day early   looks practically brand new and fired up like a charm   i use an iphone xs  but i purchased this iphone   for my daughter as an upgrade to her older iphone   great phone at a great price  and am very happy with it so far   i love the fact that it is fully unlocked so not limited as to carrier   the battery health is     which is the only reason i didn t give five stars  but i would definitely recommend this product and this seller      
949,1.0,                       initially i was happy with the phone  it looked great physically and had no signs of wear and tear  however  the battery health was lower than i wanted  the phone said the battery health was      however  i knew from the ad  that it could ship with as low as      so i can t complain too much about that  the biggest issue with the phone that was an absolute deal breaker was that it frequently crashed and closed apps on me  other times it would freeze up  imagine having an emergency and having to make a phone call  only to find out that your phone decided to freeze up   i have a family  so that s completely unacceptable  the phone also seemed to have connectivity issues and would not connect well with my wifi  it was slower than my other devices on my wifi and would sometimes freeze up  with the problems that i was having  i m thinking it was a bad main board or  motherboard   the seller was mobilespree  i contacted them and asked for an exchange  they refused to do an exchange and said my only option was to return it  i returned it with the shipping label provided by amazon  however  even after   days of having the phone back  they would not refund my money  i had to get amazon involved to get a refund  overall  don t buy  it was a waste of time and money and a hassle to get refunded      
950,5.0,                       i would like a replace took to apple store said   not great product   can you send me another on i ll keep sim card and return old one only been few monthd     
951,5.0,                       the first one i ordered had an issue with the charging port  but when i contacted customer service  they helped me replace it with a new one very quickly  the one i have now works perfectly  excellent for the price      
952,5.0,                       when they said this phone was refurbished or remanufactured i was expecting it to look old and worn out not true what i thought  this little iphone came in clean as new and already had a nice screen protector they scared me that it was only     battery capacity     not true either i turn off the internet and bluetooth systems and my battery lasts about a full week it has been a nice experience buying from this vendor at amazon      
953,4.0,                       i switched from an android to try the iphone and it has been good so far  getting used to the smaller screen and lack of a universal  back undo  button on the iphone  unless i haven t found that yet   also  for some applications it has been harder to select a fine point on the screen  battery life on this one  given it is not new  has been on although not great so i have a couple of chargers around  overall it seems like a good phone      
954,1.0,                       after reading about the issues numerous people have seen that do not meet the  amazon renewed  guarantee  after going through the hassle of getting the new phone set up  i immediately checked the battery  they guarantee at least     battery life  the phone was at      clearly they make absolutely no effort to inspect these phones  it takes all of    seconds to check the battery life  stay away from amazon for buying used phones      
955,1.0,                       after having this phone for   days the phone started freezing up   force closing and the back camera stopped working  it was just black   no image would show when you pull up the back camera  and the flashlight stopped working   not happy with this phone at all   this didn t even last me   full month so it was definitely not worth the money        
956,1.0,                       i tried to get a service plan with this phone today and was informed that the phone is not unlocked  it was advertised as unlocked   it is useless to me  seller falsely advertised this phone   at the time of my purchase  there was no indication that it could not be used with any service provided  false  misleading advertising and refusal to accept responsibility   do what is right and return my money      
957,5.0,                       my granddaughter won t be the same gift for two grandkids they love them
