0,5.0,                       i purchased a usb c a couple months ago  and realized not all hubs are created equal   although it had a usb c pass through port  not all usb c ports support data   power  hence when looking again for an all in one solution  i am happy to report that the    w usb c pass through works flawlessly  no lag or screen flashes  and finally allow me to have the one cable solution when docking my laptop at home since been working from home a lot more  anything i can do to streamline or de clutter my workspace is a huge benefit to me  now when i dock my pc  just need to plug in the one usb on the adapter  and all my peripherals get connected   i highly recommend this adapter if you need something reliable or trying to archive the one cable dream that usb c can bring      
1,3.0,                       item got over heat when i connect it to my phone like in    minutes  after that  the signal getting bad and i lost some frame i give this item   stars because it does it job  transfer the screen to my tv  and i can use it to connect the flash drive to my phone however  it only work good in the first   min  when it get the heat up  everything is not good  lagging  flashing  losing picture  screen yurn black for few minutes      
2,5.0,                       awesome little usb c hub  i bought this hoping it would work with s  e and it does  and more importantly lets me use linux on dex right out of the box  my only issue was it had problems mirroring the screen  until i plugged in external power  i haven t tried the ethernet or sd card slots yet  but i m assuming they ll work like everything else so far  would definitely recommend for the price  much cheaper than some other options on here      
3,4.0,                       i have the following setup monitor    hdmi    hubpixel      usb c to usb a cable    hubpower    pixelbook charging cable to usb c    hubrouter    ethernet    hubhub    usb c    pixelbookthe pixel   device plugged into the usb c to usb a cable is charging slowly  it is stating that it will take   hours to go from     to      with the device not in use  i was hoping to use this hub for mobile software development  which requires my phone to be on  unfortunately  the hub does not provide enough charging to make this a possibility edit  aukey sent me a new hub  it still says  charging slowly  when the pixel   is plugged into the hub  even if an external power source is plugged into the usb c port  the phone estimates that charging from     to      will take about an hour  i hope that aukey creates a better hub in the future  i am very satisfied with the rest of the functionality  ethernet  hdmi  availability of usb ports   but i have not tried the sd card slot edit    i ve noticed that my ethernet has only been running at     mbps  i ve tried two different cables   cat  and cat e with no luck  all other wired devices on my network are able to have a gigabit connection      
4,4.0,                       been using aukey products for a while  all are good quality and performs as advertised  this   to     c port upgrade unit performs flawlessly  full macbook compatibility  good ports  speed  not   stars   cause it heats above my expectations  it s not an oven  but i think probably any component will fail soon  due to the heat generated by the unit      
5,5.0,                       i got this to help with my work from home set up on my macbook  and it seemed to have everything i need  i especially liked that it has a higher power output than other similar items  which is probably more than i need anyway   the ethernet works fast  and i got regular  good speeds compared to other adapters i have  the rubber feet on the bottom are a really nice detail  and it has a premium feel to it  the cable is a good length  overall  i think this item is well deserving of it s good praise  i can t think of anything else you could add to this adapter to make it better  save an additional usb c port      
6,5.0,                       hub   in   is slim and reliable and offers great value  other hubs may be cheaper  but offers fewer ports  the    in   hub was all that was needed to plug in the following for my personal setup     usb  for mouse     usb  for keyboard keyboard     usb c to plug in the computer charger  worked both on my mac and pc     ethernet plug to power my highest speeds instead of using wifi  highly recommend     other plugs are useful but haven t had a chance to use it with my daily work  personal setupthe biggest pro for this hub is being able to plug in my usb c computer charger to the hub  this was able to charge my      macbook pro and hp elitebook      
7,5.0,                       i got this for my new m  macbook air  i had trouble with my ethernet adapter for big sur on my old macbook but the ethernet port works just fine with this product  it comes with a small carrying case which is a nice touch  all in all  i m very satisfied with the usb hub  the cable that connects to the macbook is long enough that i plan to use command strips to attach the back of the usb hub to the back of my external monitor to help with cable management      
8,4.0,                       this product ended up not working out for me but i still think aukey is a quality brand and continue to use many of their other products  their customer service was prompt  clear  and conscientious  i had some trouble using their website s complaint submission form  faulty error message  but it eventually sent my message after a dozen attempts  fortunately all subsequent customer service conversations took place via email my problem with the product was with all of its usb a ports  they seem underpowered or something because my  aukey  wireless phone charger would power on and off about every       seconds  needless to say  that is not how the charger is supposed to function  it works fine with power blocks and other usb a ports on other computers  my aukey usb c to usb a nano adapter  comes in a two pack and is just dandy  also works fine with my macbook and the charger  so it s the hub  it doesn t matter which usb a port i tried  same outcome  however  the usb a ports did work perfectly with my wireless mouse s receiver  i tried the ethernet ports and the power pass through and those also worked fine  aukey kindly sent me a replacement right away but the same exact thing happened with the wireless charger again so i m back to looking for a multi port hub that works with all my common peripherals      
9,5.0,                       i travel quite a bit for work and working from home these days  i have been looking for a usb c hub where i can connect multiple devices and free up the connection space on my computer  i have other aukey products in the house  including car dash cams  charges  cases etc  so it is a trusted brand for me and the connectivity options and price was really good so decided to give this a chance  i m glad i did usage and connectivity first  i connected the usb c charging cable from my lenovo laptop charger as input to power the hub and other devices connected to it  it sits perfectly on my desk  has a very small footprint and i now have a bunch of devices connected to it  my wide screen monitor is connected to it via an hdmi cable  i tested the audio and it is working great  in addition i have got my keyboard and the cable coming out of the usb c hub is connected to the usb c port on my laptop so everything is working perfectly  laptop is charging perfectly while all peripherals are working as expected look  feel  size and otherthis hub is very slim and has nice matt finish on top  it also came with a little cloth sleeve that i m planning to store the hub which protects the surface overall  i d say you can t go wrong with this hub and i highly recommend it  very satisfied with it so far      
10,5.0,                       since having my macbook pro           i have had three usb c hubs  this one is the best of them all  build quality and form factor are great  it small and great for travel and will easily fit in your notebook sleeve  all the usb     ports run true to speed swell as the ethernet port  hubs in the past have let me down in this area  the price is also great  thanks again to aukey for another great product     bonus  the hub came with a cloth sleeve for storage too  its in the details      
11,5.0,                       this review is intended for ipad pro      owners running ipados       short and easy review all ports work  hdmi outputs properly  usb     ports function as fast as the device connected  microsd sdcard slots all work and speeds are dependent on your sd card specs ipad pro        best thing about this hub is the usb     port   i can connect my logitech usb receiver and allow my paired logitech keyboard and mouse to function on the ipad pro without interference and lag rather than use up the bluetooth bandwidth the ethernet also works  see images    but ipados is limited to    mb s that is     megabits per second   pathetic considering wifi will net you  x the bandwidth the hub can be powered without a power via usb c   in fact you can plug into your ipad pro and it will work   great for just using the usb     port to use keyboard mouse in a quick setting   at your desktop you can plug in ac adapter via usb c to get full power   i have a   watt aukey pd ac adapter powering the hub so i did not test with apple s own   watt power supply for nintendo switch  you can plug in and it will work without external power   if you plug in an external usb c power supply it will charge the nintendo switch while powering the hub   the logitech usb receiver i used worked flawlessly on the switch without external power to the hub   the mouse did not  obviously   the ethernet did not as well   it only will work when i plug in my usb    to ethernet adapter and it worked        this was also tested with and without external power supply and it worked on the nintendo switch   the hdmi doesn t work with the nintendo switch  i believe there is a specific hammy output device required and this aukey hub isn t the right one   i have the v  model that was tested upon the only con i would have to make up is probably  heat    but it s not hot to touch   it does get warm with ethernet connected but i do not see any thing else to complain about   the led light is useful to tell me there is power connected   the ethernet flashes up white and orange when data is transferring a solid device by a solid company  aukey   i chose this brand over the other generic chinese brands because i was dubious if it would work with my ipad pro      but in the end i m glad i went with this brand ipados      is great   files apps can read all the devices connected to the usb and sd card slots  one at a time    and it makes this ipad even better than a full size laptop   stars for product quality and performance      
12,5.0,                       my first impression    i can t believe i can use my usb keyboard mouse on my  rd generation ipad pro  this is amazing  i really bought this to use on my google pixelbook go  so it could feel like i m on my office pc  i miss being able to use a fullsize keyboard mouse with a double monitor setup  i m so happy i finally got this      
13,5.0,                       this is the perfect usb c hub to use when traveling   it s very lightweight and has every port you ll need     usb    s  sd card  micro sd card  hdmi  ethernet  and another usb c to plug in power if need be   the only negative is known when purchasing   there s only one hdmi port   however  aukey offer s another hub for twice the price with more ports if needed the usb ports transfer at full speed  the hdmi sent  k to my tv when connected  and the ethernet pulled over     mbps  max of my network    the build quality feels great   like all of aukey s other products the price is right for the features  and the travel bag included is a nice touch   would highly suggest this model if it has all the needed ports   the quality  size  and price all come together for   stars      
14,3.0,                       i just purchased this device for my macbook  running catalina mac os i have my monitor connected to it via hdmi  a small external ssdconnectedto one of the usb ports small logitek keyboard usb bluetooth connection then i attempted to connect a lacie external drive to the other usb     portbut the lacie keeps powering up down constantly         i see the drive appearon mac os  then a few seconds later it disappears   dmesg  shows power up and then power down       i can t understand why the lacie external drive will not stay powered up   the lacie is connectedfrom it s usb c port to the usb     on the hub   this should work why is it not thxchris duffy     
15,4.0,                       convenient charging  the    w usb power delivery port keeps your    inch macbook pro with thunderbolt   or other compatible laptop fully charged  using your device s original power adapter  while you re using all the other functions of the usb type c hub ultra hd video  hdmi port outputs resolutions up to  k   hz to a connected display fast data transfer   network connection  three usb     gen   ports and usb     sd   micros card slots all support data transfer rates up to  gbps  gigabit ethernet port supports            mbps fast network speeds     
16,5.0,                       i ve had this for just under a week at this point and have already returned repalced the first one  it wasn t keeping the ethernet connection  it would disconnect and reconnect  kind of annoying  this replacement one keeps dropping the usb connections  i ll turn my pc on and the keyboard won t work  i have updated and uninstalled reinstalled drivers and nothing seems to fix the issue  i may look for an alternative to this one if i keep having issues           update device works as it should  but still having the ethernet connectivity issue  are others having this issue  i ve turned off power saving features through device manager  yet it still takes       seconds  if not longer  to connect  i feel as thought the device should connect within     seconds           update not only is the ethernet port a constant problem  now the usb ports aren t responding until i either restart or unplug plug the device back in  this defeats the purpose of the device  i bought it so i could leave the devices plugged in under my laptop stand and plug the usb c into my pc and be done  having to pull the whole thing out and go through it is just a pita  i am not past my return period and stuck with the device          update i would like to say that this product has exceeded my expectations  it wasn t a problem with the product  but it was an issue with my managed switch  great product for what it does      
17,5.0,                       i m using this for samsung dex  works perfectly  i ve connected a multitude of things via the usb ports and have had zero issues with my samsung galaxy s    keyboards  game controllers  and logitech mice all work  if you re looking for a solid dex hub  this is it      
18,5.0,                       this serves my purpose  i can even add an usb c extension cord to hide it behind my monitor  the customer service of this company is great  i love the ethernet port  memory card reader is very handy  connection is good  though it is made of plastic  i like the build quality and design  it is compact and sturdy      
19,5.0,                       got this a bit discounted for prime day  and i m very satisfied thus far  does everything you would expect  and has every port you could need  shown in the pictures of this review   one thing that did stand out to me was just how small this thing actually was  the pictures made it seem like it s small and portable  but product looks even smaller than you d think  which is great for travel or for not taking too much space on your desk  unless this thing stops working out of nowhere  i absolutely recommend this to anyone looking to expand their port versatility on usb c computers      
20,4.0,                       the first hub i received  kept getting disconnected from my macbook pro     because it was drawing too much power  aukey replaced it  but the replacement would not properly pass through the   w charge  so my laptop would drain quickly under heavy loads  it looked like the charge was capped at   w according to coconutbattery  even though the hub is supposed to support up to    w pass through  the replacement of the replacement kept charging not charing every few minutes  so my laptop would not charge at all  tried three hubs and three failed  the quality from its look and feel seems to be pretty decent  but it simply did not function as expected  so  the reason that this product is   stars is only because the customer service has been good  otherwise  i would not recommend the product until the quality issues are fixed      
21,4.0,                       i ve been buying and testing a number of different usb c hubs with samsung dex and this one has problems  it gets hot  doesn t enable any resolution higher than the basic     p one  and frequently causes the image on screen to cut out  stutter  or even disconnect  very annoying if you re trying to use it to watch movies  haven t had any of these problems with other adapters on the same tvs and phone      
22,2.0,                       this is a really well made  sleek product  it s multi functional but isn t bulky where it stands out i have multiple laptops  surface book  lenovo ideapad flex  with usb c connectors and a desktop in my workspace at home  i used to have a surface dock provided by my employer that i had to return after i took a new job  my new job gave me the lenovo and so i was looking for a multifunctional hub that works both with the surface and lenovo  so i needed to connect the usb switch keyboard and mouse connectors  network cable and hdmi everything except the hdmi input works  if i connect the hdmi directly to the lenovo  that works as well but wont work for the surface giving this   stars because some of the functions do work      
23,1.0,                       have this aukey hub connected to a macbook pro    which is connected to a small cisco network hub through the aukey s network port on the cisco hub there s also a windows computer connected and my ip phone  whenever the macbook is not connected to the hub it kills the network another windows computer or the telephone stop working  when i disconnect the aukey hub the network comes back  it useless for me since i need the network      
24,5.0,                       very easy to use  just as described in the websites  plug and play  it s cool to plug the charger into the hub then hub into the laptop and charges the laptop  i did not know it can push power to charge the laptop through this hub  pretty impressive      
25,3.0,                       given the advertised data rates for usb c  i assumed that this was a gigabit adapter  it s definitely not     running it with my macbook pro i see precisely    mb s through the ethernet port  this is disappointing  i got it primarily to get this particular computer off of wifi when it was on my desk usb  hdmi all work great  though  for the price  if you know what you re getting  it s definitely not a bad product      
26,5.0,                       exactly what i needed for my new work from home situation  this hub has an hdmi for my monitor  usb for my mouse  ethernet for internet and usb c for power all through one port  this helps me grab my laptop quickly when on a call and there are dogs barking in the background and i want to go to another room  when i return to the office i ll be able to use this at my desk and jump to a conference room easily without needing to unplug everything and replug it later when business travel opens up again  i ll be happy to have this hub over my old ones as it is less bulky and sleeker looking      
27,2.0,                       i m not sure why  but this adapter keeps bringing down my ethernet  cable  connections  i know because after i unplug it  my devices that are connected through ethernet cable come back up i read somewhere that it may be due to the power connecter that comes with the hub  and that it was underpowered     watts i believe  so i picked up a new     watt  block to power it and it worked for a few days  but now i m getting the same issues again  so i unplugged it again and as expected  my devices are back up      
28,5.0,                       i m using this to connect to a      k display  ethernet  power  a usb midi controller  and keychron k  keyboard  and alternating charging an apple mouse and apple trackpad  being used as a midi slider controller using audioswift   it s really nice to be able to put my laptop down  plug in a single cable  and have access to my entire desktop setup      
29,5.0,                       this is a much needed add on to a chrome book  be sure to have adequate power supply    ma plus      
30,5.0,                       great hub for the price point  was looking for one that specifically supported pass through charging over usb c  using with a dell inspiron          all ports do what they re supposed to  i ve even used it for attaching my samsung odyssey plus windows mixed reality vr headset to it  first time it wasn t fully recognized but after rebooting it s worked fine since then      
31,5.0,                       recently upgraded laptop and boy  now all laptop has usb c type charger  i had to buy this  but i am super impressed  now i can use this to split my monitor and charge at the same time  super useful  small and easy to use  i might need another one      
32,5.0,                       i got a surface pro   and this is exactly what i needed  added more ports and gave me a ethernet port as well  will be put into my backpack for future use  i m glad it also has the hdmi port so i can use it as an adapter for a projector      
33,5.0,                       seller was fast on shipping and the product is not only good  but to me is better than what i was expecting i really thought it was going to be larger and maybe as heavy as a cellphone  since i needed it right away and did not took the time to read the dimensions and weight   but i was quite surprised that it was small enough to carry it around with my laptop without taking much space and without increasing the weight of my bag pack by a lot i love the professional look of it along with my xps     also  its awesome that it comes with a small carrying soft case to protect it totally worth the money for the features     
34,5.0,                       i like this usb c hub mainly because it is really light weight and easy to carry around  however i would like it much better if its usb c cable and the connector were made of better quality material  also  another drawback that i feel is that the usb c port  power delivery port  literally only delivers power and you can t plug any usb c device such as your phone in that port  it s only for the charger cable  would have really liked if it were a power data usb c port      
35,5.0,                       i purchase this because i work online and the wifi would drop if the kids was using the internet at the same time  at first i purchased a similar product but i could not ge the internet it to work so i returned it to the store and order this on online   it work right away and i have more option  i can charge my computer  use a memory stick  connect my laptop to a tv screen with the hdmi  among other things   btw it also comes with a carry case   i am so glad i purchase it      
36,5.0,                       i purchased this essentially as a docking station for my laptop   plugging my monitor  network cable  and a handful of peripherals all into this hub so i could easily unplug my laptop from everything all at once when i needed to take it somewhere  rather than unplugging half a dozen different devices separately the usb ports  card slots and ethernet port all worked great  but i was unable to test the hdmi port because unfortunately i learned that my laptop s type c port is usb     which does not support hdmi that said  aukey was really great to work with  i emailed them  before i knew about my incompatibility issue  and they immediately sent out a replacement hub  when the second hub also didn t work  i did some more research on my laptop  and found out about the usb     issue  and i finally sent the hub back to aukey  the hub looks and feels great  very well designed  i ve purchased other aukey hubs in the past and i ve found them to be high quality      
37,5.0,                       i love this little device   it has it s own pouch if i wish to travel with it and put it in my computer bag   has just about every port i need  i ve own many usb c hubs and i usually find that i wisht it had one more port of some kind    the fact that i have a usb c port on the hub  plus ethernet  and hdmi  plus   usb a ports it is awesome also  love that i can connect the laptops power to the usb c port on the hub and it still charges      
38,4.0,                       this thing doesn t really have     watt pass through   it delivers only    watts my charging brick is   w  so i plug it directly into my macbook  and simply plug the aukey into another thunderbolt   port  this allows the powerbook to charge at full speed and handle power distribution however it wants to i discovered this today after waking up and discovering the powerbook had completely drained  probably due to steam  using istat menus to discover what was really going on with power delivery      
39,5.0,                       i have been using this adapter everyday since purchasing it  i ve had it on my wish list since june       but kept hesitating to buy it because        i really shouldn t have waited  this hub can be used with so many of my devices for a much more stable connection than wi fi  in a time when everything is done remotely i need to be sure my connection doesn t drop from poor signal  this resolves that issue  so far i ve used it on my      ipad pro       macbook pro  and my samsung galaxy s   ultra with great success  with the android it also enables ethernet tethering  when i connect it to my laptop i m able to use traditional usb accessories and drives while also charging it  it has power delivery passthrough which is a fantastic feature if you need to charge your devices while using the hub      
40,2.0,                       this device feels and looks great  really solid  sadly after only a few uses it no longer reads  or even recognises  my micro sd cards  also won t recognise my sandisk extreme portable usb c drive  had high hopes for it based on other reviews but sadly i ve been left disappointed      
41,3.0,                       intermittently connects ethernet with no identifiable pattern  i do tech support so i ve tried new cables  power cycles  every sequence of connecting all ports  other adapters don t have this issue on same phone  i don t have a second one to compare results and isolate the issue  otherwise the rest of the ports work great  even using samsung dex  too bad  it s fast and fair priced when it connects gigabit ethernet  the white activity led on that port is very very bright      
42,5.0,                       this dock is the perfect match to go with my hp zbook studio g   the laptop does not have a built in ethernet port for hard wiring to get network access  when i am working with large amounts of data and large files this is a must to ensure reliable remote work while traveling  the dock is well built and has nice rubber feet to keep it planted on the desk and not sliding around  the dock has a   inch cable attached which is plenty long to get it away from the laptop without being too long that it is a problem when putting in your bag for travel  the extra hdmi and usb ports are a nice plus to help keep things all in one place and not have cables everywhere to connect several peripherals  the dock comes with a very nice pouch to keep the dock protected when in your bag and keeping it form getting beat up  i have always been impressed with aukey products and this one is no different  i would recommend this dock to anyone looking for a reliable dock for travel and work from home if you only need to connect one external display      
43,5.0,                       this is a great travel friendly hub to take with my macbook pro to give it the ability to connect to lan  use usb        hdmi and sd   microsd  slots lan connection was seamless when plugging into a port hdmi connection   seamlessusb and sd card file transfer speeds were  sufficient and quicki comes with a soft  durable carrying case and it slim and easy to pack with your device  literally plug and play without any need to change settings in macos i would highly recommend this in terms of value      
44,5.0,                       this is a very good unit it allowed me to get extra screens on my macbook pro and also a way to connect the usb cable to charge the mac keyboard and mouse  also gives me ports to get pen drives connected      
45,5.0,                       this little hub has so much  and it s surprisingly fast  just connected it up to my phone last night to try it out and between samsung s file manager and the speed of this hub i was able to get across an album i have on a usb stick very quickly and without hassle   d now to see how it withstands the test of time      
46,4.0,                       i m attaching this to a chromebook and a mbp  both seem to work ok with all ports and no driver installation  however when charging the chromebook with a turbo charge it runs very hot on the bottom  it doesn t seem to matter if devices are plugged in or not  this should be fixed      
47,5.0,                       this is a well made usb c hub that i use with my     macbook pro  the card reader is super fast  what impressed me most was the cord itself wasn t one of those thin weak ones that most dongles hubs seem to have  this is helpful since i use a hard case for my laptop and the corded hubs work best  not a buy at all      
48,5.0,                       this is second usb c hub in my collection  build quality of this usb c is solid  it s lightweight  it also has a carrying case included as a bonus  this one has separate sd tf and micro sd card readers built in  carrying one device which does everything you need keeps your carry bag clear of clutter  a short cable to attach it to your computer is permanently attached to the hub  so you won t ever need to search for a cable just to use your hub  it has a gigabit ethernet port on it  nothing beats having a hard wired gigabit connection to your network       
49,3.0,                       overall  very functional hub  however  two very important points   i have an xps         that comes with a    w charger over usb c  this is proprietary   i expected to use this hub with the    w pd to pass through     w of power  it seems like it may have been capable of doing that  but at very loud coil whine  so loud that i absolutely cannot use it  not sure if mine is defective  but i m back to plugging power directly into the laptop   with power going to the laptop and not the usb c port  i thought i would have a spare usb c port now available for use on the hub  however  it seems like it isn t actually a usable port  devices connected there were not able to be recognized on my laptop  perhaps i should have read more closely  but i  incorrectly  assumed that the port was functional beyond power  don t plan on using it i m debating returning this as a lot of the desired  just plug one cable in  is limited because of this  may have to look for more expensive  docks  instead      
50,5.0,                       easy to use   plug it in and it is ready to go  takes up less space than my previous adaptor   this one only uses   port where my previous purchase took up both     usb ports    hdmi  sd and micro sd as well as phone line hook up   works well   with the cord you can move it around and it isn t attached to the side of the computer requiring more space   would highly recommend      
51,5.0,                       this is my first usb c hub  it s a great size  i tested all the ports on this and everting worked perfectly  i plugged it in and it just worked right away  i love that it has hdmi so you can use another monitor with it  the network port works great  my only issue is that it uses an attached usb c cable  it would be nice if it was removable so you could use a longer win if you wanted  i sipped you could get a usb c extension so not a major issue  the size is great  i tested it with several computers at work including a new microsoft surface tablet  this is great for the new surface making it useful      
52,5.0,                       wow  this usb hub is very very nice  the quality feels amazing and it it packed very well  it even comes with a nice little pouch  so nice to have all these ports in one usb hub  the speeds are great and cant get much better than this  this hub is a lot higher than others i ve had  i highly recommend this      
53,5.0,                       i purchased it for my new macbook pro      it is super light and portable before this it doesn t heat up all the ports are working fine and it is made up of plastic which can reduce the heating of the product along with this usb c hub i have also got the pouch and it is very convenient to store this product it has seven ports case it s more than enough for my use  previously  i ve purchased another usbc dongle from other brand but it was heating up so quickly and some of the ports were not working so i had to return it  and purchase this      
54,2.0,                       i received this and has been using with my new mbp     for a day  i was looking forward for a hub that gives me additional classic usb port  ethernet  hdmi and the additional sd card slots make it see like this is the perfect deal for me  however  i ve been using this today and the power keeps cutting in and out  it cuts off for a second or less and goes back to power mode  with the screen dimmed for a short second  and power plug connection chime on my mac keeps going off every minute which is very annoying   the macbook is connected to the original mac power brick    w   and has no issues when connected direct to the mbp usb c port  this only happens when i leverage the pd usb c port through the hub  i have nothing being driven off of the hub except a logitech receiver and a hdmi cable driving a  k monitor i have a number of aukey chargers and devices and have good luck with them  but not so on this one so far  makes me think i might have a defective unit that doesn t provide a consistent power delivery to the macbook pro      
55,5.0,                       i wanted to connect several usb as to my laptop  macbook air       which only comes with usb c ports  i was very pleased  i connected my huion inspiroy h   p to my laptop with no problem little to no input delay  i can also now simultaneously charge various items off of the aukey  and still charge my laptop because it has a usb c port on it  the aukey usb hub has made life easier by adding more ports  it also comes with its own little sheath for when you re not using it  this usb c hub does all i wanted it to do  unlike other commenters i have not used the ethernet port and don t plan to all i needed this hun for was for the usb ports that could take usb as       
56,4.0,                       using with a macbook pro   seems to work fine though if your try to use all the ports at once things can get a little sluggish   i plugged in ethernet  hdmi  usb keyboard  and a wireless mouse dongle   mouse was too jittery and sluggish and i had to plug the dongle into a direct usb port on the macbook   everything else seems to work together on the hub i will also forewarn that if you think you are having issues with the ethernet connection  it may not be this hub   i struggled for days thinking the ethernet on the hub was flaky only to finally discover my antivirus and firewall software was interfering with the connection      
57,5.0,                       the small usb c hub is very handy connecting to various laptops with thunderbolt port i had to buy extra power adapter to connect to the hub for power delivery wish the connecting cable usb c should have been big  it is too small and if the port is on other side of  the laptop to connect      
58,5.0,                       so a couple of months ago i got usb c hub for my macbook   lo and behold  after about   weeks my wife stole it   i needed one desperately   i have used aukey products in the past and decided to try their usb hub and i was so glad i did   the usb ports are fast   my sd and micro sd card ports work flawlessly   i love being able to connect directly to my network through ethernet to be able to get the speed i need   i hate the fact that macbooks only use usb c ports  but i am so glad for this option   it is awesome      
59,1.0,                       good built item and worked ok for a couple of weeks  until i installed the latest cumulative windows    update  now my laptop screen is blank when this thing is connected  it still works  i can still hear the hd  fans whirring   once i hard shut it down  removed this hub  laptop fires back up like normal  not sure what  driver incompatibility   is causing this  but i can t bring myself to try and solve  because a future windows update could screw things up all over again very disappointed  will not recommend this with windows    laptops      
60,4.0,                       i recently purchased this usb c hub for my      macbook air to hook it up with my    inch asus monitors  the usb hub works great so far after one month of use the ethernet port also works great for a wired connection at home for wired gig speed internet so no complaints there  the usb     ports work fine for data transfer overall  i dont think you can beat this usb c hub for the price  especially when there s coupons  the only downside is that the build quality isn t the best  and is plastic versus other brands  but over all i give this a good rating      
61,1.0,                       i wanted this usb hub to fulfil my needs so i could avoid paying      for a thunderbolt   dock  however this unit had   fatal flaws and i will be returning it pros  the usb ports worked and usb c power delivery passthrough was able to charge my laptop cons     i was unable to connect an external monitor at  k   hz  when attempting to set a custom resolution windows said the connection did not have enough bandwidth      p   hz was the highest i was able to achieve    the sd and micro sd card readers were limited to just over   mb s  tested   cards in both slots on   different computers    there is a network issue that occurs when leaving a charger plugged into the device  ethernet connected  and the laptop disconnected  this affects many of these usb c hubs with similar features  google it for more information      
62,5.0,                       i m using this with a lenovo thinkpad x  carbon gen    it ran my     x     display      hz  ran two external hard drives  bus powered  and a mouse  a gigabit ethernet cable  and a   w charging brick all at the same time  and without any lag slowdown  make sure to plug hard drives and flash drives into the blue usb     ports  but mice keyboards printers are fine on the black usb     port  it just worked when i plugged it in  no messing with drivers  my peripherals stayed connected when i plugged unplugged the power brick my laptop has usb     a ports built in  so i compared these to the hub  my samsung    gb usb     usb drive tested      mb s read        mb s write through the hub  and       mb s read and      mb s write when plugged in directly  my  tb wd drive tested      mb s read         mb s through the hub  and      mb s read and      mb s write directly  performance is basically the same as plugged in directly it has a realtek rtl     gigabit ethernet controller  connected through the internal usb hub  the usb c port is charging only  pretty typical with these hubs   it does not appear to have any fast charging for phones  the enclosure is all plastic and not the fanciest  but solid my only real nits  some coil whine when plugged into a power brick  and the green led is a smidge brighter than i d like this is an excellent hub and the price is right      
63,5.0,                       i have a      edition     macbook pro with   usb c ports and no usb     or lightning interfaces   before i purchased this hub  i used one anker usb c hub with an ethernet port and one usb c hdmi adapter to connect to my existing display  optical mouse  external usb    hdd and printer  usb       this usb c hub is very thin and compact   it greatly preserves some precious real estate on my desk as i have a surface pro and a lenovo also on my desk for some applications that only run on windows   one thing i wasn t expecting was that this usb c hub can passthrough power from the power adapter while using this usb c hub  there is a usb c port on the hub  with other devices   while i have   other usb c ports on the macbook pro  so this isn t that big of a deal  but i m sure this is useful for laptops that don t have many usb c ports   the usb c hub does provide power to my external hd and dvd cd drives   i have an external hdd  usb      that i run mac time machine and i was able to power the external hdd and run complete backup without problems   this hub had no issues powering my dvd drive  which is another usb     device  plugged my mouse into the usb  port  and everything is good there the hdmi works correctly with my display and no complaints there   the display with audio video works fine with the hdmi   one thing that was a nice surprise was that the ethernet port worked much better compared to my anker usb c hub with an ethernet port   my previous usb c hub took a while for the macbook pro to discover and usually took several minutes to connect to the network and obtain an ip address through dhcp   what i noticed with this one was the connection to the network was much faster  and usually  in less than    seconds  my macbook was connected  had an ip address  and was able to start surfing or browsing   i have not run any speed test to see if the port was actually running at gigabit speed  but it s not as critical to me even if it didn t run at gigabit speed   the sd card slot was nice to have   i do have a separate usb sd card reader and now i can pack it away   i had the usb c hub almost connected full and every device was working properly without any noticeable slowdown all in all  i m pleased with this hub and i have been using it daily for about a week now it      
64,2.0,                       this product looked really good  i chose this over its   south competitor that was priced at     however  from day   it was over heating  it got really hot that i could not touch it without getting hurt now  it does not pass the power through  i have it plugged into my macbook pro     native adaptor which is less than    w which they claim is the max pass through it also frequently disconnects my   usb hard drive attached to it      
65,5.0,                       i bought this to replace the dell usb c dock that i currently have because my dell dock doesn t have pd pass through so i lost one of my laptop s two ports just to charge  this works great and i can use the dock and power my laptop all on the same port it does get a little warm  but nothing to be concerned about  the case is a nice bonus so the cord doesn t get snagged when i put it in my work bag my only complaint so far is that the ethernet port status lights are excessively bright  they also chose to use an orange and white led instead of the normal green amber combination on most ports  the white led is the biggest offender as it blinks to show status and is really bright      
66,5.0,                       i ve always had good experience with aukey products  cables  chargers  usb battery pack  so when i needed an all in one hub for my macbook pro i just checked out aukey brand  so this hub is an   in   usb c hub  has all the ports that one would need nowadays  hdmi  sdxc     w usb c  charging     usb      sd  ethernet and usb a   it s small form factor means fits perfectly in my small backpack  the usb c cord is about    which is fair  i like the fact that the ports all have decent spacing so that it doesn t cram block the other ports if you are using them  my macbook picked up each port s devices when using them without hesitation  bonus is the    w usb c charging port to keep my macbook charged at all times  my only concern is that it s quite light  plastic  and i feel that if it falls on the ground it may crack  haven t occurred yet   but then they do have a    month warranty so i guess i m good   i would highly recommend this product      
67,5.0,                       i used this adapter with a      macbook pro   it worked excellently with my usb keyboard and mouse   the usb c power delivery provided sufficient power to charge the laptop from     to full in about   hours   it also provided excellent wired internet with a cat   cable   there is a small green led when it is plugged in  and the ethernet plug also had activity lights on the back   it comes with a nice cloth carrying case as well      
68,5.0,                       using for samsung dex  galaxy tab s    adding monitor and keyboard with mouse  what s the issue i bothered   doesn t work fastcharge via dongle   can t read hdd     or     via usb       i think there is problem in my device tab s   cant read ntfs hard drive format  exfat fat   can read andorid       wanna see hdmi     but it s     for  k it s   fps    and try to use with samsung s     dongle make some weird sound and doesnt s work  i mean at all  idk about other device but s   doesnt    don t try to use sd card reader  can not say anything about thgroughput port   can t say about it btw rj    works fine in some  if u try to connect rj    when using wi fi or mobile data  require to reconnect dongle itself to device  have this issue  not so bothering  this is all reccommend for using with   wqhd or fhd display  not     using for pc  asus zenbook um   ia  doenst work well always try to recconect usb adapter for hdd  i have   of this from different brand    from   is working well  idk which one is source troublemaker  hdd case or that usb c hub  need to check it      
69,5.0,                       i use this to connect a second monitor or screen via hdmi  when my wifi has been brutal during wfh time and staying at airbnb s in germany and in the usa i used the ethernet port to provide a steady connection for my webex videoconferences  this is a great product  i ve had it four months and have had no issues  i d welcome another one if it had a little bit longer cable from it to the computer  it can get warm during use  i also have my mouse hooked up via its usb port and there s another one if needed  lifesaver for wfh     
70,5.0,                       pros   well built  feels durable  not heavy  works really well with my macbook pro      i like that it s not too big or too small  i use it when i plug my monitor at home and for school and when i have to use my usb   it does not get really hot like other usb c hubcons   i know that the ethernet port is very useful for many people  but i wish there is a way to turn off the led for the ethernet port  the blinking is annoying when i work in my dark room   i cannot find any other issue  overall i recommend  not expensive     
71,5.0,                       used it for my surface pro    helps me a lot  works like a charm  considering now we are moving to a world of dongles  this hub comes to rescue everyone  it is small and sleek  the material is very good and feels premium  i have used the lan port a lot and it is able to handle the  gbps speed  overall a great product by aukey  definitely recommend      
72,5.0,                       this usb c hub checks all of my boxes for what i need to support my microsoft surface pro   pros the aukey   in   type usb c adapter is low profile  looks great  and has a wide range on connections that help me get the most out of my surface pro and macbook pro  this would pair well with a macbook pro  chromebook or any slim portable that sports usb c but needs some additional connections this is perfect if you need to share video via hdmi to a monitor or tv especially as many monitors still do not support a usb c input  it is an excellent secondary display adapter because i travel often for work  the addition of the ethernet port was my deciding factor in picking up this hub  having the option to hardline into a router with my surface or mac has been a quality of life improvement when i encounter spotty wifi connections that would otherwise disrupt my video calls and streaming the design of this hub complements the look of my surface and my macbook pro  the ports sit below the top of the hub on a beveled edge which helps their bare metal components hide from the eye  an indicator light  opposite the aukey brand on the top of the hub  is a soft green rather than the harsh blue led that is so common on cheaper looking hubs and gadgets  the bottom of the hub has four rubber feet to help it stay planted on your table and prevents the plastic body from dragging around and causing noise  it is a great addition to my tech kit other pros indicator led included on ethernet port attractive fabric storage sleeve for hub included in boxrecyclable cardboard boxcons i would have liked the cable to be a few inches longer and maybe made with a softer  braided cable  the rigidity of the rubber coated cable coupled with it s short length is a bit of a problem for my surface pro   as the usb c port on the surface is located on the top right edge of the tablet when it is set up in a laptop position  the hub hangs awkwardly to the side of the screen  this has not killed the experience for me and i am still very happy with this excellent usb c hub this is also not an issue with the macbook pro and should not be an issue with any traditional laptop that has its ports along the edges of its base i highly recommend this product      
73,5.0,                       i m updating this review to add that as soon as aukey saw that i had a problem  their customer service contacted me right away and did a full refund   this is really impressive for an online service   as i wrote  it worked with my external     hard drives but not with my cameras   otherwise it s a good product  solid build  elegant on the desktop and handles high speed internet connections for livestreaming well  my two power hungry jobs for this hub are to transfer video footage from avchd cameras via usb     connections to my      macbook pro and also to ingest video audio via blackmagic intensity shuttle usb     it so far works well with the shuttle     at the same time as handling high speed internet vis cat   connection but so far it doesn t like transferring footage  often it doesn t find the camera  when it does it drops the signal midstream and i get a message that the drive was incorrectly disconnected as a work around i m using my old anket usb powered hub  plugging that into the aukey hub and plugging that into my macbook pro i only have   camera plugged in at a time and no additional drives  and i have the usb c power cable plugged into an apple power brick let me know if i m missing anything  otherwise the usb   ports seem under powered for this type of connection      
74,5.0,                       so i bought aukey adaptor because i was not having hdmi port  it is compatible with my laptop and also there is a type c port in this adaptor so that you can also connect your type c laptop charger with it  one more thing that it has ethernet port which most of the adaptor doesn t provide and they give you card slots  i am using my mouse  second screen  charger in just one adaptor and didn t get any kind power connection problem  great product if you are setting up work station at your home or office      
75,4.0,                       this usb c hub arrived so fast  i love how small it is  literally smaller than my iphone x  i also like how they threw in a cover for easy portability and protection  sometimes the hdmi port is faulty  but i appreciate all the different ports  i never realized how convenient having another usb c port is on the device  if you re shopping for one  definitely get one with an extra usb c port      
76,5.0,                       so far just use it for connecting monitor via hdmi and power  and a usb a connection here and there  when i get bat to the office i expect to use it for the wired network as well  sometimes i have to disconnect the power cable and reattach to reset things if the external monitor isn t working  i use this in a combination with a magnetic usb c adapter to make the connection even easier and sometimes i m not sure if the issue is with the magnetic connector not being lined up  or the hub  usually the magnetic connector  but once in a while just need to reset things by unplugging power cable plugged into usb c port on the hub      
77,4.0,                       the ethernet leds suddenly came on and now stay bright  and on  but no ethernet is connected  the hdmi port isn t consistently connected  i have to use the laptop port  sd slot works fine  it will certainly be useful to add usb ports when travelling  but i really want those lights to stay off and the hdmi to work consistently      
78,5.0,                       aukey usb c hub is great for those who need multiple usb ports with ethernet and hdmi outlets  it works really well  i haven t had any problems so far  the product is compact enough to be carried in the included pouch it is slightly bigger than the apple s usb multi av dongle but it does give the option of ethernet and memory card reader      
79,4.0,                       i received this quickly and in good shape  but it seems to be much lighter and plasticky than the same product and model number i have been using at work  i borrowed it from a friend and liked it so much  i ordered same product here    theirs seemed more sturdy and was definitely a bit heavier   not sure if it s the material on the outside or the inside        
80,4.0,                       update  although my original product was faulty  aukey offered to replace my hub free of charge and refund me for my original purchase  i ll update my review once i get the new product and use it  but i ve decided to give aukey a better review because their customer service is great  not many sellers on amazon will go to the lengths they have to please a customer    this was a great solution until it wasn t  the other night i saw a flash  my monitors turned on and then off  i investigated and noticed this little hub was super hot  i unplugged everything  let it cool off and then plugged it back in  the usb c port on my macbook air wouldn t recognize anything  which made me believe it had fried the port i tested the port with another hub and everything worked  so this hub was the culprit  i couldn t get my usb keyboard  external drive and multiple thumb drives to work with it either this is a shame because it has all of the right ports for the work i need to do  i will not be purchasing a replacement hub from aukey i hope this helps      
81,4.0,                       so all of the ports that i ve tried so far will work    however  it will let you plug in more stuff than will work without really giving you any way of knowing that you ve reached too much power draw except things will randomly stop working for example  the main reason i wanted this was because my pc only has one usb     port  and i need to move files from my phone to an external ssd that i use for video editing work   this just barely worked  until i started using an sd card in my phone   apparently the slight extra power draw from there being an sd card in my phone was too much   my computer was giving me a really weird error that made me worry that my external ssd had been broken   i can still do what i need to because this goes through the usb c so i still have my usb    but i thought i was buying something where i wouldn t need to worry about this type of thing      
82,5.0,                       this product   is   fantastic   works with anything a usb c connection  most importantly  i wanted this to connect to my chromcast google tv device to add the power of an ethernet connection  my old keyboard mousepad and to add more storage  this worked fantastic   i am using the micro sd storage at   gb  and a small usb for   gb  and the usb receiver for my keyboard mouse pad only thing is  you need strong power adapter for it  it can hold     watts  and i recommend buying a     watt brick for this  i used a spare    watt oneplus phone charger for it and it worked well i ordered a     watt power adapter for this device and will switch out but this    watt charger powers it all just fine i tested this with my horror movie marathon    days of horror movies  back to back  and the device barely got warm i will be buying   more for my other google tvs       
83,5.0,                       update  aukey customer service is top notch  they reached out to me and are serious about product improvement and customer satisfaction  based on that i ve updated my review to   stars usb   ports are under powered  in the documentation that comes with it  it states the usb     ports only supply    ma  expect device drop outs the rest of the construction looks great and is very compact  even with the power limitation  it s still a nice hub      
84,5.0,                       i bought this to use with my macbook pro because it only has usb c ports  this hub works flawlessly with my macbook pro  the best part about it is the card readers  i had another dongle to use usb type a  but it was very simple and just had   usb   ports  but this one is the perfect travel companion because i can use usb devices while i use the card readers without having to carry a separate card reader  i also really like the fact that this had a usb c passthrough for charging  i haven t use the ethernet port  but i like the fact that i have it incase i need it overall a great purchase and i d recommend it      
85,5.0,                       i liked the small footprint   it really helps when you need to carry on backpack while travelling or moving around connection options are good  wish it had micro sd and vga connectors too  but one can live without it for sure  the only thing i would point as improvement for future generations  if any  is to make the usb ports not too tight   sometimes you have to put some pressure  tilt it in different directions until it fits in      
86,5.0,                       the usb c hub is exactly what i need for my laptop  since my laptop does not have an ethernet cable port and hdmi  this hub is very convenient  now i can finally watch a movie on tv  the video quality is also very good  the hub does have an additional usb   port  which would be very useful  and my laptop has only one port  i haven t tested the memory card port  but i think it will be fine and may use it in the future  the included soft case is very useful for carrying a usb hub  overall  i am satisfied with the purchase      
87,1.0,                       after reaching out to aukey customer service twice through their website  i still have not received a response about my issues with my usb c hub cb c    i bought this adapter last year  and it s within the    month warranty   figuring that maybe it was just this one adapter being potentially faulty with pass through charging  i purchased the cb c   model as a replacement as of this writing  i haven t received a response from aukey s customer service team  and my     macbook pro cannot charge through the usb c port in this hub  for reference  i m using the official apple   w power block and official  m apple usb c charging cable and can only successfully charge my     macbook pro by not using this hub and plugging in the charing cable directly into one of the   built in usb c ports on the     macbook pro until aukey figures out what is wrong about why pass through charging doesn t work  i d advise not purchasing this usb c hub cb c   or cb c        
88,5.0,                       aukey makes some great products at great prices and this is no different  i bought this to use on my samsung galaxy s   plus  g and it works  i am able to charge and use memory cards and even a mouse at the same time  before i could only do one with the otg adapter provided by sammy  so many uses that i haven t even done it all  excited for the capability tho     
89,4.0,                       it does what it says on the tin  i m using it for work with a          macbook pro  and it drives a  k display at   hz and a usb     external hard disk just fine   usually i unplug the hub from my macbook every night  sometimes  when plugging it back in  the hard drive doesn t connect  and more rarely  the display doesn t either   and there s a high pitched whine coming from the device  it s possible it s trying to draw too much power at once to drive both devices  or is getting some interference from the other adapter i have connected for my third display  unplugging the drive from the hub  or the hub from the computer  and plugging it back in resolves the issue  but it happens about once a week overall  it s a solid little hub for the price  especially compared to the price point of some more advanced macbook compatible hubs          but you may have trouble if you try to connect more than a couple of things to it at once      
90,4.0,                       this usb hub works great on my acer spin    but on my acer tab    tablet it only shows  low power charger  with same power adapter   i have told google of this issue and believe it has something to do with the software and not the hardware since it works on one chromebook and not the other  i hope either aukey or google fix this issue because besides that little annoyance it is a great little hub  if this issue gets resolved or a new one pops up then i will change my review      
91,5.0,                       i have another smaller adapter with the same brand and i am extremely happy with both of them  i am using hdmi and usb ports right now and i tried the ethernet to see if it is working  from the reviews and answers i see that the seller is highly caring about the customers  this is a plus as well  both this one and the other i have  i am extremely happy with the quality  i recommend      
92,5.0,                       this usb type c hub from aukey has proven extremely useful to me  i use the dex functionality when on location for research when the client has an hdmi port on their tv s  it conveyed the information flawlessly   it is also a good value proposition  i highly recommend this aukey usb type c hub      
93,5.0,                       i love how i can connect my phone and tablet to the hub at the same time  i have been able to move files from my phone to my computer  all while charging my tablet  i am able to be so much more productive by having all of my electronics fully charged and within easy reach      
94,5.0,                       this powerful usb c hub with almost all functions  this product meets every need of mine  i had a      macbook pro      however  i had one usb c to hdmi  which was not enough for me  so i looked over on amazon and found this product  i had aukey products before and like this brand  for this hub  it meets all i need  the quality has been excellent  on the video side  and no issues with speed or performance  one thing it will be nice if they provide a longer cable with a jacket      
95,5.0,                       i ordered this and instead of receiving the correct product i received something smaller and the seller tried to make it right by sending an adapter that makes up for the feature the original incorrect product was missing   bad sellers make aukey look bad good think aukey products are great      
96,4.0,                       i have been using this hub for a few months now and it works really well  my macbook pro does not have any usb a ports  hdmi port  or ethernet  this hub provides all of those ports at the expense of   usb c port on my laptop  there is also a charging port on the hub which frees up the  nd usb c port on my laptop  i think it would be better if the hub had an additional usb c port on it  but so far that hasn t been an issue for me since the laptop itself has an extra usb c port      
97,4.0,                       this works as advertised with one very strange issue that took me a while to figure out   my home network consists of a ubiquiti edgerouter x  a couple unmanaged switches  and two unifi ap ac lites   somehow  if i unplug this hub from my laptop but leave the power and ethernet plugged into the hub  it takes my wifi network down completely   i m not sure if it floods the network with enough traffic to crash the ap s  but it absolutely kills the wifi completely   every single device on the wifi will lose connection and the wifi will not return until i plug the hub back into my laptop or i remove the power or ethernet cable from the hub   again  no idea why or how it happens  just wanted to pass along this information in case anyone else encounters this      
98,4.0,                       it has rubber grips at the bottom so when you connect multiple devices it won t move on the surface  basically you can connect different things to your laptop if you have usb type c port in your laptop  you can connect up to three flash drive or external drive  as i connected   tb drive   but only two out of those three are     and one is      there is a port for hdmi cable  usb c  for smartphone charging   and micro sd and macro sd card slots      
99,4.0,                       i purchased this for my macbook pro which didn t have any usb a ports  upon unboxing  everything is tidy and looks very well made  typical for aukey products in my experience  love that it adds   extra usb ports for my other devices  plugging into the ports feel solid and all peripherals worked perfectly  i didn t give the review   stars for   minior reasons  the first is the green led indicator light is pretty bright  especially at night  wish it was dimmer  secondly  i don t know if it s just my macbook but the os won t start with the hub plugged in  i d have to unplug it first and then plug it back in after it booted  overall  the hub is great and i would recommend getting one      
100,5.0,                       this product is very portable and it seems durable  it also comes in with a pouch and a   year warrantythe ports are a bit too small  i had to squeeze my peripherals into the usb ports i wish the usb c port transferred data  but it s only for charging i had the previous version of this hub  which i really loved and was the main reason why i bought another for my brother  the older version had more weight to it and it had a metal bottom  this newer version has a pure plastic casing  otherwise  the only changes between the two are the port placement around the hub      
101,5.0,                       i am a new mac user  and with a new generation of computers comes a new generation of hardware needed to support your experience  for     this is a steal  don t go out and buy those     ones  this one is as efficient if not better than the competition  aukey is a reputable brand  their design language in packaging and aesthetics represent the quality of their products  i have purchased aukey products in the past  it does what it says it will do and then some  this is a compact product and the design is very minimal and easy to carry  comes with a nice premium pouch for your on the go needs  overall a very solid product for the price  i will look for more aukey products in the future if needed tldr  great value for price  small compact design  good aesthetic quality     
102,5.0,                       this   in   hub is great   i purchased to use with my samsung tab s  and dexx   i connect my older visiotv  keyboard mouse   printer  router and charger   it charges my tablet while i am working   this hub is much more versatile than the samsung hub   and cheaper      
103,5.0,                       seems to work well  was looking for something portable that would give me access to the ports necessary to hook up to devices externally like keyboards  mice  ethernet and usb ports for usb sticks  this all of them  it s very portable  made out of plastic so feels a little lightweight but that actually is a plus for portability  about the size of my cell      
104,5.0,                       overall  this usb c hub does exactly what it claims to do  it easily connects three usb devices                 and ethernet cable  hdmi output  normal and micro sd  and usb c power to a laptop  i tested it on my      dell xps laptop and it had no issues  it is compact and only weighs    grams  which should make it easy to fit into any bag the only two drawbacks i have for it are that the build quality is very light plastic  so i don t know how durable it will be for the long haul  and that it seems to heat up a decent amount  that being said  it has a very generous    month warranty  and i m sure any of those issues would be easily remedied by aukey      
105,5.0,                       i really like this usb c dongle  i ve been looking for one that i can use with my new      ipad pro      and my hp    chromebook  i needed to be able to plug in my flash drive into to get things to and from my chromebook and ipad pro  i also needed a dongle that could be used for my chromebook to connect to hdmi  it s a bonus that includes an ethernet port  i actually didn t expect my ipad pro to support ethernet so i was shocked that it plugged right in and worked i really like the sd card slot  it has both the micro sd and regular sized sd so i can pull out pictures from my sony digital camera just using the sd card  i can edit my pictures on my ipad using my pencil  i like that i like how it includes several different things i need in one small package that doesn t get in the way  i think it s a great companion for the ipad pro      
106,5.0,                       small and solid  this hub is easy to take anywhere   it even comes with a little pouch to protect it if you throw it in your bag  not that it feels like it needs protection   it works great if you have a laptop or tablet that is short on ports  ethernet  usb s  card readers and power pass through  all in a footprint smaller than your phone   it is a great little aukey box     
107,5.0,                       it is working perfectly to make a docking station for my chromebook  one connection for everything including power  video to a second monitor  speakers  mouse  keyboard  and wired network  perfect except  the darn cable is soooo short  i ve had to order an extender to be able to position it reasonably  they should offer a model with a longer cable or better yet no cable now that my extension cable has arrived it is truly perfect      
108,5.0,                         connections into a single usb c ports  saves a lot of wires coming into my laptop  desk looks much neat  speed is awesome and really well packaged  compact size and easy to carry  took it took out of the box  it has a feel of a solid aluminum glass casing  you can tell it is a quality product  multi stream hubs are expensive but it is not bad at all for the price  so far used it for one extended display and there is no screen flickering  stable connection  if want to keep more wires away from your laptop  just single usb c coming in  this is a good device to have      
109,5.0,                       i like the flat design of this usb c hub because devices plug into the sides rather than the top  which makes it less obtrusive on my desk   it has a usb plug on it  which i think might be usable for charging  i m not sure as my laptop doesn t charge that way  and ethernet as well   i m happy with it      
110,5.0,                       this hub is small  portable and made of good quality  i have used it for more than a week now and it works perfectly fine  i used it with my laptop as well as tab and it connects right away without any delay when using to project it to a second screen it does not take lot of space and comes with a small bag which comes handy when traveling      
111,5.0,                       usb c hub aukey   in   type c adapter with ethernet port   k usb c to hdmi    usb     ports and   unit is well made and stylish  it does what it does as advertised and very good at that  i have had n problems using it to generate pictures from my ipad to my monitor which is why i purchased tis unit  thanks amazon for a good product      
112,5.0,                       was looking for a powered version of this for my new work macbook pro but all of them seemed unreliable  decided on this and an extra official charger  which functionally ends up being the same thing with better reliability and less expensive  i use every single port and rarely have issues  anytime i ve had a problem a simple unplug and replug fixes it immediately      
113,5.0,                       i tested this hub using a microsoft surface pro   that has a single usb c and usb a port along with microsoft s proprietary surface connector for charging and docking   everything works as expected usb       similar speeds using my external hard drive as when connected directly to the onboard usb port ethernet   full gigabit speedhdmi       p     hz  i don t have a  k monitor  it is advertised as  k   hz sd   microsd   cards recognized  similar speeds compared to using a separate usb   card readerusb c   full power pass through charging   this is noted in the description but the usb c port is for power input only   the usb c port on the hub cannot be used to connect another device such as an external hard drive  external monitor  or even to charge a phone   it is really for charging input only   since my surface pro   has only one usb c port  this can restricting depending on your use case      
114,1.0,                       i purchased it cause i make youtube vids  and this company said i can test it out  what they didn t tell me was it had to be positive review  so basically there paying for positive reviews  and not refunding money  feels super cheap  works ok  but buy at your own risk  it s not what people are saying it is cause there paying people  just sucks  i like to test products and give honest opinions  not just positive      
115,5.0,                       opened this up and plugged it in right away  i was having issues with unplugging and plugging in different usb devices every time i wanted to use them  also i have two monitors i wanted to run hdmi from my laptop  this has solved those issues and seems to be of decent quality     
116,5.0,                       my latest laptop didn t include an ethernet port   seems to be the new trend   so i mainly was looking for a hub with ethernet  which this has   but it has so much more  which i m sure i ll make good use of   this build is very solid  and the hub is smaller than i expected  which is a plus for travel   my only improvement would have been to make the connector cable detachable   it does come with a very nice bonus soft material case cover  and the case has a separate compartment for the connector cable  which helps   overall i m very impressed with the hub      
117,5.0,                       i mainly bought this product to use with my midi keyboard for music production  and it works perfectly to connect it  the variety of ports is extremely useful  and i find myself using the ethernet  and the usb ports the most  i have had no problems using the usb a ports to connect and charge my iphone and ipad simultaneously  additionally  the ethernet port works very well and speeds up my computer up by a considerable degree  this is a must buy for any new mac user and anybody who wants to have a clean way to have multiple connections in the same place      
118,5.0,                       having a new mbp  these things are a necessity  unfortunately because mac took away a lot of ports  this aukey is small and comes with a carrying sleeve  and i really like it  the hdmi output was  k to our tv  also nice feature  the usb c charges the computer too if you plug the charger into it  so that is convenient if you want to leave your extra ports free      
119,5.0,                       this is the best little hub i ve used yet  i use it on a mac and chromebook and it  just works   i ve used the sd card readers  usb a sports and hdmi and it all works as expected  you can charge a macbook pro from this device at full charging capacity  it s great  i went to order another one so i d have two but it s marked as unavailable right now        
120,5.0,                       great balance between port options and overall size for travel  the travel pouch is no special reason to buy this but a nice touch that it is included  pass through charging works great  weirdly enough  the couple of times i have needed the sc card reader  it s been a game changer do agree with a couple of the others reviewers that  if this was a full metal chassis  this would be the ultimate tough travel option  come on aukey  offer up a version with a full metal body      
121,5.0,                       i have had several usb and hdmi hub adapters in the past that would not live up to their expectations  but after owning a couple of other aukey products i believed i had found the right one  not only did it perform as expected  it exceeded my expectations  i was able to extend much needed usb     devices and a  k monitor with this hub along with the ability to use it for an ethernet adapter which is a definite plus as many laptops today lack this critical input  i highly recommend this hub for those looking for a quality and inexpensive expansion to their computing needs      
122,5.0,                       i bought this for my huawei matebook x to have additional usb ports and an sd card reader and it worked great for both  it s about the size of a conventional mouse  lightweight and perfect for travel  i intend to use the hdmi output in the future to have dual monitors using hotel room tvs when i m traveling on business      
123,1.0,                       it was working pretty well  i was using with a      macbook air  all of the peripherals except for hdmi out worked fine  hdmi gave me a hard time all along  sometimes took a restart to get it to recognize the hdmi out if it had not been plugged into it for awhile  now i m at the point where it s going in the trash because the hdmi portion simply does not work at all  tested it with a windows machine as well that allows usb c pass through and it did not work  outside the return window unfortunately so i m out     spend the extra     and just get a high quality thunderbolt hub especially if you don t need the portability      
124,5.0,                       got this to replace an   in   hub that i accidentally left in the business center of the hotel    oops   so thankful that i am able to get a replacement so quickly with amazon prime  this actually had a lot in common with the old one i have  but there are some differences to note usb   ports  unlike the previous hub i have  and most   in  s for that matter   this one actually has  x usb   ports    on one side  and one on the other  many   in  s only do two usb   ports and one usb     ports  this is quite nice in my opinion usb c pd passthru  the aukey version supports    w while my older one only does   w  it doesn t really matter too much for my laptop since mine only takes in   w max  but it may make a difference for more power hungry laptops like macbooks power consumption  although most everything is the same  the power consumption is among one of the lower ones i have seen  this unit draws     w on idle without ethernet and     w when ethernet is plugged in  other hubs i have seen generally use     or    w of power  this may not sound like a big difference  although it would matter over time if you are on battery power ethernet lights  i am not sure whether or not i like this yet  but this unit emits a white ethernet activity light instead of your normal green light  it does add a bit of cool factor to this thing  although some folks may be disturbed by blinking white lights  it s not too bright though given that they have designed the activity lights to be tugged down below the casing  i probably will still try taping over it at night though when it is pitch black carrying pouch  i really like this pouch  it s compact and the hub has a tight fit about the size of my mouse  unlike most other bags where the hub is loose inside the bag that can cause it to be scratched up inside   it also has a little side pouch on the outside that you can stick the usb c connector in so it does not end up scratching up everything else in your bag  this is a very nice design compared to the other one i had  which had the side pouch on the inside and you have to play around with the bag to get it to close and tugged in properly  having it on the outside just makes everything so much easier as for similarities  this  and among pretty much everything else  uses the same ethernet chipset  realtek rtl       in fact  my windows laptop actually detected this as my old device when i plugged it in  that doesn t really bother me too much per se  although i find it to be a bit interesting one thing that i was able to do with this hub that i didn t realize i could do is to use this as a card reader on my android device  this is quite useful when i am on the go and i need to modify the contents of a microsd card on a phone that does not have an sd slot  i e  most modern phones   as an example  i was able to download my dashcam firmware while i was outside in the car to the sd card without dragging my laptop along with me  the device was plug and play and no additional drivers were needed  the android kernel didn t pick up the ethernet side though  although it will most likely depend on what kernel you are using just like anything else aukey  i find that they are a good value alternative to anker which i personally believe has become too expensive  definitely give this one a go if you need something light and portable for your usb c devices      
125,5.0,                       i needed a usb c hub  because i am now working from home indefinitely due to covid     i got this specific brand because i have had aukey products and trust their products so far so good  i have it plugged in permanently to my work laptop  where it s hooked up to   usbs  and hdmi  the computers built these days are cutting all the basic peripherals   that we have to invest in one of these things  sorry  small complaint overall  it works  i am kinda annoyed with the green light when it s plugged in  i kinda wished it was white  but that s a very small complaint      
126,5.0,                       this usb hub is great  it comes with a small holder when you want to put it in your bag when traveling  it has ports for ethernet  usb c power  two usb   slot  two memory card slots  hdmi  one usb     slot  its       inch wide        inches long  and     inch thick  the usb c cable is       inches long one thing that you should be aware of that is not mentioned on the amazon page but is mentioned in the manual for this hub is that only one external hard drive can be connected to the hub at a time      
127,5.0,                       have a mbp      model and had purchased some dongles in the past to take with me on trips and such but a friend recommended a usb c hub and aukey  prime day came around and i decided to purchase one of these kind of hubs  when i compared the price  visual aspects and what it comes with for what i need this was a no brainer  product works great  compact  comes with a pouch too   and replaces all the dongles      
128,5.0,                       i bought this for one of these newfangled puters that only come with quadruple c ports  of the options  aukey is a trusted brand and this model actually has some style rather than a boring box  it works well and its nice that it came with a little sleeve it works well  i will update if there is additional feedback      
129,1.0,                       i have this adapter plugged in directly to my      macbook pro daily  i use the ethernet port the most to get the most internet speed possible when video calling  my adapter began getting hot and then failed after   months of use  i plug in the ethernet cable into the port and the internet doesnt work  my mac reads it but it has no download or upload  it was great while it lasted      
130,4.0,                       it works great with my dell laptop  hdmi to tv with no issues   construction is great  better than the previous model i had of theirs  feels heavier  better constructed i have a different brand one that works with my kids nintendo switch to tv but didn t take it on our trip because i had this one with me but i couldn t get it to work   it was plug and play on our other one  not sure what the difference is  tried different power hdmi cords  inputs  resolution settings  no joy bought a new fire tablet   hd and read on how it could supposedly connect to a tv but this didn t work for that either   i ll double check with my switch one if i can get it to work on that and update if i do either way  it works great with my laptop which was the major need  just sad that it was not as versatile as the no name one i bought a few months ago for my kids toys      
131,2.0,                       the    w power delivery is unreliable when using a          macbook pro  i have the original   w power supply plugged into the aukey hub and then the hub plugged into my laptop  i also have a single seagate external hard drive connected to the hub via usb but it s only drawing      w       v       a   not sure what the problem is      
132,5.0,                       product came in perfect package  product from outside looks like made up of quality material and black and grey color combo looks classy compared to any other usb c hub  i wanted to have ethernet port for my macbook and this one works perfectly  there are other additional useful ports like micro and macro sd card slot   usb port   hdmi port and   c port stands  easily on table as it has   rubber drops in the bottom to grip  cable to connect to laptop material also seems to be of  great quality      
133,4.0,                       this hub is inexpensive  doesn t require a separate power source and basically works  my major disappointments are    if your bed and office are the same room  as i suspect is true for many quarantining   the ethernet port has really annoying lights that are impossible to turn off that blink every few seconds  so does the top but that s a lot easier to block  i m at the point that i unplug my ethernet every night which is a really dumb solution to a problem they should have just solved    only supports  k     hz  i use a  k monitor and it can run it at   hz but that still kinda sucks  my understanding is they re pushing usb   the data transfer standard that your usb c shaped port uses  to the limits by supporting  k     hz  however  my laptop has a thunderbolt port    i wish it could take advantage of the additional transfer speed      
134,1.0,                       the display started flickering after few days of use  i asked for refund  but aukey said they would send me replacement as this was under warranty  aukey sent me a replacement  it was two weeks before i received replacement unit  same thing happened to the replacement unit also  the return window is not closed  so i guess i am stuck with   broken hubs     
135,5.0,                       this is the second of these i have purchased  the first was taken by my wife for her computer because it worked so much better than what she had at the time   i have not used the hdmi out  my wife does and it works great for her   i have had thumb drives in all   of the usb ports and copied pasted to all of them at the same time with no problems and fast transfer speeds   when i connect through the ethernet port  i am getting full gig speed and i love that the usb c port can be used to power my laptop or i can plug into it for anything else i need it for i highly recommend tis hub  its a great price and works flawlessly      
136,5.0,                       using this to hardwire the new chromecast with google tv  works well  only complaint is that the leds are quite bright even when positioned behind the tv  there s a pretty bright overglow  my quick fix was wrapping the device in a paper towel and taping it  this covers the leds completely and since it sits behind the tv  there s no issue in it looking ugly  otherwise  no complaints      
137,5.0,                       week   review   for what i need  this checks all the boxes  i have a          apple macbook pro  i need a relatively simple workstation  requirements are an external hdmi display  cat  ethernet and a usb a logitech headset  a   w anker charger plugged into the usb c port rounds it out and provides sufficient power to the laptop  bottom line  i need to be able to plug in a single cable and be ready to go  so far this device has worked flawlessly for me  the fit and finish is excellent      
138,5.0,                       macbook pro      wish the cable was a bit longer  but can t fault it for that wanted to use it with the ethernet port but it was inconsistent whether it would reconnect after unplugging from the laptop and plugging back in  i had the same issue with another ethernet dongle on this laptop though so i don t fault this device overall i like it      
139,5.0,                       this hub is so great for switching between my work laptop  a lenovo thinkpad with usb c charger  and my macbook air  i have a separate webcam and my hdmi second monitor hooked up and they work seamlessly with it  as does charging  wish the cable was longer but functionality is spot on      
140,5.0,                       i all around like this product  i leave it on my desk with my keyboard  mouse  power supply and extra monitor plugged into all the time so when i get home i plug in my laptop and boom  all my accessories plugged in on one port  leaving the other ports open to flash drives  it s made of a aluminum bottom and a hard black plastic top that feels like it won t get damaged easily      
141,5.0,                       aukey is known for its high quality products  it is not the only brand i buy  but is one of the brands i trust  this usb c adapter has a variety of ports  including  k hmdi  it is especially helpful that it has pass through power  in my opinion  it is worth the premium price over other less versatile adapters      
142,5.0,                       received this earlier last week and works great  it was plug and play   it s nice to everything connected in one location vs having them run all into the laptop  great quality and simplifies everything  no messing around with settings my computer just knew  thank you      
143,5.0,                       i am a big fan of aukey products  the brand has never disappointed me  i was one of the first few to try out their bluetooth true wireless headset from amazon   loved it so much that i got   more format in laws  however someone stole mine and i just lost interest  i also purchased a wireless charger from aukey recently from amazon  and it works as expected i moved into my new office few weeks back and i had an opportunity to opt for dual monitors  i had a macbook pro that i own abs i wanted to extend the display to    i wanted an adapter dock that would work with my macbook pro to extend my desktop to   displays  one macbook     desktops    the problem was that these desktops didn t have an hdmi port  these were old desktops with vga and dvi ports so i wanted an adapter that allowed a pass through power delivery to macbook   ethernet port so that i can have high speed uninterrupted internet and an hdmi port  i just needed these three  and that s what i got with aukey usb c hub  yes it also had usb a abs a few other inputs i got a hdmi to vga cable from amazon for one monitor to connect to the hdmi port in the aukey adapter  i also bought a usb c to dvi cable from amazon to connect my other monitor to the usb c port directly in the macbook this worked beautifully well for my use case to use with   old non hdmi monitors it s compact and that was super important to me  light weight and works really really well  i didn t need something bulky with so many extra ports and i just got lucky with this one     
144,5.0,                       overall  good product   i ve been using it with my xps         which uses thunderbolt and it works well  tested hdmi output  ethernet  and data transfer speeds via usb and mini sd card   all great  especially for its size and portability  i ve used it both as a standalone adapter  no power input   as well as with power delivery  which is great  it also doesn t heat up using power pass through  however  my only complaint is that the product makes an irritating noise when it is allowing power pass through  especially noticeable in quiet environments      
145,5.0,                       i bought a new macbook pro and my biggest frustration has been the lack of usb and hdmi ports  this usb c hub has been a life saver with allowing me to connect to my external display via hdmi  it is simple to use and quickly connects to my device and i have not had any problems with it  the extra usb ports are really helpful for connecting my mechanical keyboard  i highly recommend this hub      
146,5.0,                       i purchased the the cb c   model   in   unit and it has a high pitch squealing noise when connected   thank god this cb c   model does not   it gets a little warm  but that seems normal to me  i will not run power though it   your just asking for problems trying to power the laptop with it also   other than that  so fas so good      
147,2.0,                       this is an interesting situation  one that i don t think you d read a review about or potentially was even tested in product development the reason this is a   star for me is because when i disconnect this hub from my mac   the internet in my entire house shuts off  read on for whats actually happening i have a wired  ethernet  connection from my router to my hub and the hub directly into my mac  the hub has an hdmi cable connected  the mac power supply connected  and the ethernet connected  when i disconnect the hub from my computer  the data led on the ethernet socket goes crazy  signifying that a lot of data is going through the hub  even though it is disconnected from my computer  as soon as i unplug the ethernet cable  my house internet comes back online   im assuming the hub is railing my internet and my isp router is shutting down the internet thinking its been hacked  trying to figure out the deeper issue  i think the power cord is additionally powering the hub so that when the hub isn t plugged into a computer  the hub is still a device transmitting information which is causing the ethernet port to go crazy resulting in the internet being shut down for all devices i wish this could be tested by aukey  when i tried this same setup on an anker hub  no internet issues  because of this  not only do i need to unplug the hub from my laptop  i then need to unplug the ethernet cable from the hub  which somewhat defeats the purpose of having one thing to disconnect      
148,3.0,                       kept diconnecting my hdmi connection to my monitor   so i thought that was the problem   turns out it kept disconnecting due to the usc c input  charging   i d disconnect the charger and the monitor would turn rightt back on  i ve requested a replacement  the hub kept getting hot too  so im not sure if the    w chraging is causing the issue will update once i ve received the replacement      
149,5.0,                       wow  this is one of the best usb c hub i have ever used  i have owned more than   usb c hub     anker    lenovo and   unknown brand  this is the first time i use aukey usb c hub and it amazed me  at first look it was not so impressive  it is plastic  lenovo is metal  and anker is plastic too and it runs hot  well  it is not hot but warm when i use it for my surface laptop      k monitor our   gbps ethernet and usb thumb drives  secondly  it is very stable  by far  my anker usb c hub would drop ethernet interface sometime even it s rare but it does sometime  lastly it supports    w pass through  this is very important especially for macbook pro       user  normal usb c hub is   w pass through and runs hot  this one support    w and only warm i highly recommend this product and am very satisfied with the purchase        
150,5.0,                       beautiful  little usb hub  has all the functions i need and was very affordable  i use it to attach different tablet devices  samsung   apple  to an external monitor  ethernet  and multiple usb devices  i d been looking for usb c hubs for a couple weeks before deciding to pull the trigger on this  i couldn t be happier  powered on and worked great right out of the box with my tab s       
151,5.0,                       i really like the size of it  i would have preferred that the main usb c cable was a bit    inch  larger  since when the computer is in a stand it does not reach the bottom of the dest well constructed  and feels solid  hdmi works perfectly for a secondary monitor and good extension capabilities  pass through power works well      
152,5.0,                       whatever you do  do not pull the power cord from this while it is plugged into the computer  it immediately shut my computer down and broke the camera  lesson learned otherwise  really amazing product      
153,5.0,                       edit  their customer service came through and provided a replacement device in addition to a refund so  all in all this is a very good device  it does most of what is advertised  i m having one issue and one annoyance with it though the issue i m having is that despite it saying it has    w usb pd passthrough  i cannot get it to push more than   w through with a   w charger  this means that if i dock my laptop and am using it  it will not charge at all the whole time i use it  note that this is a     macbook pro  i imagine if you have a     this would be a non issue  my annoyance has to do with the ethernet port  for whatever reason instead of going with the standard green and amber lights that everyone else uses the activity light is a massively bright white led  so when i m using my laptop  the wall behind my computer is constantly flashing  eventually i taped over it  which solved the problem  but man that s annoying      
154,2.0,                       with only a wireless usb mouse attachment hooked up to this thing  it could cook an egg   the cord is really short  so if you have your laptop on a stand  it dangles and will eventually damage the socket if you don t put it on top of a box or something      
155,5.0,                       aukey makes very good peripherals and this is just another example  the new macbook air and pro only have usb c ports  so you need a hub like this in order to use regular usb devices  plug in a monitor or projector via hdmi  or connect to an ethernet jack  additionally  this supports usb power delivery so you can plug your power cable into the hub and get all the additional ports without sacrificing your usb c port for charging      
156,5.0,                       this is the most powerful usb c hub with almost all functions  it meets every need of mine  there are many aspects it does better than other hubs i ve got    surfacethe black matt surface of the hub looks elegant and clean on my desk  feels smooth and no fingerprint left behind    scratch proofit s made of really hard material and not a single scratch after several days use  still looks like a brand new one    hidden ethernet portunlike other hubs with an open ethernet port  this one hides the port perfectly  you can hardly see it s plugged in    carry pouchthis carry pouch they provided for free is not a random cheap one  it fits perfectly to the hub and is well stitched  never feel awkward taking it around  you know how badly designed and material other sellers may use besides all these  they also provide a book of instructions  you can tell they spent time on writing it  very detailed introduction  you can t find fault with such a beautiful artwork      
157,5.0,                       i connect this to my      macbook pro that i have hooked up to a monitor  works great  does exactly what it is supposed to do  i am able to charge my laptop  use the hdmi output to my monitor and plug in my sd cards all at the same time  it is small and sleek  while being nicely built  has a good quality feel  easy to travel with since it is nice and small  and even come swith a pouch to carry it around in  overall very happy with this product as it is not too bulky and it does everything i needed it to do      
158,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i can t thank the computer gods for this rich in io usb c hub  i ve bought this well over   months ago for my laptop  while my main computer  my desktop  was in the shop  i had the luxury of using this for my dual monitor support i can say for a fact this was well worth the money  for one the ios on here are what i needed    usb a    sd card slots  one large and the other micro     usb c for power delivery      watts  and data transfer    multi gigabyte ethernet port  and   hdmi port with all of these ios someome  like myself  should have no problem with running all of my computer accessories  also  the price doesn t justify the quality or quantity of this usb c hub  i m not sure how aukey got around to making sure it doesn t break the bank  one thing is for sure it s well crafted  and light with a small carrying pouch      
159,5.0,                       i bought this to have a way to connect various non usb c devices to my pc   laptop  this item does the job beautifully  the quality is great  the various connections including  k hdmi are great and work as intended  its a bonus that there is a built in multi memory card reader as well the look of the device is appealing and blends in well with other devices equipment aukey is a great   trusted brand and i never worry about their products working i definitely recommend this item if you are looking for a new all in one device to keep areas clutter free and don t want to worry about various types of connections      
160,3.0,                       as others have mentioned  the hub only charges at   w  however  the most concerning issue is that the drives connected to the hub randomly disconnect while transferring reached out to support via email  website did not work for me  said something about connection not being stable  edit  support replied back through a  rd party site  which seemed a bit odd and untrustworthy but sent files to install  the tool sent is an  exe file  so either dual boot windows on your mac or have a windows pc  no instructions provided but managed to install the update  it now charges as expected  will update the review about hdds      
161,3.0,                       i use nearly all the ports on this dock  and after   months i noticed it began to overheat a lot  it also damaged my usb devices that were connected to the hub  i ll be diving into amazon to find another dock to utilize and don t recommend others to purchase this one      
162,5.0,                       just got this today  worked great right out of the box  i have a very tight space and this was compact enough to fit under my hutch  worked great to extend my macbook screen to my monitor and also connected my old logitech wireless headphones to the laptop through the usb  works great  i definitely recommend it if you want to declutter your desk  i have had a few bulky ones before but this one surprised me with the size  totally worth the price  few things to note though  you cannot use both the sd card slots simultaneously  connect only one external hard drive at a time  and the usb     cannot be used to charge your phone  still giving this   stars because i don t need either of those things and it solves my problem of having a powerful compact and simple usb hub for a great price      
163,5.0,                       so i bought this because i needed a port for my ethernet  this was perfect it s small  light weight  and easy to travel with  it comes with a super cute case that is sleek and inconspicuous  you can see the port is small and black  you can see in the picture how big it is by a sticky note  plus it comes with this dope key sticker      
164,5.0,                       i needed to replace a usb c hub that i had previously purchased  and i was looking for two specific features   a  k hdmi adapter and an ethernet port   the aukey fit the bill  and it was a brand that i had purchased previously  so i trusted the quality of its products   this product is no exception   all of the connections are solid  including the hdmi  the sd card and and micro sd card slots   the usb charging capabilities are exceptionally fast   it works perfectly with my macbook pro  and it is incredibly lightweight and portable without feeling cheap   it comes with a pouch with a pocket on front to tuck the cable into so that everything stays nice and organized when you throw it in your backpack  bag  purse  or briefcase   i highly recommend this for its quality and versatility      
165,1.0,                       i wish there were a way to contact the company for support   however  i guess i have to leave a negative review to try and contact the company   this is not the ideal way to go about handling tech support   maybe somewhere in the paperwork  it tells me how to contact them  but i am unable to locate it   this morning my device just started flashing its green connection light rapidly   it used to come on solid  but now it flashes and i was unable to use it to connect usb devices to my mac book pro   maybe there is a fix  maybe it is broken   hopefully  a review can help me understand this issue more      
166,5.0,                       this little dock is super handy  if you re like me sometimes i like to work at my desk with a keyboard  mouse and a monitor  or take the laptop elsewhere to work  i can leave a network cable  usb cables for all of my accessories  hdmi cable for the monitor all plugged into the dock  all i need to do is plug the dock into the usb c connector and i magically have all of these great accessories activated  it s much easier to use than the traditional old school docks  with a proprietary dock connector  it can easily be connected or disconnected without worrying about your laptop s display settings  it can also be used by many different laptop manufacturers  the case of the dock feels very well made of hard molded plastic  it has rubber feet on the bottom to prevent it from sliding on your desk  it even comes with a travel bag to keep it secure in your laptop bag if you are traveling for pleasure or work and want to plug it into a desk at your office or in a hotel room      
167,5.0,                       i am writing this review after purchasing my second of these  i love them  i have   places i need a hub plugging in a variety of things into my     macbook pro laptop  so instead of unplugging the things and taking the hub with me  i bought a second hub and just undock my laptop from it  my favorite part about the hub is the ethernet port  i love my macbook  but what it lacks is any ports besides the usb c  so you need a dongle for everything  this hub does all of that   if you are wondering  i tried it as a nintendo switch dock alternative  and it does not work  but that isn t why i bought it   totally worth the price      
168,4.0,                       pros  nicely designed multi connector   high quality build and low profile  just plug and play   it works cons  the cable power plug is inadequately too short for me  it s permanently attached to the unit so you can t replace it  because of the short cable  i m forced to place this connector on the side of my laptop   rather than the back to hide the messy connectors  putting it on the side takes up precious desk space      
169,5.0,                       i ve used everything from apple  anker  and satechi dongles  and all the way up the price ladder to the caldigit ts  dock  i think the anker usb c dongle is the gold standard to beat and i have no regrets at this price point  i was looking for an extra usb port for my wireless mouse dongle  i hate bluetooth issues and use an external keyboard and camera  and since this came with   usb a ports it fit the bill  additionally the    w usb pd pass through lets me charge my work     mbp    w charger  sufficiently while other dongles limited you to   w max which meant you were more likely to plug in the power cable separately if you needed a quick charge  the rubber matte finish on top completes the package as its sleek and hides on my black desk some gripes i might have are the ethernet lights are always on even if i m not connected so it lights up the room at night even if no laptop is plugged in  and really wish the usb c cable was just a tad longer maybe an extra   inches  i also don t like bright lights so i put black electrical tape on top of the green led to remove distractions  would prefer it be removed entirely   and though i know there are technical limitations but would love to see a version with displayport instead of hdmi      
170,4.0,                       edit  aukey has great customer service and reached out to me about making it right i was excited that this unit claimed to support    w power pass through  which is required if you want to plug in the new     macbook pro and not also have to plug in the power cord separately unfortunately  the unit does not support    w power pass through out of the box  you are advised to run a firmware update on the device  the firmware updating software is only available for windows  however  i finally got access to a windows computer with usb c and tried to run the firmware update only for it to fail  i checked aukey s forums and many others are reporting the same    the firmware update software simply doesn t work for a lot of people  even if you have a windows computer with usb c handy otherwise  it s a fine device  i m just a little salty that i chose this one specifically for the    w power pass through and it simply does not work      
171,2.0,                       this will not support a power supply for dell xps          w    what will is totu usb c hub    https   www amazon com gp product b  fx lw   ref ppx yo dt b asin title o   s   ie utf  psc  orqgeem   in   usb c hub     
172,3.0,                       i bought this specifically to work with the new    inch macbook pro all of the ports on this device work as advertised except for the usb c power delivery  i was only getting   w  yes  the macbook will still charge  but if i am running a heavy load it will actually discharge it is also built really well  i think they just need to change the marketing to   w and this would be a   star review      
173,5.0,                       i bought this for my macbook pro since i needed something with sd capability and was tired of carrying multiple  overpriced apple dongles around  this thing works great  it s lightweight and includes a small carrying pouch  i ve used every port on it simultaneously with zero issue  i ll buy another when my wife finally upgraded her old max to the new usb c version      
174,5.0,                       i ordered quite a few hubs for my new chromecast with google tv and none worked  so i figured i would give this one a try  it worked flawlessly  i just plug the chromecasts existing power adapter  the chromecast into the usb type c  and the ethernet cable in the back the first thing i noticed upon opening is the presentation  its neatly packaged  and comes with a nice carry case  its also got a smooth matte finish      
175,5.0,                       i had issues with my first one where the usb     port stopped working after a few weeks  i was going to return it but the company worked things out very well to my satisfaction  i am pleased with the outcome and i am sure the  nd one will function perfectly      
176,3.0,                       this item is not bad  but it is not great  i picked it up to add an extra display  have an sd card slot and run my cameras tethered via usb  it does the trick but it can be sensitive at times  this is especially the case when using on the field  it will freeze up my computer application using the usb port if it gets jostled too much  this works perfectly fine as a docking unit  i do like the build and feel of it otherwise  i am surprised it self powers despite the low wattage that the macbook air m  puts out      
177,5.0,                       i bought this to use in my office to consolidate my connections but it s working so well that i may start traveling with it   it stays cool to the touch  unlike my last usb c hub  which is important for usb c hubs with power delivery      
178,1.0,                       this unit did not work with xps      did not connect to network through ethernet port      
179,3.0,                       i bought this to reduce the number of connections to my laptop with the power cord  ethernet and hdmi   but my laptop complains when it s powered by the hub that it is only getting    w with the    w supply   the description claims    w pass through charging  but maybe that only works if i use a higher wattage charger and not the one that came with my laptop   they need to clearly state how much wattage drop there is for pass through charging   sad      
180,1.0,                       this seemed ok but i just traced this device to intermittent internet problems i was having   bummed   i need the extra connections  so i will have to find another device  might just have to go to hp when i bought the laptop new in        but it came with far too few connection points      
181,5.0,                       excellent product i mostly use it for sd card transfers but the other additional connectors are also welcome for if and when i need them usb c connection is solid  has a power activity light  all in all its a nice convenient little package connections for lan  usb      c and an hdmi port definitely handy if your computer has a spare usb c port and you need to expand      
182,1.0,                       disappointed  mine started acting up to where it has to be in a certain position to stay connected charged  and the return window closed may     it s june  th and i want to return this product but i just noticed the defect and now i m outside the return window  normally aukey products are good  this one  not so much      
183,5.0,                       wow  this products exceeds my expectations   it is small  sleek and easy to use   the best part   it comes with a stylish case to put it in when not in use  which will help keep all of the ports clean and free of debris   it also comes with a great warranty  which always increases my confidence that the company believes they make a great product      
184,5.0,                       i own a ton of these type of hubs and give them out to friends and family who need flexibility when they travel  this one is the smallest and lightest weight  i like that it includes just what i need and nothing extra  when i m out for a shoot  i use this transfer my photos to my macbook pro  and use the extra usbs to charge up my phone and other devices  it also comes with a handy little fabric pouch  i highly recommend this      
185,5.0,                       anyone with a new mac will appreciate this little hub   it gives back to you all the ports apple took away in the newer laptops and as a bonus  you also get a network port   i especially liked the color matched my mac a nice unexpected bonus is the inclusion of a carry case      
186,5.0,                       works great with samsung s    for dex hdmi output while still using usb mouse keyboard controller  passthru charging also works with samsung s included charger  though it will charger slower  super fast charging enabled results in fast charging according to the phone hub itself is fairly light plastic  and has a matte finish and slightly textured top  doesn t have a cheap plastic feel  and it won t show fingerprints micro scratches  there is some give creeking if you apply pressure  but it feels more than sturdy enough to put in a backpack or laptop bag  included pouch is a nice bonus to help protect the plastic and stow the cable      
187,1.0,                       this is connected with the   w apple macbook pro    charger connected also  the ethernet on the unit they shipped did not work at all      
188,5.0,                       this seemed like a great way to add functionality to my chromebook  which only had two usb c slots and one micro sd slot  and it really delivered   it allows me to run a full sized usb stick or full sized sd card  plus adds hdmi output to the device   the same holds true for my android phone   the best part is that it works with both  so i just need this one small item when travelling      
189,5.0,                       got my first macbook and was worried about how i am going to use my external keyboard  mouse and second screen at the same time for my projects  my friends who own macbook used to tell me none of their multiports adapters work that well with macbook  i was also skeptical about this adapter s performance before i received it  it turns out to be very effective adapters with capacity to handle multiple loads  it can handles very easy data flow when i work on heavy projects to transmit it to second screen back and froth along with other plugged in devices such as pendeive  external mouse  keyboard  and my phone to run the app that i  am working on  very good adapter for very reasonable price      
190,5.0,                       i just switch to the macbook pro   inch      and was upset to see it didn t have any usb port so i purchased this product  i do not regret this purchase in the slightest  i can now use my mouse  chargers  external hard drives with this hub all at the same time  i am also on the move so i love how small it is to transport  the ports aren t loose like most cheap hubs and the cord quality is top notch      
191,2.0,                       the product worked good for everything but the hdmi port  i am a university student and i bought this hub for my pixel slate running chrome os to add a second display as well as ethernet  i liked that it has sd and micro slots as well as   usb ports all worked great  the problem was the hdmi display would flicker on and off and glitch excessively  i have a smaller usb c hub that does the same thing  minus ethernet and the abundance of usb ports  and doesn t ever give me issues with the second display so i m a little disappointed aukey s is giving me this issue since generally their stuff works pretty well  maybe it will run better on windows or macos      
192,2.0,                       it seemed to be working correctly  until it started breaking my network connection while on zoom calls  i d have to unplug it from my laptop  macbook pro  and plug it in again to fix it   i returned it      
193,5.0,                       i desperately needed an adapter like this for my new macbook since it only has type c ports  this adapter fulfilled all my needs  it has hdmi    usb ports  one type c  sd and micro sd card reader and also ethernet port  all in one  i don t know if it s fair to expect    mm audio jack in this but that d be next level awesome connection speed is also very fast even with multiple devices connected to it at the same time design is also awesome  build quality seems strong   very slim and feel good texture and good material it is one of my best investment for my computer accessories  in the picture i uploaded  the stickers come extra so i thought sticking one onto itself  i totally recommend this item to everyone out there looking for an adapter      
194,5.0,                       i have a laptop that has usb c out   i have a monitor  a usb keyboard and a usb mouse that i hoped i could connect to with a single connection  i m absolutely thrilled to find that this device works   i get     x          hz on the monitor  and i don t even need to have external power to the hub dock device  i am just hooking my laptop to the dock via usb c  and the dock goes to my monitor via hdmi   mouse and keyboard work just fine also i did not try to extend the laptop screen because my laptop screen does    hz and i didn t want to limit the monitor   i just used it closed lid hooked into the dock device a full featured dock would have the ability to use an external power source to provide power to my laptop so that i have a single connection  but i looked at the price tag on those and i am perfectly happy using the laptop s own power brick i also have an ipad pro that i wanted to see if i could dock  and surprise  it works   but the limitations of the ipad os make it sort of clunky   the mouse wheel must be used the traditional mac direction  which is not my preference  it can t be switched in settings like you can on a mac  also  the video aspect ratio doesn t adjust to the aspect resolution of the monitor   if has the black bar sides  except when you are consuming video that has a different resolution like     x       also  a mouse pointer  button doesn t  work  like the capacitive touch sensitivity of the ipad screen   this device would be just great to dock a macbook pro or air  but it isn t quite there with the ipad because of the os for the price  it fits my purpose perfectly for less than i expected to spend   i definitely recommend this device if your usage scenario is anything like mine      
195,5.0,                       just bought a new macbook pro and decided i d better purchase a hub that has all of the ports i would potentially need   i chose this based on features and reviews and although i ve done nothing more than test it  it is a very nice  lightweight  attractive device at a reasonable price      
196,3.0,                       everything about this hub is great except the actual reason i bought it for   the ethernet function  as another reviewer said  it s wobbly and inconsistent     
197,2.0,                       the usb c port wouldn t work with my monitor  the hdmi output worked with my monitor  but the usb a b did not work with my keyboard  the ethernet cable did not work  i was working on slow wifi all day and was getting so frustrated before i realized it wasn t registering the cord   returned it      
198,5.0,                       i have used many hubs in the past  expensive ones from dell which have very few ports to cheaper ones that are wobbly and very low quality this one has a great build quality and   usb a porta which i use for my logi peripherals  usb mic external storage  the fact that it has usb   support    out of   ports  makes data transfers blazing fast there is also a usb c which means you don t really lose any post by using the hub this costs half of the ones sold by dell but is sooooo much better  it s missing vga port compared to the dell ones but who uses vga anymore  i would highly recommend this      
199,5.0,                       i got a macbook air last year and very disappointed that it only came with usb c  i use a few cameras for vacations and dashcams that use a micro sd cars  so i had to get a usb     to usb c converter then a sd card reader  then a sd card to micro sd card  this solves that issue  another thing is my printer only is in usb  solves the issue  well worth the money considering how small and convenient it is      
200,5.0,                       when i started researching on what macbook i wanted to buy  i knew i would have to find a thunderbolt hub to use all my existing devices  external hard drive  camera  monitor   while there are many options available  i was more or less inclined towards the one which attach to the macbook  but at the same time i didnt liked the idea of having a hub always attached to my macbook  when i saw this product  i liked it as this is a slim multi port  yet it has all the input options i was looking for  i like that it doesn t plug right up against my laptop but instead has a flexible cord to distance it a little to avoid rubbing scratching my macbook  i have used this for connected usb devices and hdmi ports so far and it has worked every time without issue  reasonably priced  i have used aukey products earlier  so i knew these were of good quality  i am happy with this purchase     
201,4.0,                       going to return this hub  the ethernet port is so recessed that you can t plug into it so it defeats the purpose  tried different cables none reached  the sd card reader corrupted files on multiple memory cards  only thing i will say is the build quality and design aesthetic is nice and the hdmi port did work great  it s compact  but i m going to get a different brand edit  after speaking with customer service they made things much better  they were very helpful and would consider aukey products again in the future      
202,1.0,                       purchased this to use dex on my galaxy note      unfortunately the hdmi port blinks when connected to the monitor  i ve tested the cable and monitor which both work with other devices fine  my guess is that there s something wrong with the hdmi port on the product i received      
203,5.0,                       i purchased a new macbook air and was struggling to determine how i d get the necessary ports that i needed  i purchased and adapter from apple but it    didn t have enough ports and    was more expensive  this   in   has way more ports  is much more affordable and works great  would highly recommend and not bother with the expensive accessories apple sells     
204,5.0,                       i have been on the lookout for a great usb c hub with ethernet  i have been using another style  but multiple locations i wanted to use my laptop had spotty wifi  but a great ethernet wired internet  although i love the new macbooks  the   usb c ports can be annoying for situations like that  i often am using   to   of the available ports on this thing and it works like a charm  also i prefer the hub style where the usb c port and the hdmi port are right by each other  since those are the two ports i use the most everything is on one side and the hub stays put  this unit is very light so i am hoping for longevity  but right now every port works great and no complaints from me for this price      
205,5.0,                       the product works great  no problems so far and it actually holds up to my   gbps internet  unlike previous products i have owned  not for gaming though frame rate drops if you want over    fps  i love it for the internet port since my dell laptop makes it a pain each time to unplug  ease of use it great      
206,1.0,                       i bought this three months ago  when it arrived  i was excited about it since i purchased my dad one three months prior  however  after one month of getting it  my hdmi port stopped working  i just ignored it and kept using it even though i wanted it to begin with to get down to only one cable i had to plug and unplug  well  tonight  after three months  my usb c port that power came from stopped working  now  it s completely useless  be careful when buying this product  ports may quit on you shortly after purchase      
207,5.0,                       if you re looking for a sleek  effective hub  you re looking right at it  this hub offers practicality  high quality output  and multi purpose use  and it s all packed in a slim case that fits in the palm of your hand i ve used this little guy for data transfers and direct internet hookups for a multitude of devices  it even works perfect as a secondary hub for the nintendo switch  really useful especially when gaming online or downloading content to the console it has two usb     ports which is perfect for my hp spectre x    that has a single usb     port  i can plug it into the laptop s thunderbolt usb c port and still have the laptop s usb port available for use  definitely a life saver compared to any usb a hubs out there  i can comfortably transfer photos and videos  and even have a couple more devices connected to the laptop  all because of this really awesome dock the quality is really great  and the slim and small size makes it truly a must have for everyone who needs a handy little hub      
208,5.0,                       this hub looks and weighs about the same as an old style nokia or motorola brick phone  there is one non removable type c usb cable sticking out so if you don t have usb c then that might be annoying  the hdmi port and three usb   ports make this a perfect samsung dex hub  which is the primary reason i purchased this particular unit  it works flawlessly  the galaxy s  recognized it immediately and i was able to connect a monitor and a wireless keyboard and mouse to my phone  there is a snug pouch that comes with this unit to protect it in a bag or backpack for people on the go  this is a great unit for the price      
209,1.0,                       update from review below     months in and it has crapped the bed  can t really get work done  any type of movement and the screen either blacks out or becomes fuzzy  the noise comes on ever few mins of it connecting and in connecting  i have literally only unplugged this twice to bring with me to work  i can t imagine it lasting long for someone who wants to use this as a travel device  don t waste your time or money   spend a little more get better when i first received this i was very happy with the product  its necessary to have a device like this if you own a mac and a lot of them can be expensive  with that said i have used this product for the past few months and my biggest gripe is the connection for the hdmi cable  i thought it was the connection to the monitor but after testing out a few things i found the connection to the hub is very poor  if you move the hub while connected to a monitor it will black out or become fuzzy  sometimes it will just blackout and you will have to unplug and re plug i believe the quality is the issue  its light and the connections seem to be a problem my biggest use was to connect to a monitor so having this problem can be frustrating      
210,5.0,                       this isn t just a usb gadget  it s a complete docking station  the only thing it doesn t do is provide power  the hdmi port is powerful and native  so it runs whether you re logged in or not  the dock doesn t require any drivers  and the ports are fast  i m very impressed  for the price  this can replace expensive docking stations  i ve been working from home during the covid    pandemic  and i needed a second monitor on my laptop  with this device  i can have my laptop hooked in my home office without running out of peripherals on my laptop  and  if i have to take my laptop to a different room  i only have to unplug one jack to disconnect all my junk  this is invaluable  and i need more      
211,5.0,                       there s not much to write home about with the io  they all work  however  i am by no means stress testing this hub  in the usb ports i plug in my keyboard  mouse  and controller  plug in my monitor  and my ethernet  it s nice to just be able to plug in this hub rather than those   aforementioned items independently  while the build isn t metal  as the pictures might have you believe  the plastic isn t super cheap  and it won t catch all your fingerprints  the rubber feet on the bottom make it great to just leave on your desk  as it won t be sliding around all in all  for me  i don t need all the options offered by a usb c laptop hub  and this little guy does the trick while remaining portable  light  and cheaper finally  it s nice that this can also be used with your phone  simply plug it in  and it can read sd cards  thumb drives  keyboard  mice  and likely even run a display  the fact that i can use this on multiple devices is another plus      
212,5.0,                       i love this compared to the standard apple adapter for usb c that only gives   usb port capability this was smaller in size than i expected and very light weight  had no problems connecting to ethernet and usb accessories great product      
213,1.0,                       i plugged the hub into my computer  and the green led on top turned on  i inserted my camera s memory card  and i was able to see the pictures for about    seconds before they all suddenly disappeared  i could not find the usb hub in the finder any more  and three computers will not recognize it it just died and will not work after    seconds of use      
214,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is my third aukey product  i trust this brand and that is one reason i opted for this product compared to other products available in market for cheaper price the product is very sleek  very easy for transportation  won t occupy much space in your bags its like a size of a mouse  great for people who carry laptops in small bags  the cable is not very long too  fits in your pocket very easily can be attached to your laptop using a velcro the matte finishing is great  scratches won t be visible not very heavy cons comes with a cheap carrying case  would never use that bag  also  felt the price is bit high compared to other products in amazon  wish they had one more type c output highly recommend this product for anyone who would want to carry a hub with themselves alway  recommend this product      
215,5.0,                       this is the best small usb c hub i found with every port i was looking for  hdmi  ethernet  usb a    usb     and   usb   sd card reader and a usb c input for charging now i only need to plug one usb c cable to my laptop to have all my peripherals connected  power  keyboard  screen  webcam  wired internet  and can easily switch between work and private laptop the hub even comes with a nice pouch for travelling  this is a nice touch  i have never been disappointed with aukey products and this hub is in line with the other products i have from them      
216,4.0,                       update   after posting my issues on this review  customer service reached out to me and sent me a new hub after a few email exchanges  new one received works great  awesome customer service really like the overall build and design but that s where it stops for me on the positives for my experience with this  i have a handful of aukey products that i use and have been a fan for a long time  this hub however was nothing but headaches   display out on my mac was stuck at   hz on my  k display even when it read as hdmi      pd claiming to be    w only output   w and had only one usb device connected  tried this on my mac and windows laptop  ran extremely hot  display would also flickeri didn t have these issues in my apple display adapter or another hub that i have  thinking i have gotten a defect and hope this isn t a common issue with this product      
217,5.0,                       update   informed aukey of the problem  they replaced it in   days   all s good now   their customer service is great have ethernet  trackpad  and keyboard attached to this hub   all was fine for   months  then it started overheating   cursor would randomly move  characters would randomly appear or be dropped   if i disconnect for   minutes  it would work properly for another hour  then the same problem   not sufficiently reliable for long term use      
218,5.0,                       delivery for some reason was delayed by amazon  but luckily i was one extra day available in the same location so was able to collect my shipment product is definitely not the premium built as compared to its competitors  but as an informed consumer i know there is a price for everything  with the price range and features offered by aukey in this little dynamite of a compact product  i would not have asked for more  it is sleek  mobility is convenient with its in package pouch that you can see in pictures  very convenient to carry this around in my laptop carrying case and bag  this had all the ports on offer that a modern day executive needs with their laptops that only come with usb c ports  it has high speed lan input output  usb a ports  hdmi  and sd card slots  this is my go to product on daily basis now      
219,5.0,                       a great little product  i use it with a high quality thunderbolt   compatible   ft usb extension cable to provide power and high speed wired ethernet to my laptop all in one connection  my gbe cable from my router reports this is a gbe device  and my   w pd usb c charger works to provide power for this device and my laptop the hub is plugged into  i was also able to add the wireless keyboard and mouse usb a dongles to this and use everything at once over the   ft extension cable without issue be warned  thunderbolt    has an absolute cable distance limit of  ft  and requires high enough quality devices and cables that it can even go that distance  that s why i was surprised this product was able to do it at this price point  if you try to stretch the cables longer  you ll get noticeable worse data speeds  power delivery  pd  also requires compatible devices to pass thru high power from a wall charger to a laptop  and his enough cable quality to handle up to    w  this device does it without issue  all the way up to the maximum    w  which is also unusual for devices at this price point      
220,5.0,                       bought this as my previous usb c adapter didn t have sd card slot  first off  i like aukey products and think that in general  they re as good if not better than anker  i own two of aukey s dashcams and they are much better  in terms of user friendliness and design  than the anker roav equivalent i had for this adapter  i ve used the microsd slot  usb ports and even a power pass through usb c  i did not test ethernet as i don t have a reason to yet  overall i m happy with the performance of the usb c adapter and i ve no issues  hdmi works as expected  though i m only using a     p monitor   the usb ports and microsd slots work as as expected  didn t notice any performance difference but i didn t really test either  the power pass through works great  my girlfriend has a macbook and just used her   w power adapter and plugged into this adapter and now we use this hub as a docking station  we just plug this adapter in and we get power  our wireless keyboards and am connected to a monitor  super easy and nice  if there was an option to add a longer usb c cable  that would really make it great as a docking station replacement  i will say i noticed it runs pretty hot especially if power is plugged in too but so far there s been no issues and am happy with it as is      
221,4.0,                       plugged the aukey hub into my xps  and then plugged in the power adapter that came with my laptop    w   and got a warning about low power charger  kinda bummed but not a deal breaker i suppose  i have   usb c ports  so i just plugged the charger directly to my laptop  the hub works fine passively  was able to connect to my monitor with hdmi  usb ports work  haven t tried the sd card slots or ethernet jack yet  maybe later if i can find a higher wattage charger  i ll try again  but overall  it s a nice hub      
222,5.0,                       this is a great alternative to a dock stations   great portable device   i was able to connect a  k monitor  pixio px   h   mouse  keyboard and headset with no problems   the power delivery works well for these two laptops  so there is only one cable going into the laptop c type port at any given time   i ve used this adapter for a number of days  for   hours plus a day  with not issues whatsoever   highly recommended if you are looking for a portable solution that will work out of the box with most usb devices   i just wish the c type cable on the adapter was a little bit longer      
223,1.0,                       i ve struggled to use this product for a few weeks  when trying to use eithernet  usb camera  usb mic  usb dongle  and hdmi it fails time and time again  one item will get slow and fail  today while holding an important zoom meeting  the whole device failed and would not restart unless i unplugged everything  i ll not be using it any longer      
224,5.0,                       i got this to get gig ethernet and usb ports on a chromecast with google tv   it works perfectly   all ports seem to function  ethernet is active and working quite well  and there are no power delivery issues   the ethernet port does have blinking white activity light that is very distracting   i covered it up mostly with electrical tape      
225,5.0,                       i bought this to plug into my laptop since it doesnt have as many ports as i d like and its missing an sd card reader slot  works as advertised and i didnt notice it getting especially hot and i had no problems with connection during long file transfers  it comes with a small carrying case which is a nice touch      
226,3.0,                       this device worked perfectly until it didn t   by that  i mean that it bricked my new m  macbook pro   i used this device for a couple weeks without issue when today  i unplugged the power to the aukey hub and suddenly my m  bricked   it absolutely won t turn on   i spent an hour on the phone with apple customer support before finding out that i am going to have to return the macbook for repair replacement   they stated that there is the possibility that the hub may have damaged the motherboard  beware    now  i am sticking with three stars because the product seemed to work well when it worked   the build quality seems durable   the connectors seem solid   however  i do not know if this is an aukey issue  or an apple issue   what i do know is that i have a       paperweight  and a secondary smaller paperweight with aukey printed on it beware and do your due research      
227,5.0,                       truly this aukey usb c hub   in   type c adapter hub works like a charm with the newly released google tv chromecast device  a marriage made in heaven  like white on rice  like hands and gloves is how the aukey usb c type adapter hub works with the new chromecast google tv device  in the keyboard photo above they several added ultimate enhancement features connections  giving your new google tv device an upscale enhancement with totally control via a logitech cursor keyboard  ethernet port      mb   usb mass storage   camera  google duo   sweet      
228,5.0,                       when i plugged this into my computer it was recognized and worked like a charm  i do keep getting a notification that my computer may not be able to provide enough power for the usb hub  i m currently looking into a resolution but everything has been working without any problems so far  usbs are responsive and there aren t any drops with the ethernet connection  overall  i m satisfied with this purchase      
229,1.0,                       sadly this product didn t work for me   i don t know if it was the product or that it wasn t compatible with my microsoft surface go   i got    mb of speed from the  gb ethernet port   i had to disconnect the entire unit five minutes before air time   i m going to return it      
230,5.0,                       i had a      macbook pro  which only has usb c ports  however i did not have any usb c product before and it s annoying when i got it first time  i looked over on amazon and found this product  i had aukey products before and like this brand for this hub  it meets all i need  it has pd usb c port which can provide power    usb  sd  tf and ethernet and hdmi port  it s inconvenient traveling abroad or in a country when there is not wifi access even in the hotel  the usb c to hdmi adapter is really expensive from apple which is not even multi functional  with this hub it can meets all i need and save money  the speed of transferring data of sd or usb devices and charging speed are really good  it is also good for photographers who need transfer pictures a lot     
231,5.0,                       overall it s a good  reliable usb hub and i prefer the rounded style to the other brick looking brands all ports work including the usb c port  it does get warm when in use and the power indicator light is unnecessary but standard on most of these hubs size wise it s about about the width and height of a credit card  maybe two inches longer  and has the thickness of a pen  the weight is relatively light if this has all the ports you need then it s a great buy      
232,5.0,                       i m currently using this for my      ipad pro       i ve used different types of adapters  this one by far has the most ways of expanding the usb c port on the ipad   i had my ipad connected to a monitor  made use of the ethernet port  and attached a portable hdd at once  i had no problems testing the dongle with all three ports in use   this will be my goto adapter for my ipad and any future laptop with that only has usb c ports      
233,5.0,                       just used this for my newly arrived macbook with usb c ports and it seems to be working fine  hdmi connected fine to external display and the usb a ports allow me to reuse my old cables to charge my phone  haven t tested the other stuff yet but i like that the device is small and light  and it has all the features i might need      
234,1.0,                       straight out of the box  i had issues with the ethernet connectivity as others have mentioned   the connection often cycles off for no reason  and the hub has even shut down our whole home internet network on multiple occasions  also  the connection speed was  much  slower than other devices connected by ethernet in our home while i purchased this hub specifically for the ethernet port  i figured i would keep the hub and use it for its other functions  however  yesterday  just two weeks outside of amazon s return policy   when plugging in an external hard drive  the entire unit kept cycling on and off until i finally disconnected it   i had the power pass through connected as well as a monitor   i am very disappointed with this product   i purchased a similar hub from staples that has been working beautifully and receives the higher connection speeds i would expect i would not recommend purchasing this product       
235,1.0,                       the day after i connected this adapter i noticed that the power connection came out of the adapter  i connected the connection again and there was a flash from the adaptermy computer shut down and stopped respondingit was not possible to turn it on and i had to send the computer to apple after an internet search i discovered that a poor quality hub can ruin your computer this adapter caused me hundreds of dollars in damage one day after using it do not recommend buying it my macbook macbook pro  m             
236,4.0,                       this is a tough review to leave because i feel like this hub will work for     of folks without any issues  but in my use case  it had a major failing that makes it unworkable for me to start  it s small  easy to use  and works well right out of the box for my      macbook pro   in  some of the slots are a little close together which occasionally required a bit of shuffling around for various plug housing sizes  but that was no big deal the problem for me is that i  use dictation a lot for writing and  for reasons unknown  dictation does not work work while this hub is plugged into my macbook it doesn t matter if i use an external mic  plugged into the hub or the macbook itself  or the onboard mic  dictation refused to respond to input until the hub was unplugged  i spent hours troubleshooting online and a half hour online with apple care but the end result was the same  i could  sorta  get voice control to work  but it would quit at odd moments   only if the hub was plugged in i have heard that other dictation software advises you not to plug mics into hubs  but in this case  it didn t matter where the mic was plugged in  as long as the hub was plugged into my laptop  dictation failed like i said  not a huge deal and probably won t affect most users  but as a writer  i dictate often to save my wrists   and  if i were a person  who relied on accessibility programs this would be a dealbreaker i tried it for several months but never developed a workaround  short of unplugging it for writing   thereby disconnecting from monitor and peripherals  so  unfortunately  i won t be using his hub any longer  maybe for travel  i am eager to see if other hubs have this issue      
237,5.0,                       i needed a usb c hub to power my usb c only laptop and hook it up to a monitor with hdmi  i wanted something that was similar to a docking station without the price tag  and this one fit the bill  i tried out three different usb c hubs and decided to keep this one  i like the look and feel of this one the best  it has a unique shape  sits flat on my desk  and looks more like a mini docking station  the other two hubs i tried didn t sit flat neatly on my desk and they made scraping noises when they moved  this one has all the ports that i need  on a daily basis  i use the powered delivery usb c  usb for my mouse and for charging my keyboard  and the hdmi for the monitor the other two usb c hubs that i tried https   www amazon com gp product b  h zs b  ref ppx yo dt b search asin title ie utf  psc  https   www amazon com gp product b  rwg m   ref ppx yo dt b search asin title ie utf  psc  i have a  k dell xps    that i got fro costco in september  all three hubs that i ve tried give a low output warning but i have found that my laptop charged as i use it all day for work  i plan to get this hub again for my home office      
238,5.0,                       i ve used other hubs for my macbook  and they either felt cheaply made  or got really hot  this one is solid  has more features  and while it gets warm  doesn t concern me  overall  i think it s worth the spending a few extra dollars to get this hub  rather than the cheaper ones that are all over the place      
239,5.0,                       it is always painful when you have a macbook to find the best usb c hub  i tried several items so far  but this one is the best by far  the exterior of the hub is very modern  the hub also has multiple slots for all different inputs and outputs  i really got impressed by the quality and style  very highly recommended      
240,1.0,                       used this for zoom as well  ethernet would randomly take out my internet for a few seconds each session  like other reviewers have noted   didn t think it was this hub until now  then the usb c cable started intermittently connecting disconnecting repeatedly during one zoom call  i gave up and bought another hub  unfortunate as aukey has some decent products     is this firmware problem  please fix eventually      
241,2.0,                       product appeared to be as described upon arrival  pretty cheap feeling build for the price tag  ugreen options were same price with better build quality  but this one had the  k option  usb c passthrough     w charging  hdmi in one unit  so i jumped on this  seller sent generic e mail making sure everything was received promptly which was nice to see as i haven t seen that before as title states  three hours in my external usb mypassport stopped working out of nowhere and then kept connecting and re connecting rapidly  thank goodness it didn t fry any sectors it appears   i know these mypassports don t drain much power because i can run one off of my android phone utilizing otg usb     protocols with a basic  a charger brick and it works like a gem and still charges my phone at a decent rate  so something was off  at first i thought it was my galaxy book s misbehaving or having driver issues i tried both usb c ports on the galaxy book  i tried different charger heading to the galaxy book and the usb hub  in total i finally got it to work and recognize a drive that port  switched to flash drive in case it tried to fry my mypassport again   it finally recognized it again lasted   minutes  it started shutting down mypassport again due to lack of power  then it started setting off the usb port alarm on my samsung galaxy book  immediately unplugged the hub  the thing was on fire  i tested the hub on my older dell and now the other usb ports on the hub do the same thing  all fried  over draining power  i unplugged everything but the ethernet from the hub  then then whole hub stops reading anything it literally used up my entire galaxy book battery  lasts    frreaking hours uncharged   stay away this was cheaply made and almost ruined a brand new laptop  several usb storage devices and my power supplies  about       total buy ugreen  everything worked great when i went back to them     
242,5.0,                       it comes in great packaging and the pouch is perfect for travel as it even has a pocket for the cable  it looks high quality  will update as i use it more  make sure to read the instructions to understand what it can do      
243,5.0,                       my intention for this hub was to use as a aukey usb c hub for samsung dex feature available on samsung galaxy flagship devices  such as the note  s  and higher the packaging was sturdy  and included a nice sleeve case for the hub  which would make it easy to toss in a laptop bag or suitcase when traveling  the finish is a matte black  and the i o ports are on the three sides of the hub  with usb     type a ports and sd cards slots on one side  the ethernet port opposite the face with the cord  and hdmi  usb c power delivery port  for charging the docked device  and a single usb     type a on the remaining side in one of the attached pictures  you can see i connected the display  power  network  and wireless usb mouse and keyboard  once i connected to my note   this booted right into dex  in the photo  you can see with the circled icons in the system tray that the phone was using ethernet and external keyboard mouse input supplied by the hub the hub was sturdy  and my worry was with all the i o plugged in that connections might be shaky or loose  but everything worked great  i was able to load many android apps and use them in a windowed mode  just like a desktop pc  the hub did not get hot  even with all the processing it was doing overall  this is a greats usb c hub  and a great value  i own other aukey devices  chargers  powerbanks  headphones  etc   and they never seem to disappoint      
244,5.0,                       pros   ports a plenty   fast usb    s  card reader  power throughput  hdmi and ethernet   saved me a whole dongle in my kit bag and this works better than the other two ever did   size   small and lighter than other hubs   finish   quality materials mean a good looking and what feels like robust build   travel pouch adds a touch of class   usbc cable   small pro  but the designs that have a short cable that plugs into usbc  rather than a straight plug so that it looks like an extension of the device  makes more sense and is more versatile in the situations it can be used in   works seamlessly   plug all the devices and power into the hub  plug hub into macbook and they re all there   other dongles have required apollo mission style sequence of insertions and connections to get everything working  this one doesn t cons   only one   the activity light on the ethernet port is so bright it could be seen from the moon   nothing some tape marker couldn t fix but when it s in a darkened room it s too distracting   normally would take a star off for that but it s easily user fixable so leaving it at        
245,2.0,                       i was looking for a hub for my new macbook pro  i needed something to plug an ethernet cable into as we don t use wireless at home  i have noticed depending on what i am using zoom  facebook etc the hub gets hot and it heats up my computer  this is inconsistent  it recommends plugging in the hub to your computer first then plugging the ethernet into the hub which i have done  i find that it still continues to get hot but not all the time  when that happens i unplug it because i don t want my new computer to get ruined  it s small enough to put into my computer case      
246,5.0,                       i like it so much i bought    i got one for a dell laptop when my new charging cord arrived and it was a usb c charger taking away a port  this allows full pass through charging with no issues and does well with my usb web cam for zoom  data transfer on usb flash drive is quick  when my wife s apple usb c dongle for her macbook stopped working right i got her one too  she uses it for hdmi out to a     monitor  webcam  laser printer  mouse  and charging  no problems with any connection  i ve been very impressed  its a nice compact size and the cord is just long enough      
247,5.0,                       i purchased this to replace my usb c port replicator that i forgot in my office   my last replicator was also an aukey and it was metal where this one is plastic   it comes well packaged and unlike the metal one this comes with a nice little carrying bag   though i haven t been traveling as much i m sure travel will pick up soon and this will be easier to  carry just because it is a few oz lighter      
248,3.0,                       this hub works well to power my macbook pro and allow me to use basic usb attachments   i ve used an external hard drive on the usb     port  the ethernet port  and the hdmi port with no issues   however  the usb     ports seem to be a bit under powered if you need to use something that draws a lot of power   i could not get my external blu ray disc reader to work until i gave it direct power from another adapter  i don t have that problem with another full sized dock that i have      
249,5.0,                       at first  i got a cheap one and that broke within   weeks  part of the connector stuck in my        laptop  never again  i would not buy any cheap brand and risk my macbook  this is very durable and small to travel with  make your tv your monitor  no need to struggle with small monitor and hurt your neck  money well spent      
250,5.0,                       i recently bought a new mac book pro that had limited ports  as all the new laptops on the market  you get a powerful device with a sleek design which unfortunately compromises space for ports  the trend is usually having a single usb c and if you re lucky  you ll get another usb c and usb a then you re stuck with buying an expensive hub that your laptop oem sells vs  this impressive premium aukey usb c hub with  xusb     ports   k hdmi port  ethernet    gbps  and best of all another usb c port for power delivery  to top it off it also includes a regular sd and micro sd card ports for transferring photos if you re an avid traveler and photographer what i appreciate about any tech company  is providing to its customers with a travel case to help protect and maintain their product  aukey provides a soft touch travel pouch included in the packaging this product has been ideal for my requirements  i need a hdmi connecter because i connect my laptop to different displays whether it s a monitor  tv or projector for presentations  the three usb a     ports allow me to simultaneously copy data at a high speed and to my surprise  the hub doesn t heat up when copying large data  these ports also fast charged my smartphone  at the same time i can connect my oem usb c power adapter to the hub without losing another usb c port on the laptop i highly recommend this top notch product by aukey  the premium   in   usb c hub provides me with all the ports that are essential for my work in one hub      
251,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i got this thinking that the aukey brand name was popular and maybe of good quality but guess not  it is advertised as being able to provide    w usb pd charging  it cannot do this and i would recommend people to not try to connect their expensive laptops to this to test i wanted this unit so that i could connect my macbook charger to the usb c pd in  and my usb keyboard and mouse  sd card  and ethernet to this singular hub and just have the hub usb c input to my macbook  this way i could just come back home and connect my macbook to the hub and have a one cable solution  but the device gets extremely hot and cannot charge over usb c  it starts to charge and then disconnects charging every few seconds  can be seen doing it once in the video   after a couple days  charging stopped completely  i have tried a variety of different chargers and with another laptop too  hp spectre x     to no avail i talked to amazon and got a replacement  the replacement had the exact same issue bottomline  everything other than charging the laptop works on this hub  so if you are not looking to charge your laptop thru the hub  you should be fine  in that case  you should be able to find cheaper docks that dont have the circuitry  if you want to charge your    inch macbook  this does not work edit  the company has refunded me      
252,5.0,                       this usbc adapter does the job it sets out to do  it give me all the possible ports i would need for my laptop  all of the ports are fast and that s all i could really ask for  the rubber feet don t sound like a bug deal but they are awesome to have  i ve had dongles in the past and they tend to have a mind of there own when its plugged in  i wasn t expecting a case either which is a good touch  overall a great product      
253,5.0,                       i travel a lot and live a life on the road half of the time each year  this product is going to be a life saver  the product comes in a nicely packaged cardboard muji vibe box and contains an instruction booklet and a fabric sleeve the usb hub charges a lot faster than i thought and distributes it evenly among different devices  once you plug this into your laptop  you can connect up to three other devices using the hub s usb  another via hdmi for screens  in addition  there s an ethernet port for hotels that have extremely slow wifi  we all know which brands of hotels those are eh   and two for sd cards i will mainly be using these to charge my laptop at the same time with my phone  tablet  gopro  and backup batteries  when you re traveling in countries like europe  some hotels have limited outlets  and if you re staying at hostels  you might just have one that is available  having this will allow you to charge everything overnight at once so that you ll have all the juice needed for the next day  especially if you re doing cross country backpacking or business trips that limits your down time to do these things      
254,5.0,                       transfer speeds are good  plenty of ports for my needs  and it seems well made samsung dex does work on my note     you just have to power the aukey dock via usb c  i can plug a full sized focusrite scarlett audio interface into my phone and record music just like i m on a computer  and i can do it while plugged into a tv or monitor  this is the future     
255,4.0,                       it basically does what it says it does  i haven t tried it with any hard drives  such as cards or jump drives  yet  but it handles my apogee duet well and solves the issue with only having thunderbolt   usb c ports on my macbook pro the short usb c connector cord means that when things are plugged in it won t stay flat on the table  but it is lightweight  the pass through power aspect works  tho i opted for a direct connection w  a mag power adapter like the old macbook pros had  highly recommend that  it also came with a little pouch to transport it in i may update this once i try my hard drives with it  but so far it s worked out well      
256,5.0,                       well built hub but i didn t realize how much battery powered it uses from my laptop so i decided to return it  fully charged macbook pro lost     battery power sitting idle in    hours  having to constantly unplug it won t work for me and i need to be able to use this without power   this is not a product complaint just something i didn t realize   in the end  i went with an usb c to hdmi cable and a bluetooth mouse keyboard   the other usb c port on my mac will be used for charging  etc  overall i was very pleased with the build of this unit and it worked very well      
257,2.0,                       there appears to be a power issue with this hub currently  i have a razer mouse connected  iphone via usb lightning cable and ethernet connection  i am also running power through the hub using the power adapter that came with my macbook pro  while playing wow the power continues to drop slowly  sign that the laptop is not receiving enough power while connected to this hub  for that reason alone i d say this hub is pretty much useless  i m also just barely outside of the    day return window or i d return it  had i known this hub wouldn t supply enough power i d have gone with a different device  buyer beware      
258,5.0,                       i travel a lot with a single backpack  so i m careful to buy equipment that can serve multiple purposes while being lightweight  when i recently switched to a      macbook air  i was looking for a usb c hub that would give me the ports i needed while adding minimal weight i bought this aukey hub along with an anker   in   usb c hub  both do the job well and are almost identical in dimensions  though the aukey is a bit smaller in overall volume as its body is more curved  more importantly  while the anker weights in at    oz  the aukey is only    oz  in hand  the weight difference is palpable  making the aukey a better travel companion for me      
259,1.0,                       i purchased this to use with my macbook to connect power  monitor and ethernet port   it worked very well for the first three months   however  the usb to charge my laptop no longer works   i expected this to work longer than three months after purchase   i will not buy this again and extremely disappointed in the hub      
260,5.0,                       i used to have the style hub where it plugs directly into the side of the computer into both usb c ports  the main problem i had with that is that when you try to unplug anything  you wind up pulling out the whole device disconnecting anything else attached to it this is a much more elegant solution  the ethernet port is nice to have even though i don t use it  there are two things i appreciate about this adapter   the inclusion of a usb     port and a pc hdmi connection  for those that don t know  the logitech unifying receiver has some intermittent issues when connected to a usb   port that can cause intermittent disconnecting  i have an mx master  s and ever since switching to this adapter i haven t had a single problem with disconnects when i connect my display it s recognized as an actual monitor and not a generic hdmi source  the difference here is that under macos you get access to proper scaling options  and not just     p or    p resolutions  unfortunately  it doesn t support    hz  but i think for most people that won t matter  i don t use my macbook for gaming  so it doesn t really bother me either the included carrying case is a nice little bonus and will be a permanent part of my travel gear      
261,5.0,                       i bought this for my dell vostro      and all functions work properly including pd charging through the usb c back into the laptop  ethernet performs as fast as my centurylink fiber feed allows which is about    mbps down and up  although i have not tried the card readers i have no doubt they ll also perform well  the hdmi connected to my monitor with no issues either  with new laptops providing less ports this is a great option at a great price point  i paired it with an aukey    w pd wall charger that currently shows as a   w charger but that may be because of the cord i m currently using  a new    w cord should arrive today and after i test it s function i ll do a review of the charger which is much smaller than the dell    w which is admittedly faster charging when at home  i am very happy with both units and highly recommend them      
262,5.0,                       it worked exactly as i had hoped  never been disappointed with an aukey product to be honest  i primarily bought this to use a spare usb c port on my desktop pc because i was running out of ports  the speed is blazing fast and i finally have a sd card slot and many more usb ports on my pc now  the form factor is so small i was surprised  this thing is tiny  looked much bigger on the pictures  so far  no issues      
263,1.0,                       hdmi port on the hub is not working  when i connect hdmi cable to the hub  then it is not detected by monitor or tv  but when i connect the hdmi cable directly to the laptop  then it works fine this defeats the purpose of having a hub  as i still need to connect the hdmi cable directly to laptop     
264,4.0,                       i m unsure whether or not this usb c hub has certain power requirements that make it inconvenient when connecting other usb c hubs to other ports during use  i ve noticed several times that i ve had to move my peripheral usb     devices to a different hub to get them to work properly  i use   different usb c hubs  not daisy chained  separate usb c ports  to facilitate a dual monitor setup on my macbook pro  all i had was an hdmi cable and another usb     wireless mouse device connected  and it seems this particular port on the hub no longer works  and i can only assume it was power related  it s only with this hub  not others  just wanted to share my experience  i m sure you re experience   times out of    will be a     star experience  however  i wanted to share this edge case experience in case anyone will be using it in a similar setup      
265,5.0,                       this usb hub is a literal all in one accessory anyone who is always on the move with  i use this primarily with my macbook pro for transferring documents  i thought that the data transfer speed would be affected because of the fact that im using an extension but i was wrong  crazy quick transfers and i love love love the fact that i have an additional   usb ports  extremely sleek and sturdy design  very happy with my purchase      
266,5.0,                       love the versatility of this hub supporting all my devices  newer slim laptops no longer have rj   ethernet jacks to hardwire into your network  so this hub offers the network port i need to achieve a fast and stable internet connection  best of all  the rj   connector on the hub isn t one of those hidden pull out or tilt down jacks that will eventually catch on something and break  but instead just a standard straight plugin jack for your cable      
267,5.0,                       best rating all the time  i always get anker over other products because it s very reliable  this is the second product that i bought and i am very pleased to say that it worked well and i do not have any problems with it  materials are always reliable and very sturdy while at the same time very light  it is very easy for traveling and i do not have any problems with it at all  love it      
268,5.0,                       when i realized with short notice that i d be traveling light   very light    and that my laptop was out of state  i was glad to learn that my samsung galaxy s  had a feature called dex that is somewhat handy for viewing on any hdmi capable tv or screen movies from netflix or amazon prime   also good for surfing the internet on a larger screen  most of all it can be much easier to work with a spreadsheet on a tv screen than on a phone screen  this device allows me to bring just a lightweight keyboard to a hotel and leave the laptop behind when i can t pack a laptop  it also allows me to charge the phone with usb c while watching videos on dex  and best of all the phone screen can be off   helping save battery life  this is much better than using an hdmi adapter  i just got it  so i don t have a review of longevity      
269,5.0,                       i  use this hub very often  i have it connected to an hd monitor and it powers my laptop and the monitor and i have used an sd card and a back up hard drive at the same time as all the previous and i have no issues so far  i can definitely recommend this aukey hub to anyone  i am using it with a chromebook  i have not used the ethernet connector      
270,5.0,                       this hub works exactly like i hoped it would  aukey makes very solid products and this is no exception  i ll probably never use all of the features but for what i needed it exceeds my expectations and i will recommend it to anyone who needs a usb c hub or even a usb c to hdmi adapter as this does that and so much more     
271,5.0,                       using with a new m  macbook for ethernet and power connections  works great   i was surprised how small this is   i like the way the ethernet port is elegantly integrated to conceal the cable connection   you can still see a light when data goes across the port   if it is distracting  turn the hub so it is facing away from you  the usb c cable from the hub to the computer is less than   inches  so it sits conveniently near the computer i have had good experiences with aukey products before  and have every reason to expect the same from this hub      
272,5.0,                       the hub is compact and lightweight with all the connectivity i need   the only thing that maybe would have been nice would be an audio output  but that is a very minor point   it is an excellent hub that actually powers my          macbook pro  at the full capacity needed  my machine is used for lots of heavy code compilation and  k video editing tasks    beware that a lot of other hubs can only provide   w which would be not enough  it is great to travel with  but also works well when using on a full time basis at home or in the office  this very affordable hub did allow me to not have to buy one of those      or      high end hubs i just need to give a shout out to the great customer service at aukey  the only problem i had with it  or so i thought at first  was that my monitor would not go to  k resolution when connected through the hub  i tried a different monitor  different cables  etc  but the only common factor was that when connected through the hub my mac would not recognize the monitor as  k  i contacted aukey customer service  who promptly replied and verified i had tried all practical things to resolve the issue  and then immediately send me a replacement  when that one arrived i still had the same problem and  since i could not imagine that a good company like aukey would have   bad items in a row  i started digging deeper  turns out that somewhere in some os upgrade a bug crept in where it would not recognize lg monitors when connected through a hub  any hub  not just aukey   so the problem was not on aukey s side  the solution was actually simple  by using a free app named  display menu  in the app store   which allows you to set the monitor to  k regardless of what preferences on the mac tells you  and now try monitor works great at  k through the hub  i assume in the future lg or apple will fix this without the need for this      
273,2.0,                       my laptop has only type c ports  so i needed a hub to attach an external monitor  i purchased the aukey   in   usb c hub for this purpose  i also purchased an aukey   in   usb c hub  i attached the   in   hub to an hp z    k monitor using the hdmi port  it worked for about two months  but then failed suddenly   first the monitor started to flicker on and off  and then minutes later would only display colored static   snow    i unplugged the monitor from the   in   hub and plugged in to the   in   hub using a different port on my laptop  the   in   was able to run the monitor without issues  i also use the   in   for ethernet and to attache an external    tb hard drive  most of the time the   in   can handle these  but occasionally it drops the connection to the hard disk      
274,5.0,                       my employer bought one of these as techs for our jobs  and it has such a quality build and just works so well  i bought one for myself  i ve used this on both mac and pc  and each port works flawlessly  the build quality is solid  and doesn t feel cheap at all  the case is built out of metal and plastic  and has a reassuring weight   nothing is needed to install  it simply starts working with windows    and mac os  i d highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for a usb c port replicator      
275,2.0,                       when i initially purchased this  the power passthrough worked and was awesome  given i only had to use one of my usbc ports for everything   after about a month  the power passthrough stopped working   i highly doubt it was due to anything on my end as it s the newer macbook air  as shown in many of their ads and promotional media  using stock usb c cord provided by apple and in the month of usage i referred to i didn t even move this computer around  it just stayed connected to the hub in one stationary spot   so yeah  it s just flakey      
276,4.0,                       pros   the display and ethernet adapters worked well  and it could drive a keyboard and mouse and charge an iphone while running a monitor   very light  half the weight of aluminum cased hubs  passthrough charging is a nice feature   manages thermals well  i have a usb drive that tends to get hot and it worked fine with this hub   good port assortment  both ethernet  and  hdmi  plus   usb type a ports cons   unapologetically plasticky  can be finicky with power  i can t drive peripherals or charge my iphone off the usb c port   it s  only  useful for passthrough power  status lights are too bright and light leaks out of every port  blinking ethernet light is really annoying overall  a good hub  but not my top pick i bought this usb hub for        and was reimbursed     
277,5.0,                       my employer got me a dell work computer and paid for an expensive       dell docking station  the dell station is bulky and way too expensive  i purchased this aukey dock for my wife s dell laptop for a fifth of the price  and it does everything my work one does  it s much smaller and so much cheaper  while doing everything it needs to    star purchase      
278,4.0,                       what a great product  i can t help but smile at it s elegant look and compact size  it also has a decent amount and variety of ports to make it an ideal accessory to have in my travel case i already purchased a one of these types from a not so well known brand and it worked out great  the only thing missing was an rj    port  while i have no need for one at home   i do for when i travel for work  that s when i came across aukey  the prices seemed just right  looked compact enough for travel and had all the needed ports boy did it not disappoint  it fits snugly on to my messenger bag  is light weight and has it s own pouch  the usb c to hdmi is seamless in operation and works well to project media from my phone on to tvs  plenty or usb ports for my jump drives and the rj   which i haven t had to use yet but i expect it should work just fine the only thing stopping me from giving it   stars is because it does not have a usb c to usb a adapter  but that s probably just me being picky all in all  i m pretty satisfied with this product and wild recommend it highly      
279,5.0,                       the aukey usb c hub is honestly really amazing and is a life changer for me since i own a laptop that doesn t come with an ethernet port and having one with multiple usb a ports  usb c pd passthrough port  an hdmi for multiple monitors  and an sd card reader that can read microsd cards without the need of an adapter is simplely amazing  it can do everything that i want it to do and it really expands the capability of my laptop now that i can connect an ethernet cable onto my hub which can allow me to game without any latency  important for alvr which is wireless vr streaming to my oculus quest     since i m going to college soon  this will definitely come with me and to compliment the usb c hub  they included a pouch to store the hub which is pretty dandy  especially since that the usb c jack won t scratch my stuff inside my bag  overall  i heavily recommend the usb c hub      
280,1.0,                       i got this hub because i needed an ethernet adapter for my new     macbook pro and because i like aukey s other products  i feel like they dropped the ball on this one pros  build quality seems nice  lots of ports for other peripheralscons  their manual has a lot of caveats to what you can plug in  such as   only one external hard drive can be connected to this hub  when using the usb     ports  you can t plug in anything that requires more than    ma of power  i wanted to plug in my wireless charging pad with it  but it causes the hub to regularly disconnect with have the mac say  usb accessories disabled   that said  i guess you shouldn t be using this for charging other devices  but rather just data transfer  so it s not really the worst con    the usb     ports may also interfere with    ghz wireless devices  e g  wireless mice and keyboards   so it asks you to plug those in somewhere else  fortunately  my mouse uses    hz  and it seems to work fine for now   the sd and microsd card slots can t be used simultaneously  that said  i doubt there will be many times i would do such a thing  so again  not really the worst con i guess   be sure to connect the pass through usb c charging first before connecting your usb     devices since they may require the extra power  i use the   w macbook pro power adapter my laptop came with and it seems to work fine   the hub heats up a fair bit  but i feel like almost all hubs also heat up  so i think it s fine  it s not like unbearably hot or anything   lastly  my carrying pouch doesn t seem to have come with my product   aukey  if you see this  please send me one  overall  i m a little disappointed with how many little caveats there are with this hub  i suppose most are understandable  but i also thought everything would  just work   which has been my experience with other aukey devices  hope this helps some other people update  ended up returning since they didn t respond to my feedback      
281,5.0,                       i got this usb hub for my new macbook pro  and it works flawlessly  uploading photos from a micro sd and the ability to have a hardwired ethernet connection are crucial to my workflow  only having one external monitor works for me  but the single hdmi output may be a hindrance for others needing more external monitors      
282,5.0,                       this little aukey guy is perfect and a necessity for the newer macbooks  it is sleek and all the hubs work great and instantaneous  it even comes with a very cool sticker to personalize your look  highly recommend and picked this one out from looking at a couple different options  i also recommend using this kind of hub that dongles and not one that fully attaches on the side as you will not be able to use those with a case  once again can t go wrong with this  great product        
283,5.0,                       i love this hub  bought two  one for my          mac book pro so i can extend my desktop while working from home  the other one for my son s computer for online schooling  we got so many wi fi broadcasting in our area and so i can use the hubs ethernet for peace of mind      
284,5.0,                       after jumping the bandwagon from windows to mac and getting on usb c train  all i had to primarily invest in was usb c thunderbolt compatible monitor  now  my monitor acts as my primary docking hub  but tbh i am a minimal user  my keyboard and mouse are wireless  and if needed are plugged into my monitor  and macbook is charged via thunderbolt current from the monitor i bought this docking hub for in case specifically when traveling or at work  to convert between usb c and hdmi and also enable plugging of other usb a b ports where this hub falls short is that  it doesn t have usb c port or support for multiple monitor  but i guess you don t really need that if your needs are  minimal hub for travelers   i have primarily used this to setup and pair my laser printers  card reader for gopro  etc
