0,5.0,                       this was a xmas present for my grandson aj  loves it   he immediately hooked it up to his game console xmas eve and was up all night playing   great gift for your kids              just as an update   my grandson cannot stop playing with this thing   he loves it      
1,5.0,                       there are a lot of things to like about this controller  right away you will be drawn to the razer chroma rgb with its clean bright colors  holding the control feels natural  the size of the grips aren t too small or too large so you avoid cramping your hands after long play sessions  the grips are textured  the abxy buttons are fantastic and feel more like responsive mouse clicks then the usual console controller buttons you have to mash  the swappable sticks and d pad are great for different play styles  the triggers work well and can be locked to decrease the pressure needed to activate  the mappable functions and the stored profiles are also welcomed for creating different set ups based off of the games you are playing  one word of advice is that when using this on a pc you will need to install the razer for xbox app and physically use the controller itself when launching the app  the app will need an update on pc and if you attempt to use a mouse to follow the link it will not work  use the razer controller  the price may seem steep but if you are serious about gaming it will be worth it for you      
2,5.0,                       my husband had the old version and had that one for about three years before the sticks finally started giving out  this was after extensive use everyday  he upgraded to this one instead of replacing the old one and he loves it  he loves the built in chat pad with push to talk so he doesn t have to mute and unmute himself fully all the time      
3,3.0,                       i actually like this controller  but it does have some annoying issues  it mostly sucks for things not game related  like  picking a tv show and trying not to hit the buttons on the bottom of the controller when you put it down or pick it back up  kind of similar to a ps  controller  but worse   this has stopped and started many a show on accident having a cord also kind of sucks for obvious reasons  it gets stuck on things  the cat wants to chew it  it s a strong cord with a great length  but it s really hard to pull out of the controller  that s the point  but i find that too many times the controller either doesn t sync with the xbox upon starts or restarts  sometimes the controller is on but not functioning   and unplugging it and plugging it back in gets annoying  i bought it because it was cheaper and i wouldn t have to charge it  but maybe pay the extra money to skip cord issues i play cod with it  and i like it overall  the joysticks are really responsive  i like the  quick trigger  feature a lot  and the grips on the bottom are nice  i m honestly still not used to the buttons entirely  and the extra xy bumpers are so tiny i miss them a lot  it s also too hard for me to try and use the buttons on the bottom and in the front in an easy way  especially with my left hand  or  it s easy to use the bottom ab buttons and the triggers  but it s hard to reach other bumpers from a comfortable position  i ll generally default back to using the regular buttons on the top of the controller so i can use the bumpers more comfortably if i need to  but it s hard breaking old habits this way i like the feel of the bottom buttons being set to ab  and the springyness of the regular abxy buttons  but i still completely miss xy bumpers a lot because theyre tiny and in between bigger bumpers i got the controller for     and i think if you wanted to try and learn this style of controller this is a worthy option  the cord is long and it fits snuggly into the controller  but  like i said  cord issues  i would probably just spend the extra   for wireless personally      
4,5.0,                       after heavy use of this controller over the last month i have nothing but good things to say about it  it feels great to hold and use  all of the buttons are placed perfectly  a much better option than the elite controller      
5,5.0,                       was easy to set up  just plug in and play  rgb lighting works as well when using the controller on the pc really well  i know a lot of people complained that it didn t work on the pc  but for me it does  feels nice in your hands and has rubber grips  movements are also very smooth  can t complain      
6,5.0,                       very comfortable and very good touch     
7,5.0,                       i play mainly shooters on my xbox one so i m always looking for the best controller for me  didn t want a scuf as the price started get close to the      mark with the options i chose and shipping costs  i already own a elite controller and it s better than the standard controller but i wasn t fully satisfied  never got comfortable with the paddle placement on the back so i ended up removing them entirely  i see reviews for the razer wolverine and purchased immediately  just opening the box you can tell it s a quality product  the build quality is top notch and it should last for some time  feels great in the hand and i have zero issues with the extra button placement  haven t hit them accidentally yet  downloaded the synapse app from the xbox store and changing buttons and lightning is a breeze  the cord is very long    ft  if i was to estimate and braided  very well worth the price in my opinion     
8,5.0,                       great controller and i really like the issue cable it comes with  the triggers and buttons all feel responsive and quick  the buttons also have a mouse click like feel to them  which is weird  but works very well  i haven t had any input delay like i do when using a normal xbox controller even with the usb adapter      
9,5.0,                       having used this controller for over three months now  i can say that it is one of the best controllers i ve used on the xbox one console  the paddles and additional bumper buttons are and responsive and easy to reach  also  the added ability to turn the left and right triggers into hairpin triggers is an absolute godsend  as hearing other folks owning similar controller products have to specifically request hairpin triggers  and that those hairpin triggers do not always work for certain situations in some games  the ability to remap buttons on the fly is absolutely amazing and easy to do  even when in the middle of an intense gaming situation  the synapse app for xbox one is very user friendly and snappy  creating  editing  and duplicating profiles for various games is easy and quick  the one downside  that ended up getting better over time  was the d pad faces  the package comes with two different styles of d pad  and both were very hard to break in at first  finding that  after a while of interaction  would start to hurt cramp my left thumb      
10,5.0,                       after breaking   xbox one controllers i decided to try this razer wolverine controller instead  i loved it instantly  the feel  the position of the buttons  perfect  the best way to describe it is an xbox one controller on superman vitamins  i don t mind that it s not wireless  in fact i prefer it because of the     input that makes the reaction timing instant   and yes you can tell  i hereby vow to never buy a cheap microsoft brand controller ever again  i m hoping this razer wolverine doesn t let me down and holds up      
11,4.0,                       this is a very solid controller for a very good price  it feels very comfortable in my hands  it has all the extra buttons and paddles that i like the button presses are all very solid i love the trigger stops and the rgb feature and the app for the xbox are all very cool  using the app you can program the rgb colors and what all the extra paddles and buttons actually do  you can have multiple profiles set to whatever  my only gripes with it is that it s wired and that it doesn t actually turn on the xbox when you press the xbox button  while the console is off  all very minor gripes in my opinion  well worth the price  i recommend this controller to anybody who asks      
12,1.0,                          months later and the y button stopped working  worst part is that i didnt even use it that much considering it was my pc controller and theres only a few games i play with controller  didnt use and abuse it and still managed to fail on me  i understand why people dont trust razer products      
13,5.0,                       thank you so very much recieved               
14,1.0,                       worked really well for about   or   months then it started randomly disconnecting from xbox one  at first this was only if you angled the controller down  after about   weeks of that  it would only stay connected if the controller is held straight up and down so as to provide consistent tension on the cord connection into the controller  now  no matter how you hold it  the controller will not stay connected  the cord has zero damage to it and both the cord and controller were stored very carefully  it appears the receiving connector inside the controller is bad  i figured a      controller would have significant warranty but i checked shortly after it started messing up and no dice      
15,4.0,                       this is a great controller  the only thing i find wrong with it is the software for windows     it s extremely laggy and doesn t run well at all  i m running a ryzen     x  crosshair vii hero and a     xt      
16,4.0,                       this controller is great  it looks good  responds well  and is obviously built of quality materials  however  it is not for large hands  it is noticeably smaller than the traditional xbox controller and xbox elite controller  if you  like me  have larger hands that just barely fit comfortably around the aforementioned controllers  then you will find it difficult to use this product      
17,1.0,                       fantastic controller  but the back plate fell off when i got it  i bought it refurbished  i m guessing quality control literally didn t even look at this return   i carefully super glued the part that fell off  i will probably need to sand off an edge that protrudes too far      
18,2.0,                       the x button was malfunctioning right out of the box  press it once and it would resister multiple pushes much of the time  trying to play apex legends and it would drop   or   items out of my inventory with one push  i thought maybe it needed a little breaking in so i lived with it for a couple weeks but then it just stopped working all together at times unless i pressed the button hard  i couldn t get a replacement because they were out of stock so i m doing a refund  it seemed like a decent controller so im extremely disappointed and can t recommend it for the money      
19,1.0,                       if you re a devil may cry fan  don t get this  pressing down the triggers causes the bumpers to be very difficult to press unless pressed at a very specific angle  any game where you would have to press down triggers and bumpers at the same time  admittedly few  will run into problems  i confirmed my brother s tournament edition has a similar problem  even worse than mine  the design of the shoulder buttons is in general just poor  the bumpers wiggle around a lot  and pressing them feels terrible  much worse than a standard xbox one controller  they might be ok for most games  but for       why put up with such shoddy construction      
20,5.0,                       great controller  bought it refurbished and it looked brand new besides the box      
21,5.0,                       nice little controller  not for me though  it was a bit over priced but very well made      
22,5.0,                       it a awesome controller  and i don t know why people don t like it the best and feel better than a original controller for someone that play a lot and have sweating hands and that is for a real gamer      
23,1.0,                       this company has absolutely no way to contact them regarding problems with their product  phone   no answer  email   no reply  chat   nothing  i do not recommend this product  their warranty is useless      
24,1.0,                       only use it once to twice a week for a couple hours at a time and not even a full   months of use  the left bumper and trigger stick  the lock switch for the left trigger doesn t work anymore      
25,5.0,                       i love it  the buttons are very light like clicking a mouse  i like being able to switch pads and joy sticks  it does need to be plugged into the system with a cord  but it is very long and doesn t leave any lag      
26,5.0,                       this controller is exactly what i was looking for  i d bought the fusion pro but the dpad was all loosey goosey   very imprecise   which is the opposite of what you want for fighting games  why so many controller makers design their dpad like a floaty joystick is beyond me   the hori fight commander was out of stock everywhere i looked  so that s when i looked into the razer  so glad i did  the dpad is super precise   you re not going to get any wrong inputs  only negative might be that you have to press a bit harder than on the normal xbox one controller   so you won t be getting the wrong inputs but you might occasionally drop one by not pressing hard enough  the added precision is      worth that downside for me personally ditto all of that for the face buttons which also require a fraction more force to press   having a spongy resistance like a classic computer mouse click  as well as the classic mouse click feel and sound    for some reason  it s odd but i kinda like it actually  i also love the lighter weight of the controller in contrast to the heavier fusion  i read a comment somewhere that the razer feels cheap  but i don t get that impression  it s light and that can only be a good thing for control  especially in longer gaming sessions the customization is also excellent  downloading the razer app takes no time and offers a really quick and simple process for selecting your preferences  that led band around the xbox button  never thought there would be so many options for that  tons of colors and fun display options  the way i set it up the led brightens in response to my inputs  which is something i never knew i wanted but is really cool  assigning inputs to the extras buttons and the rest is as simple as can be i actually prefer the extra buttons to paddles  especially the two next to the triggers   very easy to press and has a satisfying click analog sticks are wider like the playstation controller  fine by me  though if you want kontrol freaks make sure you get the playstation ones it s wired only i believe  not a problem for me the rest of it  triggers  grip material  ergonomics  meets the high standards of the other modern advanced controllers as far as i m concerned  it s all excellent all in all  what s not to like          
27,1.0,                       my son absolutely loves the remote but after a few months of use it has stopped working completely  not sure where to find the power cord to replace and see if that s the issue    stars for performance   star for reliability  razr refers to amazon for replacement who refers you back to razr  so warranty is impossible      
28,1.0,                       do not buy   i owned this for   months and it s fried  it suddenly stopped working overnight  the joysticks are atrocious and to change them you have to void the warranty  save your money and buy the elite controller  i sincerely regret wasting my money on this      
29,5.0,                       simply put  razer is the best controller and mice manufacturer in the world  period  i own the wildcat controller and the taipan mouse along with six other devices  the newest addition being the wolverine  craftsmanship  top tier with high grade aluminum parts  high quality buttons  and an excellent finish  it comes with a long  ft braided cord and a nicely molded hardshell case  which i really like   ergonomics  perfection  picking up any razer product just feels right  work goes into researching fit and comfort and you can tell  customization  six additional programmable buttons makes gaming a lot easier  i like remapping the thumbstick buttons so they don t wear out   there are a few cons  mainly the price  you get what you pay for and if you want the best  you are going to pay a little more  there are many additions to this controller which raise the cost  extra buttons  extra thumbsticks  led lighting   what sold it for me was the six additional buttons  if you wait a while  the price eventually will come down to         a much more attractive prospect  also no wireless  this is a corded controller but i need all the response time i can get  so i don t mind proscraftmanshipprogrammable buttonsergonomicsconsexpensivecorded controller     
30,4.0,                       a great controller from razer  i owned the ultimate before and loved it  i returned the tournament because the buttons  xyba  are a little more stiff than a normal xbox controller resulting in pressing a little harder than usual and there being a small delay on input from doing so  i d hope after some use it would have become easier and less stiff over time amazon let me return and buy the ultimate again which have the buttons pretty much as mouse clicks which i ve grown to love and the inputs are instant      
31,5.0,                       hands down  best xbox controller i have ever owned  as of now  there is nothing i can think of to complain about after a month of ownership and consistent use  kontrolfreeks don t fit on the thumbsticks but the thumbsticks themselves are very good as they are      
32,1.0,                       right trigger malfunctioned in day one  are you actually kidding me  ordered a replacement  will update the review once i get the other one edit  bought again and right trigger broke again after couple months  absolute garbage      
33,1.0,                       one of the joystick paddles stopped working a little more than   month after opening     
34,5.0,                       i was shopping between this  the elite and scuf controller  so i read dozens of reviews  people complain about the extra buttons being  too far  but i disagree  i think all buttons are within a reasonable range  the exra control sticks are ok  but for the record you only get one of each  so you cant have matching control sticks unless you use the standards they come with      
35,3.0,                       like the elite controllers the direction pad and joysticks can be customized very easily   the buttons are light and have a mechanical clickiness that is a good upgrade from the rubber carbon pads   my biggest problem of are the mappable trigger buttons on the back   they should be placed closer to the grips rather than the more centered location of the controller   the front buttons make the bumper and trigger button areas a bit too busy  the controller is also strictly wired      
36,3.0,                       i ve had this controller for a while now and i ll give u a quick list of why i gave it only     stars even though this is my main controller the m    buttons on the top are amazing and with the synopsis app it is easy to configure and use but the   buttons on the back are hard to use and i rarely ever use them comfortably i don t mind the fact that it is corded but it seems to be glitchy   i find my self having to unplug it and plug it back in because it will stop responding  or lose some functionality also the buttons in the beginning are awesome i love the clicking feature but like most controllers the buttons  can get worn down  my a button is worn out and though it still works there is no  click  and my trigger locks are ehhh over all i like this controller even though it didn t give me the full functionality i expected out of the   back buttons   and for the price  i wonder what else is out there and if there is something  better    stars   for this controller     
37,5.0,                       i would give this a       i haven t had any real issues with the controller   and actually have grown to really like the buttons next to the triggers   i have large hands and can actually reach across and press the tertiary button with my finger as i press the trigger   i use the left trigger for ads shooters and use the button next to it to  halve  my look sensitivity   provides more controller while being able to still play at max sense for most games   it s a cool feature   but definitely takes some getting used to only gripe i have with it is that the trigger lock sometimes slips   just re engaging the lock fixes it   but it can be annoying when it happens   not a massive issue though again         stars      
38,1.0,                       the rb button stopped working after   days of owning     
39,4.0,                       great for the first bit but started to get stick drift after about   months  buttons were great at first but now are unresponsive at times  never dropped and always kept in case while not being used  all in all it s a great design looks good  feels good  longevity is iffy for something at this price point  for what it s worth it s still a   star controller even with the stick drift and buttons being unresponsive at times      
40,5.0,                       june   th     i had a very hard time finding reviews for this game pad that were geared strictly towards use for pc  windows      so i m writing one  this is strictly a first impression review from a guy that is passionate about casual gaming  so i can t comment on longevity at this point and i m by no means a pro or an e athelete  i just wanted a nice gaming controller  and so far i think i ve found it the razer wolverine ultimate comes in a nice package  razer understands the importance of the wow factor not just from the device itself but also the box it comes in  that box is quality cardboard that opens easily to present the carrying case  with controller inside  front and center stylishly padded in a nice black foam cutout  in a black insert underneath is the braided black cord  and with the controller in the case are the different height thumbsticks and d pad  these easily switchable sticks and d pad are held onto the unit by magnets  and they still feel solidly attached despite being easy to switch without any kind of tools or disassembly  despite it being only a hard wired game pad  the cable still can detach from the controller for easy storage and also has a breakaway towards the usb end  so a clumsy trip up shouldn t send your tower crashing off your desk  the end that plugs into the controller is nicely reinforced with a plastic bracket built into the unit so that the stress of any tugging on the cable doesn t directly fall on the micro usb plug  which seems like a thoughtful design choice  underneath all of that in the box is a simple instruction manual and warranty card  and some other razer promotional stuff  as well as a page with   razer stickers  i hardly ever use them  but i appreciate a company that helps me rock their logo on my equipment if i want  minimalistic and no extra plastic bags  points won from me the buttons feel great and the sticks have a good level of resistance  face buttons feel clicky like mouse buttons and only need a light press  there are rumble motors in the main unit and smaller ones in the main triggers  the unit is not wireless  but for me this is a plus  the controller feels well made and solid  even though it is still lightweight now  my main point of clarification for pc only users  first  the rgb will not synch with your other razer chroma products on pc  i had read about this and was worried that it meant that i wouldn t be able to change the rbg coloring  however  you can download the razer wolverine for xbox app onto windows and set up your color preferences and brightness levels there or turn the lights off completely  the app also lets you individually adjust the two types of rumble features i mentioned earlier  and lets you set up the   remappable bumpers and triggers on the back  it is important to note that these buttons can only be mapped to any of the other buttons on the controller and not any keyboard buttons  not a deal breaker for me  but it s something that needs to be clear for others  so  if you re playing with this only on pc  yes  using the xbox app on your pc allows you to do anything you could do on xbox with it on your pc  but that s it  out of the box it is fully functional plug and play with the default control settings and a shifting rainbow pattern for the lights  for me all of this is fine i hope this review can help other shoppers make a decision  it may not be the best for those looking for      fully customizable control on a competitive pc gaming level  but if you just happen to be a person who wants a really nice wired gaming controller then you have a great option here      
41,2.0,                       controller is nice in some ways but the buttons are too hard to click in fast paced games  the extra   programmable buttons are in  a place that are unusable  the cable it comes with is micro usb instead of usb c   has rubber grip which is nice  triggers are fine  analog sticks are better than microsoft s but are a tad bit too stiff  wired only  for the price i would say this controller isn t worth it  unless on sale  not awful just a lot of weird quirks that make the controller feel strange      
42,5.0,                       this is by far the best controller i ve owned yet  i plugged it in and all the buttons were mapped and ready to go  get the razor app which allows customization    days of use so far      
43,5.0,                       features offers great competitive edge  six extra individually programmable   buttons   triggers means you never have to press a b x y  therefore you never have to remove your thumbs from the joysticks  allowing you to reload switch weapons melee jump build all while still moving and aiming uninterrupted not to mention swappable joysticks of different lengths and curvature as well as a rocker d pad and an individual buttons d pad  fully customizable chat and master volume of    levels each for headphones and earbuds using aux only thanks to control dock imbedded into the bottom of the controller  also has trigger locks allowing faster ads shooting speed  comes with razer synapse app which allows you to customize the color of the bar at the top  how many colors  which way it moves  how it moves  etc  synapse also allows you to bind the extra buttons  two top bumpers  two back buttons and two back triggers  to the original buttons  including joysticks  you already recognize  an extra feature of synapse is that you can use  agile  and  focus  to let you rapidly increase and rapidly decrease the speed at which you aim  agile and focus are generally assigned to the back triggers elite or wolverine if you re trying to decide between the elite and this  choose this  i have used both the elite and the wildcat extensively and this controller in comparison has put the extra buttons in the right place that feels natural to the hands  lack of wireless mobility  a feature of the xbox one elite controller  is made up for by more buttons  more button profiles  more assignment options for those buttons  and real time audio mixing      
44,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          its a   star product but   i bought this about   months ago and i m having an issue where it stops me from sprinting  with apex legends i use the setting auto sprint  so walking literally isn t an option but there s a malfunction where it just continuously stops sprinting and it begins walking  i have tried nier automata and same issue i bought this contoller because a friend recommended it and he said the same exact issue happened with his it makes the game unplayable in the video i am sprinting the entire time  or at least trying to  when you see the gun pull up that s because my character starts walking i recommend this controller  i just hope this issue doesn t continue across all their products other than this the controller is great  the extra button on top near the triggers bumpers are perfect  i don t use the extra buttons in back tho  my fingers just don t work that way lol i have since bought the v  and i love the entire feeling of the controller  i m still waiting for razer to tell me what they can do for the issue      
45,5.0,                       i ve had both razer wolverines  which each broke after a year   they were great for shooting games  but no so much this one and here s why on the original wolverine controllers you can map the focus aim key and continue shooting  or i also used to bind a button for rolling and dodging in division    you have to take your thumb off the right analog stick to jump otherwise  well  i only play phantasy star online   and what i did with the   extra buttons was mapped them to left d pad and right d pad so i can scroll through my hotbar without taking my thumbs off the joystick for this particular event  it is a marvelous controller  if you re looking for an advantage in shooting games  go with one of the other wolverines  but in my position this controller is amazing      
46,2.0,                       i guess the controller itself is fine  but the integration with online software to change the rgb settings and bindings doesn t work or only works sometimes  if you don t want to change the rgb settings then its a great buy  on sale at least  otherwise their are better options out there  i love razer a lot  mouse  keyboard  mousepad  headset  but this is their worst device in my opinion      
47,3.0,                       i was on the fence with this purchase  having not been satisfied with my elite controller  but finally gave it a chance  the overall construction is very solid and it has a good feel  but i question the durability of the buttons over the years  you can t click them softly  you can only click them  having said that  many reviewers say you get used to the clicking over time  but i never did  in fairness  i only played for about   days but the best way i can describe it  is it just doesn t feel like you re playing video game with those buttons  it s different for sure and i understood that going in  but the claim that you get increased responsiveness due to the cord and button click just wasn t true  that was a let down for me many reviewers mention this controller isn t completely customizable  and in fact they are correct  i wasn t sure how important this was to me  only being able to map their additional   m  m  buttons  but the downfall for me was in the deadzone of the thumbsticks  these aren t customizable at all  and there was a significant deadzone in each thumbstick that was noticeable in my main game rocket league  most games allow you to customize the deadzone in game  but that didn t seem to effect how responsive the thumbsticks were  my overall play and angles were less aggressive and responsive and the cat in the bag  the cord  it s a solid cord  made extremely well  again  going in  i liked the idea of having my inputs be more responsive and questioned whether or not a corded controller would be that big of a deal ergonomically  that was until literally   seconds after plugging it in and sitting down my   year old son tripped over the cable  cable length was sufficient for my needs  around    feet  but if you have children  they will trip and disconnect it  luckily they have the breakaway part of the cable but it s still a concern midgame i was hoping this was the controller to fill in the gaps of my elite s drift  bumper and grip problem  but it didn t suit my needs as i hoped it would  thank you amazon for quick shipping and returns      
48,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift for our godson   he is absolutely in heaven        
49,5.0,                       i ll make this short and sweet it s the highest quality controller i ve ever purchased i use it on pc and couldn t be more pleased with the purchase     
50,4.0,                       it s everything i ve ever wanted from a controller  other than the fact that there s too little resistance from the thumbsticks to my liking  it still works great though   it s durable  responds perfectly  and very comfortable  no problems whatsoever  other than the thumbsticks part      
51,5.0,                       don t buy any other controller  amazing amazing amazing      
52,1.0,                       if you are getting this controller for the pc because you want to map additional key strokes to the controller  don t  the only buttons you can map to the additional controls are just xbox buttons that are already there  this controller is useless for the pc and honestly misleading      
53,5.0,                       i love this controller  i love the feel  i love the color cycles  i love the button clicking  its all around a good controller  only problem im having is my right trigger is getting stuck     
54,2.0,                       so i have all the  big name  expensive controllers  i would say this ranks third on my list of controllers the remap buttons are in awkward places the d pad when you use the   axis one it s fine  when you uses the multipad it s useless and not responsive there are only two settings for the trigger stops  the other thing  the xyab buttons are more like short press mouse buttons  there is really no tactile response  i can see how this is faster but it s not as good for the way i play the magnetic replaceable thumb sticks are good but nothing great  i added toppers because they are pretty short overall  you can store two profiles but you have to remember which is which  sometimes it loses the profiles and you have to reload on the flythe best part for me is the mic controls    loudness controls and mute for the mic it s a good wired controller but there are others that are cheaper that feel and work much much better      
55,1.0,                       the product came out of the box  inside a plastic bag  away from the originals sold by the razer  even tough without a manual and the button lt is broken  i m going to return the product and i want my money back      
56,1.0,                       i bought this item for item for my son in november and it stopped working in january  i am very upset about this i paid over a  hundred dollars for this product and now i m being told it can t be returned  something should be done about this      
57,5.0,                       very good product  make sure you read the menu to see how to adjust microphone volume independent of game volume  the rear buttons help a lot  can be difficult to get used to  but when you do get used to them it definitely can give you the edge      
58,1.0,                       the controller was nice enough while it lasted  not worth      though  our controller lasted   months and razer would not replace it  we provided proof of purchase from amazon  but razer would not replace   repair the controller because the sticker that has the serial number for the controller on it was peeled off   beware before you buy   that is the how the company that claims  for gamers by gamers  will treat you  we will never by a razer product again we replaced it with a powera spectra enhanced illuminated wired controller   fraction of the cost and works just as well a small update   here is razer s response to me   beware  not a quality product  to further proceed  we would like to inform you that we have already reached out to our higher level of support and we will not be able to process with the replacement as much as i wanted to break our rules and proceed with the replacement  my hands are tied up  i m a gamer too and i really know how it feels that you spend a lot of money and unable to fully enjoy the device feel free to reply to this email and we hope for your quick and kind response      
59,1.0,                       i bought this controller on august   th        it worked great until today             i was playing a game and the right trigger snapped  just completely got screwed up  now the right trigger and right bumper stay down and the controller is unusable  there is also a little drag on the right stick which isn t a huge problem but now this happened  i absolutely loved this controller until this event  i have a xbox one elite controller and this one  i would choose the wolverine any day over the series until today  also  cannot get in contact with the seller which is a very big problem      
60,5.0,                       the boys play a lot of different games  sports  racing  fps  all of them  they really like these better than the standard ones      
61,1.0,                       i purchased this product and and got to enjoy it once   next time i plugged it in nothing    i typically buy quite a bit of electronics and this is my first experience with a bad product   extremely disappointed      
62,4.0,                       mostly everthing is great but something in the connection for the     mm headphone jack is messed up because it makes some kind of clicking noise when no sound is being made  other than that everything else is great     
63,1.0,                       this is the second time i ve ordered one of these controllers  first one a couple buttons quit working  this one has stick drift in both analog sticks  i bought this controller is september  spending      on a controller  it should last longer than   months  i will not recommend or purchase another razer controller to anyone      
64,4.0,                       this product delivered in all the ways it was designed for  however there were some little things about the controller that made it a uncomfortable experience for my personal preference  these things were the mouse click buttons and the triggers  the reason why i had an issue with these two things is because i have used xbox controllers for all of my gaming up to this point  so  when making the switch to very different buttons and triggers it was very uncomfortable  it felt very weird and i often didn t even feel like i was pressing the buttons  overall  if you want a controller that is based off an xbox controller but has different characteristics while also performing well than this is the controller for you      
65,3.0,                       i love my razer orbweaver  but disjointed in this controller  first off  why is it not wireless  i also though sticks were too loose for my liking  i have better control in my racing games with xbox bluetooth controllers and notice no actual benefit in lag using a cord  why i said  they need to be wireless  bluetooth      i did like the feel of the buttons and the controller seems to be well made otherwise  i game on both pc and xbox  tried it on both systems      
66,1.0,                       i m just getting another elite controller and a repair kit   this feels so off to me     
67,3.0,                       i ended up getting and tested the controller as soon as it arrived  first impressions were that it looked and felt like a quality controller  for a wired controller i thought the      price range was a bit high but i figured i d save some money because originally i was going to get an xbox elite controller  tested and loved the buttons and thumbstick controls as well as the programable features  not many  but it was a nice add on  the problem i ran into was with one game in particular which was a side scrolling game and noticed that when the left controller stick would be moved all the way to the right or left the game character would keep on moving even when stick was back to center  this was with the default settings and i could not find a fix for it no matter what i tried  tested with other games mainly fps games and the problem would not occur  in the end i did not want to ignore this issue and later on see the problem appear on other games  so i decided to return it  i did check the support page and couldn t find anything describing this particular issue and found no firmware updates for me to try  hopefully in the future there is a patch for this because razer made a nice controller here  maybe it was just my controller and other buyers aren t experiencing this but i wanted to put it on the review in case others are seeing this issue      
68,1.0,                       this is      a waste of money if you want to use a gaming headset  it doesn t support the audio on xbox one that is normally under setting after hitting the home button  in the xbox setting and the app that comes with the controller there is no way to turn on mic monitoring  i have to use my     xbox controller to use my headset then game with the razer  this is my first day owning it and regret buying it  take a look at the tournament razer that may be different  but this ultimate is            useless for any gamer using a headset  will update on how it actually controls update   few month or     controls nice sometimes the x button gets stuck but has come back after hitting it again only happen   times   and with the mic monitoring   if you have a headset with a battery and a mic monitoring volume button on the hetset itself it works  so that s what i do   this controller with a corded turtle beach head set that has a battery you change in the headset itself for more power than the controller can give to it      
69,2.0,                       the controller is a good   stars     buying it on amazon is a   bought this for my kid   he loved it   so it was all the more painful when it broke just a few months after purchase razer has a bit of a reputation for having some failures   particularly this controller   buttons fail  or they just start wigging out and randomly  pressing buttons    totally unusable   but they re backed by a good warranty    right wrong   if and only if you buy it directly from razer  or a hand full of their partners    not amazon buy it from razor and  you can rage spike it into your razer brand computer  and they ll replace both for a year   buy it from amazon and on day      you break it you buy it   bad workmanship    you buy it   zero support from razer   its not even fine print   its is explicitly stated in huge lettering in their warranty   i figured amazon s razer store would be razer related    of course it is  its amazon   why wouldn t it be   nope   just tried it    sorry you have to contact amazon  we don t cover that great controller though     when it was working   i think it might be nicer than the elite   my kid thinks so   i still like the elite  but its hard to judge on something like this   good vs what you re used to   its definitely not worse  and it s corded    so   thats a plus or a minus   its a plus in the bedroom or computer desk   minus in the living room      
70,5.0,                       what i needed was a controller that had extra programable buttons  between the elite  wolverine ultimate   and a scuff controller  the wolverine was the cheapest  the other two controllers were wireless  but since i primarily game at a desk with my console within a arm s reach  why pay for extra for it  the wolverine ultimate   like the others  has swappable thumb sticks and d pad  a mute button  chroma  on board volume control if you use the    mm jack  and a lower price tag  i highly recommend      
71,1.0,                       after about   months of occasional use the left stick began drifting to the right  i took it apart to find a small grey plastic piece that resets stick alignment had broken      
72,2.0,                       i use this controller mainly for call of duty  and as i am playing the l  will start stuttering and you will stop moving at the same time  it is very frustrating to deal with and makes the game unplayable  i tried remapping the l  button but there is only an option to remap the l button  not l  so there is no other way to replace the l  button  aside from that  it feels like a well put together controller but that one issue is just not bearable      
73,3.0,                       couldn t wait to get this controller when i read its positive reviews  when i finally got it i was let down because it did not come with the braided charger that was mentioned the description or on the box  guess i shouldn t ve bought it refurbished      
74,5.0,                       i really like this controller  as a left handed gamer  i m used to having to use third party controllers and mice to game   and since companies like scuf and razer have been making controllers with extra remappable buttons  i ve been using them  in the past  i ve used the razer sabertooth and wildcat for pc gaming  and though both were better than the stock xbox controller  neither was quite right for me the sabertooth and wildcat both had the same problem for me   the extra triggers on the bottom protruded too far and were placed awkwardly for my hands  and the hard plastic grips eventually caused hand fatigue   i m a professional tattooist who games a lot when not working  so hand strain and fatigue are a constant issue for me  basically  my hands never get a break  and after a week of work  holding a controller on my day off can be actively painful  so  this time out  they got everything right  the old removable triggers on the bottom of the controller have been replaced with textured buttons that rest exactly where my fingers lie  and the hand grips are rubberized  extremely comfortable  and feel slightly more ergonomic than before  the face buttons are a little tighter in the controller as well  and the slight rattling they used to produce on previous razer controllers is gone long story short  this thing is a joy to use  i can use all four under buttons without having to shift my hand awkwardly  a first for me on any controller  and i ve used most or all of the ones razer has made  the microsoft xbox elite  and a few scuf controllers   the sticks feel right  and the grips feel perfect  in fact  what prompted me to write this review is i ve been sitting on my day off gaming  which normally means i start with sore hands from the day before  and can play until they get too cramped and i have to stop  i started out that way today  and just realized my hands feel better late in the day than they did this morning  which tells me i m not straining them at all using this thing  that s never happened before also  the app you can download to pc is a nice touch  it s easy to use and lets you completely tweak the controller  down to the lighting and level of vibration you want  i m used to the  hold the map button  then hold the bonus key while pressing the button you want to change the buttons  thing that feels like you need   hands to do it  but having the ability to set the whole controller up while it sits on your lap is great i can t rate this thing highly enough  well done  guys  now make one like this i can use on my ps       
75,5.0,                       i love this controller its been working great  i never liked wired controllers cuz i always have a problem with them but this is great  it comes with   other attachments if you wanna change the buttons  it feels great      
76,5.0,                       this controller functioned exactly as it should    so easy to use  in my opinion after using   weeks i still give it   stars     
77,1.0,                       i ordered for my grandson  razer wolverine tournament edition    remappable multi function buttons   hair trigger mode   what i received was a cheap    transformer toy   i have been attempting to reach someone  with no luck   i received an email telling me that a refund will be processed  but no return label to return the item   please advise on the next steps to take   thank you      
78,2.0,                       after   months of use  the controller is starting to develop toggle walk  on the left thumb stick  to the right and intermittent movement forward  on the left thumb stick   this makes game play impossible at any level      
79,1.0,                       this is a phenomenal product and i have no complaints about it  this gets a one star because the service you recieve from razer for any issues is atrocious  i will never recommend anyone to buy a razer product strictly because of how they treat their customers      
80,5.0,                       this controller is extremely responsive  i love the clicky buttons and the aux input is simple and works perfectly with my razer black shark v  my only complaint is the cord being permanently attached  wish it was the braided removable usb c cord like the other wolverine and razer keyboards  still worth getting though     
81,3.0,                       i absolutley love this controller but after having it for about a month  the controller no longer lets me plug a headset into it without making a terrible flatlineing noise with every headset i have  now have to use a second controller to talk to my friends  but overall its great      
82,5.0,                         features are nice      
83,1.0,                       the two  remappable  buttons can be remapped but they will always only duplicate the action of another button   they are not able to take on extra functions to allow for more versatile pc gameplay      
84,5.0,                       the first one didn t work for some reason but the return and exchange was great  a new one was on its way before i even sent the broken one back  this was a gift for my son and he seems to like it  he has been using it for a few weeks now and no complaints      
85,5.0,                       responsive  durable  sleek design  improved game performance  wish there was a wireless option tho      
86,1.0,                       nice controller iff you use it for xbox onlysynapse is not supported for pc it will not register or sync for your keyboard mouse nomo pro or nair ultimatenot worth       with tax     
87,5.0,                       i m a guy who likes to enjoy gaming to relax  been using this for anthem and the division    i ve used just about every other controller out there  and this one takes the cake  the buttons are springy  the hand set up perfect and the controller has the perfect amount of heft  it s held up well  anyone who says it s been breaking probably suffersfrom gamer rage and needs to learn how to take care of things      
88,4.0,                       the controller overall is amazing in many ways  the trigger stops  the grip  the joy sticks  and the back buttons  but for me the axby buttons don t feel the same as it is for the other controllers because it s different and personally it s not for me considering it takes more pressure to push the button down but maybe you ll like it who knows all i know is that it s an amazing controller just not for me when it comes to the buttons     
89,5.0,                       i love this controller  everything feels right and the paddles on the back sit in just the perfect spot  it made playing fortnite so much easier and having the extra buttons to map just gives you a bunch of options to set up the controller just how you want it      
90,4.0,                       i have owned a elite and infinity   scuf   i bought this to play cod and have used it daily for a week  i would say for me this is best  the first reason is the button placement on the back  i did have to put a piece of masking tape for better grip on it   the scuf is too hard to press  although it does get looser  the elite i press by mistake to much  but has the fastest response next the bumpers on it respond noticeable faster  i don t notice any differ between all   controller on the triggers  i like the trigger stops built in something the elite doesn t have the main reason i bought this is my elite joysticks were wore out  i ve it about     years play with it almost daily  it is still a good choice other things to know  like all new controller they joysticks has to we broken in  i started on a    sensitive and am now back down to my normal   after a week  my aim seems better  but time will tell if you play with kontrol freeks the ps  xbox     work great      
91,3.0,                       i ve had this controller for about four months when i first got it i was super stoked about the quality it felt pretty good you had a good grip on it and you don t miss click back paddles like people say on the elite but unfortunately it s starting to feel it wear down my x   b buttons are not as clickey as they used to be and the back paddle that i sue a lot the paint is starting to rub off  i know that s just a cosmetic issue but to me it s kinda of a big deal because of my ocd i like to keep my things nice and tighty and take well care of them but when i noticed that it upset me    also every time you turn off your xbox you have to plug it out and in again or else it won t work like it won t respond idk if it s just mine or something but yea it s annoying here is a picture of the wear the paddle has     
92,5.0,                       i m a semi pro gamer and can vouch that this controller is better than the elite controller for a better price  the only downside is that you can t fit kontrolfreek stick extenders onto the joy sticks  buttons have a mechanical feel and the input lag is close to none  purchase this controller if you re debating between a few      
93,2.0,                       i am very upset with this item    the a button suddenly just stopped working every thing works except the a button   i can t even remap it because i have to access every menu with the a button   it may not even be  months old but i ve missed the return by policy and now it completely malfunctions   it was too much money for me not to be able to fix a problem caused internally not by me       
94,5.0,                       my husband loves his new controller  he especially loves the extra buttons on the back    great quality so far      
95,4.0,                       i love this controller  it works very well however its not as durable as i d like it to be  ive used it a few months and im starting to see signs of wear  its still very usable just sometimes needs some minor maintenance      
96,1.0,                    me mandaron un control y cables que no eran yo compre el wolverine ultimate edicion y me mandaron un control normal con un cable diferente todo fue diferente        
97,5.0,                    el d a de ayer lo recib   debo decir que desde la caja exterior como hasta el estuche interior tienen gran detalle  el mando como tal no es liviano  tiene buen agarre y lo mas importante funciona como debe ser en windows  nada que envidiarle a un mando de ps adaptado en la pc         
98,5.0,                       after having an amazing experience with the wolverine tournament  i got the ultimate  and it was by far the best controller i ever used  over a year later  the controller works perfectly  i ve used it so much that all of the letters have been rubbed off of the buttons  roomba comes rolling around when i m not looking and pulls the controller off the table  it s taken a few drops  but this was the big one  trigger broke  rip wolverine  i get an elite series   because it s wireless and use for   week  the sticks  triggers  and paddles are great  the buttons and dpad are just bad and it had connection issues and input lag even when plugged in  returned the elite series   and got another wolverine ultimate and i m glad i did     
99,5.0,                       great for the gamer in your life     
100,2.0,                       love the feel of the controller and i wanted this controller to work for me unfortunately after a month or so the right hair trigger became spongy and didn t work like it should i had it replaced and that process was smooth and great unfortunately it happened again with the replacement and actually affected the game play now i can t return the second one which is a bummer over all the feel is great but the air triggers breaking both times makes it a big issue     
101,1.0,                       about   month old and the jack does not work      
102,2.0,                       the buttons on this controller warn out wayyyy to fast  i purchased this controller on april  th and the blue x button followed a week after the green a button both were non functioning after continuing use  would not buy nor recommend buying this controller again and or to anyone  forget the flash of the product cause that s all your buying honestly  the extra buttons or  features  only become a nuisance from accidental pressing dearing game play  which becomes very very frustrating      
103,5.0,                       quoted my kid here  i don t use it   this controller far exceeds the capabilities of the wireless one preceding it and this controller also has additional capabilities and buttons  etc   even the buttons feel more  positive    my kid is thrilled with it   plus  we re cutting the flow of dead batteries to the trash pile   the team mates are thrilled also as this controller won t crap out at a critical moment in a mission      
104,1.0,                       long stories from the company about power flow and bla bla bla  if it only supports usb      just list it in the friggin specs      
105,5.0,                       it s a high quality product  seemingly very solidly built with a few nice features   you can exchange the toggle sticks and you can change the travel of the toggles   it also has a few extra feature buttons on it  such as for muting the speakers it s even colorful  has a constantly changing band of color around the upper part      
106,4.0,                       pros     this controller feels really great to play with   i honestly really love it   way better than a standard     xbox controller   i love the additional remappable   buttons    on back  and   on top    the   on top are unique to this controller and placed in a great spot   the   on the back take a little bit to get used to  but don t get actually pressed like the xbox elite controller  which i also like  by the way    i love the  focus  option  which basically works as a temporary dpi adjustment that you can assign to any of the buttons   this allows you to slow the movement down of one or both analog sticks adjusted to whatever speed feels great for you   i assigned it to a rear button to slow down the right stick so i can be more precise with sniping  mostly pubg for me  but works with any shooting game    another unique and great feature to this controller   the led lighting  although not at all necessary  is another cool unique feature   you can assign the led options  colors and other options  to each saved controller configuration so you know which configuration you are currently using on the controller   controller feels slightly more ergonomic to me than the elite  but i m sure this depends on your hands and how you hold the controller   i m      tall with large hands   the wolverine ultimate is also way lighter than the elite  which makes it easy and comfortable to use for long periods of time   right left quick fire trigger settings feel great  requires slightly less pressure pull than the elite cons     it s not wireless  as you probably already know   but the cable is premium quality  has a great solid connection to the controller that keeps it from being easily broken  unlike the xbox controllers  including the elite    this is the biggest issue most people have with this controller  but it s not a problem at all for me   plus  playing with a cable offers the quickest reaction time   it s probably barely noticeable to most of us  but it may keep you alive on a few rare occasions   yeah the built in headset options are attached to the controller  unlike any of the microsoft controllers   but this controller doesn t have a mic monitoring option   this is the biggest con for me personally   i m used to being able to hear myself when i talk in chat which keeps me from feeling like i have to yell over people to be heard  and also i ll notice if i m breathing into the mic or something rather than another person in the chat having to tell me to move my mic because they don t want to hear it   why oh why didn t you include this option razer   many gamers complain about this issue online   if you don t care about mic monitoring  you probably haven t had it before   then this may not be an issue for you   the     extra for this controller over the elite  currently      for razer wolverine ultimate and      for elite  is still cheaper if you need to purchase a separate headset adaptor for            by the way  go with turtle beach if you do   i have   of them and the  superhuman hearing  option is amazing for hearing and locating enemy players near you    unfortunately since the headset controls are built in to the design of this controller  i can t use my tb headset adaptor with it   lastly  but won t usually be an issue  i had an issue with my    mm headset adaptor on my controller upon opening new for christmas   the controller would shut off when i plugged in my headset  which worked totally fine with all of my other controllers    i discovered that the extension cable i was using wasn t compatible with this controller  even though it worked totally fine with every other controller i did own  including the elite   so it you need to add an extension cable to to reach further than the cable that already comes with this controller  approx   ft   i m not sure if it ll work summary  i really do like this controller  a lot   i just wish it had a voice monitoring option  but other than that  it s amazing and feels great    hope this helps my fellow gamers  or parents of  out there looking for a premium xbox controller           
107,4.0,                       review note i got almost a year worth of play from each ultimate and tournament purchases  i m disappointed that i am forced to replace my controller yearly especially now that they can cost over       this is very bothersome as i use to game even more often and rarely had any controller break  this seemed to change starting with xbox one and ps   all my xbox     ps    older sega microsoft nintendo consoles have working controllers i m giving the elite   a chance after giving razor ultimate   tournament   ms elite original their dire chances   year update i bought the tournament after the ultimate crumbled after a year  i thought i would be able to save money by getting the tournament as i didn t think i used the ultimate features  however  i was so wrong  the ultimate also has super upgraded face buttons that instantly react to light touches  the tournament has a hard mash face button system  you have to press with more intent and the lag to do so will affect your twitch performance  for that alone  you need to skip the tournament and get ultimate  the tournament crumbled on me after it s year  instead of the left analog becoming loose  the stick itself split       of the pad on the left side of the left analog cracked off  sometimes my thumb falls off or i at least lose control  i ve been suffering while i have been waiting for the elite   to be released  they claim to have addressed durability issues   year update all but the left stick of this controller held up  the left stick has a large dead zone now so precise control is gone  i think it started to loosen months ago but has now hit the point where i have to replace  still better than the elite  but either way i think these things should last more than a year for a casual gamer  less than     hours original my xbox elite controller broke in   ways and going back to a standard controller was not fun  finally came across this after searching  it was promising and it holds up to the hype the buttons are more responsive than anything else i ve ever known  the deadzone works as expected  i changed the led to the immersion mode  the default is silly  but that s why they let you customize  my hands get less fatigue than they did with the elite my precision in gameplay is extremely better now  i play a lot of rocket league and noticeably winning a lot more  i make more of the hits i meant for while making less mistakes overall  i wish i had this controller when i played sizz and moses  they crushed me more than anyone has and i would have liked to have had a chance  overall  my brain to game move translation has never been better they only give you one long stick to swap out with  i wish you got two like you do with the elite  but honestly since rocket league only needs one precise stick  i m doing fine  this is my only complaint  and no one is selling them separately the xbox app is easy to use  but i did not see a controller firmware update or check option  i guess that is only possible on pc the focus and agile modes seem amazing for first person shooters  this will give a real edge to those who use it  this also helps with missing a second long stick disclaimer  i ve only had this for    days now  so i cannot comment on long term durability yet  even if it does break down  i ll probably buy another one of these and not switching back to elite      
108,4.0,                       definitely a nice controller because i purchased a re newed version the light does not stay turned off you have to go into the app everytime you turn console on to turn it off for the onetime use gets annoying but other than that its a solid controller and anything made by razer has lasted me    years same hope for the wolverine      
109,4.0,                       does what it should do      
110,3.0,                       we loved this controller until my son lost one of the thumbsticks  now i m finding out that they are not available for purchase  the only replacement part you can buy is the d pad  so  buyer beware  if you have kids that tend to lose things  don t buy this controller live chat with razer was not helpful at all      
111,5.0,                       m m style buttons  and just like the candy coated chocolate  they will stick after a month of heavy use  i can already see myself buying a different controller risky purchase      
112,2.0,                       using it was nice  the bumpers were nice but kinda annoying to click and the same goes with the ones next to the lb rb bumpers  but after barely a year the controller was bought in early october of       its not september       it started malfunctioning and now won t even turn on despite having no damage done to the cord of the controller      
113,1.0,                       my son loved this controller and then it broke out of the blue   nothing happened to it  was not dropped  etc  and we contacted razer  followed their advice to try to fix it and nothing worked   if anyone has suggestion or the company sees this  please contact me      
114,5.0,                       great controller  feels great  the response is amazing  i did have one before that lasted me a year  i would recommend this controller to my friends     
115,5.0,                       i using the controller with windows    pc   integration was a snap  just plug it in and it works   you need to download the razer controller tool kit from microsoft to set up custom keys and use the chroma   it would have been nice if it was recognized by razer synapse and didn t need the extra software but it is what it is   the controller itself is accurate and feel great in the hand   a lot of comments about the ayxb keys being clicky   its very subtle  to the point i thought at first i may have gotten a knock off because mine didn t seem to have the click but after a bit of use i could feel it   if you press sown very gently the click is at the bottom of the buttons travel just before it bottoms out   i like it and it adds to the feel of quality      
116,5.0,                       this is one of the best wired controllers that i ve used in recent memory  it is expensive but it appears to be very durable      
117,2.0,                       the controller when in working order is amazing  however there are damaging issues  the back grips started to peel off like the tape had become loose  the  b  button at one point became nonfunctional  i attempted to open it and just clean it however this would be a fruitless since they made it almost impossible to open the controller  the sticks are so easy to screw up for it to actually work like it should i had to super glue the sticks down otherwise whenever you do quick strikes to it  it would just fall off  my       regular xbox one controller has lasted me since i got my xbox in      with none of these issues  so when paying        for a controller i expect it to last more then   months  im considering taking business elsewhere since i want a fancy controller  but one that wont cause me heart breaking problems  i love this controller when its fresh and new its literally the best controller ever but after awhile it shows how cheaply its actually made      
118,5.0,                       i never thought there would ever be a controller that was more comfortable than the xbox one controller  well in my opinion the v  is thee most comfortable controller ever made  i love the  clicky  buttons and the texture  greatest wired controller ever        highly recommended      
119,5.0,                       normally i don t write reviews but for this i feel like it s a must  as a hardcore fighting game fanatic response times are everything  out of the     wire controllers i ve had this one takes the cake by a long shot  buttons are incredible  feels like a mechanical keyboard  amazing grip and shape  honestly feels like inputs are immediately read  overall it s perfect      
120,3.0,                       as far as  pro  controllers go  i have used an xbox elite controller  razer wildcat  and now this razer wolverine  i bought the wildcat when the right stick on my elite started to have the dreaded floating issue i m gonna be comparing this to the wildcat since they have a lot of the same features and the wolverine seems to be the next evolution upgrades  dpad is waaaaay better  interchangeable thumbsticks and dpad are nice    extra triggers are nice  though i m not sure how necessary they are since they can only replicate other buttons on the controller  chroma if you like lights  textured grip is applied at factory rather than at home with disassemblydowngrades  extra triggers on bottom are not mechanical anymore and are harder to press  extra triggers changed position slightly and are less comfortable to use  if you prefer two short thumbsticks  they will have different tops because only one stick of each top type is provided in packagethe wolverine certainly tried to win me over  but the change away from mechanical triggers on the bottom really killed it for me  i prefer the wildcat      
121,5.0,                       button responsiveness is amazing  the adjustments you can make to the controller are amazing  i love the cord  no batteries  faster response  and the headset sounds clear  best controller you can buy  i ll be sure to update this in a few months to talk about how well it s holding up      
122,5.0,                       would recommend anyone using a standard controller to make the upgrade  really has enhanced my gaming      
123,5.0,                       this controller is amazing  i hope i never have to buy another one  great hand feel  solid to the grasp unlike others that feel like they ll break if i hold them tightly      
124,4.0,                       everything about it is good except the mushy buttons   they don t click like a regular xbox or playstation controller for that matter   the buttons make the controller feel cheap but it is pretty well built   we ll have to see how long it lasts   been a few weeks without issues     
125,3.0,                       this is a nice controller if it were about        cheaper   the plastic is creaky around the right trigger area and the thumb sticks feel a little wobbly  particularly the left one  also the trigger button plastic feels really cheap   definitely not worth the asking price   wish i had purchased the xbox elite       
126,4.0,                          the analog sticks are shorter wider than the standard xbox controller  why it matters  shorter analog sticks mean less control  and wider  the top  analogs means you cannot use kontrol freeks with the controller    the back paddles are in a terrible position  like truly awful  the feel material quality of the controller is great  it would definitely be worth the cost   except the paddle location is plain bad  yes  that is a matter of preference  but the paddles are just too low to ignore the drawbacks if you like the paddle placement and don t use kontrol freeks  i would still suggest this controller though  hopefully any newer models razer makes reworks the back paddles  because the front paddles  bumpers  are great  i loved the front paddles during the   days before i decided to return it      
127,5.0,                       this is actually my second one after someone broke into my apartment and stole it  i love the feel and the customization of it way better then the xbox elite controller and actually better build as well  the lights at a added bonus and makes it look cool lol      
128,2.0,                       was great at first but right trigger broke and i ve only had it for a month      
129,5.0,                       awesome controller  not wireless though        
130,2.0,                       i ve gone through both elite controllers  and i bought this one hoping that it wouldn t have similar fundamental  build quality related issues  unfortunately  this was not the case  both of my bumpers are defective and often register single presses as double or triple clicks  for the games that i play  rb and lb are crucial and makes this controller unusable  both this  the elite v   and the v  are unusable so no use for comparing their features because none of them can do the bare essential functions that a controller should do after just a month or two of use  i m disappointed in this controller  and the entire market for  elite  or  pro  controllers because they charge  x the price of a regular controller when its build quality is even worse than the     ones   pro  keyboards and mice are normally rock solid for a year plus  but controllers are so far behind  if anyone has any good options for   paddle controllers that do not break lmk bcz it appears that this controller is just like the rest in the build quality respect      
131,1.0,                       bought it and it broke about a month in   after a painful     hours on the phone showing video proof they finally sent me a new one  over a week later    i ve had the new one for about   months and the x button just stopped working   will never buy another razer product between the service and poor product      
132,5.0,                       i have an elite controller  but when i saw the razer  i had to try it  i use razer products on my pc and i ve always loved them  and it looked like this one might solve my problem with the elite s paddles  apparently i can t quit triggering them accidentally  i ended up taking them all off and just adding one when i really needed it  but that felt like a waste the razer works well  the action feels a little bit better than the elite to me  and the paddle design solved my problem  i never hit them by accident and get quite a bit of use out of them now  the software recognized the controller with no problem  and i have customized settings for nearly every game  the cord isn t super long  but it s more than long enough for my purposes since my setup is in a relatively small space  on the one hand  corded controllers are a bit of a bummer  on the other hand  i never have to replace or charge batteries i purchased it eight months ago  and it still works perfectly after near daily use  and a ton of weekend marathons   my only issue is that when i switch from the tv speakers to a headset  i have to shut off the controller and let it come back on before it will start routing the sound through the headphones  it s a tiny quibble and only takes maybe    seconds to reboot  but it is a bit annoying      
133,5.0,                       i bought this controller for use with my pc after having bought two xbox elite controllers that stopped working after mere hours of use and a battle beaver that was not working on arrival  i got both the ultimate and tournament versions because i had originally wanted to use the tournament  but i had heard from one or two reviews people that the buttons are different so i wanted to see for myself  i should mention  the first ultimate edition controller i received was broken on arrival  the shoulder buttons would basically not register at all when i held down the trigger on their respective sides  i have no idea what was causing it  i was able to get a replacement through the amazon returns and they allowed it to cross ship while i returned the defective controller at no cost to me  i would remove a star for this  but this controller is just so much better and cheaper than the rest of the competition at the moment that it doesn t even matter presumably a lot of reviewers have not tried both controllers so i am here to tell you definitively that there is a huge difference in the face buttons  they are both nice and clicky tactile buttons  but the te s buttons have a much much longer travel time  the travel is practically the same as a normal xbox controller  just with a nice tactile feel on actuation  it s not bad by any means  but compared to the buttons on the ultimate it s a night and day  the ultimate s buttons are lightning quick to actuate  you hardly even have to press them button down  they are absolutely amazing for competitive games  razer really doesn t seem to give any information about this besides calling the te s buttons  tactile  while the ultimate s are called  mecha tactile  also  the back buttons are really nice  i don t really have a use for a lot of them but i do really like being able to bind one of two things to back buttons which lets me avoid using a claw grip or awkwardly shifting my hands  it s never worth sacraficing your hands to game  invest in your health  compared to the xbox elite controller s paddles which make the controller quite awkward to grip and are prone to accidental inputs  both wolverine controllers are much better  but as i said i highly recommend the ultimate verision  the ultimate s back buttons are actually perfect  i can grip the controller exactly how i would a normal xbox controller and then the buttons are right next to your fingers when you need them  i usuaully shift a finger onto the paddles for easier use too  trying to place your fingers on all   buttons feels pretty awkward  but you might be able to get used to it      
134,5.0,                       the cost is a bit much  but i have to say it seems to be a good controller  it feels good in the hands and looks good to the eye  i had no issues at all connecting to my pc  i ve read reviews that did  but those appear to be dated a few years ago  perhaps the problem was resolved   if it stands the test of time  i will have no regrets      
135,3.0,                       good weight  rear paddles are a pita to reach compared to my elite series    but all the buttons work  which my elite   doesn t  only other bad side is it is wired     
136,5.0,                       this is such a good controller  went through so many elites that kept breaking and i ve had this for a year and it s still perfect      
137,5.0,                       awesome controller   way better made and responsive than so called pro controllers   if you can get past it being a corded controller  you will love it   it has a very long cord and ends constantly changing batteries      
138,2.0,                       absolutely loved this controller in my hands  the tactile feel of the button presses and everything before launching a game  apex legends  in which i use advanced look controls  i turn off the dead zones so that i can be more accurate while having maximum sensitivity  mimicking that of a mouse and keyboard player  i went to the firing range to practice my aim with the new controller   the aim stick drifted left considerably  enough to be noticeably unleveled with how fast i turn left versus right  i returned it and received a new one  thinking it was a flaw with that one product  same thing on the second controller they sent me  i can t be competitive with this controller  as i aim left far faster than when aiming right while using micro movements   poor design for the aiming stick in my opinion  if you use dead zones and have to push the stick halfway to maximum in order to move your reticle  this might be perfect for you  incredible feeling while using this controller  but the one thing i needed most  consistent and accurate aim  was nonexistent      
139,4.0,                       i decided to but a high end controller   i first bought the microsoft elite   but after   hours of trying to get it to sync to blue tooth  i returned to walmart   i would have kept it but microsoft dropped the ball on how the usb connects to the control   razer hit it out of the park with this controller   it is a wired controller but the cable can be removed   but the way that the cable connects is where microsoft failed   the cable plug in is recessed into the controller adding stain relief the connector   this way the connector is not feeling the strain of the cable   awesome i am still getting to know the controller so i plan on updating my review later important   for the wolverine series controllers the user manual is wrong when they tell you to download the  razer synapse for xbox   you must download the  razer wolverine for xbox   the  razer synapse for xbox  will not work with the wolverine      
140,4.0,                       hope you have then buttons fully memorized  x  a  b are gone  only can see y  other then that it s a great controller  trying to trace down a solution to this now   very annoying for a controller so expensive      
141,2.0,                       i have had horrible luck finding controllers that function properly  i started with a      scuf hybrid  best durability so far  but had connection issues  switched to elite series    after  st month it had horrible stick drift and even had dead points in the analog  upgraded to elite series    developed exact same stick drift issues and would never be resolved for longer than a month clearly frustrated with microsoft at this point  i decided to jump into another realm of controllers  this time from razer  i ve used alot of their products in the past and always thought it was decent quality but always loved how clean the rgb is  i picked up this wolverine ultimate  felt great straight out of the box  tight responsive etc  then i tried using a quick chat on the d pad and it selected an option in the exact opposite direction than i pressed  it s been about   months of owning it  i ve dealt with the d pad issue the entire time still trying to find my warranty  the  clickiness  of the buttons is like a mouse  which is interesting at first but definitely wears fast    months and you can barely hear or feel the a button click i don t know if it s just horrible luck  bad programming  lazy manufacturing or whatever  i m just sick of spending       on products that don t even last a quarter of the life span of the xbox    s lolit s also very weird transitioning from elite to this  it takes a few days  try it out  if it works for you it s a solid controller  just wish it would perform  i m definitely not confident in its durability      
142,1.0,                       brand new controller out of the box  you would think it would have zero problems right  unfortunately this must ve been a factory defect  as one of the controller analog sticks drifts without touching it  to say the least not happy at all      
143,3.0,                       this is a controller you d typically use for an fps game  however  the short  thick thumbsticks design make accuracy not that great and makes your hands fatigue faster  also i ve had the controller for about   months and the left joystick is having issues      
144,3.0,                       was really excited to try this controller out   i have many other razer products and feel like they make good stuff   i was sadly disappointed in the overall feel of this controller   the abxy buttons don t have a satisfying  responsive feel when pressed and the dpad was   loose feeling   dpad did not seem to respond correctly either  will be returning and sticking with microsoft for controller   rare miss razer      
145,1.0,                       this controller only works on pc if you re on windows     it s completely useless otherwise   i feel very mislead by the product description  while i m here i might add that the physical quality of the controller isn t necessarily impressive for the asking price        
146,5.0,                       wow   my first razor product and i was not let down  i    the new bumpers   i use l  for jumping and r  for beat downs and it multiples my k d by        get it now now     
147,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have owned   generation one elite controllers made by microsoft  i was not satisfied with the amount of money i was paying for them  i paid       for each about a years length away from each other  both having the same recurring issue the bumpers  the wear and tear i had with them was a joke  i could go into detail about them but that s that  razer got me into the game and i was a little hesitant to buy this  but i took a gamble  it was fantastic in everything all around the board this is better than the elites i ve owned for nearly everything  the one big part for me was the adapter that comes with this is permanently on the controller and it didn t go bad but very once in a while my voice would cut out  not an issue if you have no one to talk to or don t play regularly with people  although for someone who is paying       for a controller i m a bit of a serious  gamer  per say  this appeared to be an issue within the first   months of owning it  the wear and tear i put controllers though is bad but this one was fantastic till this happened  this is an amazing product it really is and it probably  won t happen to anyone else and if it does then i hope razer sees this and fixes it  i gave this a   star to hopefully get some attention to the people who criticize products and want a deep dive into a product  but also a customers opinion on how to improve  razer did good on this controller they really  i ve now went back to using my elite controller for now but it feels obsolete compared to the razer if i m being honest  if you found this useful please do whatever you can so people can see this and understand the product  thank you this is coming from someone who during the covid    stuff played video games    hours a day for around   months so keep in mind i am a gamer      
148,4.0,                       so far the best controller i have ever had  i have only had it a month so as long as it holds up i ll never have to look for any other controllerupdate  was a great controller but after     months i was getting drift and a couple of buttons were failing  since i am easy on my controllers and don t play everyday i feel for the money this should last a lot longer then it did  if they drop the price to sub    bucks i ll consider buying again but until then a bit of a ripoff     
149,4.0,                       i normally only stick to console manufacturer made controllers  but decided to try this one   the over all build quality and feel of this controller is definitely better than what im used to   it quickly became my favorite controller   i do however have a few issues with it    the bumpers on the top i kinda feel are a bit long and a little to easy to hit accidentally  it can really mess up your gameplay if you have an important button assigned to it   something i just had to learn to get used to  so not a big deal     after a few months  it has a slight pull to the right on the left analog  contacting razer was easy and quick  had to do a few tedious things for the rma process  but the shipping and speed of everything was very quick   i m gonna assume i just got a lemon  and will test out the new one to see though even with the rma process i feel like it s one if the best controllers i have bought in a long long time   would recommend it as of now  depending on if i have to rma again      
150,5.0,                       i got this for my little brother for his birthday and he loves it  he had an elite   controller but the left stick started to drift on its own  so i got him this on an he said he ain t never going back      
151,3.0,                       only have had this control for couple days less than a month  the right analog stick is already leaning off center and drifts the cursor  i do like the feel weight of the control but not even    days and the stick is drifting   wouldnt mind so much if it was the left stick as thats the one for forward movement    but     bucks for this to happen is stupid     
152,5.0,                       i am glad i wasted my money on this  the controllers alone is extremely responsive  what i mean by that is there is no delay when pushing either thumb stick  playing cod with this controller will make you feel like a god  especially when you tune your focus and agile buttons  this controller makes playing nba  k actually enjoyable because by default it feels like  k is supposed to have a massive amount of input lag  overall i am impressed it s worth the money  but it is not wireless in case you wondering      
153,5.0,                       i ve had   elite controllers that both developed stick drift just a few months after purchase  and the positioning of the paddles just didn t work for me   i never could adjust to the play using the paddles the razer wolverine is amazing in comparison   it feels like a quality remote  and i got the hang of the paddle use in less than a week   the premapped buttons were perfect for the games i play   i also like the wired vs  a wireless remote now   no more charging or running out of batteries    no more running around the house digging in tv remotes loli could never go back as my movement and gameplay is way better now i might even order another as a backup      
154,1.0,                       opened the box  downloaded all necessary software  plugged in brand new razer controller annnnd     nothing  no new device detected on pc  restarted  tried again to get the same results  actually just received a      piece of plastic in the mail  fantastic      
155,5.0,                       bought for son and he loves it      
156,1.0,                       i returned this after first hour of use  the controller looks feels and functions great    until you realize that you can not hit multiple buttons at the same time otherwise the driver locks up and continues pressing buttons without your intended input you can not change the buttons to be macros only other buttons that already exists on the controller  for example  i cant make a back paddle be an  e  key press  only a b x y    etc      
157,5.0,                       probably the most natural paddels there are   week into the controller and love it  i ll also say i had the xbox elite controller and it is built terrible bumpers consistantly break and paddles can easily be pressed by accident  i will update this review in a month      
158,1.0,                       my journey with this controller started a few days ago when it first arrived  everything seemed perfectly fine up until the left trigger just decided it should not work  so i ordered a replacement and now that i actually got to test it with  everything  working properly i can tell you without a doubt the old wolverine is heaps better  i still have my old one and its much much better  my main dislike for this controller is where they put those lines that separate the textured bit of the controller and the normal bit  the normal xbox controller does this right where your hand will never rest so you don t feel that annoying line but this controller put that line separation right where my hand rests so its very uncomfortable to hold  and not to mention theres no back paddles and the cable is not detachable  really a massive let down razer     
159,5.0,                       works great haven t had any issues and have been using it daily for hours      
160,1.0,                       beautiful product  but it did not come with the usb cord   cannot even connect to the computer  i ve tried to connect with other usb cords but none of them works because the tip of the usb male part needs to be certain shape to fit into the female opening of the controller  very disappointing      
161,1.0,                       just   days after return window closed  left button stopped working  wont buy again      
162,2.0,                       this controller is the best gaming controller on the market  quick reactions  fast buttons  grippy  and has lights  except the problem is i love it so much and now two buttons on the controller are not working  i m past my return date and past customer service date and i m worried i won t be refunded or given replacement controller      
163,2.0,                       everything works just fine other than the    mm jack for the mic  i tried plugging my mic in when i first received this controller and it get making loud beeping sounds and there was heavy static  it didn t pick up my voice at all either  gonna return and try to get a new one  kinda upset about this one     
164,5.0,                       this thing is beyond sweet  i m so glad that i bought it over the elite controller  the mechanical buttons alone have made it worth the cost  i play minecraft on pc as well as a ton of other games and they all see the controller auto magically with no issues  i always play wired because i think it s a better experience so i don t mind that the controller is wired but some people don t like that  i prefer it actually and i won t even touch a wireless controller so this option was ideal for me in many ways  i ve owned the controller for months now and it has improved the quality of all my gaming so much and i m very happy  the way that the buttons click down and then click themselves back up is very awesome and it makes me able to do a lot of complex controller movements really quickly      
165,2.0,                       there are few controllers that have been able to withstand the demand of rocket league  i had   different controllers fail in the same way within a span of   months  the a buttons were all jammed because of broken springs  i have used the wolverine for   months now and the buttons are still springy and clicky  unfortunately  the left stick has begun drifting which makes any game unplayable  this controller is fancy and flashy and has lots of buttons but it doesn t have a working joystick      
166,5.0,                       great gamer console      
167,2.0,                       while the controller looks and feels high quality  with all the extra buttons having a nice click to them  though i wasn t a fan of the face buttons  a  b  x  y  and thought they were too     squishy  for my liking however as soon as i plugged it in and booted a game  i noticed the left thumbstick had a very noticeable downward drift  i even took the stick off and just used the  nub  and it still drifted i had hoped this would replace my elite controller as that had started drifting after about   months  but this one seems even worse in that regard instant return      
168,5.0,                       this is by far the best razer controller in terms of design  very fast response rate and buttons triggers are great quality  the only issue is that i ordered one and it had left analog drift  if you are a competitive player this is a common issue that comes with the territory of using a controller  a quick return then trying again was worth it for me as now i have a perfect one  i ve gone through two scuffs  and two razer raijus and neither of them are built as well as the wolverine ultimate  i d like to see razer continue to focus on their controllers and become the staple in competitive gaming  no other controller has   remappable buttons and offers sensitivity increase and decrease buttons  i use mine on pc but it can also be used on xbox exclusively   if you play fortnite you will absolutely dominate lobbies without question      
169,5.0,                       if i could  i would rate this controller          having owned an elite and scuf fully custom controller  i decided to give this a go tl dr   if you re on the fence about dropping some money  do it   i don t think you ll regret it build        it feels a little heavy and grips are just  grippy  enough size        it is slightly smaller and my hands feel too close to each other buttons        the abxy buttons feel amazing and very little throw   feels very much like a mouse click   triggers feel great and the trigger pull adjustment is perfect   much better than the allen wrench style of the scuf   d pad is a little wobbly and slightly unresponsive   the backside buttons will take some getting used to as they are stacked on top of each other and there is a learning curve to them joysticks          buttery smooth travel and magnetic switch out with concave con curve and different height sticks      
170,5.0,                       best controller i have had  i like it better than the elite      
171,4.0,                       the first one out of the amazon wearhouse arrived in record time  but    it rumbled more on the left then the right  the mechanical buttons where a bit hard to push  and the power cable had to really be shoved in the controller for it to work and was hard to remove  it felt like a refurbished controller  the second was perfect and works great  make sure you test it  send it back if there is an issue      
172,2.0,                       this is my second one  the first one lasted about a year  this one lasted about   months      
173,5.0,                       son been using it for over a year now  no issues of it getting wore out like other controllers he has had  very happy with it      
174,3.0,                       for reference  i bought the thing to play with my laptop  as far as the controller goes i have zero complaints  the trigger stops do what they re supposed to  making the left and right triggers feel snappy and giving me more immediate feedback when playing destiny or other fps  there s a bunch of additional buttons on it i probably won t use too much but having the option is nice  to set the buttons and lights for pc users requires the use of the  razer wolverine for xbox  app you can get for free on the ms store and which works well enough on pc my gripe is the cord  the thing can t be used wireless  which is fine  direct input is usually better anyway  but if you re playing on a laptop the cord is   ridiculously   long  there s like     feet of this thing just dangling off the side of my laptop  so if you re playing on your xbox and want a nice lengthy cable  this is fine  and it s pretty finicky to boot  within   weeks of purchase i got the dreaded usb error that says  failed to retrieve device descriptor  or some such   i know this is related to the cord because no matter what controller i plug it into  more on this in a sec  it simply won t identify properly  amazon sells replacement cables  not made by razor  that are a bit shorter for about     and change plus tax  if you re playing on a laptop this additional cable is a must buy another weird quirk about the controller is that  while it s cord can plug into any micro usb device  such as a ps  controller  not every micro usb cable can be used for the wolverine itself  the way the port on the controller is recessed and grooved means only certain cords can be used on it unless you want to risk damaging your controller port to make it play nicely with other standard fare cables      
175,1.0,                       had to replace controller twice  first one didn t power up  second had a stuck lb button after   months  outside of amazon return policy  hopefully razer can help  i do own the tournament edition and wildcat with no problems so far  would be great product if it worked as should      
176,5.0,                       i bought this controller to play final fantasy xiv  and so far it works really well  i had it for almost three months  no damages were noticed yet  other than that  this is a good controller to play on pc      
177,4.0,                       i m a casual gamer that wanted to be able to keep up with friends that like playing warzone  the extra buttons took a bit to get used to and for the most part i only use   of the extra buttons  three of the back buttons and one of the top buttons  the buttons and thumb sticks all feel great and i especially like the way they made the d pad buttons  the button on the back that reduces sensitivity is a godsend for me when i m trying to be precise like when sniping at range  the trigger locks are also nice although honestly i engaged them and never changed it back and probably never will  the chat buttons and headset port are really nice and make it quick and easy to adjust in game volume or chat volume  occasionally i get a weird crackling from my headset when it s plugged in which seems to originate from the controller  but usually disconnecting the controller and plugging it back in fixes it the reasons i don t give this   stars is that first the buttons on the back of the controller aren t the most accessible  i ve got pretty big hands and the buttons are in the middle of the back of the controller which isn t as comfortable as say an xbox elite controller where the arms are situated under the grips  the second issue is that i have to set a higher deadband on the thumb stick to keep it from drifting than i have to on my basic xbox controller  this hasn t been an issue that i ve really noticed other than having to change the setting  but it surprises me that the cheaper controller has a tighter tolerance  the sounds crackling issue that i noted above is a pretty minor inconvenience and has never lasted through a reset  lastly it s not a wireless controller which again is a small gripe  but given the proximity in cost  unless it s on sale  to an elite controller makes it a tough sell if you don t sit close to where your console or pc is located overall i m really happy with my purchase and since i got it on sale it was a much better value than the retail price      
178,5.0,                       the buttons are super tactile and the extra buttons are in nice spots that you don t accidentally hit them but they are still in easy reach      
179,1.0,                       let me start by saying i loved this controller until it broke and their customer service has been bad thus far   the fact that it plugs in is a huge plus   not having to worry about changing out rechargable batteries is a huge plus   the lights on it are cool and the chat pad at the bottom is awesome   this controller crapped out on me after   months though   the right and left bumpers no longer work   let me explain sometimes when i press them it recognizes one click sometimes it will not recognize at all and sometimes it will recognize   or   clicks   this makes a game like fortnite unbearable when you are in battle and you think you are swtiching to your shotgun but it registers   clicks and switches you to bandaids instead   i called customer support   the guy was nice but had no clue what he was doing   he was looking for drivers then wanted me to download the razer app  which is only usefull for setting custom mappings and changing the light schemes  he asked if i bought the controller from amazer sold by amazon  hoping that would be his way of weaseling out of helping me  i told him it was   he opened a ticket and emailed me a form to fill out along with attachment my invoice for the purchase  i did and   days later i have heard nothing   i will adjust my review if they remedy it   having a    day warranty on a      controller which went bad in   months is not good   i would stay clear of this controller      
180,3.0,                       gamin  great paddle placement and awesome focus mode slows joystick and another mode speeds it up  perfect for sniping  but feels cheep and my joystick messed up the first week i had it  just lifted to where it could spin still use it here and there good controller but maybe a lil over priced     
181,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          had the controller for barely two months and it just randomly stopped working  the computer registers that its plugged in  i ve also tried other ports   but the light no longer comes on and the power doesn t either  everything on my computer is up to date  it was fine a few days ago and now refuses to work  i have not dropped my controller or done anything to damage it and no one else in the house even goes near my pc  rebooting doesn t fix it either so  i m left with a controller that doesn t function and no way to get my money back  outside of the return period   i expected higher quality  seeing that its a razer controller  but i guess i was wrong      
182,1.0,                       not so good for gamers  we purchased this for our son fo his birthday so it sat for over a month  when he got open and use it  literally   weeks after  the joystick jammed  we even took it to gamestop for hopes of saving an expensive controller  but the only option seemed unrealistic for our son  deadline to exchange had passed pretty disappointed in this product and would not recommend it      
183,5.0,                       superb controller  the face buttons use mouse switches and the additional control over the trigger buttons is a plus  i ve yet to delve into the software that allows for different sensitivity modes overall  a step up from a typical xbox controller if you re willing to pay for it      
184,3.0,                       this controller has a lot of nifty features   however it wasn t made by microsoft and doesn t have microsoft s quality craftsmanship   when you pull the triggers you still hear the springs contracting and expanding   i expected more from a controller with a top of the line price      
185,1.0,                       it worked great on the first day i used it  but on the second day  it stopped working  it will not even power on anymore just garbage  what a waste of money       dollars  on a controller that only lasted me a day were is the quality assurance in razer  last razer product i ever buy      
186,1.0,                       this controller cannot be remapped on pc  it may be ok for first person shooters  but this you it is a huge handicap for fighting games and platformers  because the extra buttons get in the way      
187,2.0,                       controller is great  step up from the last model  only issue is my first one came with a right stick drift  returning it and will get another for sure update  second controller came in with the same exactly right stick drift up and to the left  will send this one back for sure      
188,1.0,                       their synapse software does not work on win    unless you use a compatible razer keyboard and mouse  this is stated nowhere and i only found out after being on with support for    mins  a miserable and unacceptable requirement  do not buy if you are using only with win         
189,4.0,                       pros  blades are out of the way but are still accessable  durable construction even with repeated drops  parts are easy to change cons  the controller is heavy     
190,1.0,                       save your money what good is all these fancy switches levers and buttons good for if the damn thing stopped turning on i do not want a refund or a replacement  i want you to go out of business and starve to death i just bought two wired controllers for     each  i am sure that after a month they will turn on      
191,4.0,                       pros   responsive tactile buttons  button mapping software   solid rubber grips and thumb sticks that  feels great cons   bigger then the xbox one s controller      times bigger easily   bottom buttons are mounted way too high i ve owned a power controller a controller a pdp controller and an elite controller this one has buttons mounted  higher then all three and cant be customized   last thing i noticed is that while the face buttons are clicky and tactile they are rather hard to press  this is for good for fighters but harder to deal with on fps games  though to be fair they do add two remap able buttons near the triggers that you can swap for any face button all in all its a good buy if you want elite controller features for half the price and enjoy large controllers  if you want something similar to the xbox one s controller in size id say save up and buy the controller        
192,1.0,                       i used this controller for only a couple days and a button already completely stopped working  it s cheap  overpriced garbage      
193,5.0,                       excellent controller without having any problems  i own also elite   no problem at all in both controller  the elite   like you own luxury car and wolverine ultimate it s like sport car full optional      
194,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          right thumbstick catches onto something when moving it south      
195,5.0,                       i am not by any means a professional gamer  but here are my thoughts wired working xbox button responsive multi function buttons  can be turned off  customizable durable break away nylon cable        long  rubber cable wrap rubber gripsi have been experiencing some lag with my stock controller  so i specifically set out to find a wired controller that is very responsive  i am not disappointed  the buttons are crisp and quick with an audible  click  with each button press  i like that the fact that the xbox button works is great  it doesn t even need to be held down to turn on the xbox  just a quick click and the console responds  neat right out of the box this controller is pretty cool  it feels a lot like a stock controller  but the multi function buttons are definitely different  i have never had a controller with these buttons  so it will take some getting used to  but i can tell i m really going to like this feature  if ever i do change my mind  i can assign them to do nothing when pressed  completely eliminating them without the need to remove them  before you ask  they are not removable   the light in the center is customizable as well with different color options as well as different patterns and brightness  it can even be turned off altogether if one chose to do so the controller looks and feels durable in my hands  i m not worried about dropping it on the floor  i am clumsy by nature and have   curious and sometimes rambunctious cats the nylon branded cable is clearly durable as well  i have had products in the past with similar material so i am confident this cable will last a very long time  this cable also has a very nice break away feature which is really great for storage and for having   cats that can be unruly with their brotherly wrestling matches  with this feature i don t fear them ripping the cables from the xbox console  nor am i worried that they could pull they xbox from the t v  stand altogether  and if ever my fianc  or i tripped over it  i think the cable and controller would survive quite nicely  however  i don t think it will be easily uncoupled by accident as when plugging the wire into the console  the controller  and attaching the cable in the middle  see photos  it feels solid and tight  and the rubber cable wrap is adjustable  which provides storage options  i can choose to wind the cable tight and small  thin and lengthy  or anything in between  this cable wrap will do well in any scenario the rubber grips on the joysticks as well as the backs of the hand grips feel very nice  with my stock controller  i did have issues with long term gaming and felt my controller slip out of my grip  i often had to readjust the controller in my hands  this controller is definitely better for that  my fingers grip it nicely after downloading the razer wolverine for xbox app i discovered that it is even more customizable than i realized  the multi function buttons can be remapped to basically anything and even the range of the joysticks and triggers can be changed as well as vibration intensity  very nice features for anyone wanting tailored responsiveness all in all this is a great controller and i am very excited to get to know all of its features and functionality in the enjoyment to come  well done  razer  as always you have delivered a quality product      
196,2.0,                       i bought this controller in hopes that it would surpass all other controllers i have used in the past   for the first few months the controller worked great   i play roughly    hours a video games a week on average   however in the last month i noticed some significant changes   one being that the  l  joy stick is moving to the left always in games   ex   character spawns and moves to the left until you hit the joy stick to the right to cancel it out   secondly  and most importantly  the cable   after several months of being extremely cautious and careful with this controller cable  it now does not work   it slowly was disconnecting randomly at times  now there is no connection at all   i do not throw my stuff around  i have not dropped it  i took incredible care of it   i will not be purchasing this again  nor will i recommend it   i am very disappointed i spent        on a controller that worked for less than a year   my xbox controller is   years old and still going strong      
197,1.0,                       i used this product for   hours in trainers in rocket league   by mapping left and right air roll to the back buttons  it s possible to tornado flick   after spending   hours learning that as well as getting completely reprogrammed in my brain to use the back buttons to air roll left and right  the boost button  b  randomly completely stopped working in the middle of a game   just straight up did not allow me to boost   i took it into training and found that indeed  the button would randomly not register   this has been mentioned in multiple other   star reviews furthermore  the right trigger was sticky at the beginning and by the end of   hours of playing was already squeaking furthermore  i spent an hour and a half and had to contact razor support to get the  plug and play  thing to work with steam games   hint   you have to turn off xbox controller configuration support for some reason so  after     hours of suffering through getting it to work and   hours of actually using and getting excited at my new prospects in the game  d   it has a button stop functioning consistently and a trigger going from sticky to squeaky           i absolutely am not satisfied  nor would i recommend this controller to anyone   at least anyone that seriously games or needs consistent precision in their inputs   definitely not for competitive games like rocket league  unless you re like a silver lol  it baffles me that a product advertised as plug and play that costs      would be so much headache and disappointment in a single day   i copped out and bought this because scuf has been out of stock for over   weeks with  no known eta on when we ll be restocking our xbox controllers   coming straight from their support which i contacted    i guess learn from my mistake and wait for scuf to restock  some unknown eta   because there is a an honestly decently high chance you might get one of these controllers that becomes completely unusable in     days  time   this is something that is marketed to serious gamers with precision needs  and it absolutely does not stand up to that test   couple that with the consistent theme of this  and very similar problems with the back buttons  mentioned in other   star reviews  and you come to realize that there is something likely low quality in the manufacturing process   another review mentioned he got a replacement only to have the same thing happen again   that s why i m refunding without giving them another chance   if you can t have a product that withstands even a single work day of gaming  then you do not deserve      of my money      
198,1.0,                       voice communications no longer work properly after only   month of use   you have to jiggle the headphone cord around to get it to work and you have to find the right position to make it work   worked fine for   weeks       
199,4.0,                       i ve gotta say  this is a really good controller  i have had this thing for about   months and it feels really nice to hold  the mouse clicks are satisfying to press compared to a regular controller and the magnetic trigger stops feel great to fiddle with  but it has a few setbacks for some people  the first one being for the fellas who use a  claw grip  the start button will be near your index knuckle  so you will hit it more than you would think  second is the bumpers and the triggers  the triggers are fairly blocked by the bumpers if you use them simultaneously  also you need the razer xbox app to map the other two bumpers for the pc fellas tldr  looks good  feels good  sounds good  very strudy  but the bumpers and triggers collide with each other and the start button is easy to misclick if you have a claw grip  cant button map the extra   buttons on pc to my knowledge      
200,5.0,                       much more convenient to hold than the elite  the paddles are not in the most  natural  position but i found that they are better in their position on the wolverine because i can hold the controller and click the buttons on demand  with the elite i have to hold the controller on the paddles  which led to inadvertent paddle clicks of course this one is wired so if that is a deal breaker then look elsewhere      
201,1.0,                       i ve had this contoller a little over   months now  already dead  i plug the controller in  no lights at all  i didn t buy the additional amazon coverage  but now i am stuck with a broken      controller  and nothing to show with it  would not recommend  right analog stick broke within   weeks but was not bad review worthy  but now  i would not recommend this product at all  i would recommend buying the tournament edition if anything  as that will save you     worth of useless add ons      
202,4.0,                       the buttons are a bit smushy but so far the controller is fast  but i suggest using a higher sensitivity in shooter games since the sticks are pretty stiff  overall i slapped a kontrol freek on that s ps  and have been gaming fine since      
203,4.0,                       pretty good   but wouldn t pay full price for it my hands are a bit on the smaller size  so i find the design to fit my hand great  the led lights are a plus  i honestly don t mind the usb cable since i m originally a pc player everything is wired and for optimal gaming i d debatably say wireless is not good for latency concerns  i like that the controller is also pretty light  everything is built pretty well  but it is my first time using a controller with multiple button mappings  so it s going to feel and still is awkward for me to utilize  but the more different games i play and mess with the button maps  i can definitely feel it helps a lot   overwatch for certain characters like doomfist it s great  call of duty it s pretty damn good esp if you like to knife it has a mechanical click noise  huge plus for me   coming from using mechanical keyboards and mouse the noise and feel when i play feels so great  and debatably it helps the controls run smoother and better they have trigger adjustments  and for me personally  man it helps a lot  helps boost my reflexes and reaction time my only downside is are the analog sticks they only come with   different sets  and unfortunately kontrol freak does not fit on them  i purchased a ps  one and had to damage the sticks a bit to fit them i personally only liked one of them because it was longer and helped with my aiming but it was the only longer one they had  the rest were standard size overall controller is great  if you like mechanical keyboard and mouse you ll definitely like this  and i got it during prime day  but i wouldn t have paid more for it it does improve your gaming experience  but not significantly life changing honestly      
204,2.0,                       i bought this rather pricey wired controller because i was tired of oem xbox one controllers dying or falling apart at         each  i had already purchased four that died in addition to the one that came with my console that also died    that s      or more in replacement costs   worth noting  my     console that i keep for beatles rock band and whatnot still has its original controllers   infuriated with microsoft s subpar xbox one controllers  i switched to the razer wolverine ultimate  looking forward to no longer worrying about batteries or charging  as well as interchangeable sticks  hoping that shorter sticks would be easier on my often painful gamer thumbs the controller is impressive in looks  comfort  and features  even the wire is mesh covered and detachable  and unless you have kids or pets  it s really no big deal and saves a lot of hassle over swapping batteries at inopportune times the shortest thumb sticks did indeed soothe my overused thumbs  that is  until one of them fell off  nowhere to be found  i called razer and was told they hadn t any replacements in stock  wtf  checked back three times in as many months and not a single time did they offer stick replacements  searched ebay  amazon and more no one has of replacement sticks for the wolverine ultimate  except razer  who doesn t regularly keep them in stock had i known that going in  i m unsure that i would have purchased it  and i m pretty salty over the whole affair  because magnetic parts come off more easily than you might imagine  and what sort of company makes proprietary hardware with interchangeable  easily lost  parts then doesn t stock them     stars for not regularly having replacement sticks in stock     star for not allowing resellers to stock replacement parts as well  what good is a controller with magnetic parts if those parts become lost or damaged and you cannot purchase replacements       
205,3.0,                       this is my second wolverine  this is a great quality product and the indented shoulder buttons are op but  the fact that razer hasn t supported the mapping software for windows is ridiculous  just get an elite   instead      
206,2.0,                       what a joke of an item  i bought this to use on a pc and utilize the extra buttons for key mappings  little did i know that you can only map the extra buttons to xbox controls  such as buttons that already exist on the controller  so dumb  additionally  dont be fooled by the removable wire  this controller is wired for a controller that costs over       this is simply not acceptable  i get there s a market for these items for pro gamers but razer really dropped the ball with this one      
207,5.0,                       better than the elite controller      
208,5.0,                       i like the controller its small thats was i like about and without reaching the buttons you have it on the back and the best part is the colors and cool how it changes color and the best part you can put your own favorite color on it on a app on xbox     
209,5.0,                       took about   week to get comfortable with the extra buttons  mapping is simple and can be done during gameplay if needed  great if you don t want to learn claw grip play style  and benefit from being able to use other buttons while your thumbs remain on the joysticks  build quality is top notch too  if you re really into shooter games it s worth a try      
210,5.0,                       i have owned a scuf one  the microsoft elite contoller  and now the razer wolverine ultimate and i can honestly say this has become my favorite controller i cannot speak bad about the scuf other than the fact my paddles kept breaking and i had to replace them often   it wasn t major  but it was annoying   even still  the scuf ranks better than the elite being that i had it for over   years with heavy use  destiny  halo    and the only issue was the paddles breaking over time the reason i upgraded to the elite is because i wanted to move from   paddles to     the elite fit the bill  and i did not have to wait for my controller to be made  i was able to hit a local gamestop and pick one up that day initially i was excited  but i ve had pretty much every known problem with my elite   my left bumper broke  search for elite bumper repair kit  its so common that multiple sellers have repair kits for the bumpers    my sticks became very loose  inexcusable considering i had the scuf more than twice as long and never experienced that issue   and the grip panels on the controller began to peel so annoying that i finally just removed them altogether  i bought the controller in april of      and while it was still usable when i purchased the razer in jan      i would not say the quality was at all worth the price tag   the scuf far surpassed the elite in this category now for the wolverine ultimate so far i can tell you that this is my favorite controller   i can t speak for the durability or quality over time yet  but the controller feels like it s actually going to last   i will update my review at different intervals and update on this the buttons are super responsive  light touches to the abxy buttons will active them   and they feel more like a mouse click than the squishy feeling you get from the regular xbox controllers  elite and even scuf included being that it uses the body of a regular one controller the hair triggers work as well or better than the offering on the elite  and i do prefer them over the hair trigger lock system my scuf one used   i m not sure if scuf has made improvements in this area with their newer controller  infinity   but even the elite controller was preferable to what was on my scuf   the wolverine pretty much exactly the way the elite does  and it does decrease the trigger travel a great deal note  i did not have issues with the hair triggers being a problem like i did with my scuf and even elite  i had to calibrate the triggers being in hair trigger mode using the software on xbox    so far i have played pubg and halo     some games need the trigger to travel more than some hair trigger systems allow to register  thus it needing to be calibrated for the elite no option for this on the scuf or wolverine    once again  though  i have had no issue with the wolverine not registering on a game yet the top paddles i thought would be an adjustment but other than retraining my brain  they are very easy and  natural  to use   the bottom   are excellently placed and are quite easy to access using your middle and ring ringers  eliminating the need for your fingers to ever leave the sticks   i have opted to use the default buttton mapping  x and y on left and right top paddles  a and b on the first   of   bottom paddles  and the using the bottom left paddle for focus and the bottom right for agile  i m not going to explain to you what focus and agile do because that s available to you elsewhere  just know that once you get used to the controller and the idea of having it it is a game changer   more precision or speed as you need it at your fingertips   yes please if you re alrwady considering this controller this should be a sign that you should give it a try i decided to because i used a razer copperhead mouse when i pc gamed back when dinosaurs still roamed the earth  quake     and was always very happy with it   i m glad i decided to try the wolverine  it has not disappointed yet edit august   th      i am still using the controller   one paddle has stopped working  but it s a minor inconvenience   i m still incredibly happy with my purchase nearly   years later      
211,4.0,                       please note i use this on a pc  and not an xbox     so if there are any issues with this and the xbox   i am unaware of them the remote feels very sturdy  the cord is very secure when connected   long braided cord for ease of use   it s well made and goes with my razer  keyboard   i would highly recommend buying this for anyone thats needs a quality controller if anyone has any issues changing colors or getting it to rebind the buttons go to the microsoft store and find the free app to fix that      
212,3.0,                       i love this controler  however my mic pics up everything but when using this controler i can t change the threshold or the mic monitoring like you can in the xbox menu because for some reason they remove it when using the controller second my controlers  mm headphone jack has started to freak out  i will randomly get dropped audio but mostly it will be a high pitch beeping  i have tried a different headset and a different usb port but nothing is working  loved the controller tell it started to freak out  it started to happen at    days   days after the return policy      
213,5.0,                       this thing costs more than my first nintendo    but it is definitely worth the money if you want to program your own config and layout      
214,4.0,                       plus      comfortable grip  and reprogramable buttons are great negative     triggers feel alittle fragile  and cord has lost connectivity with slight contact   very expensive     
215,2.0,                       i ll start with what i really liked  the d pad  while not mechanical  still felt a little clicky  definitely not a standard membrane feel which was nice  now the bad was the face buttons  it s possible i had a dud  but my face buttons did not feel like i expected  there was a lot of resistance before it would finally  click   imagine a membrane key on top of a mechanical one  it was really disappointing after using the razer wildcat and loving the controller so much  on top of that the placement of the extra buttons on the grip didn t work well for me  just from clenching my hands a little too much i would activate them really easily on the plus side i got the ultimate edition after this one and it is exactly what i was looking for  if you loved the wildcat i d recommend the ultimate over the tournament edition  i caught it on sale for      and i m very happy with it      
216,5.0,                       fast shipping i bought as gift for my husband  easy set up just download the app on xbox   i highly recommend this controller over the elite controller     
217,1.0,                       i ve bought two of the tournament edition controllers and both had audio jacks that broke within a week of use      
218,5.0,                       i ordered a used one when i bought this and instead they charged me for a new one and gave me a new one  i don t care though because this is exactly the controller i was looking for  the colored leds are more than just a nice little show off you can do when your friends are over  they actually can serve as profile identification for custom button schemes you set with the games you want to utilize the   extra buttons for  once you download the free app for the controller you will assign a profile  lets say gears of war   for example  then you can customize your button inputs  then you can assign a led color profile for when you use the gears setup  very neat feature  the cord for the controller is very long so do not worry it will not reach your chair  couch etc  definitely worth the price      
219,1.0,                       product is not supported anymore  there are some apps on the windows store for win   but they re broken  you can t change it remap buttons  and the extra buttons you have are just alternate buttons for a b y x  you can t change these  the extra buttons are completely useless on this controller  not worth the money at all  i m switching to an elite  which is still supported by ms and there s a software that let s you really bind keys to what you want for max customization      
220,4.0,                       i really liked using this controller  however  i still ended up going back to the elite controller  this controller works well and was good to use  but in the end i preferred the other      
221,3.0,                       the product is built well and has a good feel to it  the buttons are nice as well but there is a major design flaw with this controller  the joysticks specifically  the joystick stem is fatter than a standard xbox one controller which ends up limiting the travel in the joystick  specifically  the joysticks have    less travel than the standard xbox one controller which doesn t sound like a lot  but is very noticeable in first person shooters and racing games  adjusting the sensitivity doesn t help because the controller takes the physical control out of your hand  the more travel in a joystick  the more control and accuracy you will get with your thumb  because of this  i can t recommend this controller      
222,5.0,                       this item is comprable to the xbox one elite controller   i ve owned this controller for a good while now and there is no drift in my sticks and the buttons are still responsive and useful   i like the back paddles on the elite controller better but you will get used to these over time   this is not for people who want a wireless controller as this controller must be wired or plugged in but the cord is very long and it does not bother me  when it is time to get a new xbox one controller  this is most likely the one that i will purchase   currently i am mostly playing red dead redemption   and call of duty black ops        
223,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          first of all  the box arrived damaged  idk if it was because of the delivery or the product was already like that when they send it   the controller itself has one of the trigger stop switches loose which although it doesn t affect functionality it s kind of a downer that it came like that being this a  new  product  the controller itself has a premium feel once in your hands  i really liked the customization you can do to it  only downer it s the plastic material from the extra buttons  triggers and bumpers  it s really glossy and really easily scratched  overall it s a good budget elite controller with the pros and cons of a wired controller      
224,5.0,                       best decision i have ever made for gaming    after two weeks my gameplay greatly increased  i wasn t a fan of the wired controller at first but it s long enough for gaming and long enough to just kick it and watch tv    this is a great controller for someone who is looking to take there gaming to the next level but not spend a fortune     
225,1.0,                       at first  i thought i bought the ultimate controller  aside that it s not wireless  in april       the  for use on pc the build quality seemed good  buttons crisp  grip is grippy and still not sticky at this point i would have given it a   it s not a   because  buttons can only be remapped to existing controller buttons  you would assume that the  the most versatile and customizable controller ever   would be able to do that  especially when you need another program aside from synapse and razer central   razer synapse for xbox   to access all of its features  there  it even has a feature to change the controller sensitivity  or something  called focus or agile  which must be binded to a button to be used yes  it has original functions that are binded to buttons but can t it bind keyboard or mouse inputs  note that because it has unique programming  other remap software that would work on normal xbox controllers cannot be used with this controller  the wolverine ultimate was originally released in november         any hope that they will provide an update for remapping is slim to none also  the  lightweight braided fiber cable  have these dense nubs   inches from where the cable ends  one the controller and two on the usb side  one actually an adapter   which are heavy enough to pull down on the cable and gets pretty annoying  especially when it hits my table or knee when i move the controller i was pretty disappointed at this point but decided to keep it since i like the feel of it after two months defect    the m  button  the additional button near the bumpers  occasionally acts as if the button is continued to be pressed on  the physical button doesn t get stuck  so i had to press it again to reset it  as someone was enjoying the m   m  as quicker  more tactile buttons to replace the triggers  and needs to press it a lot  this was extremely annoying after four months  now  defect    i have heavy stick drift on both thumbsticks  and my x a b y keys either do not send input or get stuck  unlike the other defect  this happens regularly and i can t live with it being my main inputs unfortunately i decided to take the controller apart to see if was caused by debris  so i assume that my warranty is void overall  if this controller worked and was wireless  with keyboard mouse inputs remappable to the buttons  then it s definitely worth the price however  i would say this controller is actually worth     at most  but if i already have a controller from a current gen console  i would not spend that     to get this or any controller with additional buttons   you probably won t use the additional buttons  the ones on the back  since they are extremely awkward and you need to retrain muscle memory from scratch to use your index and middle fingers that you never used before  tl drthe wolverine is a wired xbox controller that feels nice  buttons and grip  but fail horribly at all the bells and whistles that are supposed to justify the very high price  especially in           
226,1.0,                       this controller is trash  i didn t even use it more than   times  total  right out of the box i noticed a little bit of stick drift  thought maybe it was my call of duty settings  it progressively got worse and worse until my player was just staring into the sky as i was walking  product came in on monday  played   game  tuesday played   game after work  wednesday didn t even attempt due to the amount of drift overnight   i just am so confused how this is happening with something branded as a  tournament edition controller  imagine if i was a pro player and was in a big tournament  my controller is failing me before i even get to play  really   unbelievably upset at the quality  returning and praying i just got a defective controller  even thought i bought it brand new out of the box        
227,3.0,                       i ve used this controller almost every day since october      and it s been great  however  the right bumper is starting to break  doesn t always register in game anymore  i go and check razer s warranty policy    controllers are   year  given the pricetag  i m pretty disappointed that it didn t last longer than that      
228,4.0,                       i like it  better than any other xbox controller i ve played with  expect the ultimate edition  the ultimate edition is just better  the abxy buttons are much better it s like a mouse click that takes a lot less pressure to press than the wolverine v   also  the   extra paddles make it more worth it  for only      right now  get the ultimate  this v  was a good try but to me the ultimate is still better     
229,2.0,                       this controller is very comfortable when gripped how you would normally grip a controller  however    the paddle placement on the bottom basically require you to play with open hands because they are so hard to reach and next to impossible while actually gripping the controller when the whole point of a controller like this is for the paddles  and you make said paddles impossible to comfortably reach even with the very tip of your fingers you would be better off using a standard xbox controller      
230,1.0,                       don t waste your money  really bad software  and the bumper broke in   months  never buying razor again      
231,4.0,                       very solid controller  very customizable  comfortable and one of the best controllers i ve ever used  this was enough of a gripe to lose a star sadly  but it doesn t not work with synapse    you will have to download  razer wolverine for xbox  to configure button mapping and lighting   i don t like using an entire software suite for one device      
232,1.0,                       best controller out there by far  but they dont last   and customer support sucks  i have had   in the past   years    year after each use something messes up  first   first year  remapping button quit now   nd year  nd controller   left stick is not working now     
233,1.0,                       for the month that the controller worked  it was fantastic  suddenly it no longer works  the xbox light will briefly flash and then the controller shuts down  good luck finding any info for troubleshooting too      
234,3.0,                       great controller with good ergonomics  only thing is the sticks sometimes need alignment through windows monthly to keep everything on point  price is a little steep for what you get  especially being wired      
235,5.0,                       amazing button re mapping options  weighted very well  comfortable grip      
236,2.0,                       good buttons and rgb customization via razer app  feels very light  but the   action buttons feels like a mouse quite ugly the analogue sticks is very bad not soft at all  i don t recommend this controller      
237,5.0,                       over a month and this has performed flawlessly from day       
238,5.0,                       do i really need to say something  it s a razer so you know it s good it s only wired no batteries in this one again it s only wired don t complain about it cause it s a lot lighter than my elite controller plus   extra bumpers      
239,1.0,                       the buttons are harder to press than a regular xbox controller which i don t see it as a good thing  also the joystick started to stick to the sides within a week of use  and two months after the trigger stoppers don t work properly  the worse of all is that i can t claim the warranty      
240,5.0,                       awesome controller better than the elite and cheaper by a      and no battery to charge      
241,4.0,                       extra mappable buttons are great  anologs have perfect response  bit a y x b buttons are slightly harder to push than a normal controller and also has a distinct click that maps tabbing buttons quickly for game mechanics harder      
242,5.0,                       looks and feels great  love that it s a dedicated wired controller  i m old school in that sense and love the idea that i don t have to worry about the battery any longer     
243,5.0,                       very good     
244,4.0,                       i got this controller a few months ago and it is the best one out there  it is wired not wireless if you prefer wired it is good for you  unfortunately my cord tip bent and i can t use it now but i cannot also find it on amazon        
245,1.0,                       pc gamers do not buy this controller      the razer synapse program for xbox will just crash when you try to remap a button  have to download synapse for xbox through microsoft store      
246,5.0,                       i love this controller  buttons are in an intelligent place no need for batteries comfortable what more do i need to say      
247,5.0,                       should have came with better instructions other than plug and play   had to figure out all the extra buttons on my own   other than that it s a great controller specially for serious  gamers      
248,5.0,                       i ve usually stuck with cheaper     controllers as i thought it wasn t worth it to spend more  but after trying out this one i m sold  the build quality is noticeably better and the additional buttons    back paddles and   extra top bumpers  are a huge value add  the ability to remap those buttons is even better  as you can really customize it to your play style and maybe save yourself some strain by mapping a frequently used button to the back paddles  i d definitely recommend it      
249,3.0,                       this controller is sturdy and has nice features but i am really disappointed that the extra buttons cannot be remapped to the keyboard or mouse  third party programs like rewasd joytokey don t recognize the extra buttons due to razers hardware  but i got it on sale so i can live without the extra buttons  i would give it   stars if i could actually remap the extra buttons but right now i feel lied to about them being re mappable  they are interchangeable with other buttons on the controller at best      
250,5.0,                       im strictly comparing it to the generic controllers you get with the xbox  this one is much better for competitive play  more sensitive overall and easier to maneuver when playing games like cod etc  seems to be holding up in terms of durability      
251,3.0,                       controller is great  but when used with my normal xbox one turtle beach headset i often end of sounding like a  garbled robot voice  to the people in my party  everything else works great but the mic problems are very annoying     
252,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the worst controller y ever seen the b doesn t work     
253,3.0,                       the controller as good build quality and it feels good in my small hands  but the placement os the other buttons under the controller are hard to reach and does not feel natural when playing games  i have to constantly adjust my fingers to press the buttons  so i exchange it for the other variant where the buttons on the bottom are located closer the handle where your hands rest naturally when playing      
254,1.0,                       bought this super excited  within a couple weeks of game play the a button stopped working  used razers customer support and took all the steps they told me to and they ruled it was a bad controller and to send it back  sent it back  no issues with amazon return btw  got the same controller again  the new controller s headphone port appears to be going out now  sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t  for the record i ve been very carful with both controllers  haven t been dropped etc  really expected more very disappointed     
255,3.0,                       this is my  th razer controller after the last   i owned have severely degraded due to normal usage  i ve had a sabertooth and   wildcats and this one is a step down from those older models  the abxy buttons are stiffer and require more force to push them down  this is critical for me since i play rocket league and i often need to press the a   b button at the same time  the multi function triggers on the back are in a weird place and my ring fingers sit on the edge of the hard plastic piece which is unpleasant  this could have been avoided if they just rounded off the edge or moved them up higher  unlike previous models  razer opted to remove the ability to set macro buttons using just the controller and forces the user to use the razer synapse application  in hindsight i should bought the ultimate edition  but couldn t justify spending      when all   of my controllers have broke in some way      
256,5.0,                       if your fed up with crappy wired controllers then here you go  just do it  the triggers rumble  it feels really good  i honestly  want say it s worth a     bucks but its damn sure the best controller i have used ever      
257,1.0,                       a month of use and the y button suddenly stopped working  lt engages lb randomly and both lt   rt get stuck and have to be tapped again to release  would not recommend if you want something that s gonna last  i sent them back for a refund      
258,1.0,                       ordered one of these september          now it is september  th      and i used the controller a moderate amount  it has developed slight stick drift in the right stick in under a year  i wish these controllers or any controller for that matter would come with a dead zone adjuster because apparently no one can use quality parts that last longer than a year  other than the drift problem i love the controller      
259,5.0,                       loving this controller  so far so good  use it for pc and xbox  wired is kind of in the way but other than that it performs well very durable and comfortable  can compete with some elite players      
260,2.0,                       i bought this controller as i m playing more frequent and for longer duration  the overall feel is great and all the buttons feel snappy  my only issue is that the sample i got had a severe joystick drift which made it impossible to use on any game     
261,5.0,                       i love this controller   i don t love the fact that it isn t wireless   i knew that when i bought it but i still wish it were wireless   if you are playing a gaming console and are not within     of your tv you will need a usb extension cable   the controls are smooth and have that  click  to them that really feels good   the paddles and great and the audio controls on the controller are nice as well   feels like a high quality controller   would recommend this item  i got mine from the amazon warehouse listed in vg condition   it is like new   i ve had no problem buying open box items from amazon just read the description carefully   it will tell you exactly what you are getting      
262,1.0,                       i had high hopes for this controller but ultimately it has been a horrible decision purchasing it  i purchased this controller in june of       by december of       the left thumbstick didn t work properly and the right trigger stop was broken where it could not be used at all  i opened up a warranty case on            with razer  they first sent over a list of questions asking when the issue occurred  was it working properly previously  description of what the issue is etc  after responding to that email they wanted a video showing the controller is not working properly  so i had to record myself using the controller and simultaneously show how the functions were not working on the screen and not working on the controller  i then had to upload this video and once they reviewed it and determined if was defective and under warranty they sent the case to another department who sends you instructions for getting your replacement  that department reaches out with instructions providing you a return authorization number and a fedex prepaid postage  i then had to find a box  pack the controller  write the return authorization number on the box  otherwise they won t accept it  and they state that you have to print out the email thread with all the correspondence and put it in the box as well  once all that was done i had to go to a fedex location to ship it out and wait for them to receive it  process the replacement and then mail it back  this all started on            and i received my replacement on             almost a full month later  in the meantime i had to buy a regular xbox controller so further funds were wasted  i get my razer replacement on             plug it in today for the first time            and the  x  button doesn t work on the replacement  as if the process wasn t long enough  the replacement they sent me is broken out of the box  a simpler process would have been that once they accepted the controller was defective  to send a new one and with the new one send a return label so u could use the same box and just affix the new label  that way you aren t waiting for them to receive your broken controller before sending you a new one  i ll update this review with what their response is with this replacement controller that had a broken  x  button  but as of right now i would not recommend this product to anyone      
263,2.0,                       if you are use to the normal xbox one controller then don t buy this  garbage waste of money controller  thought maybe for one second i d get a controller that may be a bit different and useful  but turns out i d rather use the messed up brand new xbox controller i have  tbh i think the elite controller feels better in every way  garbage garbage garbage for      imagine smashing like the a button flat in a normal controller so that way it barley clicks back up and that s how the buttons feel on this  just frustrated when you push kinda hard up on the anolog stick and it comes out messing up your gameplay  so hopefully you go somewhere like gamestop and try it out so that way you don t experiment like me and end up wasting money     
264,1.0,                       will never buy a razer profuct again  i got right stick drift after just   month of use  i can t believe that something that costs over      couldn t last a year at the least      
265,3.0,                       great quality sticks  but synapse does not work and the new buttons are not my style   i am old school claw pro gamer from      though      
266,2.0,                       took all of   months for the infamous right stick drift to start   a constant issue across the razer forums that appears to specifically point to this issue being a large deal amongst the amazon sold controllers   nothing tried has fixed it  if you insist on buying the wolverine te  order from razer directly  not amazon  not saying the problem is directly specific to just amazon sold controllers  but after some research across the forums  that is the conclusion i came to      
267,4.0,                       really dig this controller  had the wildcat for a year until the left analog stick started to malfunction  received a new one under the warranty since it was just over   year  decided to keep the wildcat as a backup and purchased this model  the wolverine ultimate  pretty disappointed though because i ve only had it   months and the right analog stick is defective  turns normal speed to the left but very slow to the right  only happens on games with tight aiming controls like r  siege  etc  still a bummer though bc when playing certain games i have to use the wildcat to prevent the issue  going to contact razer yet again for info on another return overall  great controller  i d like to think i just got a bad one      
268,5.0,                       i ve tried a few different controllers as i graduated to incorporating paddles into my game  the controller quality of the product and build is superior  everything feels sturdy and comfortable in your hand  the only downside is the paddles are a little tough to reach      
269,4.0,                       it s over priced and the buttons underneath aren t positioned as well as an xbox elite or scuff controller   but it has rgb and matches my razer blade pro and razer mouse   my name is runngun   and i m an rgb addict      
270,2.0,                       i play rocket league a lot  i can kill a normal xbox one controller in   months playing a lot  as that is pretty much the only game i play  issue with me is the left thumbstick wears out  so i usually by a cheap controller every     months and replace it  like      vs xbox one or  premium controller  which cost a lot tried this one out  exact same thing  left thumbstick now drifts after buying it on jan   th  everything felt very nice    premium  over the cheap chinese controllers from the start  after about a month  left stick starts drifting there is zero difference in the  quality  how this holds up vs a cheap aftermarket controller   the grip feels better  and the buttons have a bit more of a  click  to them  it wears out the exact same as the cheap controllers      
271,1.0,                       save your money on this one guys  especially if you re used to regular xbox controllers  after just one day my right stick started drifting  for      that should not happen the light in the middle constantly flashes this super bright  distracting light that can t be turned off  or dimmed  or even set to not be a strobe light  so it s always in your face blinking  playing call of duty  i kept accidentally switching my gun in the middle of shooting  because the buttons on the bottom of the controller  which are not remappable by the way  are too close to the handles so they get pushed unintentionally  the axby buttons click like a computer mouse more than an xbox button and at first i liked that  then i realized it s harder to tell when i m pushing buttons in the heat of the moment  the rubber on the back  while good for grip  just made the controller feel sticky at times overall this controller wasn t made to be used for more hardcore games even though that s what it says it s for  this isn t a good controller  it s a controller that s trying to be cool and it s not working  idk maybe i just have big hands      
272,4.0,                       great controller  i am having issues with the micro usb cable and the controller timing out      
273,5.0,                       hands down the best pc controller i have used  love the thumbsticks and button feel  only negative thing in my eyes is the micro usb connection  i really hope future models come usb c  to be fair it is also intended to be used with xbox   which is not usb c compatible so can t blame em for old usb      
274,1.0,                       controller is not wireless  the only reason i purchased this controller is because the page said that it can be wired or wireless  i just recieved the controller today           and juat started the return      
275,3.0,                       great controller but the cable is too short     
276,5.0,                       its a great controllor if your not used to buttons on the handles it may be off at first and you may axsidentally click it but besides that its great the real question is if the price is worth it to you     
277,5.0,                       i got this controller for my son for xmas  its march now and its still working great  he loves it and i know theres no way hes going to use the regular xbox controller after using this one  it has the extra buttons and it lights up  it also has a sturdy cord that lasts      
278,1.0,                       had two of these one the buttons on the underside broke and stopped pressing after a couple months and the second the left thumbstick would move without my thumb even on it  very poor manufacturing      
279,1.0,                       as the q a below says  the controller is limited to only mapping the default xbox buttons for pc users at least with the elite controller you can remap anything you like using rewasd   unfortunately using this controller it s impossible to remap to anything other than existing xbox buttons   additionally  it does not work with your typical razer chroma drivers  and software   it appears to use the same app that is present on the console      
280,5.0,                       love this controller  i am a competitive apex legends player and have gone through about   different types of controller trying to find one that worked well for me  this controller took a little to get used to coming from a regular xbox controller but once i got used to the feel it has really good response time is great because it s wired and the sticks deadzones feel non existent  also the ability to lock the right trigger improves response times and single rapid abilities  i have not found on the xbox store anything to reconfigure the buttons though which means it comes preset with what the paddles do  you can reconfigure more on a pc though  all in all a great purchase and i love the controller      
281,5.0,                       very very nice controller  almost better then xbox controller just with it was wireless     
282,5.0,                       this has been the first hi end controller i ve ever gotten and i can t believe the quality and the performance of the controller  it feels right in your hands of course it has a learning curve if this is your first  elite  controller      
283,5.0,                       great build  reliable  works as advertised  would buy again      
284,3.0,                       i have two of these controllers and they are the best controllers ive ever held   the remappable buttons and mechanical face buttons are such a treat to play with  however  there s a reason i have two of these controllers  and am now looking for another  the control sticks dont have any noticeable stick drift but they do lose their full range of motion  on one of my wolverines the left stick kinda dies when going into a sprint on fps games where it looks like im a noob in a manual car clutch stalling every   feet  on the second wolverine it was more noticeable playing injustice   where my left and right stick were influencing each other   pressing right or left on my rs kept read as if i was going up or down with my ls   there s defiantly a problem with the innards of the controller i just have the tool s or know how to crack it open and look     
285,3.0,                       if you are a person that every dollar you spend matters  id suggest trying to find a different controller  i have seen people write better than elite controller by far and that is a straight out lie  they have probably never had a elite controller or are just trying to be a word of mouth advertiser  i dont know the durability yet since i just got it  but my  st impression is just  ehh   the d pad is way too stiff and it barely breaks the surface of the controller so it just feels clunky and i can see this being a problem for long game sessions  takes way too much effort to use the d pad for simple menu navigation  the left thumbstick feels short and the right thumb stick is too stiff  the paddle that is default to x has the same problem as the d pad except not too stiff  my impression of the build is rushed and feels cheap  my elite controller felt great    felt premium  that is definitely my favorite controller  but the bumpers break way too easy  after   returns in   years  it is time to find a new favorite controller  sadly  this controller is not it  if i hadnt made the mistake and bought the tournament edition when i wanted the ultimate edition  my review could have been different  but the quality of this controller feels subpar    im not even going to return it and exchange it for the slightly higher priced controller  i dont think the results will be much better  if this controller does not feel any better within a week  i will probably sell it and go back to a standard xbox controller again i will tough it out until november when elite series   comes out and hopefully the bumper problem is fixed hey razer  some of us have plenty rgb in our pcs already  rgb will not sell your product over good construction  if it feels cheep  it usually is      
286,1.0,                       i thought they fixed the audio issue with xbox in party chat  it s buzzes and buzzes when using a wired mic  i literally sent this back and purchased another elite controller      
287,5.0,                       my brother is loving it  and the extra buttons  macros  are really useful      
288,1.0,                       i m pretty much writing the same review with razer wildcat  my razer wolverine didn t even last   yr  razer hasn t improved the durability of their products  no more razer for me        
289,1.0,                       avoid at all costs  controller isn t even a year old and frequently does not register rt or a  really quite irritating and a waste of money  avoid and spend your dollars on something of actual decent quality      
290,5.0,                       the power end that fits into the controller fits very snug the way all power cords should fit  it has a deep lip that seats deeper inside the controller  when the cable gets pulled  stretched or yanked it protects the actual connection from becoming loose at the controller  i m on my third xbox elite controller and every one at the connection on the controller is so loose that i have to play wireless  i tried taping the second elite so i didn t have to buy another one but  the cable would come loose in the middle of game play  do the math  i bought a third one  stupid stupid stupid  do the math  the paddles for me are good because i have long fingers and they do not get in my way unlike the elite controller that has the paddles closer to the outside of the handles  i haven t programed the paddles because i find i like the position and the default mapping of the controller just fine  it works  it s been two months and the quality is holding up just fine  all so  the built in sound controller is easy and a step up from the adapter  a couple of taps and i m all set  bar none the best controller i ve used yet  give it a try  i have used the controller   year now and it has performed very well indeed  then the controller stopped receiving power someone online said its the power cord  i don t know  it might be  if i wiggle it around just right a small flash of power lights up the controller then stops  the connection ports on both ends look fine  the cord was not yanked over the   months  the quality of the controller is fantastic apart from this  it looks brand new still  if it is the cord please fix this  i guess i m going to try another cord  i ll keep you posted      
291,5.0,                       disclosure  this is a wired controller  that said  this is the best controller i ve played with  my previous favorite was razer wolverine tournament edition  both controllers have remappable buttons inside the left and right triggers  no one else adds extra buttons in this location and they really need to get on board  it s perfect to assign your jump and weapon swap to  and the buttons on the back are in much more comfortable positions  and with it being wired i unplug it from the xbox and into my pc and it s instantly ready to go  i didn t even have to run the remapping process again on pc  elite  scufs    i ve tried them all and i ll only buy razer moving forward      
292,1.0,                       controller later me   month total use time  unbelievable  it s absolutely junk  x button is stuck  i never eat or drink around the controller cuz i lts expensive  now it s trash worst company to ever make a controller not even a way to get replacement      
293,5.0,                       smaller lighter and feels better in my hand than either of the official xbox elite controllers  the software offers more options beyond just remapping the buttons  the lighting  vibration and stick sensitivity can all be changed with the wolverine software  unlike it s bigger brother  the ultimate  and the elite series  the configurations can t be altered while actively playing  having gone through four elite controllers  i feel more confident in the wolverine s design and quality than the elite series  the wolverine is not over engineered  which is why i think it is able to be sold at a lower price point than the elites  the wolverine is not some shoddy knock off  it is well made and sturdy      
294,1.0,                       i love the controller  however the first one sent had massive stick drift on the right thumstick  ordered a replacement of course    recieved the second one and it had the same problem except on both analog sticks    not sure whats going on with that but aside from that issue its a wonderful controller edit  right stick has become totally useless  not worth the money  and the one im talking about is the replacement  garbage     
295,1.0,                       i bought this to use the programmable buttons  thinking i could just use it with synapse  instead  synapse refused to actually register it was connected and i come to find out i ll need an additional app  then  i go to download the app from the microsoft store and it just refuses to download  which is already an issue i have with the microsoft store  but  more or less  the entire reason i purchased this was out the window without being able to rebind  why this feature wasn t just added to synapse  i don t know  i m not one to complain about minor things  but this is infuriating      
296,1.0,                       i have owned this controller since christmas so a little over   months and it already quit working      
297,3.0,                       i gave this controller   stars because it s a good controller and i have always really enjoyed razer products  but i had to return the controller   times until i got one that kinda works  the a and x buttons are about to fall out  but at least this one works  i know that i should have returned the controller but i figured if it took   tries to get a semi working one maybe it s the best one i m going to get      
298,1.0,                       first controller i received was unresponsive after unplugging it once  second one had the a button die within   months and they are unable to get me a replacement  avoid this product      
299,4.0,                       overall amazing  it just feels good  everything is smooth  the only thing i have to complain about is the stick sensitivity  but if it could be adjusted  it would easily be better than the elite      
300,1.0,                       ear piece broke off and is hanging by the wire   my son had to tape it together to play   he spent his own money to purchase and is very disappointed   for      it should last longer than   months      
301,4.0,                       i bought this controller to replace my xbox elite controller  left stick probs   i loved the trigger stops and the paddles on the elite  i decided to shop around and found this controller  the buttons are super responsive  sticks are great  no complaints for performance  i have small hands       female  so i dont use the extra buttons by the bumpers and i can only reach one of the underside buttons while maintaining a comfortable grip and reach the left stick  since the underside buttons are closer to the center  my fingertips don t reach as apposed to a controller with paddles buttons closer to the grip tldr  great controller but not if u have small hands     
302,5.0,                       i wanted to start using a controller for some games on pc  i had tried scuf vantage controller and a xbox elite controller  i sent both of those back and went with this and i could not be happier  the controller is very solid  the paddles on the back are in a great position and can be customized very easy  the left and right triggers have stops so you do not have to pull all the way down and can be adjusted on the fly  there are multiple joysticks that come with the controller and are easy to swap out  they have both domed and concave short and tall      
303,5.0,                       probably the best controller i ve ever had  on top of the elite      
304,5.0,                       if you re going to be forced to overpay to get a decent xbox style controller that doesn t feel like fragile cheap plastic but still bristle at the price gouging of a normal controller  you might as well overpay a little bit more to get a nice controller instead  great button action  some extra paddles on the back for people who play competitive games  i guess  i don t use them  and the cord is resilient enough to endure my cats periodically chewing on it  which was part of my decision making process  it has some minimal random rgb cycling on the face if you re into that thing      
305,5.0,                       my son loved it does everything expect     
306,4.0,                       pro s  good feeling in the hand  mechanical yaxb buttons  changeable left and right stick as well as dpad  onboard switching of profile for ease   four back paddles respond well cons  not really a con but this could take a while to get used to  especially if this is your first gaming controller with back buttons      
307,3.0,                       summary  too expensive for my taste for service life my left joystick no longer registers when pushed directly forward  i suspect the fault lies with the microswitches the button labels are obviously applied to the top instead of what look like colored inserts on the standard controller  they wore off within a fortnight excellent when it works  you must ask yourself if you re willing to shell out the in game currency for that amount of use time i shall bitterly miss the extra bottom switches which allow changing direction while executing slides etc      
308,2.0,                       i decided to go with this controller over buying a new elite    had the elite   and within a year a had severe stick drift  i became accustomed to the trigger pull modified and the paddles on the back  after reading some reviews i decided to give this one a shot  after only a few days of light to moderate use i noticed the abxy buttons began to only register   out of every   buttons presses  also i feel like the back buttons protrude out too much  the wire hits them and on more than one occasion i accidentally hit the paddles back buttons  so i will be returning this item and going with something else      
309,5.0,                       love this over the ps  scuf controller i use this new controller on pc for cod  rocket league  slapshot  gears  and halo      
310,4.0,                       very smooth design  solid build the buttons click similar to a mouse and the razer synapse app is easy enough to use to remap your buttons  one setback and may be only my experience is that i have to unplug  controller sometimes then plug back in to have the sound come through to the connected headphones  there is a quick disconnect on the cord and may be a little touchy on mine but seems to be working fine now  another thing to note if you use kontrol freeks  they will not easily pop on there without some slight modifications  other than that solid purchase although a bit expensive for a wired only controller      
311,5.0,                       this was bought as a christmas gift for my son  he s been very very happy with it  in terms of functionality and quality  love the razer brand  they have been our go to for mice   keyboards for years now      
312,2.0,                       xbox elite controller is better in many ways  first of all the triggers of the elite are butter smooth compared to the wolverine  then the buttons on the back  the primary reason i bought this controller  are too far for my fingers to reach comfortably  they are a lot further than they looked  i have to stretch to reach the buttons  and the buttons are slick so i can t hold them down for long without my fingers slipping  i suppose if you re just pressing them once it s okay  but by default they re mapped on buttons that i hold down  b and a   which brings up another really annoying thing  you can t remap the buttons on pc  made by gamers for gamers  oof razer   review is coming from a razer fan too        
313,5.0,                       if its a calibration issue  i will update this   but out of box it is drifting slightly on both sticks to the left  ive installed the wolverine synapse software  but it has no calibration feature  everything feels wonderful  if i could just fix this drift update the new controller arrived the next day with no drift  i didnt think a controller could feel more responsive than the first one  but this one does  this is by far the best controller i have used  i will update this again should problems arise      
314,2.0,                       the controller is great  aside from the fact that the right trigger broke completely      
315,4.0,                       i like everything about this controller except razer s software to control the rgb lighting   it s terrible   once i get razer synapse to without any flaws  then i ll be happy      
316,5.0,                       grandson says it great product     
317,2.0,                       i bought this thing under the assumption that the programmable buttons can be bound to keyboard inputs  sadly i have never been more wrong  the customization ends with normal button inputs being mapped to either the buttons between the triggers or the  top  buttons on the back  only  the bottom programable buttons are  not  mapable to another button press  probably ok for xbox but for pc it seems the best controller option is the elite  razer has lost a potential customer due to this  as they are primarily a pc peripheral company you would think they would offer full pc mapping for their own product  disappointed  do better on the next version razer     
318,5.0,                       so far after using this controller for about a month i d say it s the best xbox controller i ve ever used  it s wired which for me is a plus because i never have to charge it or change batteries in it and the cord is about    ft which is long enough for me and is a very thick braided cable so i never worry about it  i love that the face buttons feel like clicking a mouse it makes the whole experience feel more fluid and responsive especially for action games or fighting games  i also don t notice any lag with this controller like i did with my xbox wireless controller which i found most notable when playing fighting games  the paddles on the back feel very solid and at first are a bit of a pain to reach but once you get used to where they are then it s very easy to reach you won t even have to think about it  the razer synapse app is very easy to use on xbox and lets you really customize your controller for any game that you play and you can name your presets as well so you can easily find them later  the controller will also let you store   presets at a time and quickly toggle between them on the fly  you can also mute the headset with the press of a button if you need to which i do find to be useful when playing your games and you know it s muted because the button has a red slash through it  so overall i think it s a great controller but it s definitely not for everyone  it s very expensive yes and the     dollar price tag had me hesitant to buy it so i cant recommend it to everyone  if you don t mind the price though and want a good pro controller for your xbox then i d recommend this controller to you  this is my first pro controller i ve never used the xbox elite controller so i can t compare this controller to it but my experience so far has been a positive one and hopefully this review will help you make an informed purchasing decision      
319,1.0,                       i got this controller thinking it would work all the time  after all  it is connected directly through the xbox with a wire  it should work way more than a wireless controller  correct  nope  on my xbox one  regular xbox one i got when it first released  it would work i would say     of the time i turned my xbox on  the rainbow lights would turn in  but the other light under the xbox logo on the controller would not  the solution to this is fairly simple  disconnect the wire and reconnect it to the controller  although simple  it is highly inconvenient and very irritating  i purchased an xbox one s and i found that it will never work with the xbox one s upon activation of the xbox  i would turn the xbox on and spend   minutes unplugging and re connecting the controller in order to get it to work  this is extremely frustrating as a wireless controller works way best  it s too late for me to get a return for this so i basically wasted      but please  don t make the mistake of purchasing this  other than the technical issues  the controller is well designed  the rainbow lights makes you think of razer of course which is good  the   extra buttons come in handy  i just wish the controller worked      
320,2.0,                       poor quality  the pl stic it very weak if the controller falls it will be broken  its works fine but its like a cheap plastic made     
321,5.0,                       this controller looks great and performs just as great  i do wish the buttons felt less mechanical  but overall  i love the feel and performance of this controller  buyer beware  you re also unable to make the extra keys into a custom macro      
322,5.0,                       i love this controller   i had to send the first one back since the product was not new as advertised   the new product i received is excellent   it s really responsive  light and feels great in my hands  i put away my xbox elite controller   you do have to download the program for the controller to reprogram the buttons   the bottom paddles are not in the way like the xbox elite   you don t accidentally hit the paddles   definitely recommend this product      
323,4.0,                       nothing special for the money  the microsoft elite is far better     
324,3.0,                       the hardware feels nice and sturdy  i like the ability to change the d pad and thumbsticks to be more fighting game friendly  unfortunately  the software is hard to use  razer synapse   and   do not work to control rgb on controllers although they are razer s recommended control panels  i had to use razer controller for x box through the microsoft store to be able to change lights and buttons  going to the microsoft store s website said the software was currently unavailable  but going through the desktop application allowed the software to download and install  as a whole  the hardware for the controller is great  the software is lacking though and in general it was a mess to find the supported version      
325,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i m man  razer i think you need to stick to pc  not the worst  pro  gaming controller i ve bought but not good either  the left button sticks so i can t even use the controller right off the bat  if the lt is always pressing down unless i manually pull it back up  it looks like you guys focused way too much time into the looks then into the product  i was so excited to see you made a xbox one controller because i play pc and console  but you let me down this time        
326,5.0,                       this is my favorite xbox controller by far  so happy i got this over the elite  not only is it less expensive but it also has features the elite controller does not offer  the extra triggers and trigger stops are amazing for call of duty and shooters in general  the customization is very fast and easy with the xbox app and rgb is awesome  despite the controller being wired only it really doesn t bother me because the cord is long and helps with latency  this totally changed my gaming experience      
327,4.0,                       i play apex and call of duty     of gaming and had   paddles for a and b  i only used a and played on tactical  i ve had the controller well over   years  the rb and lb were falling apart  kept together with tape and it was time for a new controller i own the astro a   mixamp and the mixamp wire started to fail on me after   years  luckily they gave me one with just the    mm plug in case  well the mixamp wire had a built in chat adapter and i missed is a lot  it was easier to mute my mic  mute party chat and hear the sound effects only i ordered this last night and it came in before i woke up  day   of use and i was in training mode for at least   hrs  found some binds other users have posted online and used some of their binds and just kept it there  i use   out of the   buttons  coming from   paddle  there s so many buttons to get use to  i use the jump button on the opposite from my old controller so most of the time i ve been jumping just to get use to the jump  i ve played a few games and i kept forgetting where my fingers were in a gunfight  after a   hrs my hand were aching because i was trying to grip too hard to reach the paddles on the back  i have to get my hands use to the controller but i won a few games with some decent plays  my aim does not sway as much and i turned my sensitivity up  it was on point  all and all it s a good controller  just wish the paddles were place elsewhere  i m taking a break now but i m about to get back to killing gamers online   lol     
328,5.0,                       big words to give a product right  ye  i know but here s why  every oem controller has one problem and it s that the area under the analog stick sheers away little by little every time leaving dust that could work its way in and under the controller cover possibly screwing with the sensitivity to the stick  the razer wolverine doesn t do that  it has a metal neck on the analog stick that prevents wear and tear  jesus christ what a controller saver  the xyab buttons aren t deep press buttons  they re mouse click buttons meaning less travel and ambiguity  the lb and rb triggers can be adjusted from long to short  i don t have to explain about the   extra macro buttons do i  the only thing you gotta know is that those macro buttons can t have pc shortcuts  they can only use remapped controller buttons  the controller can store   sets of macros and there s a a button to swap between macro sets on the fly my only gripe with the controller  i ve got big hands and the l and r buttons are slanted and make it awkward to press  other than that  nothin with a particular dongle that can we used on any console from switch  ps   xbox  and pc  i use this controller for everything cuz    it s too damn good  i could care less for flashing lights on it  i turned those off  d     
329,3.0,                       pros  the swappable thumbsticks dpad on the ultimate are great  i prefer the taller thumbstick on the left and have been very happy with that feature  the overall feel of buttons and grip is better than a standard xb  controller   more on that later  i ve had no issues with stick drift  which was my primary reason for upgrading to this vs my original xb   the wired connection is secure  the cord itself is of good quality  and it s plenty long enough for any normal use cons  as many other reviewers have said  the extra buttons aren t really useful at all since you can t bind them to anything custom  i use this on my pc and would have hoped there d be a way to make them a bit more useful  after   months of use  the a button on my controller is sticking badly  this is the reason for a   star review  my buttons weren t sticking like this on a standard xb  controller after multiple years of use  so having this issue so quickly is really unimpressive  i have reached out to support and will update this review if i get any kind of useful response  update  cleaning with rubbing alcohol temporarily solves the problem  but i m now basically cleaning it every other day  not the best solution      
330,5.0,                       i never write reviews and ive honestly put this controller through the ringer ive had for over   mnths now and had to share how great this controller is  sure its pricier than microsofts but for good reason youll go though   or   elites before the razer  this is the first product ive endorsed  get the ultimate version you wont regret it      
331,2.0,                       this is a beautiful controller  it feels nice and seems very well made  i would have loved to keep it  but i play on pc and was unable to remap it to my liking  even with  rd party software  if the company allowed it to be actually remappable  i would say this is better than the elite controllers  you re only able to remap the controller with the same buttons    a  b  x  y  triggers  etc  i m not sure why you would want to do this    an easier way to jump  i m not sure  but if you can think of a reason then this controller might be for you      
332,5.0,                       absolutely love this product it s taken me some time to get used to all of its features and to figure out how i want it mapped out but i have been a step ahead of my competitors once i found a comfortable mapping set up      
333,3.0,                       well to start off positive  this controllers quality in the couple days i ve had it has been top notch  zero faults there  but this controller suffers from the same issues i have with the standard xbox one design  and is probably the same reason everyone generally prefers the     controller   which is the joysticks and triggers  they absolutely suck in comparison to the originally     controller design for just about every game i play  the key issues is spring pressure and feedback  just like the original xbox one controllers the triggers have absolutely no resistance which make it difficult to modulate pressure and return  the joysticks on the other hand suffer from too much lever action  the sticks feel longer and fall over way too quickly from its fixed position  which sucks because the initial pressure to get it moving is stiffer than at the extremities of its travel  this is just not good for anything  i use to get away with running at a high level with racing games with the     controllers  now its nearly impossible  modulating brake pressure  acceleration  and turning is snappy and hard to control with this controller  in shooting games it is hard to keep the linear motion accurate thanks to the poor joystick feel the pro s compared to the     controllers is everything that isn t primary  the grips generally feel much better although slightly shorter which i dont really care for  the primary buttons and d pad have much more feel and positive clicks  outside of this  nothing about this xbox one design is better as such i don t recommend this unless you specifically prefer the xbox one controller over the      which i absolutely do not   i might be showing my age here  but what worked for me     years ago  works just fine for me now  these changes don t help me at all  i hope razer makes a xbox     design compared to this one design  there is a reason there are more replica     controllers on the market than these  they are better i d easily give this a   stars if there was any quality problems to note  but luckily razer designed a high quality   bad product  i think they refer to this as  polished doodoo       
334,3.0,                       controller was great  had a small malfunction in the right thumbstick after about   months  not a big deal it s electronics so stuff will happen    the problem is in the customer support  they have ignored several of my emails for a replacement due to warranty  it has been a month and they have been going back and forth with me  i give the controller a   star review and their customer service a   star      
335,3.0,                       as a big fan of razer for the past several years  i really was excited that they made a new controller when i wasn t able to buy their     ones before they went off the store  this thing looked cool and exciting showing off extra buttons  rgb  and mechanical switches on a controller  trade offs being that its wired only but hey this still sounds great  if only razer went the full mile   i fully understand that this was meant to be for an xbox one  i get that  but xbox controllers are commonly used on pc so i figured  the company razer would make their software detect this controller  but pc synapse doesn t recognize it at all  you have to go to the windows store  oh yes  and download the xbox one synapse app on your windows pc to be able to customize this controller  to which you will only be able to rebind the buttons using other controller inputs  they end up just getting in the way at this point unless you are really into it which i wasn t since i just wanted to remap extra features to it well it still has mechanical keys right  and yea it does  its kinda cool  still can t decide if i like or dislike em tho  they make a satisfying little click noise which makes me happy  i use razer greens on my keyboard just for this sensation  but something doesn t feel right  unfortunately i don t own another xbox one controller anymore so i can t compare it directly but i had fond memories of using it with my pc but i m not getting that same vibe  its gotten to the point i use my ps  remote or pro controller more often now  d pad is really bad for platformers but not so bad for arpgs like a souls game   easy to hit   key but not easy to shift direction with it  lastly we got some rgb  makes everything better right  since we are in gimped synapse  we get even less features  bright side the thing remembers what you set it to unlike every other razer product   i guess they accidentally learned what that on board memory they keep selling us is for   its meh  i have mine flash every time rumble features goes off to trigger the people around me overall its an alright controller  but this thing is priced to be an upgraded controller  so unless you are really curious and a razer fan on an xbox   i cant recommend this product  it s pc compatibility is awful  customization is terrible  and i can t even consistently use it over a cheaper product  it s stupid to fanboy but i did like the unique products razer goes out and creates and am willing to pay a bit extra for their darkened edgy razer designs but when they release half assed products like this it burns tl dr   its a hit or miss if you will like it  dont buy it for pc usage its worse than a normal one  rgb bruh  bad dpad  rip razer     
336,5.0,                       loved that they had more controls than the regular series   controller     
337,3.0,                       the controller looks and feels fantastic  alas  i can t use one as it is windows    only even though system requirements on the package state i quote   xbox one   xbox one s   xbox one x   pc with a free usb port   apparently  a free usb is not enough  the controller will not get recognized on windows   while the mapping software drivers can only be downloaded from microsoft win    store  i can t understand the logic behind such a stupid business decision  but it is what it is  goes back to amazon      
338,5.0,                       great christmas gift  my husband says it made every game better  he says its comfortable and easy      
339,1.0,                       avoid this brand  the one the right trigger died in about a week  the replacement from amazon right trigger started sticking   weeks in  contacted razer support and had to supply a video of the trigger which does really show anything  no resolution  was able to still use controller with the trigger stop off  now today   months in controller is dead  will not power on  it was working fine this morning came back later and dead  terrible quality and terrible support      
340,5.0,                       the controller itself is amazing so far  has a great feel and the rubber grips are very nice  the a  b  x  and y buttons have a nice click to them and the joy sticks have the perfect amount of resistance  the d pad has   individual buttons which is another nice thing  great purchase  but the amazon packaging was really rough but the controller package was undamaged and thats the only thing that i was worried about      
341,1.0,                       soon as i got the box in  took it out  plugged it in    lights on the controller blinked once and then it didnt do anything tried using it on multiple systems in different ports and the thing wasnt even being recognized as being plugged in returning this pos and getting something from a different company      
342,3.0,                       the markers on the buttons disappear after some time and there should be much better software for calibrating it also there should be a extension cable with power supply because it s kind of slow on a long cable extension     
343,1.0,                       thumbsticks are too wide to fit fps freeks on  i dont know why companies do this  it is the most annoying thing i can think of about controllers      
344,1.0,                       save your money and time the controller worked for about   minutes before the right joycon started drifting to the left  downloaded the razer control mapping app on my xbox  and while they couldn t do anything about it it confirmed the issue in the focus section of the app      
345,5.0,                       good to hold and works well      
346,4.0,                       complete garbage  was great until about a week ago    suddenly just stopped working  do not buy this piece of junk      
347,2.0,                       the button s  on bottom of controller are in the way you hit them all the time  this controller wont make a you a better shooter  player  cord is to short  lmfao     
348,1.0,                       i was very upset  after only playing on this controller for   days the y button completely gave out  i tried it on xbox  and pc  and in multiple games and it was the same result  the y button failed  i would have asked for replacement but at the time it was over a month out  decided to get a refund      
349,4.0,                       the mechanical switches are amazing and build quality feels very solid  unfortunately i play a lot of racing games and while the bumper is held down and the trigger is pulled they collide  sometimes stopping the trigger from releasing  this wont be a problem if you mostly play anything besides racing games or you do not use the manual gearbox option  but is definitely something to keep in mind if you re playing a lot of forza beamng i m sure this could be solved by a slight modification to the trigger bumper  but most people won t be willing to disassemble and potentially file pieces of their      controller down out of the box      
350,1.0,                       the left thumbstick has broken and the warranty expired by a few days  i bought myself this controller for an early christmas gift and the first time it was listed as undeliverable after christmas  had to call and be on the line with amazon for a while to simply reorder the controller  then i had to wait for a gift card number to be emailed to finally reorder  now as if feb    my warranty is up by   days and the warranty started when i first initially got the item  i d like to have them replace the thumbstick and send back but i have no option for that      
351,5.0,                       there is a v  version out there that is a similar price but doesn t include the back paddles  it s smaller and more ergonomic but i ve yet to try one  so if you want to pay the same price and have more buttons with the razor software for pc  i would choose this again to get a little bit more of my money worth      
352,5.0,                       i was playing rocket league with a ps  controller and found out this razer controller totally changed my game experience making the games more exiting and more easy to play  also is more compatible with windows    than ps  controller  i definitely recommend this product for pc owners      
353,5.0,                       this is my favorite xbox remote  i can really feel the quality  out of all my friends  im probably the best builder because of it  i dont even have any buttons mapped  the quick response buttons and hair pin triggers really improve your game play  it being wired means i never have to worry about my controller dieing on me  the cord is long enough to be able to sit across the room from my tv      
354,4.0,                       bought the razer wolverine tournament edition controller after my elite controller started having issues  the left stick had started to drift up without touching it which became vary annoying  after doing some research i found out that it was a common problem along with grips coming off  after reading about the consistent quality issues i decided it was best to look elsewhere quick review score    i decided to go with the razer wolverine due to it not needing a charge  i sit at large desk where my xbox and monitor are so no need for a wireless controller   also i wanted something that delivered similar performance and features and the razer wolverine is a great choice  joysticks are extremely responsive and i like that the buttons on the controller are integrated  the only downsides to this controller are that i cannot fit my xb  kontrolfreeks on it since the top of the sticks are larger  i have read that ps  or old xbox     kontrolfreeks work so i have ordered them to try as well  the other downsides include the price and how  plasticky  the controller is  for the same price as an xb  elite controller  it should have some metal components  i paid      at the time so i m not that upset overall i am very satisfied with this controller over the elite  i do not consider this an upgrade from the elite  but is a solid alternative to those looking for one  if you can get the wolverine at the same price point as me or lower i think it s a no brainer over the elite      
355,5.0,                       feels great in the hand and the mechanical buttons are very nice  i will update this review over time as far as longevity goes  but right off the bat  it feels more sturdy and durable than any other controller i have tested     
356,5.0,                       it definitely is worth every penny  the sensation in the hands  the built quality  the pressing of the buttons  magnificent gamepad      
357,4.0,                       controller works great  all of the buttons are easily changeable  and work flawlessly  however changing audio settings isnt the best  you cannot individually change the game and chat audio  you can only increase both chad and game audio at the same time  other than that it s a good buy      
358,3.0,                       overall great controller  i have had this for almost   years and it has worked well  only problems were the joysticks sticking and making it very hard to run in fps games like call of duty  the chord that connects it to the xbox is very fragile and if not unplugged after use can deteriorate and eventually stop working  solid controller for casual players but wouldn t reccomend for someone playing all the time      
359,5.0,                       from the grips falling off and bumper breaking on your elite controller by microsoft  if so  stop doing what i did  buy   more elite controllers that had the same defect in   generations  i hate being a peasant  yes peasant  that refuses to evolve from no paddle format controllers i m very spoiled now bleh   the kb m boys already have enough advantages over us  so just slap anything you need to remove your thumbs from a stick for and slap it on the extended  yet different from the elite  back paddles  totaling of   on the back  did i mention no backing out to an app that lets you manipulate the button placement  just a   step press process  and the a is a paddle button  oh  but wait     more button selections next to your bumpers  a total of    yes    extra buttons  you get a button  you get a button  you get a bumper butooooonnnns  one thing tho  can t change or manipulate the flashy color led  oh well        
360,4.0,                       has some issues where you turn on console by the console but the controller will not responded until i unplug and replug the powercord  also some headsets with have a whitenoise in the background im assuming because it is wired  otherwise its a very solid gaming controller better then the standard you by at walmart      
361,4.0,                       first off i love this controller for my xbox  the additional buttons on the inside of the bumpers are great for remapping d pad buttons and allowing for smoother game play since you don t gave to take your thumb off of the analog stick  this means you no longer have to stop moving in a game just to swap weapons or abilities in some games   the controller itself is solid  light weight  buttons do not have to be pressed very hard to be used  definitely a pro level controller the problem is that this is my second controller  the other controller still works  but just like all razer hardware  the usb cables are proprietary which is just stupid  in a world where usb c has the ability to be used on anything  razer still thinks that they have to create proprietary plug shapes for the cable and the actual device itself  so you can t just grab a new usb cable and use it  if i was able to at least purchase a new cable  i would have given this a   start rating  but because they are not available on the razer site  i just got a new one  i mean wake up  even apple got rid of their stupid proprietary ports and plugs and is now universal  this is a serious problem in my mind  i will happily change this to a   start rating if razer fixes this issue      
362,1.0,                       this is the worst controller i have ever owned  it could have been a great controller  but for some reason they have it set up to randomly shut the dpad off   that is correct  you read that right   while playing a game  the dpad just stops functioning  and you have to either swap profiles twice or un plug and replay it in to fix it   after that is done it might only work for a couple of seconds before it shuts off again   now normally  i would contact support to see if there is a settings issue somewhere  but absolutely no support is offered   i tried going through the website and they tell me that they won t give me support   this is the last razer product i will ever buy due to the outrageously bad  feature  and lack of support   i have spent thousands on razer gear over the years  and to be treated like this is absolutely abhorrent   do not buy      
363,5.0,                       works great  just wish the cord was longer      
364,2.0,                       first off  i do like this controller  i like the fact that it has rgb and how the buttons click  but i got this because i was told that i can remap the buttons so rb was rt and lb was lt like you can on the elites  you can only remap the m buttons  i have a disability and it s hard for me to play fps because aim is lt and fire is rt  i have an elite series   but the right bumper doesn t respond the way it should  guess i ll be buying most of my games for the ps  because the remapping ability is built right into the system      
365,1.0,                       the controller will randomly register the x button always and not register the b button  i have to hit the change profile button to get it to go back to normal  it does this on either the blue or the green setting  it makes no difference  it happens randomly and is impossible to predict  practically unusable      
366,1.0,                       bought this controller thinking it was a good value for what it seemed capable of     boy was i wrong   the buttons started sticking after one month and after multiple emails to support  i have received no response  this was the worst investment i have ever made and i encourage all of you to look elsewhere  this is a scam  the controller is so cheap and i had a feeling after the buttons clicked instead of pressed  that it would not last long  biggest waste of       do not waste your time or money      
367,5.0,                       way better then the elite if you don t mind a cabled controller     
368,5.0,                       i love it     love time controller player  i ve had them all  this is exactly what you re looking for  im a    s baby  just hear me out  get it      
369,3.0,                       great controller would have given more stars but the xbox logo on mine is tilted to the side and my ocd won t allow me to rate it higher      
370,1.0,                       i ve had this controller since january   st played with it almost daily and it s already malfunctioning and the buttons are not reading when pressed and at the same time i bought a second cheaper controller for my nephew and it s working perfectly fine still  my window for replacement is already closed and basically it s just a trash controller good luck finding something i researched a lot and thought i made a good decision but i guess not     
371,5.0,                       i ve used several controllers with mappable buttons and triggers  etc   razor s wolverine is the best   it is ergonomically excellent  middle and third finger triggers fit right  the lower left right bumpers are convenient and the rubber handles make for a sure and comfortable grip   the app for xbox is self explanatory and the duel profile swap button is handy   i ve found the wired connection helps in pvp games such as for honor  ghost war and cod where latency can be an issue   it is worth the price      
372,5.0,                       the buttons seem appropriately sensitive and i like the weight of a wired controller and that if i drop it for whatever reason i can catch it by the wire  this controller isn t hard wired but the wire clips in with an additional retainer as opposed to just the mini usb plug what i don t like   there are a bunch of extra buttons and maybe that s cool for somebody but i think it s dumb and i accidentally hit them all the time  it s even more dumb that they can only duplicate the functions of the other buttons and seem more sensitive than the  hair trigger  setting on the bumpers  the number of times i ve accidentally jumped over things in the division to my demise would boil the blood  my buddy  who prefers wireless controllers and has to listen to my expletives  always says  i told you to go with the fancy microsoft controller also  the chroma whatever they call it light is really dumb  why people want their computers to light up will always baffle me  the light is so bright that it s distracting when it s night and there is no ambient light  you can install a program on your computer to manage this light and reassign buttons but i don t want more stuff running on my machine personally  i ve always found the classic microsoft wired controllers to work well but now  apparently  you can t get decent wired controllers anymore  batteries and charging are annoying and i now have to pay over      to solve a problem that cost    just a few years ago anyway  this controller is decent and i d buy it again knowing the options i ve got but it s gimmicky and over engineered      
373,5.0,                       best controller i ve ever used i bought a second one on sale  the extra buttons are so comfortable and well built  i honestly prefer this over my elite controller      
374,1.0,                       disliked it hugely because my rb button and my a button as well  didn t even own it for one day fully and had problems in less than a few hours of gameplay  not worth it  save your money  i ve had cheaper wired controllers that lasted longer than that      
375,1.0,                       chief among them are the chat or i should say inability to control the chat  first whomever you are talking to and whether it be in a party or team chat will hear a loud buzzing and it is most definitely the controller  because the same headset with two other controllers does not present this buzzing  also you cannot control the headset volume and the slider function so you cannot control how much chat volume versus game volume is in your headset  the xbox does not recognize a headset plugged into the controller fully  it does seem to halfway because the headset icon is in the upper right hand corner but it will still not let you control it where it should  see pictures  in addition to the aforementioned  the back buttons are actually hard to reach      
376,1.0,                       i m having an issue with my a button not returning fully to the top position  purchased under   months ago  a little disappointed considering the cost      
377,2.0,                       buyer beware  this controller does not support wireless despite the product information page saying compatibility  wireless only native wireless connection support with xbox one  no receiver required   pc compatible via microsoft wireless adapter  not included this is extremely misleading and lead to a purchase i would not have otherwise made otherwise a decent controller although not really worth the price tag      
378,2.0,                       i decided to go out of my comfort zone and buy this controller because i thought it looked great  it was awesome for the first few months     i have owned this controller now for   months pros  face buttons  abxy  are mechanical and feel amazing  one of the best qualities of the controller  thumbsticks are very responsive and interchangeable and the leds look phenomenal  also it being wired makes the input lag almost non existent  and bye bye batteries cons  after less than a year the mic port is now not functioning well and causes my headsets to pop and crackle in parties  and i cant hear the left side of my headset unless i hold the jack in a precise spot  and i tested other controllers and the headset works perfectly fine  cant use the back paddles at all  i dont have the ridiculously long fingers that this controller requires in order to comfortably use the back paddles  dont try to reinvent the wheel    the placement of the paddles on the elite controller are perfect  these run down the direct center of the controller and you can barely touch it with the tips of your fingers  the second set of bumpers kind of suffer the same fate where as they are just not conveniently placed for use consensus  i really want to love this thing  but the fact that the mic port quit functioning properly on a     dollar controller not even a year after purchase is what killed me the most  the face buttons more than made up for the lack of use on the back paddles  i wish they would resolve this and allow me to replace the controller  but unfortunately i do not believe this will be the case do yourself a favor and buy the elite    it may not have flashy led s but the ability to use the back paddles will more than make up  if paddle use doesn t matter and you are just solely looking for a better feeling controller  this one is great  minus the mic port      
379,5.0,                       i love it no issues with it  super durable way better then my xbox elite controller and the razor wolverine ultimate customization is pretty endless it s great  no issues or problems      
380,5.0,                       i ve had several     xbox one controllers  but i think this one might be my favorite  many of my previous controllers had problems with the triggers becoming unresponsive over time or the bumpers breaking getting stuck  i ve had this controller for a while now and it s still functioning as well as it did when i took it out of the box  it took a day or two to get used to the feel of it  but once i did it was great  the extra buttons on the back of the controller are a nice touch  if for whatever reason i have to get a second or replacement controller  i will most likely be coming back to this      
381,2.0,                       i got this controller and i loved it  the additional buttons are superb and it really upped my game  the joystick feels great  and the buttons were wonderful until   weeks ago   months after purchase the left bumper doesn t  click  anymore and it sticks occasionally  no problem  the controller has a   month warranty so i submit a request on sunday of last week  i wait   days which is how long they say they will respond in  and nothing  friday rolls around and i get a survey questionaire about my service but never any service i submit another one and tomorrow will be day    no word  nothing  for     bucks i thought i was investing in some quality controller    months isn t even a long time and i ve had cheap    dollar controllers last me years  it s a shame too because it s a great controller when it works      
382,3.0,                       great controller but the triggers seem get squishy pretty quick on the   i ve had     
383,5.0,                       nice     
384,5.0,                       we ve had every flavor of remote    all the teens in the household state this one is the best overall   recommended      
385,5.0,                       love how my sticks haven t started drifting  prior to buying i went through several of the controllers you buy from gamestop  this has already saved me   and i will definitely buy another in the future  obviously the paddles and mechanism for locking the triggers are just a luxury      
386,5.0,                       this is definitely a competitive quality controller  and for a complete casual like myself it took a little while to really start getting used to it that said  it s absolutely worth it   the controller is solidly built  and the little added features like an a and b button on the underside of the grips makes it easy to access the controls on those buttons without having to take your thumbs off the control sticks  honestly  it s a neat feature that i didn t realize i wanted or needed until i tried it  and now i m glad i have it      
387,5.0,                       i love to fact this controller is very easy to setup  there is a xbox one app specifically for this controller  you can setup profiles for every game in your collection  also  ships with a case for the controller and usb cable  this is the best controller you will ever see      
388,5.0,                       great remote  i looked into multiple remotes including scuff and xbox elite  through people i have talked to with both  i decided to get this one  buttons on bottom are perfect both in placement and response as well as the ones on the index fingers  the index finger and front buttons are all clicky like a computer mouse  wire doesn t bother me  in fact i prefer it  only complaints are that it is hard to put all the items in the travel case and there is no long rounded joystick option      
389,2.0,                       at first i liked it but the longer i used it the less i cared to use it   if you have large hands this is not the controller for you   the bumper buttons at the top are too close together   i keep hitting them by mistake   but the biggest problem is the lag   there is some serious trigger lag   the materials used to make it are quality  opposite of scuf    cheapo  but the response of the triggers are terrible      
390,1.0,                       for this expensive of a product i expected better quality  half the time i click the buttons the games don t register a click even though i feel the click  either i got a defect product  or it s garbage        
391,3.0,                       i bought this because someone i lent out my elite   controller to broke it  this is a good controller  i like the clickiness of the a b x y buttons  which gives a satisfying response  i like the rgb light though i wish it were programmable to light up with the rest of my razer rgbs on my pc  there s many things about this controller that are bad about it  however the extra keys are only remappable to other buttons on the controller  if you were hoping to press keys on your keyboard using the extra triggers  then you ll be sad if you lose one of the small thumbsticks by accident  there is absolutely no way to get a new one  there s no third party sticks anywhere  talking to razer support will have them tell you to just buy new ones from their website  which there are none  many people on their forums are complaining about this  the only one available is the  long module   which is missing both the standard and ball top thumbsticks  so if you re a person that never loses sticks held on by magnets  then this may be the controller for you      
392,1.0,                       bought this controller back in may and the right thumb stick has already gone out  buttons failing and seems to have a mind of its own  while playing fps  the weapon will start drifting  firing on its own and and not moving in the direction that the thumb stick has moved to    months out of a controller for the price that was paid is a complete rip off  if i wanted to keeping buy controllers  i would by the cheap ones cause they would last at lease   months      
393,5.0,                       if i didn t have this controller  there s no way i would ve made top    on na servers in pubg  i love this controller      
394,5.0,                       i got this controller refurbished for    bucks  totally worth it  previously i was playing on a regular xbox controller for basically all my gaming  i tried the ps  controller here and there as well but this is by far a better option than either of the stock options for consoles  i bought this after i got a dedicated gaming pc and wanted a controller with the additional paddles and a more premium feeling to it  i can say having used it both with my pc and xbox that it is well worth the price  some people complain about the buttons being hard to push but i barely use those anymore as the paddles mainly replace them  the trigger stops are nice for the shorter travel and the wire is long enough to reach your console from basically anywhere in the room   the rubber pieces on the sticks are thicker and much more durable than a stock controller  and i m pretty sure the sticks can be replaced when they wear out  the set up was easy and painless  no issues with drivers or any other problems  added benefit is i never run out of batteries mid game and have to scramble to replace them cons  i would say the additional set of bumpers included right next to the traditional bumpers on the controller are a little hard to reach for integration into a fps style game  that being said i have not really put much effort into using  learning them and have only had the controller for a couple months  the idea that those would replace a second set of paddles on the back is a little laughable as they would require the use of your fingers you would use for aiming and shooting conclusioni would recommend you get this controller if you are looking for something that is better than a stock console controller for your pc or xbox  the ergonomics are great  the zero lag and extra paddles definitely give you the opportunity to bring your gameplay up a notch  it feels very sturdy and well built and for the investment should outlast a regular controller     times   i wouldn t get this controller to replace something with   sets of paddles on the back or if you intend to play on the playstation  i also wouldn t get this controller if you feel like you absolutely must have a wireless controller or say have a   ft    ft gap between your couch and gaming station   quite unlikely      
395,5.0,                       let me start with that i also own the elite using both factory and scuf paddles  so this is a comparison this controller blows the elite out of the water  the weight on this controller is significantly less than the elite so it s more comfortable  the button placement style means almost   accidental pushes of the buttons  elite owners know the pain   wolverine is a corded controller but comes with plenty of cable to reach the xbox  wolverine requires an app to be downloaded to your xbox to customize the controller  app is extremely easy to use and almost every minor detail of the controller can be custom configured overall  i would repurchase this controller again  and over the elite      
396,5.0,                       pic  razor controllerpic  xbox series x controller  for comparison only pic  astro headset doo dad  for review example only controller is great and noticeably more responsive  however  it will not connect the a doo dad  pic   shows a astro doo dad  with out the doo dad your sound will be sub par you can connect a headset to a xbox x controller for sound while also playing on your razor      
397,1.0,                       how do i contact the seller   i am having an issue with my controller  i bought this for my little brother and not it s not working after having it for such a short time  i m not too familiar with xbox but i am familiar with ps and they seem pretty similar  you press the logo button and the system turns on and you play  can the seller please contact me so we can resolve this issue  thank you so much      
398,4.0,                       so far ive had it a year and no issues   no drifting nothing is falling apart and i use it about   hours a day everyday grips on the handles are great  button click is amazing  the trigger stops i didnt think i would notice but going back to a regular xbox controller with a full squishy trigger  ew i have the tournament edition so no binding all buttons   just able to bind a paddle to an existing button but i was ok with that my only complaint is when you re buying a controller this expensive let us be able to rebuild clean replace things easier  if this thing was a bit more modular it would be perfect  maybe a grip on the triggers as an option      
399,5.0,                       at the bottom will be the pros and cons if you want to skip to that they got rid of the buttons on the back from the first version  which is great for me   the wildcat was one of my favorite controllers  and i did like having the option to add the buttons on the back if i wanted to   but  i found the buttons on the back to be a tad excessive in the end  with the razer wolverine v  you get the extra bumpers without the nuisance of anything getting in the way of your grip   the material they used around the grips makes it easy to hold the controller firmly  it felt awkward at first due to the grips formation  but quickly got over that    drift on the controller even when i removed the dead zones   this is a hard quality to find  no matter the controller from my experience if you are looking to buy a controller i would highly recommend pros  based on my personal preferences    drift  buttons feel great and responsive   not sure if i got lucky with the   drift on the joysticks  haven t seen any complaints about it yet   comfortable  and the grips make it easy to hold the controller firmly   i really like the material they used  they removed the buttons on the back of the controller used in the previous versions  liked the option to have them at first  but in the end i found them to be a tad excessive  best controller for the price    powera s fusion pro controller would be a close  nd for      but it falls short in my opinion   it s not a bad option though if you like the elite s paddle style   you will need to download the razer application to program the buttons as well as tweak any other settings to your liking   this applies to pc and xbox users   application can be found in the microsoft store  possible cons  depending on your preference  none of these bother me in the slightest  doesn t have interchangeable joysticks or buttons you aren t able to remove the cable from the controller  does have the breakaway towards the usb side  cable s material is standard  and not the mesh you normally see from a razer product that s it  hope this info was helpful   like the direction they took with this one   simplified and refined would be a good way to describe this controller     extra buttons are all i need   and i love the placement of the buttons next to the bumpers   i will update the cons list later depending it s longevity   if it s like the wildcat in the regard i have high hopes   that controller is   years old and still works lol    sorry if this review was too long  i do not write reviews very often      
400,4.0,                       very nice controller the buttons in the back are placed perfect      
401,1.0,                       analog sticks are sloppy and innacurate  you have to set the deadzone in most games so that your camera isnt constantly panning  you cannot change or turn off the colors on the controller without downloading software and making an account  on pc   and it messes up games whenn you are using a mouse and keyboard to play if its still connected  ive gotten killed numerous times in pubg because this controller was still plugged in and got me stuck in walk mode for some reason  highly recommend you do not buy this  the stock xbox one controller is much better     
402,1.0,                       started having issues with the sticks  pressing the buttons on the back sometimes doesn t register  feels like a quality controller but it has drift from the box  better off with a amaxon basic controller but that feels cheap but works better than this      
403,1.0,                       this thing is a mess   the sound doesn t work  yes  i checked the settings    the buttons    oh man  the buttons are horrendous   i was really hoping that this would  be the one    sorry to say  it s not   will have to return it i don t recommend this product to anyone serious about their gaming accessories      
404,4.0,                       awesome controller  will be getting another soon  unfortunately  my first had a minor misshap  tiny bump  from a little fall which lead to a broken bumper  completely ruined  wish it was more durable for something so expensive gameplay wise  superior to the microsoft xbox controller in every way  truly the top elite as far as elite controllers go      
405,3.0,                       i bought this controller after my gen   xbox elite controller started getting unacceptable left stick drift and had broken lb twice  i wanted the gen   elite  but i decided to give this a shot  my main game is rocket league  so this isn t from the perspective of a shooter main i ve only had it about a month so i can t speak to it s durability  but i will update the review if something becomes a problem   see update at bottom as far as features of the controller  it is packed  there are   programmable buttons in addition to the default xbox layout    on the back and   on the top  this is  tournament ready   so these buttons can only be mapped to existing xbox functions  there is no option for keyboard shortcuts or macros  you can also use  agile  and  focus  if you are into shooters  the chroma lighting is cool but obviously purely fluff  i made it as dim as possible the build quality seems good  it doesn t have the heft of an elite controller  which is more from not having a battery than it is from cheaper materials  the light weight makes it very comfortable for long gaming sessions  and the cable is high quality with a breakaway design in case it gets yanked comfort ergonomics are great  but took getting used to  the elite controller has it s paddles positioned on the back of the grips  so you wrap your fingers around the controller to hold it  that is more natural to me  so the elite controller fit right into my flow without any problems  the wolverine positions the back paddles in the middle of the controller  which means you cannot wrap your fingers all the way around the grips and still use the buttons  this took a lot of getting used to  but now that i am comfortable with it i actually find it encourages a much more light and deft grip on the controller  the elite encourages you to squeeze tightly  and i had to actively fight that urge to maintain quicker and lighter presses  the wolverine forces you to hold the controller with less force  and as such my comfort and dexterity have increased after the switch along the same lines  the buttons are super clicky and tactile  feeling more like a mouse press than a button as others have said  this also encourages lighter and faster touches  as opposed to the forceful mashing that i was used to on the mushy membrane elite buttons so overall it is a supremely comfortable controller to use for long gaming sessions once you have gotten used to the required grip  and it has all the features you could want for a  tournament ready  controller  here s to hoping it doesn t break tomorrow update  so it didn t break tomorrow per se  but it definitely hasn t held up well  within the first   months the right stick started to drift pretty bad  in rocket league that only impacts camera angle  so it wasn t the end of the world and i kept playing with it  i had pretty bad stick drift on my left stick on my gen   elite controller after about a year which was way worse to deal with  about   months ago the bottom left button on the back of the controller started feeling looser than normal  as of today it has fully broken and cannot be pressed anymore  i will probably just re map that button to the one above that i didn t use  but it s not a good sign that within a year i ve had a button break and pretty massive stick drift also  after about   months of use and after switching to a wireless keyboard and mouse  i m starting to regret buying a wired controller  there isn t a noticeable difference in latency and while the lighter weight is nice  the cord makes it about as cumbersome as a heavier wireless controller all things considered unfortunately  poor quality control seems to be a requirement for  pro  grade controllers  xbox elite gen    anything scuf  this one from razer  so there isn t a clear winning alternative  if you are ok with a wire and are ok with accepting the potential for stick drift or the occasional broken button  this is still an excellent controller ergonomically and i love the clicky buttons  i d be way more harsh    stars total  if it wasn t such a common thing amongst these types of controllers across the spectrum  i just wish i didn t have to expect those problems when paying double the normal rate for a controller      
406,1.0,                       after using this controller for a couple months i have come back to write my review  overall i like the button feel  feels like mouse click instead of goo like a regular controller  my issue though is the fact that it needs to be plugged into the xbox and if you use a wired mic it has feedback constantly  whether you use a chat mixer or not no matter what it has got horrible feedback that people i play with can not stand  also all the controller buttons the paint has worn right off   unfortunately this controller is unusable for online unless you re going to buy a wireless mic      
407,4.0,                       this controller has continued to exceeded my expectations  it is the best pro controller i have ever used  and that goes to say above the microsoft elite  scuf  and powera controllers  and not to mention it has a resonable price tag to go with it  it feels nice and sleek in the hands and is very comfortable and easy to use  not to mention easy to get used to  the learning curve is not steep at all with this one  the companion software app  razer controller setup for xbox  which can be found on the app store in the microsoft store is also very easy to use and very much appreciated  this controller is very reliable and gives you the edge you are looking for when it comes to fps  apex  call of duty  etc   or any game for that matter  you won t go wrong with this one      
408,3.0,                       it d be alright a half the price   i was expecting programmable buttons  but the additional buttons can only mimick other buttons   sometimes the a button doesn t register   the switch to shorten the throw of the triggers is nice      
409,5.0,                       my son loves it for xbox one and he is a major gamer   he loves not having to replace batteries all the time and it has all the special buttons to do the extras   he would definitely buy it again      
410,5.0,                       love the weight and how smooth the buttons are      
411,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          haven t had this controller very long  it is a amazing product  unfortunately  today it s moving on its own  i hope its just a defected controller  i hope the second one doesn t do it        
412,5.0,                       excellent response  joysticks are snappy and the button action is crisp  i m the type that hates the lag of a wireless controller  and this one is far superior to using wireless  i ve not yet programmed the paddles since i m finding the standard layout s responsiveness is sooooooo much better than standard wireless units      
413,2.0,                       the markings on the buttons wore off after about a month and something broke with one of the joysticks within   months   i m getting a standard controller to replace it      
414,5.0,                       i find it hard to play games without it  i lost still and i use one hand to play  without the smaller size and additional reprogrammable shoulder buttons  gaming would be nearly impossible on dinner games  i love razer  inclusion is the key to health and text had helped me be included in a great community     
415,1.0,                       brought from amazon warehouse   description said some damage to the orginal packaging but everything was in working condition  i received the conroller today and found that the packaging was peferctly fine and intact but the controller itself was broken  be careful buying from the wearhouse  dont believe the description of the product  only buy if you want to be dissapoinnted  i was lied to and stole from  i would recommend zero stars on this purchace if possible  im by no means saying anything bad about the product  this is about how the item was listed and sold     
416,5.0,                       i bought the razer wolverine ultimate chroma controller back in january      and it is still my main controller for xbox  i specifically wanted a wired controller because i have a habit of letting the batteries die and during long play sessions  having to disconnect from party  change controllers or plug in mid game is annoying  i play at my desk on a monitor  so i have no need for wireless  and have gone through many standard controllers to warrant the need for something more durable  the wire is long enough though to reach your couch i did think about the elite controller but i was worried about the overall build and materials  and the prices were jacked up since it was sold out for a long time  i ended up going with the wolverine ultimate and after almost a year of some serious gaming  it still looks and feels like the first day i got it over build is excellent  i ve taken good care of it and it doesn t leave my desk  the rage is real and so far has overcome  the metal triggers and bumpers are still in good condition after a year of use  a difference between the standard controllers which after some long use  my right bumper would always be worn in and hard to feel the response  the joysticks are also very durable and still have that grip that would usually be worn in and or torn on the standard controllers   i like the rounded tip as my left joystick and have no issues with the joysticks ever falling out  i use the button d pad instead of the    no issues with that popping out either  there is a huge difference in the abxy buttons compared to the standards  they really do feel like mouse clicks almost  i really like this but at first touch i was skeptic  they react and respond quicker  doesn t have that squishy feel  i did own one of the new premium controllers and like the standards  after a few weeks of use  the a button would get stuck   gta  rd    the wolverine ultimate really nailed it with the durability after a year of use  all mechanicals working like i first bought it although the price might be high  i think this product pays for itself  i would go through   fresh controllers a year to have them unusable  and they re on average      not including the battery pack  i think this controller can go through more years before showing any wear or tear  according to their website  my one year of use really backs all that negative testing they did with the controller  if something were to happen with mine in the future  i most certainly be considering buying the wolverine ultimate chroma controller again side note rgb color is sick  the case is super premium  the app works well and not hard to navigate the x logo home button is slightly crooked when i first got it  but i couldn t let that stupid cosmetic error justify a star      
417,4.0,                       i ve used a lot of controllers and this one is pretty good  the buttons on the back are excellent  the lightbar is bright and looks nice  the abyx buttons are much different than a normal controller  they basically  click  like a computer mouse  it takes awhile to get used to them the d pad is great  one slight interesting note is that the left d pad button seems to be a bit louder than the rest   hopefully that s alright the extra buttons by the bumpers on the top are essentially useless  i have no clue why they re there  they re almost impossible to reach and to me it s a total waste of money and resources for them to include them my biggest problem with this controller by far are the bumpers  there s almost zero feedback  they feel almost like the triggers  there s no click  there s no audible or touch feedback  this is a massive problem as i use this controller to play rocket league and i have the drift button set as left bumper  unless you re actively turning in the game  there s no visual feedback on screen to show that the button is held down  so i m in a situation where the game and controller are not giving any feedback at all on whether or not i m using the handbrake in the game until i actually try to turn  and in rocket league  that can result in a lot of problems quickly  if you think i m exaggerating this  it s already caused multiple problems where i tried to quickly turn and i do a normal wide turn because the button actually wasn t read as being pressed another small gripe is there feels to be an extremely faint uneven spot under the left analog stick  very very faint but it feels like it has a slight bump or something  it s hardly noticable but the right stick feels smoother in comparison  which leads me to believe that there s a slight flaw in my left stick  again  super faint but it could be the result of poor quality control overall  i m happy with the controller  microsoft s controllers are a joke when it comes to longevity so we ll see how this one holds up  the d pad alone is worth moving away from microsoft s awful designs  although they improved it with the series x  i still prefer this d pad  so i d still pick it over the series x controller   however do note this is a wired controller whereas the xbox controllers have bluetooth       
418,5.0,                       i have big  strong hands  and i play sweaty rocket league matches  the regular xbox one controller left analog sticks break down over time   i know because i ve gone through several of them  the razer wolverine however is made of stern stuff  i don t care for the led lighting  although maybe it s cool for a party trick or something  but the functionality of this controller is fantastic  the buttons are really nice to press and give a subtle click feedback  the analog controls seem completely linear and are easy to use for fine movements  i have no complaints about the software  it seems perfectly functional for what it is  it s easy to create and switch profiles for different games  all in all  it feels like the nicest xbox one controller ever  if you re comfortable with the standard controller but want more precision and durability  this is the controller you want  i ve never bought a razer product before but i will be much more likely to consider the brand in the future based on how great this controller is      
419,3.0,                       build quality is top notch  but it claims you can remap the buttons  you can only remap buttons to other controller buttons  not to pc keyboard  or even as their own controller buttons in game settings don t get if you want a fully programmable pc controller     
420,1.0,                       i purchased this controller on                the date of this review is                the past   or   weeks the  a  button has been automatically double jumping in rocket league and finally today the button stopped working  it s a great controller when it works  but who wants to spend       on a controller that is only going to last a year  i take really good care of my gear and play games about    to    hours a week  if this would ve been my fault due to the fact i don t take care or am hard on my gear then that would be a different story  for being a  tournament  grade controller i don t think it held up  i would ve been happy with   to   years of use out of this  but   year and almost   months doesn t cut it  the warranty is only a year  so time to purchase a different one      
421,5.0,                       absolutely hands down the best controller on the market    the rgb really gives it the best game feeling   the abxy buttons sound and feel like mouse clicks    the programmable bottoms are supper useful and feel better then scuf and the elite controller   and     the grips and analog sticks are also very nice and you can replace the sticks and d pad  very important  it is very good that it is wired  wired means faster connection and less delay which is very important in gaming  the cord is long and i even have to use rubber bands to make it shorter     
422,2.0,                       extreme stick sway on left analog stick  and i just got it today  it renders the controller nearly unusable      
423,5.0,                       love this controller  and i actually prefer the buttons on the back compared to the triggers on the ultimate or the  elite  software mapping has worked flawless and never had an issue  hands down the most ergonomic pro controller  seriously  this is night and day more comfortable than the ultimate edition      
424,5.0,                       best xbox one controller there is  great quality  a lot of reprogrammable buttons and wonderful rgb     
425,5.0,                       i was not sure what i was getting myself into going after this over an xbox elite   controller   but i am very happy with my purchase  straight away the led light is very bright and beautiful  i love how responsive all the buttons are  and most of all how comfortable the controller is to hold in my hands  i have only played for about   or   hours so far  but this is a product i will be recommending to all my gamer friends          
426,3.0,                       the controller is high quality but the buttons on the underside are hard to press and i wasn t able to get used to it  i had to go back to my xbox elite controller because the paddles on it are so much easier to use      
427,1.0,                       xbox button jams up  one of the paddles doesn t work  overall waste of money in my opinion     
428,3.0,                       i decided to buy this controller after my three normal controllers broke within   years  my first elite controller series   in just under a year  and my elite series   in just   months  i decided that this controller would be my end game controller with fingers crossed and knock on wood  i love this controller so far  and my big hands make the paddles on my ultimate placed perfectly with more comfort and dependability than both my elite controllers ever did  by the end of the rest of day one after work i played with it  i was already playing better than i ever did with the elite controllers   the only problem i noticed and panicked about a bit was that it had very slight stick drift out of the box at times  although nowhere near all the time  i had gotten this for games like r   which my elite series   needed a left stick deadzone of     and still had stick drift  or even didn t register forward movement of the left thumbstick  this controller was supposed to be my solution to dealing with stick drift entirely  it s easily manageable and can only be replicated inconsistently  but it makes me worry about if i just spent another      for a controller that will break in just a few months   i don t know if it s just something that won t progress  and that i should ask for a replacement  or send it back leaving myself with the worst stick drifting option being my series    i don t know if there s even warranty for it that i have or not  and for how long if so  the stick drift has followed me on every controller since getting my first xbox one  and i much prefer this controller to any i ve had before it even if my series   came out the box without problems  i ve had this for   days now  and it s difficult to replicate the left thumbstick drift  but i ve found it to only occur upon moving the thumbstick down  it also seems like it could be very sensitive as the pressure from my thumb tapping it lightly might cause it from time to time  or just with it resting on the stick  if it stays this way i can definitely reccomend it  but we ll see down the line i guess update  the controller has a habbit of glitching out my mic and turning my voice into a glitching robot that is hard to understand at random  but frequent times  the controller rarely  but sometimes doesn t turn on when i turn my xbox one x on  it takes a few tries of unplugging and re plugging it into either the controller  or the xbox itself to fix  it sometimes doesn t register presses of the under buttons  and the two extra front buttons  but it s extremely rare  all of the buttons have held up rather nicely  and the thumbsticks still have no stick drift with heavy use  the undergrip is still in mint condition  the rgb is still perfect  and i find that the paddles  except those really rare times  work perfectly with exceptional responsiveness  the biggest issue i ve had so far was the mic issue  for something like rainbow six  siege  this is a huge issue for me as i ll be in a ranked game and it will glitch out every once in a while every few games or so  not even my broken elites have done something like this  an upside is that the ever so slight stick drift is completely gone somehow  it s an exceptional controller  but the mic issue is a big new one for the games i play  so i ll have to bump the stars from   to   sadly due to my experience paying           for this controller and having an issue like this      
429,1.0,                       when it came in one button was a little wobbly  couldn t figure out how to write company  controller worked thou    months later it didn t  never had a controller break before years of use  and i never paid this much for a controller no drops or slams  just manufacturering goof  which happens  but there is no contact info  and what they give me i don t get answered on   i went with this instead of scuff cause the price and scuffs sticks go bad  but atleast they can sell you new ones  this thing breaks  just throw it away   looking into scuffs now  if company finally gets ahold of me after this review i will update    but  choose another option  this controller is the best  just cust serv  and poor manufacturering have it moving into to  nd or  rd against an inferior controller that cost more  unless you want to buy   a year         got even worse    paddle button just snapped off     go with scuff    and bever ever buy renewed from amazon    it has all failed     percent of the time     scuff sticks go bad but they make those easy to replace     razer controller has been by far the most fragile  and the most expensive      worst thing i have ever bought online      months and half the controller is broken     and amazon makes sellers make good on crap products  but doesnt practice what they preach          never again     
430,2.0,                       i know i am bad at games  but this controller made me really bad  it would input on its own  and sometimes just lock up and would need to unplug and re plug to get buttons to work  started to do the warranty  and razor wanted a video  tried to take a video of the issue and now it wont even power on   when it worked   for the week  i really like it      
431,1.0,                       i bought this controller last march  it was amazing  best aftermarket controller i have used and i love  repeat love the extra button placements and ability to map them to your liking  as well as have two different mapping settings that changes as easily as a single button press however  after about   months of daily use  an hour or so a day  it would randomly start disconnecting itself  it is a wired controller   everything still hooked up and it would just disconnect and you would get the message on screen  please reconnect controller   i have tried everything i could to solve the issue  but the problem being  i has to be the cord  as my controller has always been handled and taken care of with extreme care  i reached out to the company  and unfortunately they weren t even accepting emails   the customer service is actually non existent  and that s a real bummer  and for that reason alone i will not buy another of their products  nor would i recommend their products to anyone      
432,1.0,                       the wolverine ultimate is advertised to be xbox and pc compatible  it is not even remotely the latter  i purchased this to run a flightsim game on the pc and find that  by design  this device cannot be seen in the razer synapse software  their configuration tool  because it is apparently  tournament certified  and thus prohibited from assigning keybinds in the manner i have come to expect from every other razer mouse and keypad i have purchased  keymapping is limited to shuffling the few existing keybinds it already has  this purchased needlessly wasted my time  a device crippled in this manner should be advertised as  tournament only  or  limited options for non tournament players  rather than the misleading lable of  ultimate   it has been packed up and processed as a return bad form razer  i expected better from you      
433,5.0,                       this is a very nice controller and it works well with my computer      
434,2.0,                       i had the predecessor of this controller  razer wildcat  which was awesome  i thought for more money and more back buttons this would have been better  i was wrong  if you can find the wildcat  get it  they changed the buttons on the back on the wolverine and it doesn t feel natural like the wildcat      
435,4.0,                       this is a great controller  i love the paddles and the feel  however  i was far more invested in a normal xbox controller than i thought  that being said  if i wasn t  i would have stuck with this controller a long time ago  i am returning only to get money back to purchase an elite  again  this is due to my heavy use of the base xbox one controller  i am a bit dependent on this style   feel side note  the buttons on this controller are a bit harder to press than xbox   at least i felt this way      
436,3.0,                       face buttons started not working well  love the controller other than that  i have it   stars after giving it an initial   star because after taking it apart and spraying air in it the buttons are working ok  controller was a mess to take apart and now the sides don t fit correctly but my controller works at least so i m not too upset     
437,3.0,                       nice controller  to bad right out of the box the left joystick has horrendous stick drift  its low left and probably the worst drift i have ever dealt with  even my   elites had drift but nothing as bad as this  hopefully my replacement is actually working when i get it     
438,4.0,                       i ve been having the controller for about   years now and ive used it for both pc and xbox one  well since last year the cables been going out on little by little  it used to sit on a platform where their would be no movement what so ever but after i got a pc it s been dangling and the gravity pulling the usb end down really messed it up to the point that it would just turn off unprovoked out of nowhere  today was its last day  i was fiddling with it for hours to no prevail  still an amazing controller nonetheless but the durability of it is not up to what i ve experienced with razed products  and i want to note there is no visible stress on the cable nor any rips in the sleeving that surrounds it which is the reason i m disappointed in the durability      
439,5.0,                       if you like a quality controller with a great warranty this controller is the best  i broke a button on one  sent it in to razer and got a new one within a few weeks  love this controller and company     
440,5.0,                       feels absolutely juicy and is very durable  the whole controller is absolutely a quality product  you will not be disappointed  but beware  the paddles will take getting used to  if you have smaller hands  the paddles might be a stretch to reach  but the abxy buttons are amazing  and feel and sound like the click of a mouse  super satisfying and def beats the elite controller      
441,3.0,                       i own a razer wildcat and have had it for three years  after heavy use  one of the trigger stops no longer worked properly  being that i loved that controller  i figured the wolverine would be a great pickup to its credit  it still is a quality controller  though i have to wonder about some design decisions  once again the triggers and sticks feel great  however the abxy buttons have a significantly longer travel distance compared to the wildcat  even though they have a satisfying click  they are simply harder to press  oddly  they ve gone the opposite way with the dpad buttons  they re closer to a terrible mac butterfly keyboard than the satisfying clicky buttons on the wildcat  the point being  on the wildcat  the tactile feel and required pressure is the same on both the dpad and abxy buttons but is different on the wolverine for no reason i could live with that if not for one fatal flaw the wolverine has customization options  moreso than the wildcat  which could only be customized on the controller itself which was somewhat handy   but it is not editable on the pc  i do not own an xbox one so i was unable to control any of the button settings  like turning the back buttons off  or turn off the annoying led s unless i was able to use an xbox one  for a      controller this seems a real insult to someone that has owned multiple razer products to not be able to customize it from any of the razer pc apps  especially since they have created an app     just for the xbox  for that reason i returned the product and will continue to use my wildcat      
442,1.0,                       right bumper weak failed click back way too soonpurchased april first bumper lost click backupdate nov      lb lost click backnow its difficult to playleft and right bumpers are now to sensitive and activate on slightest touchpurchased a new ms controller to replace thisdisappointed i liked it but it became defective faster than a ms controller  that s a feat     
443,3.0,                       controller came as expected  feels great in the hand  and worked as it should         for about a month and then the right joystick started ghosting and making me turn without wanting to  after maybe a month of having it      
444,4.0,                       this is an amazing controller and it has taken the lime light away from my keyboard for most games  i m a casual gamer and recently this controller has allowed me to sit back on my couch and play my pc with the relaxation of playing a console  sitting up next to the monitor and playing with my keyboard gives me a competitive edge when i want it but for most times the controller is very nice and is automatically detected  my biggest problem is that it doesn t work with razer synapse for chroma effects      
445,5.0,                       loving this controller  feels so much better than normal xbox controller  love the customization of sticks  trigger stops  and maps or buttons  paddles a great addition to have a few extra moves or functions ready in your favorite games      
446,2.0,                       when i first got this controller i was absolutely blown out of the water and i loved every bit of it  but now that i ve had it for just  over a month i m very disappointed  all of the buttons are clicky and fast to react but just a few days ago i picked it up and pressed the x button and it barely clicks anymore and feels like it s completely lost all of its springiness  not to mention i ll have to press it     times to even get it to register  normally if i had a controller that did this i would just blame it on wear but considering the fact that i spent      on this and have had it for about    days it s absolutely mind boggling that the x button already broke      
447,3.0,                       cannot lock the buttons near the trigger button which in the hype of the game they can be accidently pressed and it messes everything up      
448,4.0,                       so i already own an elite series    this new razer wolverine   is not that  but it does compare favorably in a few key areas i purchased this for     instead of the usual       and that seems about right  if you can find it even cheaper  then this becomes almost a must buy the negatives out of the way  it s wired  this cannot be used in a wireless setting  and if it could then this might be even better than the elite  now i obviously knew going in that it was wired  and that s not a deal breaker when using at my pc  which is where i m using it   but this is a total no go for my xbox with that setup  if having a wireless controller is important  then pass on this guy  i m also not a fan of the extra buttons on the trigger  in theory i m a fan  just not of their placement  they just don t seem practical or easy to use  i m sure others don t have an issue with their placement  but it s awkward  with that said  i ve never been much on using extra buttons  even the extra paddles on the elite  so this will vary based on the user the pros the buttons  oh the mechanical switches on these guys  it does take a minute to get used to  but one you do  it just feels so much better to use  it s hard to explain  but if you ve used a mechanical keyboard  then you ll understand  yes  they make a difference the build quality  the feel of this guy in the hand is legit  i m not going to say it feels better to hold than the elite  but it s on par with it  the thumb sticks  the triggers  the texture of handles in your hand  the whole package just screams quality and is a pleasure to use i will say the placement of the menu buttons is odd and different  not a negative  but if you switch between this guy and a regular xbox controller  it will take a minute for the brain to remember the placement when you at first switch back an forth if you don t mind a wired controller or the lack of the back paddles and want that elite feel then this is a no brainier if you can find it around              
449,4.0,                       controller is great  i ve been using it every day for the last  months and the hair trigger options really improve my rainbow   skills  i always lost firefights because i couldn t get the full trigger pull in time only gripe is very small  sometimes i have to unplug and re plug in the controller to get it to work  besides that the controller is a good buy for xbox lovers as well as pc usage      
450,5.0,                       this is by far better than my elite series one controller   provided that it is not wireless   no batteries or recharge times       
451,4.0,                       overall a very great controller  i have owned a scuf vantage and i can say that this performs up to the same standard  the layout of the remappable buttons has worked out really well for shooters and rocket league  the top remappable buttons have a mouse click feel and sound to them and the back paddles are more muted and have a soft button press  the d pad buttons and the abxy buttons have a similar mouse click feeling and sound as well  there are trigger stops that are able to be toggled on or off but i don t think i have ever toggled it off  the shortened trigger pull feels much better and seems to give a slight edge in reaction time  i have heard some people say that in intense games they have pulled past the trigger stop but i have yet to have this happen to me  the back handles of the controller are covered in rubber and do a really good job of keeping it in my hands and not slipping when adjusting my grip  near the top where the xbox button is located there is a line that fades left to right with rgb lighting fairly quickly that looks really nice and is surprisingly bright but not overpowering  the lb and rb buttons are fairly standard and work as they should  there is a    mm audio jack at the bottom of the controller that will allow you to use a wired headset  the sticks are slightly concaved with nice grip  if you like to use kontrol freeks you will have to sacrifice the outer layer of rubber on the thumb sticks because they are to large and will not fit  i forced the kontrol freeks through the rubber layer and they have not given me any issues  i have used this on both xbox one and pc and it has worked well on both  the cable included is long enough to be used while sitting on the couch away from your system and it is also braided and very durable  i have used this controller exclusively for   months now and none of the components have become sticky or have stopped working  both sticks still do not have any idle drift in game  i m overall very happy with it and will likely purchase another if this one ever stops working      
452,5.0,                       i love all of my razer products  i wish this one worked with the pc synapse  but you are able to download the xbox version on your pc to change the colors  lighting patterns and set the programmable buttons  i love the feel of the buttons  the the a b x y buttons push like mouse buttons  please be aware this controller is not wireless  it always needs to be plugged in  but to make up for that razer gives you a pretty generous amount of cable  also you do need to be careful on how much stress you put on the cable  the cable that comes with it is pretty much the only cable that will plug into the controller      
453,3.0,                       the goodit s a good controlleryou can customize the lighting  you can customize the buttons it has quick trigger the badseveral times when i press a button and then quickly press another button and it doesn t register that i press that button the regular xbox one controllers are better then that it s not wireless  and a little on the heavy side     
454,5.0,                       this is the best controller i have ever owned  but it is also the most expensive  it seems nice and sturdy  comes with a good case  and replaceable d pads and analog sticks  i bought it reluctantly because i was sick of replacing cheap controllers and was curious if the premium product would be any different obviously  since it is razer  it glows and whatnot if you are into that sort of thing i never knew i would find the additional buttons so handy  especially with games requiring you to hold down a button while sprinting  the additional buttons act as duplicates that can be controlled with your index fingers allowing better simultaneous control with the analog sticks so far  i am happy with it  provided that it continues to function properly for some time      
455,2.0,                         had for   monthsi bought this instead of the microsoft elite controller thinking i would like it more since i have not experienced any issues with the mice i ve bought from razer  when it worked  the most annoying thing was the usb cable  it tended to get loose from the controller frequently  not sure if that is the port or the cable didn t try out the extra joysticks  though i did switch out the d pads and didn t have much of a preference since i wasn t playing any fighting games  i didn t use the extra mapping buttons either  just never decided what to use them for  the controller definitely feels great and enjoyed it while it lasted  i turned off the chroma as i just found it distracting and kinda annoying when it would light up the room more than the light from the tv though today the left trigger has receded and i ve been unable to get it back out  will try razer to see if they will honor their warranty  though based off my experience would probably go with the elite controller      
456,3.0,                       the controller is cool and has nice designs  but if you re used to a regular xbox controller  the controller feels awkward and very hard to get used too  cool controller  not worth the price  especially like i said if you re used to the regular xbox controller     
457,2.0,                       in just under a year control stick started to fall apart  unlike most higher end controllers the joysticks are not replaceable  will be sticking to my series one elite and scuf controller as thay can be maintained and have years of use without issue      
458,4.0,                       bought this for our son  and i m sure it works just fine because  well there have been no complaints  i guess that is a win right      
459,2.0,                       this controller was fine for a few months  then the lettered buttons would start jamming and wouldn t press down anymore  i opened a support request with razer and they were extremely unhelpful in the matter  they refused to do anything about the situation      
460,4.0,                       tl dr  came from an elite controller  hated the break in period  but ended up being very satisfied with a quality product getting used to this controller takes a minute and will make you question why you even bought the controller to begin with but then suddenly you adapt and it s the best controller you ve used to date coming from an elite controller  i didn t like the paddle positioning on the wolverine at first  but i too got used to this  and actually prefer it over the elite s paddle locations  purely because now i don t accidentally squeeze my controller and hit one of the paddles mid firefight  with the elite  i could only use two paddles at a time for this reason  no such issue with the wolverine extra bumper buttons are awesome and extremely useful  nuff saidtrigger stops are good  but after smashing on the left trigger when adsing since purchase  i can feel a little more give in the left trigger over the right with the stops in use  no difference when the stops aren t used buttons are responsive  with a cleaner feeling action than the oem controllers grips are grippy and this is huge    they dont melt off  ahem elite controller ahem rgb lights are fun and customizable  which helps with identifying which preset you re on      
461,2.0,                       the controller is over priced for what you get out of it     the controls don t feel all that smooth either   to be honest it s a waste of money to buy off brands       
462,2.0,                       trigger button broke due to hair trigger malfunction  also m  button is cracked  i ve had the product for a year   the main components of the controller do not work anymore  for the cost it should last a lot longer  also razer support is non existent  they don t offer a repair service of any kind  if you re a hard core gamer that games few more than an hour per day just  know this controller will not stand the test of time      
463,5.0,                       i use this controller to play all types of shooters on x box and it s honestly a great product  if you don t mind spending a lot  it does feel significantly more sturdy and reactive than a standard controller  a total of   extra buttons  plus the chat control panel and there s even a button that will switch between at least two bind settings      
464,3.0,                       buttons are fine but the joystick is off like most non microsoft brand controllers  they just never can get the joysticks right  i was struggling to maintain aim when sniping in pubg compared to using the standard xbox controller and also ive recently noticed the     is starting to go shot      
465,2.0,                       i am a huge fan of razer products  just about every peripheral for my gaming rig is razer  so i had high expectations for this controller   i bought      for my xbox and   for my pc   my main issue is with the software and key mapping  i cant believe there is no true custom mapping abilities or special functions like you get with the xbox elite controller   the mapping for the pc is the same as for the xbox  even though on a pc you need to be able to map more keys  or combinations of keys   i thought i would be able to do multiple key functions on the same bind  for example to lean right or left in a game i am playing i have to hold a modifier key   i wanted to be able to map that to a single key  but the software is so minimal and basic its not possible   i am debating sending both controllers back  because i expected more  much more from razer      
466,1.0,                       left analog stick just stop working  i had brought this item less than a month      
467,5.0,                       if your looking for a good elite controller  well your in luck  this by far the best elite controller ive boughtn  and you can remap buttons with the razer synapese app on the xbox and swap your dpad and joysticks  you get your moneys worth      
468,5.0,                       i bought this control almost a year ago  the control is very user friendly and since i have a smaller hand it helps keep me balanced while i game  my only thing is the pedals are starting to  lag on me while i play  does anyone know how i can fix them  the lag comes from regular wear and tear so they re not terribly laggy  just a bit      
469,1.0,                       good controller if overpriced  but it is not remappable or pc friendly  the synapse software is a different version than the normal razer software  despite having the same name  and does not allow remapping as advertised      
470,3.0,                       i really enjoy this controller for its feel  ease of access  and utility  but there is one major flaw with my controller that is keeping it from being a   star  the wire used to connect to my pc has an issue where it will disconnect the controller at the slightest movement of the wire which has caused some more issues with my ability to enjoy use with it when at a key moment of game play it just stops working      
471,3.0,                       best controller i have ever used  right bumper and right trigger are both broken at the time if writing this   must point out that this is the replacement controller for the one purchased in june        the original controller had an issue with the right bumper also but it was replaced under warranty  unfortunately the replacement has now had the same issue and is completely useless now   wont be buying another controller  obviously there are manufacturing issues with these controllers   sad really      
472,5.0,                       very superior to microsoft control  which after   months of use broke the rl and lb button     
473,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          honest review    when you see the controller reviews and it looks completely destroyed it s because gamers are overusing the controller  it s an amazing controller grab handling great functionality and buttons feels heavy but clicky and nice great software for rbg lighting    don t overuse the controller       
474,4.0,                       great controller  the customization on it is fantastic and it feels amazing to play with  only problem is i can t use the extra buttons in my fav game  apex legends       
475,1.0,                       i bought a new device and received one that was clearly repackaged  cable was bunched up in a ball  paper inserts crumpled up  packaging bent  misshapen and unsealed  right thumbstick looks like a dog got at it  buyer beware      
476,3.0,                       this is my second time buying the controller  i was happy with first controller but eventually after years of abuse it was time for a new one  this time around right off the bat the dashboard button was crooked and a few days later when i plugged in my mic i was told that it makes a horrible static noise  tried with multiple mics  also sometimes the trigger stops will snap out of place every now and then      
477,1.0,                       buttons are terrible  triggers moves you don t want to use in game  i had such high expectations for this controller being better than the wolverine ultimate but it is a thousand times worse     
478,3.0,                       latest update overdue   razor did honor the warranty after some back and forth  i am not happy with the process but they deserve some credit for fixing the issue older review below linebeware of warranty claims   apparently razer support is giving me the run around because i bought this on amazon   it was even tagged as  amazon s choice    apparently the seller was electronics   deals and razer claims they are not an authorized reseller   i am currently a week into trying to figure out how to replace my controller after support has confirmed a hardware issue   my left thumb stick does not register up so its hard to move in  fps   i will keep this updated   i left my original review below                              previous headline  great alternative to the elite controllerthis review is for the tournament edition  ultimate has several other features i have been using this controller for several months and would recommend it for anyone looking to add back buttons or would like a better feeling controller with the face buttons  x  y  a  b    i play a lot of fps games where you either need extra buttons on the rear or you have to learn how to do the claw grip to compete with online players at a high level   previously i was using an elite  which i loved until it recently broke   i decided to give this controller a shot based on two factors   first the warranty was  a full year unlike the    days you get with the elite   secondly it was much cheaper than replacing the elite   i would buy again and would recommend to fellow gamers pros   lower price point than elite or scuf  face buttons feel great  like mechanical keyboard   m  and m  buttons are actually very convenient  chroma lighting is cool but mainly for easily telling what profile you have active  software to remap loads fast and is very easy to usecons   the back buttons are better than scuf but not as easy as elite  personal preference mostly   wired only  should be for competitive anyway   non replaceable thumb sticks  one size fits all here   software can only remap m   m   m   m  buttons  standard buttons are not configurable   have to switch profiles via the app  its super fast though      
479,5.0,                       controller works great   high quality  i ve had one before  the dog ate it  lol   expect this one to last like the last one   interchangeable sticks and d pad for customization   led program for those nice colors   seated plug protects it from damage in the controller   the only drawback is that i use astro a   headset and i can t plug it in   i didn t realize that the mixamp control unit on this controller is build in  you can t unplug it to plug the astro mixamp into it like you do on other controllers     astro recommends using their traditional mixamp  pro tr  as a workaround     another      and more cords  so     yeah   beware   otherwise  love this controller   it s many options  quality build      
480,5.0,                       really comfortable and good button feedback  my only complaint is that the back and extra top buttons are pre mapped to abxy and can t change from that     
481,1.0,                       truly a bad controller   the sticks are stiff and hard to aim like a cheap        controller  the extra buttons they added are horribly uncomfortable locations that make them difficult to use  this is at best a     controller trying to act like its pro      
482,1.0,                       first off this product is not compatible with the razer synapse program  you have this a program called  wolverine for xbox  which is a direct port of the xbox program  they didn t program it to respond to mouse and keyboard  really lazy programming then for the real kicker  when you get into the program you realize you can only remap the buttons to other buttons on the controller or   of the controllers special functions which means the extra buttons are useless for pc players worse part this controller has been out for years and they have not fixed the software yes in mine opinion and everyone elses except razor  the software is a broken port of the xbox software  it is in no way is a windows program other than it runs on it this is my last razer purchase      
483,4.0,                       using the controller for pc gaming   only issues are i wish the d pad buttons were a bit bigger   i did have a problem with the left analog stick getting stuck at the   oclock position for the first   weeks  it has since resolved itself   otherwise great controller      
484,4.0,                       honestly didn t think it would be this capable  more than enough for your regular competitve gamer  if a wired controller bothers you then id avoid this other than that its great enough said      
485,5.0,                       got this controller back in      and still using it very good controller also with the chat and extra buttons     
486,5.0,                       works as advertised  and feels real good in my hands  i also like that it was plug and play  i am not able to use the software because it only works for configuring rgb on xbox   i won t take a star for a quality product  especially since i don t need the software and the light scheme goes with my hyperx rgb keyboard  i can t program any buttons  but i usually do that in game anyway  i recommend this product      
487,1.0,                       bought this controller april   th       it was a great controller until today june          my right stick started drifting within the first month   no biggie   now the controller no longer works   save your money   i can t even get in touch with customer support     
488,1.0,                       was a great controller stored it in the case out of the way when not in use  loved the feel of everything about this controller   until my buttons got stuck for no reason think it s the springs which gave out think the case depressed the keys now they won t rise  it s to bad would get a new one but no guarantee that the same thing would not happen again      
489,4.0,                       very nicely designed controller  works well but joysticks not as precise as mouse  especially aiming joystick in star wars battlefront ll  possibly i have not learned to calibrate it properly yet      
490,5.0,                       hands down the best xbox controlleri ve put a lot of hours in on this device  nearly     so far   and i have had zero issues with functionality   there s no stick drift  and the buttons remain just as functional as they were out of the package   i understand where some people would have issues with not having a wireless controller  but being wired is the only downside   the cable is braided and break away though  but you will never have to worry about the port where it plugs into the controller breaking over time because of the stability in the design   if you re sick consistently buying new controllers because the old one has worn out or drifts to the point where you can t even select anything efficiently  then buy this controller   it s worth it      
491,2.0,                       the controller itself is well made and responsive  but the wire for the controller is poorly made and didn t last   months  the wire is a micro usb so i picked up a new one from the local store only to find it didn t fit  razer decided to cut grooves into the port so that only their cord would fit in  yeah they ll probably tell you it s to help the cord fit snugger  and maybe that was the intention  but it seems super shady  it s even worse that researching for replacement cords leads you to some forums where others have complained and no one has been able to find a replacement  so they made a terrible cheap cord for a       controller that cannot be replaced and doesn t last more than   months  yeah  i won t be buying any more razer products i did finally find a  solution  to the replacement cord  i took a drill to the inner mold where the cord attaches and carved out the plastic grooves preventing any non razer branded replacement cord and then was able to install a better made cord and not buy an entirely new controller      
492,5.0,                       great controller  superb razer quality as usual  thumbs ticks are really nice and the trigger stops are perfect  i don t use the extra bumpers but i can see how they would be useful  the cable is really nice and breaks away easily  the app let s you customize everything and works well  i have big hands and this controller is a tiny bit too small but otherwise the back buttons are tactile and easy to reach  highly recommend      
493,4.0,                       what can i say  holy crap   i have the      x box elite controller   so i got this for my gaming desktop because when i got my x box one x i moved my s to my gaming monitor and desktop setup  wow  okay   it s wired   i hate that   but now i know why  the response is extremely noticeable compared to the elite  buttons have a more tactile feel  my only complaint is that with the extra swappable pieces you don t get matching sets so it s mismatched  what were they thinking  otherwise  excellent case  light in your hands and solid built quality and the lighting is cool  another great razer product  docked a star only because of not giving set pieces for stick replacements which make it feel off using anything other than stock      
494,5.0,                       this controller feels great  the buttons are supper responsive and the added option of swapping d pad and analogs is a great    mappable buttons witch is wonderful especially for shooters never having to take your thumb off to reload or jump  also the rgb strip is customizable witch is another bonus  rubber grips on  the backs for you swet moments what s not to love  i went with this controller cause i had a standard xbox controller with a panel pack for the back panel buttons and it was time to upgrade  but i only use wired don t like battery s specially when i game for    hours  and the mic and game mixer for audio was also a sell cause on my other controller i used a turtle beach controller adapter  it also goes great with my razer kraken tourmant edition headphones so yep lol  this is a buy in my book      
495,4.0,                       my issue with the controller was the the paddles location isn t in the greatest spot but manageable and i have medium small hands so it s not that bad but i have to use my ring fingers to maintain my grip otherwise  it s tough to explain so my solution was i made both button on one side jump so no matter which one i press or accidentally fly hit i ll hit the one i want regardless of grip or panic press another thing i d like to touch on which is a big plus and almost nobody ever reviews for  talk about is the stick resistance and how it feels amazing  best way i can put it is it feels like the ps  resistance  in my opinion playstation did it right and this controller has about the same  there is no wiggle or jiggle room what so ever  the mm you move it will move in game  when using it so no dead zone if you will compared to license xbox controllers that have wiggle room both gens for the elite controller have the wiggle problem and maybe other third parties companies  power does a good job too i primarily bought it for pc but i have an xbox as well  the buttons feels great and very tactile and responsive  zero issues  the trigger stops work as i d expected with not a lot of travel distance when switched on  switched off feels typical and responsive  the two extra buttons by the bumpers i m stil getting use to but i do accidentally hit them sometimes however i was using the controller for the first but time and used it for   hours and just a slight adaptability that needs to happen   the cord is more than long enough and i preferred wired anyways so plus for me the xbox app has     stars on windows store and xbox store  people were having profile issues but if you play only fps or that s your primary then i wouldn t worry about as you can physically set the buttons without the software so because of the crappy app and the location of the rear buttons it loses a star but regardless i would still buy this again and recommend over any controller for xbox or pc  every button press feels like a mouse click so if you re looking for a controller buy this one  i m not a razer fan what so ever but this is      worth it      
496,1.0,                       update  we ve had the controller for a year and it has completely stopped working  according to reddit  this is a common issue after this time frame  very disappointing for the amount of money paid for this controller  it should last long than a year  i wouldn t recommend this product  we have old scufs that still work on the      buy scuf instead  if you can  it ll at least last my boyfriend loves this controller  it is a great alternative to a scuf  and there are many features he liked more than a scuf  such as the trigger stops that are controlled by a switch  the only downside was that a month or so after getting it the  a  paddle on the back has to be pressed hard for it to work  pressing lightly wouldn t do anything  while the other one worked fine  that s the only reason i ve given it     stars  he was worried about it being wired  but the card is so long you honestly don t even notice it  and you don t have to worry about batteries  overall  we enjoy this controller  it was just a little disappointing that one of the paddles wore out so quickly      
497,5.0,                       this controller is way better than any other controller i ve tried  it s better than the elite imo  scuff and battle beaver controllers  the best thing i love about the controller is the   added top buttons by the triggers and how smooth and precise the thumbsticks are and how you can speed em up or slow em down all the the press of the back button  worth the buy if you re looking for a top notch fps controller to up your game  it takes a little getting used to but once you get it down after a week of two you will love how easy fps games are      
498,2.0,                       this is definitely one of my favorite controllers i ve ever bought  or at least it was    within less than   months  my left bumper has become stuck and the controller is no longer functional because the bumper is constantly active  i wish i could afford a replacement  but i bought the controller on sale and now have to find another      
499,5.0,                       my boyfriend had always wanted an xbox controller with the back paddles  so i got him this one as a gift  i thought it was cooler and seemed like better quality than the xbox elite controllers  and not to mention cheaper too   when it came  i took it out of the box just to check it out before giving it to him  and i was honestly so impressed with it  it s sturdy  the buttons click instead of a press  which makes it easier to click them faster over and over again  the joy sticks are sturdy as well  and come with two different ones  which is good incase one breaks  and it comes with a nice case   and furthermore  my boyfriend lovessss this controller  he says it helps him play better  and he loves everything about the controller  so coming from a person who didn t use the controller  and a person who does use the controller  we both give it a       highly recommend      
500,4.0,                       this is a great controller overall  so far i am having only a few issue  the input response is the best i have seen  the paddles on the back might feel short at the beginning but they are extremely comfortable for long term play  even with large hands  the only thing i can complain about is that the a and x buttons get stuck often and i have to keep a can of compressed air next to my desk to fix the problem  i keep the controller very clean so this should not be happening      
501,2.0,                       lets get this out of the way  this should be good for xbox users as they generally dont allow you do map different buttons that arent already present  but for pc gaming you re better off getting a steam controller build quality seems very good  one of the reasons i bought this was because it looks sturdy  and the cable retainer looked like it would prevent damage to the port  if dropped tugged the abxy buttons are a bit hard to press compared to my xbone comtroller and the amazon basic controller i already have  other than that all buttons have a satisfying mostly linear resistance and click breakusability  basically an xbox elite controller never use personally  i was hoping that with this supporting pc i could re map the programmable buttons to different key strokes  or at least a combination of xbox button presses as most games will let you map button combinations  but no  you re limited to a single key bind  of only the existing xbox buttonsadvertizing   calling this re mappable is quite a large overstatement  though i dont know what to call it otherwise  i guess swappable clone able would be more approprate  as the only mapping that is allowed  are buttons already present elsewhere on the xbox standard controller so you re just duplicating a buttonside note  if you ve been having issues with the xbox button not working in windows on a standard xbox controller  it seems to work reliably on this one     
502,5.0,                       easily the best controller by far  the only limitation is it s wired  the audio aspect is a nice feature so it s compatible with most headsets  the buttons are made to be very quick they re also sturdy  you can tell the controller is well built  also the analogs are very responsive and the lights are a nice touch  i tried the elite and stuff and didn t like either      
503,5.0,                       these controllers are way better than the microsoft elite ones  my elite controller practically stopped working after   months  and had a big hassle to try and get the warranty dealt with on that  never buying a microsoft controller ever again after going to this one  razor for life now        
504,4.0,                       it s the best controller i ve ever had   unfortunately though i accidentally spilled my drink on it  now it won t turn on  it s too pricey for me to buy another      
505,2.0,                       pros  i like the weight feel  the abxy buttons  they click instead of mash   the chroma options  the built in voice control adapter and the two extra buttons adjacent to the triggerscons  i don t like the location of the back buttons  as compared to the xbox one elite   most importantly  this product does not provide voice feedback with headphones  the feature where you hear your voice when talking in to a microphone   this is a huge design error in my opinion i was hoping this would be a more durable option than the xbox one elite controller  unfortunately  the two con s i listed are dealbreakers for me this would be a     controller if chat voice feedback was an option and a     if i could adjust the location layout of the back bumpers similar to the xbox one elite controller      
506,5.0,                       aside from the bumpers  to which i m still adjusting  this controller had been fantastic  i really enjoy the clicky feeling of the keys and the grip on the control sticks  absolutely would recommend to anyone who asked      
507,4.0,                       the response time is amazing i ve been using a ps  dual shock  day   i noticed i can move faster  respond quicker than before  rocketleague   mechanics that i struggled with seem effortless i m surprised it s this good  glad i got it and wish i would have bought sooner because i was skeptical and went through   ps  controllers and   steam controllers so well see how it holds but     so far amazing      
508,5.0,                       always had elite controllers  but i really like this one  better price  lighter      
509,4.0,                       day   and it feels like it was made to be in these hands  it even has some weight to it for my fellow large peoples      
510,5.0,                       he was like a kid in a candy store when he opened this  i don t think i have ever seen him light up so much from a gift  he says it handles well  the buttons are smooth   it is very comfortable in his hands   the reaction time is amazing      
511,3.0,                       bought this in may and as of yesterday the left analog stick started to not register while playing cod causing my running animation to go and stop  the controller itself is great but for the price truly disappointed that this happened since now i got used to the paddles  i ll try and see if i can get one swapped if not i ll get an elite  buy with caution      
512,1.0,                       so i have had this for about   months and about   months in it started to experience drift in the left joystick causing an absolutely horrible gaming experience   that being said i m not in the us right now so i can t send it back to razer to get it fixed  or replaced   hopefully when i get home i can send it back for a free fix or replacement at which point i ll give it a proper rating   for now it ll remain a one      
513,5.0,                       when i saw that     of all reviews gave a   or   star review i knew that the razer ultimate had to be a true winner  so i took the plunge and i could not be happier  took no time at all to set the controller to the way i wanted the buttons mapped using the xbox  the controller itself has a good solid feel and the buttons are all very responsive  comes with a nice case for storage or travelling and the never ending chroma lights is a unexpected treat  great gift for your gamer or yourself it has been about   weeks since my review on this product and i have had not a single issue or problem with this controller  take care of the controller and it will last a long time  the one thing it did help me with is raising my k d in call of duty   went from a     to      what a difference this has made for me and it works nicely with rpg s      
514,4.0,                       it s a great controller all around  just wish you could customize the buttons and use synapse   like my other razer devices      
515,5.0,                       xbox home button sticks  returned it and got a new one but had the same problem    will return again and hopefully will resolve it  but i can only give   stars because of this  controller is nice but it seems razer could care less about console products update  i used this controller for a good while  i honestly really enjoyed it once it was fixed  the paddles are nice but the controller is very delicate so be careful not to drop it  wired control kinda sucks but at the same time you never have to worry about batteries or charging  i have a new controller now from evil controllers  but my wolverine is the go to for anyone that plays split screen with me  everyone seems to love it  honestly at the price it is now i d recommend buying it if you like controllers with paddles  i d give it     but that s not a option so i ll give them the   because i did grow to love a lot of features on it      
516,5.0,                       i waited a couple of weeks after i purchased this controller so it would give me time to get used to it and break it in  im a previous owner of an elite controller  actually   elite controllers because they kept breaking on me  i buy sell very expensive camera regularly and if you know anything about high end camera gear then the inspecting process is as tedious as it gets  a spec of dust can make or break a sale for a        lens  needless to say  i take exceptional care of all my electronics the same way i would my camera gear which is why im absolutely amazed that all   of my elite controllers had defects after rather light usage  after my  rd elite break  i decided to opt for the return and get the razor wolverine ultimate instead  i usually go for name brands and the most quality of any product i get but in this case the elite had failed me ive  had this controller for   weeks and it feels very well built although not as premium as the elite feels but still very nice  however  the buttons and joysticks feel much more sturdy and well built compared to the elite controller  thats where it counts  aside from the durability  the usability of the razer blows the elite out of the water  the   extra buttons by the rb and lb buttons are much more useful than any of the paddle add ons on the elite controller  also the   add on buttons under the controller are much more convenient than the elites paddles also  you can still grip the controller tightly and not accidentally press them like you would with the elite  the micro and macro movement feature is just a bonus that takes the controller on that much higher a level at this point  i also love the click style of the a x y b buttons  every controller brand should adapt this feature my only negative about the controller is the cord length  its only about    feet long while my xbox is    feet away from my tv  a male to female usb extension fixes this problem but then it renders the quick connect useless if someone were to trip over the cord and pull on the xbox  this controller is not perfect but its the best on the market at the moment so im leaving   stars i am very happy i made this purchase and won t be going back to the elite even if they update it  i will be buying more razer products from now on      
517,1.0,                       the product felt a little weird from the beginning  but easy to adjust to  the rgb lighting is what you expect and is very cool  however  my controller stopped working after about   months  this happened in the middle of my game and i could no longer turn it on      
518,4.0,                       all in all  this remote is the business  the textured hand grips allow you to maintain a solid hold on the remote  even during the sweatiest of matches  the trigger locks allow for rapid trigger manipulation which is vital in pvp fps were thousandths of a second matter  the additional four buttons  which are programmed by default as x  y  a  and b  are very convenient as  once you learn how to effectively utilize them  you will seldom need to remove your thumb from the right control stick  the construction feels solid  what i expect from razer  i know that some people complain about it not being wireless  however  they are aware of that fact prior to purchase  and shouldn t have purchased it in the first place  i prefer wired controllers  and most hardcore gamers that i know prefer them as well  i don t like to bother with charging my remotes  especially during prolonged gaming sessions  the only reason that i m deducting a star is because this remote is dependent upon  synapse for xbox   that means that it doesn t synchronize with your other razer synapse peripherals  it isn t a deal breaker  but  it is a little disappointing that they don t have a separate driver that pc users can utilize to allow this remote to synchronize with synapse for pc      
519,5.0,                       good     
520,1.0,                       start and rb are tied together  not programmed  after a month of use  i contacted razer over a week ago and thought this was on the way to resolved as we d verified the issue over their chat but the warranty center hasn t followed up with information to turn in the broken one so that i can receive a voucher      
521,1.0,                       the product software cant be installed and doesn t actually even worth for this product   only figured that out by googling and seeing the copious amount of disappointed customers  pulling the right trigger sometimes will activate the triangle button for some reason  cant update drives to see if that will fix it because   you cant install software for it and device manager says the drivers are updates  big yikes      
522,2.0,                       honestly  the issues with this controller are  so comically sad     i dont even know what to say  every single problem this controller has makes it extremely obvious that razer has apparently laid off their entire qa team i guess  every single issue should have been noticed within the first    minutes of any product testing  so i have to assume they didn t do any  worse part  amazon is allowing them to get away with selling this horrible controller because it is looping the reviews from previous controllers in with it  i just hope some people can see this before wasting      okay  here we go    first off  as others have said everywhere  if you press either of the bumper buttons and then try to  press the triggers  you have to force the plastic ont he trigger past the bumper button plastic making an audible click that will surely degrade the controller after a while and already makes it horrible  the trigger will also stay depressed if you are still holding the bumper when letting go      which can ruin your play in a large number of games second  the right trigger already started sticking on god knows what when depressed after    hours of ownership     and then eventually a snap was heard on the hair trigger crap and has broken it further i can t imagine what else will go wrong    i am so upset because razer used to be the company i could trust in a see of third party trash  now  they are literally worse than the random unlicensed controllers on here  at least they only charge you         for their controller that will break in less than a week worst part for me  the box was trashed by mistake so now i can t even return this horrible controller  instead  i will place it somewhere it constantly reminds me to never even buy a razer product ever again  which is really sad because i loved them i can honestly say now  however  that power a has surpassed them in quality     shudder   i  would go through the pros and good parts but the negatives are so bad it doesn t matter  it is completely unusable  razer support wont help either because i was advised the clicking and breaking the triggers make is a feature not a bug so     grift away razer  you will lose far more in future revenue than you have grifted from me here      
523,3.0,                       started getting drift  then the trigger paddle broke off           
524,1.0,                       ordered this for myself as a late x mas gift  and as an end to      gift  because we all need one of those  came in quickly and i was super pumped  so as i got to setting it up  it all looked okay until i got to the box itself  i don t know how else to describe it other than the packaging being loose  unusual for razer products  well as i took off the paper  lo and behold  the seal that closed the box appeared to have been tampered with   once i got inside i found of all things   a used controller  it was pretty well worn and dusty  and even the connector cable was pretty dinged up  i m rather upset as this controller wasn t cheap  started the return process with amazon and i will update if things are corrected  check your stuff folks      
525,4.0,                       all around good controller  does everything you want it to   the cable includes a  trip disconnect  inline  to theoretically prevent anyone from pulling your console off the shelf if they trip over the cable   i suppose the obvious ask here would be to have a wireless version of this thing   thankfully we have not had to test this trip disconnect thing anyway  the headphone jack leaves much to be desired   first and foremost  it comes out the bottom   why   there s already a cable required at the top  why not have the headphone jack next to the console cable   that would be a no brainer   but for some reason  razer went with the no thought required bottom headphone jack   seriously guys  you re a high end gaming controller manufacturer     this is a stupidly simple thing to think about   especially with the extended button panel on that bottom edge  it makes the headphone jack cable stick out so yeah     nice controller  just be careful with the headphone jack      
526,1.0,                       i got this replaced once i got my replacement in and it lasted maybe a month like my first one  the y button went out on my first one the second one the y button started to stick and now when you press it  it sticks down like you re holding the button      
527,4.0,                       this controller has more pros than cons and while not perfect  it s superior in both ergonomics and build quality to microsoft s elite controller pros    it s comfortable  the grips are angled slightly inward and there is less reach for triggers    the buttons are tactile and feel mechanical  not spongy    the back triggers are actually comfortable and functional  unlike the removable triggers on the elite controller    it s programmable and has swappable joysticks with different heights   while it s not usb c  the micro usb has a small housing around it that makes it easy to connect cons    the top of the grips are smooth plastic  which leads to sweaty hands vs the elite s soft touch grips    the power cable is heavy the fact this controller is wired  is not a con  most buyers should know this going in  it s worth the money  especially if you have experienced joystick drift   months into an elite controller      
528,1.0,                       first controller s right trigger broke in two days   amazon shipped replacement   second controller s right trigger broke in one day   i play fx  pinball on steam      
529,5.0,                             would recommend i play mostly apex and with the   triggers and two extra bumpers i have it mapped out to where i never take my thumbs off the sticks i ve owned a scuf prestige previously which i have now sold the triggers on the bottom are laid out perfectly for easy reach when you need them but you can still have a normal hold for games that you dont all the buttons are extremely easy to push unlike the scuf where they were too stiff to push without adjusting your grip i ve had this for roughly    weeks now with no faults or issues for anyone considering this or a scuf definitely take this even comes with two extra sticks and  a case the cord has a breakaway point which also works fantastic if you have dogs or kids running around a truly fantastic controller if you want to up your game definitely surprised me with the quality and ease of use over a controller i paid an additional      for     
530,2.0,                       decent controller  however after about a month of use  the buttons on the back became loose and they stick  it isn t fun to walk around the whole match stuck in the crouch position      
531,5.0,                       read this if you re on the fence about buying the wolverine controller buy iti ve spent the majority of my life playing video games  i first started on the snes and as i got older  i progressed into the more competitive fps games  i ve been playing online games since halo   and i m still an active fps  pvp type gamer why does any of this matter for a review it comes down to this   i ve spent a lot of my life with a controller in my hands  and this is by far the most innovative and easy to use controller i ve ever owned the ability to change my sensitivity while in a firefight is insane  i don t typically use this feature  but i definitely understand the potential use  the best thing about this controller are the two extra buttons behind the bumpers you can map  i m currently playing destiny   and i can jump  slide crouch  switch weapons  reload  access my quests and my inventory without ever having to take my thumbs off of the analog sticks  what  i know  it s crazy  speaking of the analog sticks  they are extremely easy to swap out  i used to play with kontrolfreeks but i feel like razer just got these bad boys right  feels very natural  the mic controls on the bottom are super helpful to change audio level on the fly  not to mention there s also an app you can download to the xbox to adjust built in sensitivity  dead zone  color scheme  etc  i ve been using it daily for about   months  and honestly it was one of the best gifts i ve ever received      buy this if your e considering it  great for serious players who really like to get sweaty and also casual players who like ease of use and customization  thank me later     
532,5.0,                       i got this for my boyfriend  it s great  much better than the wolverine tournament edition or the xbox elite the programmable buttons on the back are a game changer we use it on a pc  the rgb doesn t work when the controller is unplugged but he only uses it plug in always as to avoid lag      
533,5.0,                       i use this for fortnite on pc  you can use it on xbox or windows  the   programmable buttons are in good spots two on top two on back  much better layout than scuff or other similar pro controllers  the usb port is extremely well built unlike stock xbox controllers  braided cable  overall in love  has lasted six months of heavy use with no real sign of wear     
534,4.0,                       be mindful that is does not support attachments on the bottom  i wanted to use my turtle beach or xbox adapter with it but it was not supported  this may have been a mistake on my part for not reading even deeper on it  but smooth return and beautiful controller when i got it      
535,2.0,                       this is a good controller for the money  however  the  a  button  one of the a b x y xbox buttons  started to stick after a few weeks use  this would not be enough for just a   star rating  except that i have found  via google  that the  a  button problem has been ongoing for years   i have no idea what the defect percentage is  i have asked for a replacement  and will see how the replacements does or does not work  i will update my review if the new controller proves more reliable      
536,5.0,                       this is definitely the best controller i ve ever had  i ve been gaming on pretty much every system imaginable since the   s and this one is my favorite by far  very comfortable especially for long gaming sessions  the paddles on the back are easy to use yet out of the way if you don t want to use them all the time  they don t accidentally press when you set the controller down either  trigger switches are responsive  the additional shoulder buttons are easy to press and provide a mouse like click when pressed  the software is simple yet intuitive  the face buttons are mechanical and provide a satisfying click when pressed with responsive actuation  rgb lighting is sweet  the joystick grips work really well even if you re like me and have sweaty hands  i would definitely buy another one of these if they ever come out with a wireless model  though it is nice to not have to deal with batteries  i have the standard xbox one controller  the elite  elite v   and this one and i d definitely say this is the best one by far  completely worth the cost  the build quality is fantastic      
537,4.0,                       i was trying to decide between this and the elite so i bought both  i love almost everything about the controller  the extra two buttons next to thr triggers are amazing  m   m   but with that being said the lower paddles are just not positioned in a comfortable place to me  the ones above it  m  m   are reachable for most but i don t know anybody who likes the lower two  m   m    the controller is super light  even lighter than the stock xbox one  the buttons for the mic and remapping are amazing as well  i love all the features it offers but i can t go over all of them  my biggest issues with the controller is having to unplug it and re plug it for it to work sometimes and the thumb sticks on it are really responsive but i play a lot of fps games and the thumb stick pads are pretty fat  it messed up my aim in a few games and i was never able to adjust to it and i used the controller for about     hours easily  the cord comes with a wrap for the extra cord you don t use which was very nice  one thing i didn t think i would like a lot but i did was the color options for the light on the controller  i still have it but i use the elite  if you can get use to the thumb sticks and they are comfortable for you this controller is easily the best one out there  i just crossed the scuf out in my mind  they are never available     
538,5.0,                       buttons are nice quality materials     
539,3.0,                       the short press toggle switch gets stuck  making the rt trigger stick and constantly in the  pressed  position  it doesn t appear broken anywhere so i can only assume faulty design  i have not played enough hours to justify such a breakdown otherwise the controller is comfortable and the lights do what they re supposed to i wanted to be proud to own this razer controller  now i feel i have to find a better brand      
540,2.0,                       tldr  doesn t seem worth the extra   over a baseline controller  it still broke after   months in general it works fine  feels good  and does the things you would expect initially when i started using it i the buttons seemed to have more resistance to the press  and things just seemed to have a rigidity to them  on the whole this makes it feel more rugged and your actions feel very intentional  in practice it seems to be about the same  the grip also feels slightly different than a standard xbox controller  i had to adjust my grip a bit  it took a week or so to get used to the differences  the feel was noticeably different i haven t found a use for the back paddles  and it seems they can only mirror existing buttons  so it seems you can t really use it as a separate  standalone function button  it just copies one of your other buttons  admittedly i might ve just not set it up properly the controller kinda bugs out the usb port somehow occasionally  i ve had a few weird things happen  the controller will be black dead and you have to unplug the cable and plug it back in to get it to kinda wake up  i ve also had it bug out my keyboard and mouse  where both go black along with the controller and unplugging the controller brings the other usb stuff back    so yeah  weird  but only seems to happen after waking the computer up  not sporadically  so it s not been a big problem so i bought this controller around   months ago  the bumper just crapped out on me  it s kinda stuck in and feels all mushed  won t click anymore    i ve had the same bumper break on previous controllers  i bought this controller hoping the higher price would come with a higher build quality but apparently the bumpers still crap out around the same time  yeah i dunno  i guess i m death gripping the thing  the extra button resistance mentioned above maybe isn t helping i play a lot of rocket league and i have boost set to right bumper so i m hitting it very often and holding it down a lot of the time  so apparently the bumper just isn t made to hold up to that much use  i think i m better off buying two cheaper controllers for half the price since they crap out around the same time anyway and the extra features didn t actually seem to do anything for me looks like i have a use for the back paddles now aye           
541,2.0,                       i really love this controller  but if you lose any of the thumsticks there is no way to get replacements  from razer directly or any third party   had to buy a broken one on ebay and just take its thumb stick     
542,5.0,                       this controller has held up far better compared to the xbox brand of controllers  i was having issues with the joystick breaking within the first month of owning a new controller  i ve owned the razer for nearly   months now and have had zero issues  i would definitely reccomend to a friend      
543,1.0,                       controller is great but their customer service is trash  they fail to give you any information about the warranty and then go with the  you had    days  like seriously  trash     
544,5.0,                       purchased for my sons   th birthday  it was his only gift because it was expensive but well worth the money  he s legally blind in one eye and enjoys the added features  he s not on his xbox       but when he does play  he absolutely loves it      
545,5.0,                       quality controller  i have a    year old son that goes through controllers like crazy  this one has lasted about   months now with no gameplay problems or wearing out  he loves the customizations on it and all the features  i definitely recommend this      
546,1.0,                       used this controller for about a month and a half before the left analog stick started drifting  i play rocket league on pc with it  and it s a huge detriment  maybe it s a lemon but i cannot recommend the product based on my experience  and the drift appeared too late to return it for a replacement      
547,1.0,                       sticks drift   right bumper didn t register presses  buggy firmware and no support from razer  returned and bought a power a spectre      
548,5.0,                       an excellent responsive controller with many buttons to set up your preferred confirgration      
549,5.0,                       controller has drift after   months and razer is refusing to replace it   they asked for video proof of the drift  which is ridiculous   avoid razer products  they will not honor warranty claims    update  took a while but razer replaced product with a brand new unit   refreshed warranty like a brand new purchase      
550,4.0,                       after burning through   elite controllers since release day i finally gave up and bought this little guy  the goodits solid especially the micro switched buttons and feels much more premium volume control s are at the bottom of the controller the less than goodi m not in love with the rear paddle placement but you ve you get used to them it s not bad  but not as comfortable as the elite this controller doesn t support on screen digital audio chat balancing like they do with their first party stuff it s wired  which i prefer  but there s no option for wireless likely due to m  the buttons aren t as customize as the elite paired with the m  accessory app mine needed a secret firmware update to fix it not being recognized by the xbox after waking up conclusionif you re burning through the bumpers like i was this thing is the ticket  no real problems after   months  however you lose out on some nice features  but those features aren t anything if the controller breaks constantly      
551,3.0,                       i came from an elite controller and after   and half years the controller died  i tried using this wolverine ultimate but here are the key things i did not like   you can t button map any button  only the extra bumpers and paddles on the back  not the main keys   you can t use kontrol freeks on them  they come with one tall and one short extra  anolog sticks  non matching the versatility on the elite controller far supersedes the razer wolverine  i guess if the things i listed above don t bother you  it s a great controller with mechanical keys  feels good in hands  the back paddles do take some getting used to and it is wired but buyers should already know this going in      
552,1.0,                       look and feel is top notch  windows    pc wouldn t recognize it at all  tried multiple sets of drivers  even bought a new usb     card to avoid xhci compatibility issues  if i had an xbox  presumably   i d love it    but the windows    support is iffy af      
553,2.0,                         pros the buttons on the controller are not like most controllers  these buttons click like a mouse  it will take a few matches of your favorite game to get used to them but it will grow on you   the controller is sturdy and well made  i dont feel like it s going to break anytime soon  consi really wanted to love this controller  but unfortunately  i do not  the     re mappable triggers are very hard to reach  i purchased this controller specifically for the triggers on the back of the controller  i play a lot of overwatch and fps  on xbox  where taking your hands off the controller at the wrong time will cause you to die  if you re looking at buying this controller for the re mappable triggers  do yourself a favor and look elsewhere   i m  ft  in     lbs with very large hands  you re gonna have to trust me when i tell you that i have the hardest times using the triggers  in fact  i no longer try to use them at all  it s not worth it  the   triggers on the back of the device are placed terribly    of the   triggers arent really triggers  but are more like half triggers  they do serve some kind of purpose according to the instructions  but they are too small to even bother using the other two triggers are located so far down on the controller that you have to stretch your middle fingers to get to them which then makes holding the controller not comfortable  if you re going to use any of the triggers  i recommend using the two on the top   you will also have trouble getting to those comfortably as well  but its not as awkward as trying to use the ones on the back   you cannot buy additional interchangable dpads and thumbsticks  this might not seem like a bad thing since they do give you   thumbsticks and   interchangable dpads but if you want to do any other kind of combination  specifically with the thumbsticks   you re out of luck overalli would not purchase this controller due to the bad trigger placement  if you can live with a basic version of this controller  i d check out the razer wolverine tournament edition with   remappable buttons  on that controller  the   triggers that are built on the back are built onto the grips of the controller which is way easier and natural to get to   imagine where your middle fingers normally rest on the back of a normal controller  on the tournament edition of the controller  the triggers are built there  makes sense right       
554,2.0,                       standard xbox controllers have lasted longer than this one and they are     price  only a one month warranty if you buy on amazon  highly disappointed      
555,1.0,                       terrible quality  i have two of these controllers and both have problems  one of them the sound stops working so i can t use a headset  the other one completely died      
556,5.0,                       bought this for my son   he loves it   the feel  sensitivity levels  and durability of the controller are perfect for him playing his games      
557,4.0,                       i have both the ultimate and elite v  and the ultimate wins hands down  buttons that dont fail and better placement of remappable buttons to not fatigue your hands  the dpad is a bit loose for those of you stronger than an    yr old but its perfect if you dab a bit of super glue on the rear of it when you place it in and you can always take it back off without damaging it ive done it multiple times just dont use more than a thin layer  the focus feature for aiming is great too its like a secondary aim assist if you dial it in right  highly recommend been using mines for   yrs now no problems     
558,5.0,                       the lights are a bit excessive until i found out you can adjust them maybe a couple more stick extensions     
559,1.0,                       very disappointed with the controller i received  the buttons were incredibly hard to press and almost felt as though they were jammed  initially i thought that was just how the controller was designed  but after a couple mins i noticed the controller also had stuck drift  a      controller had stick drift right out of the box  never been more upset about a purchase until this one      
560,3.0,                       decided to try out the razer wolverine because my scuf  ps pro was falling apart   tactical spring cancelling and right paddle wasn t working    i use these controllers to play cod on pc so it doesn t matter whether i use a ps  controller or one built for xbox in terms of comparing this controller to a standard sony ps  or scuf  ps pro controller   the controller is big  hefty to hold  definitely  a lot bigger than your ps  controller  i would assume an xbox controller is about the same size if not bigger  overall i really liked the controller in terms of what it was capable of doing however the button placement was off for me and don t see how anyone can get use to that type of layout   for reference  i wear size medium biking gloves   i also had a scuf impact and vantage and didn t like the feel of those controllers  although i could hold it and reach every button pretty comfortably the pros of the controller for me was     back buttons in one row  pretty efficient and ease of use and reach  however it is a little farther towards the center so if you have smaller size hands definitely wouldn t find the controller comfortable   was easy to customize the button layout on pc with the xbox razer app for windows  adjustable hair triggers  probably better than the adjustable hair triggers on the scuf  clicky right   buttons  anytime you can get a mouse click type of button get it  definitely better for fps games the cons   the main discomfort i noticed right off the bat was the bumpers are oddly placed  it felt unnatural going from the trigger buttons to the bumper buttons   the movement was so off that i find myself not being able to aim correctly when using my tactical equipment   the trigger buttons are oddly shaped and pop out at an angle  the way its shaped makes you hold the controller in a certain way which makes it harder to access the bumper buttons  again it might just be me coming from a ps  controller to an xbox style controller  the m  button which is the left middle button next to lb and lt is oddly place where i would accidentally hit that button  i ended up disabling  it   now the biggest con for me and why i decided to return this was  the back top trigger button was causing my left middle finger to become bruise   the way the backside of the controller pops out it didn t allow my middle finger to rest comfortable on that button   to better describe it  it was as if my finger was resting over a bump to press that button   however  the right side was perfectly fine  i would assume that my left hand position is different from the right as the analog stick is higher up vs on the right side where the analog stick is on the bottom section of the controller   i really tried to make the controller work  tried holding different positions  tried using the bumpers as my trigger buttons  tried using the m  and m  middle clicky buttons as trigger buttons  but no matter how i held the controller my left middle finger would end up hurting overall  i liked the controller  i think it would have been the perfect controller if it was a tad bit smaller and where  the back side didn t pop out so much  it was hard to find a comfortable position to hold the controller  really wanted to make this work as i am a big fanboy for razer products  razer headset keyboard mouse etc really wanted to match the controller as well  might give the raiju ultimate a try but seeing how the controller seems very closely built to the wolverine i ll probably pass i tried a lot of high end controllers overall   for me the best feeling is still the standard sony dual shock size controller   i do agree that the left analog stick is actually more comfortable higher up however  the sacrifice is that the controllers are usually always bigger therefore a lot less comfortable in my case   if razer would build a controller based on the sony dual shocks i d be all over it in a heartbeat      
561,5.0,                       amazing quality  better than i thought actually rubber grips prevent my hands from sweating  the buttons are tactile except the replaceable dpad  i use the opendpad not the tilt locks are nicely made  cord is very well made  will definitely recommend this to people      
562,5.0,                       after using a second hand elite for about   months and it predictably started to fall apart  i began to look for a better option with the same premium feel this was really the only reasonable option since i play on pc and don t mind the wire pros   great feel in your hand  well built   buttons have a clicky mechanical feel  i could never go back to the regular sponge like ones on the elite   decent sticks  i am not a fan of concave thumb pads  but these are the best i have used  i have ordered some short convex grips from kontrol freek  xbox     ones seem to fit  wire connection is really secure  i found the elite wire falling out after   months of use and had to replace it  this wire is supported with a socket that holds the connection tight  awesome design  pretty seamless functionality with pc cons  razer synapse for xbox is trash  freezes and crashes all the time  fortunately you don t have to use it often or leave it running  can t be too mad  because all of the software made by hardware companies is garbage    nzxt  evga  msi  gigabyte    none of them can do it right  except for logitech too bad their controller is from       paddle buttons are easy to hit on accident  but it is probably just because i am not used to them  lighter weight  which could make some feel it is of a lower quality than the elite overall  a better user experience than the elite with a better warranty for    less bucks  easy choice for pc users who play wired      
563,3.0,                       it s a good controller  that s it  i would have given this a better rating but because the buttons on the back are completely useless i won t  they are very hard and awkward to push  i wish they we closer to the outside so i didn t have to stretch my fingers to press them  i am now wishing i just bought the elite series   controller in the first place      
564,1.0,                       so they make a great controller and advertise all these features  but downplay none of them being accessible on pc in whats adds up to misleading advertisement  but its made for  windows      its a collaboration between razer and microsoft not to do pc software to force people to buy xbox consoles  when pcs could be same and better  don t get me wrong  if you just want a plain old controller that works great as is  this is it for pc if you like xbox style layout  but if you are buying it for colors  remapping  forget it for pc as that only works on the xbox console  razer is a piece of crap company who makes a good re mapper for keyboards  mice  and even the mats the keyboards and mice sit on  but nothing for their  pc  controller  insane and they deserve no credit for this alliance with microsoft  how can it not be some backroom deal as they can remap everything else they make      
565,3.0,                       this tournament edition controller did not impress me as much as i was expecting  as i am a huge fan and supporter of razer products  this purchase was for use on a windows pc only  the two main reasons i had opted for this particular controller over others had let me down  first it was for the remapping of a few buttons  these are very limited as what you can with them  as a razer product i was assuming it would be more similar remapping programming as their keyboards and mice  it is not at all like that  the second main reason for this purchase is for the chroma lighting  as i have a razer mouse and keyboard with that lighting and also my case has lighting  was assuming this chroma controller would work in conjunction with the other products using their razer synapse software   this is not the case  you will need to install an app from the microsoft store to adjust control the lighting as well as any remapping of the buttons as the controller itself it feels fantastic and solid  it is very comfortable and the added paddle buttons on the bottom are fantastic  there is a bit of weight to this controller and i actually like that though i deem this controller as satisfactory  i would not make this purchase again  also i am extremely happy that i did not opt for the more expensive ultimate edition as with all reviews this is my opinion and yours may vary      
566,5.0,                       best game pad i ve ever used  trigger stops work great  all of the programmable buttons on the back are easy to reach and responsive  will give you an unfair advantage in pubg or ufc    this thing is practically a toptier gaming mouse turned into a controller  also have a problem with  broken triggers  they re still in good condition  this behemoth even survived a fall to a tile floor from  ft  if you got the money  get this sum b          
567,2.0,                       i really like the controller   it feels great however mine came with a right joystick drift out of the box   to their credit  customer service offered to replace it as long as i mailed mine in   however  i am unwilling to go     weeks without a controller   therefore  i am just dealing with the right stick drift and will try a different brand when this controller is no longer useable      
568,5.0,                       honestly i ll keep it real with you guys  this is the best controller i ve ever used  i ve owned both scuf and the series   elite controller and both of them cannot compete with this bad boy in terms of quality i ll have to give that to the wolverine  usually the thumbsticks on pro controllers go out and to this day i ve experienced no stick drift what so ever the buttons feel like mouse clicks making everything feel super responsive which is awesome the extra buttons come with a learning curve but after playing with them for about a week you ll get the hang of it and you ll notice yourself playing better i ve used this controller on both xbox and pc and i ve had no issues so far  looking forward to moving onto the new blackops from mw with this controller  it s gonna be awesome the only con i can really think of is that the controllers case is a bit flimsy when compared to the elite series    and it s wired only but if you can get over those two things  this is the controller for you      
569,5.0,                       worth every penny      
570,3.0,                       razer comes out with another good product that falls short of being great  there are a lot of great things about this controller but for the price  it still leaves much to be desired pros it s packaging  like all razer products  is top notch and feels luxurious  the power cord is long and high quality which features a cool break away feature so you do not rip the cord out of the controller or xbox  the mechanical  click  of all the buttons is very satisfying  along with the overall feel and built quality  the built in audio control is nice along with the button mapping profile selection with color  the additional top buttons inside the bumpers and triggers is a really awesome addition and they work really well  the razer synapse software is user friendly and allows you to customize the button mapping  vibration strength  led lighting  thumb stick  agile  and  focus  along with create additional profiles cons personally  i find the back buttons paddles a little hard to reach while keeping your fingers on the triggers and thumb sticks  they could have been a little more to the outside of the controller which would have improved overs accessibility  the cool feature of being able to set you thumb stick sensitivity with  agile  and  focus  is negated when you do not have them mapped to buttons on the controller which to me is dumb  why offer sensitivity adjustment when you can t use it  lastly  after just one weeks use in fps  the right trigger was sticking because of the bumper trigger design  the triggers have little lips the go over the bumper and if not aligned cause the trigger to stick  i use the bumpers  not the triggers  to aim and fire but somehow this still happened and i had to bend the trigger a little to get it to work properly which was kinda sad after only using for a week overall  this is a really good controller but like other razer products i ve tried  it just falls short of being great because of minor design flaws      
571,5.0,                       i don t own any consoles  but play a lot of games on pc that are just better with a handheld controller  the quality is awesome and the sensitivity on the toggles is fantastic  don t really used the extra buttons on most games  and usually turn them off since i accidently hit them and are usually bond to the same key as another button on the face      
572,1.0,                       you can not remap the extra buttons for custom keybinds  only other buttons that you already have  x  y  a  b  etc      
573,2.0,                       originally when i first received the controller it was great  after a few months of use  the lb and rb button have degraded and are no longer staying pressed or press too fast  its as if it isn t fully contacting and does what the controllers of old with the  turbo  button would do  pressing it on and off really fast  razer if you re reading this  i have a support ticket open for this and it s been    days and i haven t heard from your support team  my case   is                i don t recommend this one as the controller can t hold up to normal use and customer service has yet to respond to me      
574,3.0,                       used it for a couple of days then returned the controller  first impression was wow this controller feels and looks nice  did not feel cheap at all  i noticed that some of the direction buttons would get stuck on menus for no reason both days several times a day  so i returned it seeing that it was      and already glitchy  the response time while playing was honestly the same did not see a major difference compared to regular xbox controller  it is wired also kinda disappointing  the back buttons are neat though and top mid buttons as well      
575,3.0,                       i love the feel and how all the buttons click  also being able to make a large number of control schemes is a huge plus  the only down is that it started not working all the time  then every game i played with it would act like i m moving the camera up and move fast  disclaimer i bought a refurbished model  if it didn t have that issue it would be the best xbox one controller      
576,5.0,                    los botones son muy diferentes al control original  se siente como un rat n o mouse al tocarlo  es muy liviano y c modo mas puedes cambiar los botes etc         
577,5.0,                       tired of going through batteries   this is your answer  all around great gaming controller   takes a bit to get used to a couple buttons  which sit up higher on controller  but really responsive and quiet      
578,1.0,                       ought this controller thinking it would be on par with the cbox elite controller or better  in less than three months the headset jack at the bottom with the mute button has already become defective and any headset will no longer work with it pretty disappointed after dropping a crazy amount of coin for this toggles on the bottom are also very uncomfortable and almost seem to far down on the back of the controller making it difficult to get used to      
579,2.0,                       this controller is really good  really comfortable but i don t think its worth the price of       i did alot of research on the product before i purchased it and i was extremely excited to receive it  i had to return the first one because of stick drift  but the second one also had stick drift so i just sent both back to get my money back and now im just waiting on a refund but i did purchase the power a fusion pro and its alot better with great sticks and zero stick drift even on   deadzone for warzone   i use controller on pc      
580,1.0,                       i haven t had a chance to try the product because the one i received did not function correctly hence the one star review      
581,3.0,                       the controller itself is very nice  but with in the first couple hours of playing with it the right trigger button began to fail to register clicks  i play a game that utilizes the right trigger as a main button of play i was looking for a controller similar to the razer wildcat and this one is perfect  im just very disappointed with the quality of the controller that was shipped to me      
582,5.0,                         tournament edition review  i play on xbox and pc frequently and often prefer controller to laze back  i ve personally found scuf controllers to be mediocre  haven t bothered with the pricey ass elite but i don t plan to  i absolutely love the powera fusion  however i ve gone through   of those in less than a year  so i decided to give this thing a try  loving the tournament edition so far  grabbed it on sale for    my only gripe with this controller are the default short thumbsticks  as opposed to the ultimate edition   i already knew about this but then i saw that the extra kontrolfreeks i had for xbox one didn t work  i heard that the     ps  ones did  so i bought some and they have a very snug fit  work perfectly  other than that  no complaints  you can customize the controller vibration sensitivity  there s a focus and agile feature that only work upon holding down a remappable button that s pretty neat  wish they would just activate deactivate upon press instead overall the controller just has a really nice feel to it back buttons are way more attractive than the ultimate s in my opinion  all the extra buttons feel good  the remapping is limited but i was already planning to have them remapped to the face buttons  be warned though  m  ans m  have a slight buzzy noise if pressing simultaneously  it doesn t bother me personally but i figured it might bother someone else you can also customize the rgb through their app if the default flashy lightshow bothers you    i made mine a static red no issues so far  will update as i use regularly and switch out occasionally with my current fusion controller update mar        still using this controller  and i absolutely love it  i prefer it over my fusion by a landslide         
583,2.0,                       love the feel n weight of this controller  plays great    but the analog stick is already going out   beware of purchasing this refurbished controller      
584,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          ehhhh i have mixed feelings about this controller       here s why  yes i really do like it and do believe it is better built then the elite controller  the buttons are a firm press the controller is strongly built and all around i like it better  but what sucks is this controller is not fully compatible with my   very nice headsets  turtle beach and astros  i can plug them in using the straight aux but there is no way to hook up my adapters to mute and control volume   now i did not notice this till after i purchased it but they do offer the next  package up  for this controller which that adapter is then built into the controller  i contacted customer service and unfortunately they do not make an adapter for my controller and nicely suggest i buy one of theres that was compatible  i won t be doing that but i will be keeping the controller cause why not   but overall i like how its built just if you want to use headsets that aren t razer buy the next one up  lol       
585,5.0,                       i love this controller  i ve never had the chance to try out an actual elite controller but i have a feeling i would still prefer the razor  buttons on the razor feel so nice and the input time seems great  i use it for pubg mostly and it was a great addition to the setup  i love never having to worry about batteries      
586,5.0,                       was torn between this and the elite    inevitably  i opted for this one simply because it was prime and could be here in   days     days later i received it   lolit got lost in shipping  and i couldn t be happier  this thing is buttery smooth  responsive  and doesn t eat batteries   i didnt think i would use all   buttons  cod  but i do  agility and focus are on   of them  it s just a well built controller  it doesn t feel as heavy and premium as the elite did  but the performance is bar none as good if not better xbox one s     
587,1.0,                       delivered april    headphone jack stopped working july  th  worked for    days  the window for return closed on may     this item was          ridiculous         
588,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          stick drift     
589,3.0,                       i bought this under the assumption that the customization options would be available for pc  as it s marketed as a pc  and xbox  controller  sadly  there s no way to customize the controller using the pc software  the controller is sturdy and has lots of paddles buttons that most controllers don t have  but if you re not playing on xbox it s kind of a brick compared to made for pc controllers  definitely disappointed i have a razer keyboard and mouse i love  definitely not a brand bash  but this shouldn t be marketed as a pc controller  all xbox controllers can be used with windows    at a base level       add the controller to the synapse software will get you   stars   i expected this allowing me to map buttons to pc keystrokes will get you   stars   why wouldn t you add this       
590,3.0,                       good controllersolid craftsmanshipnon programmable keys on pcobnoxious  non disableable light stripthis is probably better for an xbox  first razer hardware i ve ever purchased that doesn t even communicate with synapse  waste of extra buttons since they can t be changed and most are just dupes of existing buttons  not being able to reprogram them defeated the purpose of buying it for the extra butto a      
591,1.0,                       it worked great for less than   months  a button no longer registers like     of the time though  and now it s unusable  nothing is physically wrong with it as you can see  probably gonna go with a scuf controller now  would not recommend buying this controller      
592,4.0,                       good controller but face buttons are gummy  maybe that means it will last longer  but i otherwise don t care for that aspect of it luckily the whole point of a pro controller is mapping the face buttons to the back top so you don t have to take your fingers off the thumbsticks      
593,5.0,                       best controller i ve had       
594,1.0,                       this product is defective   razer company will be refund my money because i didn t purchase it on their website   amazon shouldn t carry this product if you cannot refund it      
595,4.0,                       great controller but gosh darn over priced  if you like a wired controller  great  if you actually want to mess around with the back paddles to get a leg up  great  if you re like me who just plays on the weekend with the boys back home  snag a cheaper model      
596,3.0,                       i really enjoy all of my razer products but this controller left me surprisingly disappointed  the face buttons are too heavy for my liking  the d pad is atrocious with  down  feeling completely different than other directions  i like the analog sticks and razer s app for customizing and the sensitivity macro but still all together a      from me     
597,1.0,                       a button completely stopped working  warranty was only for   month  i am so mad      
598,4.0,                       just wanna start off by saying i love this controller  it s comfortable in my hands  the mechanical switches are very tactile  the trigger stops work great  the interchangable parts are very well designed  but there are a few relatively minor issues with this controller that prevent me from being able to leave a   star review my major gripe is that after roughly a year of regular use   just long enough for the warranty to expire  i started getting a very noticeable drift from the analog sticks  i m on my second one of these controllers  and both experienced the same issue  first the left stick and then the right one  and the issue just gets worse with time  and since the issue started about a month after the warranty expired  you re forced to just replace the controller or learn to deal with the drift  my only other complaint lies with the software that you are required to use in order to remap the extra buttons  the app only allows you to rebind those buttons to existing inputs  and nothing extra  this means you are forced to bind them to x  y  b  a etc  you can not bind them to  for example  additional hot keys in a mmo for items abilities or whatever  and there is zero way to do this  even if you are on a pc  because razer forces you to use their crappy software to rebind the keys      
599,1.0,                       i can t believe i spent so much money for a control and already broke  lasted   months  my husband is who uses it and really takes care of it  the left stick gets stuck  i don t know if it was defective from the beginning     
600,1.0,                       so this is actually the second controller i got after returning the first to amazon  the x button was faulty after a few days on the first controller  i got the second controller about   months ago and now the x button is doing the same thing  it will activate normally sometimes  then it will just be a dead button or activate      times  i use this controller to play a lot of  d side scrollers  so it is very noticeable when i can t attack when i want to  the return window is closed so now i have to see if razer will let me replace this for a new one great controller otherwise  but seems to be an issue with their key button switches  i can not recommend this controller to other people after having issues within such a short time frame      
601,5.0,                       this razor wolverine controller is a very awesome controller and it is exactly if not more than what was expected  i am very happy and pleased with the quality of the of the item i would recommend this controller for any gamer who wants to up his game the remappable programmable paddles are a straight game changer i absolutely love it      
602,5.0,                       so i started using this for halo and apex on the pc  the controller is phenomenal  only problem was the cops showed up at my door cause my gunplay was on another level    thanks razer     
603,5.0,                       i love it  the swappable sticks makes it extremely nice for customizing your perfect controller  i tried the xbox elite series   twice before deciding to go with this controller  the series   just had too many problems  along with stick drift and loose paddles  the only thing i d say is an issue  would be the paddles are slightly far for finger reach  so if you have smaller hands  maybe go with a scuf      
604,1.0,                       i have used microsoft elite controller which works fine just wanted to try for a better comfort which this accomplished however even after a year using the aforementioned and having to go back to it  the buttons on this controller started failing after only two months  very dissapointed in the life of product verses price buy a scuf controller its worth the price         
605,2.0,                       the wolverine is not a  bad  controller  the buttons are all responsive and for those using it on an xbox    it probably works as well or better than alternatives  the big problem here is for pc  razor has taken it on them selves to not allow the paddles or any button to be remapped to anything outside of and xbox controller button  this makes the controller near useless for a pc sadly  even playing games that support xbox controllers your paddles  which i would assume is one of the large reasons for shelling out the dough for this  are still just repeats personally after playing with it for a while i dont see that using the paddles as an alternative to the regular abxy buttons is any real benefit for     of games  if you search around you might see people mention rewasd  unfortunately rewasd sees this as a regular xbox one controller instead of elite and does not let you remap the paddles which again kinda negates the reason to buy this controller over cheaper alternatives  rewasd says that to make the controller paddles work they would need cooperation from razor which they dont get  with wolverine v  not including paddles i would say it is likely never to be supported at this point after many hours of google fu i was unable to find anything that gave me hope of remapping the paddles making this just an over priced xbox one controller more or less      
606,3.0,                       the controller glitches a lot when you switch pads out and the trigger stoppers don t full work   looks very nice paddles help a lot just was hoping for a better trigger stopping setup     
607,5.0,                       i normally pull out my controller when i don t play competitive  but wow  i only play with this controller now  no more keyboard mouse for games  i usually play rainbow six siege competitively and i ve increased my ranks quite a bit  the trigger lock on this really helps with those single shots  the controller is responsive  durable  and really good looking      
608,2.0,                       controller plays and controls great  buttons are well placed  and the  hair trigger  function is cool headset doesn t play xbox audio  but chat works  mic and hearing teammates   headset plays on other controllers  this just randomly occurred last night while playing  and i ve not been able to figure it out      
609,1.0,                       i think this is a highly addictive and toxic device  ordered it as a christmas gift for my boyfriend  he is now a zombie    i have not seen him the same since  i can t get him away from it  he just grunts when i try to talk to him and he won t put it down      
610,3.0,                       i loved the controller when i first bought it  but now my x button is making a snapping noise evertime i push it down and one of my analog sticks literally snapped in half during a racing game  yes i crashed into a wall afterwards was embarassing  but over all it is a good controller has a nice feel vibrations are strong and buttons are responsive  just wish it wasnt breaking already      
611,4.0,                       definitely feels better to use than a standard xbox controller  not sure if its exactly worth the extra cost  but its definitely an improvement  contrary to most people s opinions on here you can rebind the keys and change the rgb on pc by downloading the synapse for xbox app from the windows store  i dig it      
612,1.0,                       these are bad and by the time you re    days is up to return it   it s completely not working      
613,2.0,                         stars for the controller  it feel good in the hand and it doesn t feel cheap  but it didn t have other   stars because i received and broken controller  the lt button and the left side of controller was completely broke  i don t know what happen  maybe something went wrong during the shipping process  i still love razer product  but they need to be clear the description of the product  there s should be a different between  used very good  and  used broken       
614,4.0,                       let me start off by saying i absolutely love razer and everything they make  i m literally writing this review on a razer phone    now that that s said i got this controller for rocket league and it immediately has stick drift on the right stick  you can clearly see it on the locket league main menu since it starts to spin slowly immediately  i ll be returning for a replacement and hopefully it s a fluke because razer        does not make bad products       do not prove me wrong razer      
615,2.0,                       purchased this because my last controller had no grip left on the sticks  the audio port gave out  and couldn t hold a charge  the controller looks nice and flashy but that s where the pros end  i ve tried going through my xbox to remap the buttons in the back but the xbox doesn t detect them  so i m stuck with binds that are less than optimal  also when trying to use a headset with this controller on pc all i get is high pitched screeching i can hear in the next room  overall i m very disappointed with my purchase and can t understand how this controller can be used by pros      
616,2.0,                       ordered this controller in april      as an alternative to getting the more expensive microsoft elite controller  intending it to be a kind of middle ground  with some of the elite features the good feels great in your hands  with very tactile   clicky  buttons  comfortable rubberized grips  and good resistance on the sticks and other buttons  the adjustable depth triggers are great  as are the   additional buttons the added buttons triggers were the primary reason i had bought this controller  very nice  premium feeling product the bad by mid june  the y face button started working intermittently  sometimes it would register keypresses  other times not  cleaning with compressed air and rubbing alcohol did not have any effect  yes  you can re map the button to one of the additional buttons triggers as a band aid fix   but why should you have to do this for a  premium  product at a premium price  twice that of a standard microsoft wireless controller   from a reputable manufacturer like razer  it s disappointing to have the controller fail after   months   of course outside amazon s return window  especially so when you consider the price difference of the wolverine versus a standard ms wireless controller  and the fact that those same regular controllers can last years without such issues  really disappointing the ugly razer support has taken almost a month from the initial inquiry on june   th  and the issue with the controller has still not been resolved at of july     after   and a half weeks of sporadic communication  sending the same information multiple times  it has taken    days to hear back from an rma representative  which was expected  within    hours   i understand  and razer has a very clear statement about this  the added challenges of working during the pandemic  but these kinds of interactions do not need to be extended for nearly a month to wrap up it s a great controller while it works  but considering the price and the extremely poor longevity  it s certainly not worth the premium over the standard microsoft controller  the experience dealing with razer s support sours the whole experience  would have much rather just returned directly to amazon and been done with it      
617,1.0,                       no rear panels  you have to use every finger to be competitive nowadays and they are just going to release another controller later with them  don t waste your money  wait or buy the wolverine tournament edition      
618,1.0,                       started off as a decent controller  it went downhill very fast  i play call of duty a lot and the sticks seem to stick and mess up your movement and it also randomly makes your character look straight up which is horrible  will not buy again  don t waste your money  now looking for a new controller cause i can t take this anymore      
619,1.0,                       shipping was fine  product arrived undamaged   it looks ok  however the controller box was missing its seal   upon further inspection there were finger prints and smudges all over the controller   would have been expected from a used controller but i ordered this one as new   this is not a review on the quality of the razer controller  it only speaks to the condition that i received it      
620,2.0,                       i love razer but god the light on the top of this thing is obscenely bright  the bottom buttons are in the most annoying spot if you do not want them  this is also a wired controller only by the way which i personally like  the buttons have a click feel that people complain about when i have them use it  it basically feels like a mouse which again i like  the main thing for me is the light on the top  i play in the dark and this thing is blinding      
621,5.0,                       i love this controller  i had reservations because it is wired  but the trade off is the build quality  warranty and the overall style  even the cord is this nice braided nylon  definitely not cheap looking  you get what you pay for  thus the premium price      
622,5.0,                       i bought this because microsoft had taken the elite   off the shelves due to poor quality and my original elite s paddles no longer function  i was wary at first  i ve never been a fan of pretty much all  rd party controllers  but i own other razer products for my computer so i took the gamble  and wow  was i impressed  this thing feels amazing to hold  the buttons are clicky and quick and having   extra shoulder buttons is way nicer than it seems  you don t get as many thumbstick options  you can t adjust the sensitivity curve of the joysticks in the software either  the cord is plenty long so don t worry about it not being wireless  all in all  this thing is great and i actually prefer it over microsoft s own option  the back paddles are nearly impossible to hit on accident  something i d do with the elite all the time  if you re looking for a replacement  or for your first  pro  controller  i highly recommend this one      
623,1.0,                       this controller was great  until it randomly stopped working after only using it for   months  i plugged it in the other day and it just doesn t work anymore  all connections intact  very disappointing         
624,3.0,                       the remapping of the   buttons is easy  but i ve had a few issues i wouldnt expect from a premium controller   i occasionally have stick drift on the right stick   if i push slightly to the left then it stays in that direction slightly   i ve had issues with both dpads that come with it as well   the button style gets stuck on the up position locking my controls out and the rocker style gets stuck in the left position and causes my weapons to single fire in warzone   if it wasnt for those issues i would like this controller alot     
625,5.0,                       if you re committed to competitive gaming  this is a great product  comfortable  pretty  and durable i did have one issue with some sound my party mates were hearing but after contacting support on reddit  a quick firmware update solved the problem i can t compare it with the other two top brands since i ve never had them make sure to keep the box as the unit itself only has a partial serial number used for registration and support  seems kind of dumb but i haven t found a way to find my products sn on my xbox pc     
626,4.0,                       i had a slight issue with the right thumbstick being twitchy with a deadzone of less than       otherwise it has been far superior to my old scuf that had nothing but issues from day one      
627,2.0,                       the controller feels great but after a month of having it the left thumb stick has started to randomly stop registering input  while playing it ll move my character to a crawl or sometimes not even register that i m moving it at all  i m waiting to hear back from razer on this matter and hopefully they ll be able to help me find a solution to the issue      
628,2.0,                       poor mechanical reliability after   month of normal use  too bad it cannot remap to other buttons other than their  multi  buttons      
629,5.0,                       a xbox controller with the sensitivity of a ps  one  much better than a regular or the elite  def worth it at this price or any lower if one can find it  all buttons are easily accessible con  not wireless will update after a few months of constant use yaknow   razer is sony s pc brand so it s good      
630,1.0,                       bought this controller for my son  used it for    days and key buttons stopped functioning  wish i would have returned as it  unusable and collecting dust      
631,1.0,                       i ve only had this controller for one year and it is completely busting on me  whenever i push on the left analog stick  the controller registers that i am also pushing up on the right analog stick  this is an extremely annoying problem      
632,5.0,                       i love it  best xbox remote i ve ever used  it s slim and light  satisfying clicky buttons  i do use control freaks before i bought this  they don t fit the analog sticks  but side from that they re great      
633,5.0,                       i ve gone through too many xbox one controller  all of them have an analog stick issue with drifting by itself without pressing it after a while noticeable in games like rocket league or other car games  this though is the best controller with clicky keys   way more durable than an xbox controller   would definitely recommend i can live without the chroma colors   would be nice to just have a hard switch button to turn it off on the controller itself   razery synapse softwares is garbage right now      
634,1.0,                       i ve had this product for a couple of months and the sensor in the left analog stick is already starting to give out  if you re comparing this with some of the more well known but slightly more expensive options  i d recommend purchasing one of those other options instead      
635,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i like the ergonomics and triggers are very comfortable on the fingers  the rumble also feels very nice because it s not too strong  the extra tiny bumpers come in handy as well  they are set to a and x which is nice for a bumper jumper set up without having to change control schemes in the game  the share and  start  button placement take a bit to get used to and i ran into an annoying problem  if you hold down either bumper first then hold down the trigger  the trigger rubs against the bumpers  it makes a loud click and lifts the bumper in the process  i feel over time it will break off because it also prevents fluid movement of the trigger  i demonstrated the problem in my video      
636,5.0,                       great controller  works right out the box  and i am able to remap function button with no hassle      
637,5.0,                       for the wolverine v  better than the xbox elite v  have them both i dont care about paddles on the back i hit them when i dont mean too so i dont use them it takes a millisecond to move thumb to a button i love the mechanical buttons so much better than the squishy xbox elite buttons my new favorite controller yes it is wired and that is a good thing no lag no batteries like any controller it will not make you better you are only as good as you are better design and comfort love it wont go back to a xbox controller elite or otherwise      
638,1.0,                       please read  i bought this controller dec     today is dec     it has already stopped working  this is not a good buy regardless of the hype if they are packaging selling and delivering dud controllers  there is no qc at razor      
639,5.0,                       love this controller        
640,3.0,                       responsive but very cheap feeling  no where near as solidly built as elite series controller   way to expensive  friend has broke his after two weeks  i expect the same      
641,2.0,                       christmas present for my son  he loved the item  raved about the features  however  just a few days after product support window closed  the left analog stick stopped working  i can t find anywhere for product support  lesson learned   purchase the asurion warranty  disappointed for sure      
642,4.0,                       volume controls can be a little tricky  sticks aren t as smooth as an elite controller  and controller body is just a little bit small  otherwise  perfect      
643,5.0,                       i bought this controller and i ve had it for at least a month and honestly  it s great  i ve never actually used a pro or a elite controller before but i enjoyed it  it s comfortable  the button mapping is great  it sounds like a mouse clicking when pressing the buttons  trigger locks so you can press down the triggers faster  and don t forget  lights  playing this at night while the controller is lit up is just such a great feeling because the only thing that s lighting up your room is the tv and the controller      
644,2.0,                       so this controller was absolutely amazing to start out with  i bragged about it to all of my friends  i have larger hands so i do not like the xbox elite controller because of where the buttons are on the back  but the   buttons in the back on the middle of the controller are amazing for gaming and functionality  i had the wolverine ultimate controller so the one plus side is razer customer service has been very helpful and because of this i gave the controller an extra star  but other than that just disappointment  if i spend     dollars on a controller i expect the controller will last me a very long time but this controller is not built to last  i only had it   months and take very good care of it but it is unfortunately just not made for daily use  the m  button on the back has become loose and when pressed down it also activates the m  button which makes both buttons completely useless because who wants one button to do two jobs  in addition to the a button on the front does not bounce back so often times i press it and it just holds in  which is very disruptive to play   stars because i only had the controller for   months    now it is unusable        
645,1.0,                       you can only remap the  extra  buttons to an existing controller button  and   functions that increase decrease the sensitivity of the sticks    in my case i was hoping to use the extra buttons as more buttons to use on my controller  however they can only clone one of the existing buttons   i was hoping this was just a limitation in razer s software  but even with a  rd party controller mapper these  extra  buttons can not be assigned since the firmware doesn t see them as their own buttons and will only let them perform the function of one of the existing controller buttons but other than the misleading advertising and crap pc customization  this is a pretty nice controller pros sturdy housingresponsive buttonscons dpad buttons are more effort to press than other controllers and can lead to fatiguewired extra  buttons can only clone existing controller buttonsupdate   after    months  product has a   month warranty   the b button no longer works properly  it has to be mashed down with extra force   i guess i found a use for the extra shoulder buttons that can only be remapped to an existing button   disappointing for a      controller   i will be looking elsewhere for my next controller purchase      
646,5.0,                       i bought this controller after having gone through   xbox one elite controllers  those have lasted me  on average  about   years each  both have ended up with busted bumpers  due to the infamously poorly designed dampeners they put on there  as well as the left joystick becoming non functional after the many times i ve used it while playing cod games  for running  i play mostly fps shooters so take that in mind i was ready to pony up another     for a new elite controller again but came across the razer ultimate and decided  after doing my research online and on youtube  that i would give the razer a shot  i have not thought twice about my purchase and am a new  loyal fan of the razer ultimate  it has a sturdy build  feels solid in the hands and responds like a dream a couple of things worth mentioning  if you use kontrol freaks  they will not fit on these because the knobs are too wide    but  i was able to trim the edges of the rubber on the knob and get the kontrol freak on with no issue  look it up on youtube another thing that had me hesitant was the fact that this was not a wireless controller  but the chord is plenty long  that  combined with the reduced latency  since it s plugged in  makes it an even trade off for me in the end  do your own research to make the best decision for yourself  but personally  i am loving this controller      
647,5.0,                       i ve been playing with it all day  and i can say that it feels amazing  at first i thought that the back triggers were going to be hard to reach due to how they are positioned  and how my hands are not that big  the truth is that i was surprised with how perfectly everything is placed and how i can reach every single button and trigger without much effort  button mapping with synapse is easy to do  but if you want to do so on the go while in a match  you can with the mapping button the controller provides  this controller is amazing      
648,5.0,                       there is a app on the xbox one store to set it up lights  paddle and extra bumpers remapping snipe and speed boost for the joysticks  that you can assign to the   pads or the   bumps aux connection  braided cord  d pad feels weird if you came from the elite controller control the vibe in grip and trigger locking triggers  badass lightshow settings no vibe feedback that catch through the mic worth the price      
649,5.0,                       bought this back in september  waiting till now so i could give a give accurate review  it s amazing  i have no  complaints at all  it functions as well as the day i bought it  i use it on pc for competitive gaming  super fast response time   trigger locks work great  remapping paddles is easy  love it      
650,4.0,                       it s light  response time is good  thumbsticks are very sensitive      
651,5.0,                       i have been a razer fan for over a decade now  i have most of their pc gaming products   am never disappointed when i see something new from them  it s always super slick looking  wicked engineering design   made with the highest quality parts   this controller is no exception  i have the ms pro controller          really enjoy it  up until this controller  it was my favorite  the weight difference was a little strange at first  but once i got used to the lighter controller   everything has been better  my personal fave  the slow down trigger   excellent for landing those precise head shots   head shots  head shots  head shots for all my friends        
652,5.0,                       i really love the feel of this controller  i have the tournament edition too  but this is a whole lot better if you want more buttons  i doubt i ll ever use them all but it s great to have just in case      
653,5.0,                       i got this for my grandson for christmas and he loved it  really enjoyes playing with it      
654,5.0,                       razer wolverine ultimate for xb  so  i ve had this controller for a while now and it is a great buy  i ve had and used everything from original controllers  scuf controllers  even built my own scuffs  but so far  this one simply wins pros   comfortable with textured grips and paddles to allow hours of handling without issues   crisp buttons  plus the bumpers are so much easier to reach and press  also making an audible  click  when pressing  this goes for the abxy buttons too   more programmable buttons  program the ones you need   even disable the ones you don t    both potentially pro and con    it s wired  never worry about charging  making the controller even more lightweight and comfortable  the cord is long enough and is strongly braided  even having the traditional quick disconnect if tripped on   customizable lighting on the controller and light intensity   control of rumbler intensity in grips and triggers   magnetized thumbsticks  it comes with a molded case with extra  extended thumbsticks   magnetized d pad   feels super solid  it s not flimsy feeling  it is not  cheap and plasticky   it has no  hollow feel or clicking  sound when playing  it feels nice and dense in build quality   sound control  easily balance game and chat on the controller cons  no mic monitoring at all  so far  there is simply no fix for this   the extra bumpers on the controller are nice and crisp  but have the slightest play in them and you can hear a bit of rattle if you shake the controller  this is only the back bumpers  and does not take away from any of the quality of it best tip i ve read reviews that there is no synapse app for windows     this is true  but you can store   player profiles on the controller  distinguished by green and blue leds   using the synapse app  setup one profile for console  and the other for pc  in one click  you can easily switch from one to the other the only thing left to see is its durability  i take care of my equipment  so we ll see how well it holds up to wear  otherwise  i plan on sticking with this controller from now on      
655,1.0,                       i m primarily a keyboard and mouse player  but i occasionally like to use a controller when playing lengthy rpgs  it lets me sit back and relax a bit in a way i just can t do with a normal pc setup  i initially bought a generic  rd party xbox     controller since i prefer the feel of a     controller over the xbox one design  however that cheap controller arrived with a deadzone on the left stick  so not wanting a repeat of the previous purchase i decided to buy something a little pricier so that i wouldn t need to worry about build quality and cheap parts  after looking around i eventually convinced myself to drop the     for this during a sale  needless to say i was pretty excited  the product arrived quickly with prime and was working out off the box  that didn t last long  less than a month in fact as for the controller itself   its one of the best feeling controllers i ve ever used  the rubberized grips feel great  the travel distance on the face buttons felt weird initially  as you don t have to press as deeply to get them to click as you would on standard console controllers  but after a few days i was used to it  and it felt better than other controls  the extra buttons on the back were something i ve never used before but i quickly found myself using them instead of the face buttons  why take my finger of  a   button to turn with the right stick when i can hold the back trigger to run and turn at the same time in order to change the lighting on pc you need to download some razer software which i find entirely unnecessary  the controller does not work with synapse  so if you already own a razer product and have already installed synapse you need to download separate software solely for the controller  the software itself is pretty bare bones  you can only change the lighting  and rebind the triggers to other bottoms  for example you can bind the left back trigger to any other button on the controller but you can t bind it to pc keys software aside this is without an exaggeration one of the best controllers i ve  ever used  but  as you ve probably guessed from the review score  there was a huge issue with it  within less than a month the controller broke on me  i m no stranger to broken controllers but i ve never had such a premium controller fail after so short a time   after about    hrs of total use i pressed the right trigger and it sunk in and would not pop back out  i thought dust or dirt may have caused it to stick but after so little use there is no way that much dust dirt could have built up  i cleaned it with compressed air just in case and in doing so noticed some broken plastic through a gap in the trigger  i looked online to see if there was a quick fix and found that this issue is more common than one would expect  tons of forum posts with the same issue  and in every case there wasn t really much the users could do but reach out to razer support  so that s what i did  with a cheap  rd party controller i don t care if if breaks and don t bother with returns or support but with a     dollar controller i have different expectations a part of my real world job requires i often reach out to company s support and while i have generally had issues with some it is overall a straightforward experience that results in my getting the support i need  not so with razer  after sending a proof of purchase and an explanation of the issue that was clearly a hardware issue with the device itself they asked i send a video of the issue  i do so and when i hear back they ask i try connecting the controller to another usb slot on my pc  why  the video already showed it was a hardware issue  ok i comply and naturally nothing changes and i let them know  they then ask me to connect the controller to an xbox or another pc  again  why  so after about a week of putting of with even more of their pointless responses and not getting anywhere closer to getting a replacement device i decided to go instead through amazon  i was fortunate enough that the controller broke within the    day amazon return period so i was able to send in the controller with no questions asked  i just needed to drop off to a ups store   i am currently waiting on the replacement and will update this review when i receive the second  here is hoping the quality control isn t as bad this time around      
656,5.0,                       so much better then any other controllerliterally mold to my hands and no stick drifteven after heavy abuse speaking behalf of my friend who s owned one for a few months now   go getcha self a razor wolverine now       
657,5.0,                       i am genuinely satisfied with this controller  was looking for a more competitive controller with paddles buttons on the bottom that didn t cost      or      like other brands charged  razer delivered  the controllers feels just right in the hands although it does feel smaller than the default xb  controller  also be aware that the thumb sticks are slightly bigger than the default controller meaning you will not be able to put on kontrolfreeks  anyways great controller  the buttons feel nice  the controller fits nice in your hands   the cable is braided more durable  the part of the controller where the charging cable connects to the controller is super secure meaning it won t bend at the weak point the way it does on other controllers  has a great app that makes it easier to customize your button layout  and the icing on the cake is  it has a gorgeous lighting system allowing you customize it any way you want  great controller especially for the price      
658,3.0,                       i have had this controller for one month and the characters on controller buttons have worn away  razer customer support told me that they will not warranty and item from a non authorized dealer  they were going to give me a   time free replacement  in my opinion it s overpriced for the quality that you get       
659,5.0,                       love it that you can plug your headphones directly in no need for after market amps  adjustable trigger pull i probably should have gotten the razer wolverine tournament edition for     more      
660,5.0,                       a lot smaller than i thought it would be it s about the same size as a ps  controller but still very high quality definitely the best pro controller i ve had and i ve used them all     
661,5.0,                       great set of headphones  great quality and i hope they will last a while  noise canceling feature is awesome  you can only hear what goes on in the game with no background noises to interfere  would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a quality headset without having to spend a lot of money      
662,5.0,                       gave this as a gift to my grandson  and he loves it   he said it s truly an  ultimate  game controller of the year   aside from his pc  it can also be attached to his nintendo switch lite  which he enjoys playing because of the razer wolverine controller         
663,5.0,                       this is by far the best and slim controller  the triggers feel so much better than regular xbox controllers  i would highly recommend buying one of these  very lightweight  playing warzone with this has gotten me multiple dubbs      
664,1.0,                       i ve tried every  pro  controller currently on the market for the xbox one pc and honestly they all suck    this one is easily the worst one  it isn t wireless  the extra buttons are in an awful place  and everything feels cheap  in my brutally honest opinion  just stick with the normal xbox one controller  but if you need to remap buttons to stupid paddles or something on the back then just get the xbox one elite controller and buy a new one every    days when it dies and it s out of warranty      
665,3.0,                       after going through   elite controllers in the past   years  i was looking for an alternate and dove in when black friday came along  amazon has always been great in getting product to my house when promised and this arrived a day early to my surprise  anxious to give it a try  i opened it and quality looked and felt great although a bit light and doesn t feel as good in my hands as the elite does  i prefer some weight to my controller   although i would have love to try this out  my hands did not fit up to all of the back buttons  i wear ml gloves for reference  i could not reach the bottom buttons without rotating my hands towards the bottom to hit the m    buttons thus dragging either my left or right thumb sticks with it  i think if you have long fingers or larger hands  this wouldn t be an issue  i hope this helped out people that may have the same size hands as i do      
666,2.0,                       the controller dropped from my table and the fall had broken my right trigger   if it was an elite controller it would be fixable   bought a second one and the rb button is linked to the select and in some games this is very annoying and game breaking would return right away if you have the same problem       
667,4.0,                       update  so i bit the bullet and upgraded to win     it s still free   google it   after another brand s high priced controller died within a week   while you can t remap buttons to a keyboard s keys  the feel of the controller and the paddles are nice   no drift so far requires windows    software that must be downloaded through the microsoft app store   what shouldn t need to do clever workarounds to get a gamepad to be recognized by my pc      
668,1.0,                       i am very dissatisfied with the performance of this controller  the first time i bought it  within a week the left trigger would stick down and not come back up  it was unplayable so i sent it back and ordered a new one  the second time i bought it  the right joystick s sensitivity was almost like completely gone  i had to up my game sensitivity to a    to even play with it because of how slowly it moved  i even took another controller to test them both and sure enough the wolverine was moving about a quarter of the speed of the other controller  only when i actually pushed the joystick down and moved it to the right or left did it move at a regular speed  what i am saying is these controllers are made cheap  and i take care of my products and it is unfortunate to see such a great concept ruined by cheap manufacturing      
669,3.0,                       i m kind disappoint my left stick stop working properly  i purchased in november is no good      
670,1.0,                       the software for pc this uses is a terrible xbox port instead of razor synapse   the buttons are also programmable   i wish razer would put effort into making pc software for this      
671,1.0,                       if it had subscribe and save i would give it one and a half  started glitching days after the warranty ran out  not worth the money  with less than      hours played  i almost exclusively played warframe this past year when using my xbox  the left bumper started glitching  glaringly obvious when play limbo and instead of sliding you roll into the rift  also notable when rotating through menus with the bumpers  zero glitches when going right and intermittent glitches when going left  figuring  why not  i submitted a ticket before the review to see if razer would stand behind their product so close the the end of the warranty  no  they hide behind their policy  since the amazon selected retailer wasn t an  authorized  reseller they used that to brush of the already expired warranty  morally reprehensible and legally questionable  so  there you have it potential buyers  rather than merely pointing to the warranty being expired they drudged up a policy that would have left me hanging if there was a glitch on day one  so  if you mean to buy this controller and the seller isn t  amazon direct  i wouldn t buy it  or  if you insist feel free to email razer support to verify the validity of the seller      
672,1.0,                       if you want another rgb toy and you want to download and install idiotic bloatware to  make it all da shiny light things go color pretty   then this controller is for you if you re above the age of    have an iq greater than a brick s   and actually want a frickin  controller  look somewhere else   preferably anywhere but razer      
673,5.0,                       this controller is far and away the best gaming experience i ve ever had  the textured grips take a little time to get used to but eventually feel like you re not holding anything  especially after long or intense gaming sessions the extra paddles and sensitivity buttons really change the way i understand the games i play and really help me get in the game the configuration app is very easy to use  and offers a comprehensive guide to what everything does and really makes the controller custom to the user also good quality in the manufacturing side  holds up to rage and controller abuse very well  one slight issue  occasionally  the controller will not transmit an input  and that has lead to a lot of frustration as it tends to cause unwanted movement and can cause issues during fights all in all  a very good purchase and avery happy experience edit  september        there was a firmware update that fixed the input issues  since updating i ve had no qualms about recommending this to anyone who is serious towards enjoying their gaming sessions      
674,5.0,                       my only complaint about the the wolverine ultimate is that it is not cordless  but this comes with a    ft power cord plus i connected it to my   ft usb connector giving me    ft of length so it is not a problem  this controller is comfortable in my hand and very responsive  much better than series     of the xbox elite controllers as well as the original controllers  i will keep you updated but so far  i love this controller      
675,5.0,                       this is the best purchases i ve made in a long time  the quality of this controller is absolutely perfect  it does everything my fianc  needs it to do and then some      
676,3.0,                       as a controller is pretty good  the best thing about this controller is the paddle placement  their in a very convenient spot for your fingers which makes them incredibly easy to press  however that s about it  i ve had   in a   month span the second of which broke just   weeks after me getting it  the software that comes with the controller is just alright  if i could ve i would ve just spent a bit more money on the elite controller because it has a lot better software      
677,5.0,                       this is the most comfortable xbox controller i have ever tried and this is coming from an xb elite user  the xb elite controller was great except the response time with the buttons was noticable after awhile  after having my eye on the razer controller for awhile i decided to pull the trigger  i m so happy i did  my fingers felt so nice  and natural on the back triggers the second i held it in my hands  it is extremely lightweight  and the buttons have a clicky mouse feel to it  the responsiveness is insanely noticable  i actually prefer wired controllers so that was a huge plus for me      
678,5.0,                         months and    ish hours of dark souls later it s holding strong  the paddle buttons on this thing are the only reason i can do speed runs  it s comfy and responsive  buttons are easy to program  i consider it worth the money  only complaint is you have to use the cord it comes with  annoying to swap between pc and xbox because i can t use another cord but that is just a minor thing      
679,5.0,                       totally overkill for what i need but nice hardware always pays for itself in the end haha     
680,3.0,                       i bought it to up my game and it worked great out the box  started having issues about a month after i got it  issues being  slow or non responsive buttons and joysticks  kept getting worse  just boxed it up and done with it      
681,1.0,                       listing says it will work on  pc   manual and website says it will work on  pc    not mentioning it won t work on win  is a glaring omission fu razer  thanks for the disappointment you worthless shibags     
682,5.0,                       originally on the send day when i plugged in my headphones  all i could hear was a high pitched beep  after a short while with support though  i was able to ship it back with little effort and after a long awaited reunion a brand new controller was sent to me  it s a great controller overall and i love it t ok death  i m just a little iffy because of the initial buy  then again i did buy it during christmas so it makes sense why there were some faults      
683,5.0,                       let s get straight to it light  fits perfectly in your hands  super fast response  better buttons than xbox elite controller  the y b x a buttons have this mechanical feeling same as that of a mechanical keyboard   it just feel right   if you are a pc gamer  the rgb makes the any boring build   x s better   out of    personally this is better than the heavy and bulky xbox elite        
684,5.0,                       this is a solid xbox controller  i ve owned   elite controllers  they all broke within months  this razer wolverine ultimate is wired only which is fine  i play at my desk anways  plus the cable is really long  the a b x y buttons have a nice clicky feel  the paddles have a different location than an elite controller  but i got used to it  the extra lb rb buttons are really nice  the built in headset adapter is awesome  you can mute your mic  and turn up lower the headset volume  check out the reviews on youtube  i thoroughly enjoy this controller      
685,2.0,                       my buttons have been sticking like crazy and i ve had the controller for a few days  i tried to just click them a bunch to break them in but nothing seems to work and it s super frustrating      
686,3.0,                       i m using this exclusively on pc  so far i love this controller  but the d pad needs work  the buttons are harder to push than a normal controller  with either d pad option  and they don t feel natural  i can t differentiate between up  down  left  right as fast so i feel like i m always searching for the right button also the start select buttons are way too tall  and the button press isn t linear  the buttons wobble so they are hard to press since they are so tall and rub against the sides  they feel like they get stuck halfway through the button press  the rest of the buttons are great though the triggers feel like they have a bit more resistance than normal controllers  and the resistance isn t linear  it s more springy  which feels nice the controller vibration is great  best i ve felt from this style of rumble  and it s very strong  yet feels smooth  and the controller doesn t rattle from the vibration  which gives it a very quality feel the trigger rumble is super strong  wow  and does cause rattles but it s so strong  how could it not  but alas on pc  i ve only got to feel the triggers rumble in the setup app  because the feature is narrowly supported on xbox  and apparently non existent on pc  because i haven t found any games that used it the ability to adjust analog sensitivity on the fly is a life saver but there is one more thing and that s parts availability  there is none  you can t even buy extra parts  you can contact razer for replacement parts if yours are defective  but that s it so  that means you re stuck with what s in the box  if you lose analog sticks or a d pad or your dog chews them or you break them  you have to buy a new controller  because analog sticks from other brands don t fit  and razer won t sell you more  i m sure this is      intentional so that s why i m deducting two stars not only does it cripple the controller s potential lifespan  it limits your configurations  i can t run two tall sticks for racing games  i use analog sticks for steering and brake gas  because it only comes with one  you can t buy more from razer and nobody else makes anything that fits  so i m stuck having to choose whether i want precise control for steering or precise control for brake gas  i can t choose both also  the extra buttons aren t truly mappable  only mappable to other buttons on the controller  which yes  is great for some games  but useless when you need custom keymappings had i d known the negatives first  i d have avoided this controller  it s not worth the premium  and is likely to become useless before it stops working  due to detachable   yet non replaceable parts      
687,5.0,                       loving it  it s got a nice feel and is extremely responsive  works much better than the standard xbox controller and the clicky buttons are satisfying to use      
688,1.0,                       i am a pc gamer and i recently purchased nba k    a game where the keyboard is really awful to use and using a controller is best  i wanted a nice control and a regular one was about     so it was worth     more for a razer controller  i opened it and was estatic only to realize the x button didn t even work  the x is used to shoot in nba k and shooting is literally the most important thing in the game  if someone is going to pay a large sum of money for a controller that is  far superior  to a regular controller the buttons should work  the buttons work on a    dollar controller  total waste of      the refunding process is painful too  don t bother with this  if your willing to pay this much for a controller just buy the real thing from razer for      ish     
689,5.0,                       i ve had this controller for about a week now and i love it  i tried to use an elite controller  but because i tend to clench the controller when poop hits the fan  i found that the paddles got in the way  the  paddles  on this controller are placed perfect for someone who grips the controller like i do  the buttons are very responsive and i love the  hairpin  triggers  so far  this is the best controller i ve ever had  i highly recommend this to anyone looking for extra buttons      
690,5.0,                       the remappable buttons were something i never bought into  i didn t use them  i just wanted to have a controller for gaming that felt good  good button response  almost tactile  clicky   and had a bit of that obnoxious rgb flair to it  i found my self pressing said buttons on accident a few times that made it difficult for me to play games of various genres  i didn t take the time to see if i could disable them or map them to nothing so they wouldn t register an input  but if you want to essentially program a button  not sure if macros are possible with this controller  then this would be for you  it really  really felt good when i wasn t accidentally pressing those buttons what did surprise me  was that while the cord is detachable  this controller has to be wired at all times  this does not have a wireless function  not a big deal for me because i used it on the pc  pc games and xbox streaming  but for someone looking to have a home set up and lounge on the couch   better make sure you ve got an extension or you re close enough to your console      
691,5.0,                       amazing controller much better than the xbox elite controller i like where the extra buttons are compared to a scuff  super responsive buttons no latency at all feels good in hands     
692,5.0,                       and that s saying something  he loves it  if you have a tween teenage gamer and beyond  this is a great gift      
693,2.0,                       update     the cable is very finicky   even though it is connected as far in as it can go  if it get bumped it will disconnect the controller and you will have to push it in  but you won t even realize you did anything until the controller lights back up   after a couple of days i have gotten used to the buttons  but i still enjoy the elite s natural feel of the back buttons   again i d still prefer the elite because of that  and since i don t have to worry about making the cord angry and my controller disconnecting mid game there are two things are terrible about this controller    the buttons on the back of the controller are in terrible spots   you have to stretch to get to the bottom ones and to me the placement doesn t feel natural at all compared to the xbox one elite controller   the back buttons on that controller are awesome    the way the aux jack is set up you can not really have any wired headset like the astro a  s because of the way they plug into the controller   luckily i had a cord lying around that had the two sizes of jacks that were needed for the headset and controller the controller itself feels very sturdy and i love the buttons and triggers   also being able to remap the buttons is amazing     the reason i play with a scuf  elite  or this controller is for the extra buttons on the back and so far out of those three it is the worse   i would take an xbox elite controller over this one any day of the year   maybe after time i could get used to stretching my fingers to reach the buttons on the back  but the easier idea would be to return it for a better controller      
694,5.0,                       quality as you expect from razer products     
695,5.0,                       i ve been gaming for a while as i started out gaming on pc and then also playstation before the  nd one came out  then later i got a xbox     and my gripe with it was how cheap the controller buttons were  on my ps  and   controllers each button press felt just right  on     controllers both the d pad and rb   lb buttons were just horrid  i ran into a number     controllers where the rb or lb just didn t work  my own wired     controller that i used with my pc just never felt good to use  for games that leaned on the d pad i just avoided using the xbox controllers all together after playing assassins creed with it  after that i was really disappointed in how little the xbox one controllers improved over the     controller  so when ps  controller support grew for the pc i just used it whenever possible this controller though really changed most of what i ve felt is wrong with the quality of microsoft s controllers  the d pad is just like i ve always wanted from an xbox style controller and each button at last clicks just right  my only minor complaint is the rb and lb feels less than intuitive to press due to the ergonomics of the controller   i works very well with both my pc and xbox one x  going to say now that this controller will be all i use on any xbox from now on  now as for pros and cons pros   separated d pad is what i love most  it can make a real impact if you are like me and tend to hit off center where on a ms controller it will cause a different direction than what you intended   much better face buttons with a smooth defined click   a tighter slightly smaller frame and a bit more comfortable shape in hand   triggers feel good both with and without using the stop  it s a notable improvement over the standard controller   a quality long cable for living room use     programable buttons for use on pccons   the rb   lb buttons could be improved some  it s still way better than microsoft controllers however   no wireless  doesn t really matter to me  but it s worth noting considering the cost here   the rgb light is kind of bright for me i got this during prime day  but now having used it i would say it s worth the msrp  i rate this a        because other than my nit picking it s near perfection for a wired controller      
696,5.0,                       use for both my pc and my xbox  love how it feels and performs great  change anything on the fly      
697,5.0,                       works well  jusy dont like the light bar on all the time      
698,2.0,                       the quality of the controller is definitely top tier at first  i really wanted to like this controller  it s comfortable and feels good on hand  however  after a few months of use  the  a  button on the controller started to double or triple tap when i just press it once  i don t play games too often  as i also use the controller to operate my computer to move the mouse and click on websites or pause play movies  i never dropped the controller or caused any damage to it   it just seems to lose input capabilities after a few months  i m very sad about this because this was such an expensive investment on a controller  i hope razer contacts me to at least repair this for me        
699,5.0,                       love being able to play pc games again and works flawlessly with my pc  cord is very long and the lights are pretty  comes with a case that keeps it safe from the cats i have  would recommend     
700,5.0,                       this thing is awesome  and the best controller i ve ever owned  the cable makes the annoying issue of your batteries dying mid game a non issue  the cable also makes hooking the controller up to a computer extremely simple and easy  the controller has a decent weight to it  and the rgb is super slick  the cable is also sturdy  and doesn t feel flimsy at all  all in all  its a great purchase if you want a controller that will last you for a very long time      
701,5.0,                       so far so good  great buttons and customization  some can be a little out of the way  but i guess that s to be expected with so many options  lights look great and i have yet to have any issues  it only took a couple of days to get used to switching from a normal controller  it is a bit expensive  but it s my first good controller  may be worth the price depending on the longevity of it      
702,1.0,                       the product stopped working about       months after use  too expensive of an item for this to happen to so quickly  too bad the return window is closed  i have no idea how else to dispute this terrible product      
703,5.0,                       most say  i m impressed  i have had many  last one was the ms elite which lasted just over a year before stick drift became an issue the razer is fantastic  i play primarily on pc so i have not used it on my xbox  but i m sure it works there great too the app to change the settings is ok  definitely worth the price      
704,5.0,                       the razor wolverine ultimate is definetly worth getting  it has many multi function buttons that gives you the edge in many games in which your hand never leaves the analog sticks or the triggers  i haven t experimented with any shooting games besides gears of war   and boy i tell you im able to pull of moves i couldn t do with an regular controller  the buttons click similar like an mouse would on a pc  and has   sets of directional pad options    extra buttons you can swap for multi function use  this controller includes led lights in the front that can change patterns to your likings  the only con that really doesn t matter to me is that its wired only  it does however have an long usb cord  so that shouldn t be a problem  also the price if your an casual gamer  this controller is meant for competitive players looking to compete or take their game to another level    stars no doubt     
705,4.0,                       awesome   like the scuf vantage but for xbox the bumpers are a little more uncomfortable compared to the elite but you can get use to them  the extra   buttons by the triggers become second nature with how your hands fall over them  i use them more often than the buttom bumpers  on the fly profile switching is awesome  rgb is good as usual for razer the only issue i have is this being wired  and finding replacement thumb sticks and d pad seems to be non existent if they happen to get lost unfortunately      
706,3.0,                       yo  this product is hyped up and throws a lot of gimmicks at you to make it seem like it has additional value first off  the thumb sticks are totally proprietary and are differently structured   they are short in length  which is just inherently bad   the surface is a big  slightly concave saucer that is not inherently a flaw  but they make the surface area too big to fit any third party stick attachments to remedy these flaws   if your competitive or like to try hard  you are stuck with the below average thumb stick design in both comfort and performance that isn t even as good as the stock controller  they have higher tension  they intentionally do not follow the industry standard of universally sized sticks nor do they meet the competitors features of exchangeable sticks so you have the option to not use trash hardware   rather  they have all these seemingly standard features only available on the  ultimate  version to force you to spend more money   great business  but scummy nonetheless   if scummy and or predatory market practices bug you  then you d do better to stay away from this product   this particular product is so egregiously far under the baseline quality you d expect from this price point  just so they have an excuse to sell you their more expensive  flagship controller second  the buttons   they are  mechanical  or whatever  meaning they are made to click like a good gaming keyboard    these do work as advertised  but who cares   they are not an improvement   they are not inherently bad either  it is just another gimmick they can put on the box to justify the price point   just kinda goofy lastly  size and extra buttons   the paddles on the back are good   you will be accidentally mashing them until you get used to them  but they are fine and seem like they would last   the additional bumper buttons are kinda dope  great for the lazy homies who can t be bothered to use their pointer finger that come on their hand to push face buttons   its also smaller then the default controllers   why would they do this lmao  who the heck asked for an even smaller version of an already small controller   like many choices made for this product  you just ask yourself  why   review  thumb sticks aren t even as good as the generic stock controller  weird dimensions  too short  very little tension   scummy and predatory marketing practices  this controller is fundamentally obsolete to the more expensive controllers   buttons are whatever   different but not better  hair triggers are too deep to actually make a significant difference  all features are essentially just gimmicks  incompatible with third party stick attachmentssummary just use the dang pointer finger thats on your hand to push the face buttons instead of dancing your thumb around like a goof   or  if you are hell bent on taking your thumb of the stick to hit buttons and you truly can t be bothered to fix it  just buy one of those        paddle attachments and slap it onto the back of your regular controller  and throw on a    pack of controlfreak things if you like accuracy in shooters or comfort    all in all  can be a cool party trick for friends  but is marginally inferior to the     default controller      
707,5.0,                       clearly there are some very unreasonable critiques of this controller  it s hands down better than anything else out there  the only downside is as a person with huge hands  any controller feels toy like to me  once you adapt and learn this setup  there is no comparison      
708,1.0,                       the look of the product is amazing and has a great feel  the customizable buttons and toggles are a great feature as well but the most important thing is the operation  the trigger response is adjustable for quick fire but fails with delay  it should not have delay being a corded controller  i would expect it from a wireless controller   i ll simply say that controller response is crucial in the gaming world  spend a few extra dollars and get the elite series   wireless  no lag at all and you can customize it like the wolverine      
709,3.0,                       i enjoyed using this controller for the features as mentioned by other users  the ergonomics are great  and the back two buttons come in handy  i added removable grips to the sticks  and instantly improved utility notable cons   can t program all buttons  this is a software fix  c mon razer  update your synapse app and firmware  currently  only extra buttons are programmable to old buttons   abxy buttons and d pad on my controller felt stiffer than usual  and does not always register all keysso  i am returning this controller and switching the the ultimate edition  the ultimate edition is about the same price when on same during the holidays  it has better button feels  more sensitive  and stronger  sticks  and additional mic control  definitely worth the switch if the price is right      
710,5.0,                       outstanding  came in the correctly padded box  love all the features and the chroma lighting is great  used mainly for pc with no issues  only complaint i have is with amazons shipping department  why on earth would they ship an item like this in an envelope i have no idea so be cognizant if that       
711,3.0,                       it doesn t last long i ve been having this controller little over a month and a half and the rb buttons doesn t work so be careful i ll would just suggest to buy the paddles attachment they sell at walmart     
712,2.0,                       the remote is advertised as a controller that lets you remap   additional buttons built on    but it fails to mention it can only be remapped using the keys already existing on the remote you can t assign keyboard or mouse buttons    waist of time for pc users    for the price i was expecting a remote that felt great in my hands    plastic exterior doesn t feel smooth but rather rough and anything but flush     
713,4.0,                       this controller is great but i will note a few oddities i ve noticed the xbox button doesn t light up the associated app doesn t allow you to press  b  to back out of the app and back into your game sometimes the connection gets weird and you have to unplug and plug it back inthe bottom paddles  m  m   are a little two hard to press  i am used to the elite controller and use the paddles to map to a for gears of war  this becomes a very essential button and it is simply way harder to use with this controller      
714,3.0,                       heavy     
715,1.0,                       i never leave reviews but this was expensive for it to break on me very fast  if i can leave less than a star i would  first my left trigger goes out  it cracks when i press  but lucky me it breaks the day after i can return it  then shortly the right trigger does the same thing  now i have      pos that i can t use or return  now it s on sale lol don t buy save your money      
716,1.0,                       this controller is trash    definitely a recipe for carpal tunnel  it s like too small    i don t even write reviews but this is real bad  the bumpers just get in the way    i shoulda just spent an extra     on a scuf controller    smhhhh     
717,5.0,                       great gaming control     
718,1.0,                       ugh     i ve been fighting tooth and nail with razer support since i received the controller trying to be able to keep this controller  i really love the feel of it but it won t connect to the only application that is compatible and now all the extra bells and whistles that i paid extra for is no use  i m giving it another day if razer support can t help me than i m returning this item and never buying anything razer again      
719,5.0,                       it does everything i need it to both for my xbox one x and pc  my only issue is that  at least for me  holding the xbox button while the console is turned off does not turn the console on  otherwise totally worth it on sale or otherwise     
720,4.0,                       great controller the m    m  buttons have completely replaced me using the bumpers because placement is so ideal only con is a minor annoyance  this controller cannot turn on the xbox using the xbox button like a standard controller can  don t know if this is because it s wired or  rd party or a lack of programming      
721,4.0,                       had to find out on my own research  on the correct app to download in the microsoft store because it s name was changed after the release of this controller   fond that to be frustrating because for some people  they may not figure that out      
722,4.0,                       this controller is pretty cool  and it feels really nice and i like the option to change the physical joysticks and d pad  i only have one complaint with them  if you leave your xbox off for a few hours or disconnect and reconnect the controller with the xbox off  then the contoller won t turn the xbox back on with the home button  you have to push the power on the xbox itself  i don t like having to get up to turn my xbox one  they could easily fix this with a firmware update      
723,3.0,                       pros it feels sturdy  cool lights  useful buttons cons it s a huge difference in ergonomics from the oem controller s  it feels extremely bulky in my hands  it actually makes me play worse during competition than with an oem controller  even with using the shortened sticks  i m struggling to be fast and reach these skyscrapers in time  they also come off a lot because they are held by magnets  after a month of use  the stick is now clicking and cracking like it s ready to break  for the price  this is a downer also  the build quality seems okay but check out the xbox button  it s crooked      
724,2.0,                       i enjoyed the previous tournment version of there joystick   unfortunately it broke after only one year   button s  above the joystick and above the  x   y  buttons is noticeably different than previous models   after a month i find myself still searching from them and at times have to look down at the controller to insure i am hitting the appropriate key the designers get carried away and change the layout   personally i think they should have to swim   miles in shark infested waters  will not buy another razer controller or device again      
725,5.0,                       i love this controller  i have gone through a few of these over the years and i figured if stop looking for a cheap alternative hoping this one will outlast the rest  from what i hear about it s build  it should      
726,5.0,                       my son is a computer gamer and loves this thing  says it changed his whole gaming to more rockin roll     
727,5.0,                       my son loves this controller     
728,1.0,                         months in and this controller already has a broken button i treat my controller well and don t use the y button much with the games i play  also i have it connected to a paddle that said it wasn t my paddle that broke it was the y button  i ve had this problem already once before with the tournament edition  to get a new one it s such a hassle they have you box and ship your old one to them then they mail you another one that will break in another couple months because its probably refurbished  the whole thing takes like   weeks aswell so i m stuck with no controller to play with because razer went cheap on their part  also after talking to their support they were so unhelpful and basically told me i was wrong and it was my fault not theres     
729,3.0,                       i bought this controller  the tournament ed  for use on a pc since  in my opinion  some console games don t translate well to pc   i was excited to be able to use and program the   additional buttons in any way i wanted  and the chroma lighting would look awesome with my custom made pc  which uses rgb cycling leds   well  to my disappointment  the additional buttons can only be programmed as controller buttons  y  x  a  b  r trigger  etc etc    so all they are good for is repositioning buttons on the controllers  like  moving the a button to a faster  more reachable spot    you can t reprogram the buttons to a macro or any keyboard button other than that  the controller works great  feels comfortable in the hand  and looks nice   however  unless you only want to be able to reposition controller buttons  i d recommend saving half your money on a regular xbox one or     controller  i m returning this and doing the same         isn t worth the money on pc      
730,3.0,                       received this a few minutes ago  the box has been opened previously  the pictures i took are as i opened it  i m pissed that i paid for a new one and received an open box or used one i ll update this after giving it a test run  on the upside  i received it quickly  which is great     update  yep  its used and broken   is this for real  amazon  buy a  new  product and get sent a used broken one      
731,5.0,                       this controller is exceptional so far  had it a couple of weeks   i ve used the elite controller  and i prefer this one  tournament edition   having extra bumpers is preferable to me than paddles  and the overall build quality of the controller feels so    premium     
732,3.0,                       it s bulky and back buttons felt awkward to hold  had to return     
733,5.0,                       i spent a long time deciding on a controller to upgrade to before picking the wolverine ultimate  i love the feel of it and the customizability  a few of the mappable buttons are a pain to hit  the upper two of the back four   but since most controllers only have four mappable buttons i haven t been upset at all about this difficulty  the cord is a bit of an annoyance but never having to charge the controller or replace batteries is a plus  and i don t sit farther than the length of the cord away anyway      
734,5.0,                       man at his controller makes a difference  i had a scuf that had bugs and generally felt cheap even though it s more expensive than this controller  razed is very customizable with the app you download and it works right out of the box no problems  man i m satisfied with this product        recommend      
735,2.0,                       really loved this controller when i first started using it  then things slowly began to fade  the sensitivity adjustors for the left and right triggers get less and less effective as you use them  after a year mine are to the point where there is very little different between the normal setting and the increased sensitivity  the right joy stick has also begun to lose some of its responsiveness when clocking down on it  it will either be very delayed or i will have to click on it many times for it to work if the features that made it so fun to use lasted longer than they do  this would have been   stars      
736,2.0,                       i bought this controller  razer te  for pc gaming in march       definitely one of the best controllers that i have owned for xbox one pc  unfortunately  the x button just stopped working  i tried unplugging the controller as well as restarting my pc in hopes that maybe resetting the controller would fix the issue but to my surprise it didn t  for the money it was a gamble because i wanted something nice but on the other hand i haven t had much experience with razer products  due to the incident i doubt that i will use them again due to the short life span of the controller and for the amount they cost i figured i d be able to use the controller well over a year  to those wanting a solid gaming controller i would highly recommend but due to my experience i d be careful      
737,1.0,                       broken app in windows store  synapse   company does nothing  but pretend they help you      
738,5.0,                       love this controller  while it is higher on the price end  it is significantly better than any other controllers i have had  the extra triggers are also really useful with out having to go out of the way to use them  the rgb is also very nice to see at night without being too distracting      
739,5.0,                       i got this for my gaming computer and i have been upgrading it lately  leaning toward rgb and this was the finishing touch i needed  also the extra buttons playing pvp is great      
740,2.0,                       this product has   additional buttons but these buttons do not add a  new  input to the game  just allow you to move an already existing buttons functions onto them  also  they do not allow the recording of macros  if what you want is to add   new inputs to improve your game experience or program macros  look elsewhere      
741,4.0,                       pros after using this controller for three months  i can t imagine gaming with any other handheld controller  the extra bumper between the trigger and regular bumper brings a whole new aspect to mappable buttons  it feels completely natural and has been my go to rather than the usual bumper you see on every other xbox controller  the feel of the abxy buttons is extremely satisfying and gives a solid  click  feedback similar to a mouse click  it brings the mechanical keyboard aspect of pc gaming into an xbox controller  i have not experienced any issues with the magnets in the joysticks  i imagined they would slip off during intense gaming sessions  but i have yet to experience that thanks to the solid twisting lock mechanism  personally  i don t use any of the extra thumb sticks that comes with the controller  but i can see how many other people would enjoy them  the d pad also gives a very good feedback similar to the abxy buttons cons although i don t use the hair trigger function  it doesn t seem to work very well anyway  with hard enough presses on the trigger  i can notice the trigger lock giving and the trigger slipping down further  i also don t believe the paddles in the back are comfortable to press  they have a satisfying feedback like most of the other buttons on the controller  but they seem too far in the middle and a little far down the back for my taste  again  not much of a problem for me as i don t utilize them  just like the trigger locks p s i have since bought another controller new  but take caution when buying used  of course i knew there might be issues buying the controller used  but no defects were apparent at all for the first few months  up until two weeks ago  i had no problems with the controller  since then  the left analog stick has been starting to go out and not respond to certain movements  after contacting razer about my warranty  which i had no information on before hand  they told me my warranty expired in july of       warranty only lasts a year after purchase   just beware when buying used because it is likely out of warranty by the time you receive the controller      
742,5.0,                       very happy with this purchase  this is a great controller  works great and shipping was fast  even more happy with the price      
743,1.0,                       within two months it stopped working       
744,4.0,                       i ve got this controller as well as the elite  i like that this had some extra features such as color changing led that gives a cool effect  but the extra trigger buttons just don t work as well for me as the ones on the elite  it is also wired which is good and bad  good that it never runs out of battery but still  it s wired  so bad as well      
745,2.0,                       initial impression is very good  but just after using for two months the  x  button doesnot seems to be click anymore and is in depressed state but works with some pressure    trying to see how to request warranty replacement     
746,2.0,                       if you press down lb and then lt you can hear the two buttons hitting against each other  like when you re in gta in your car and you re trying to aim and then have to reverse  only downside i found so far  me personally i m going to shave off some plastic with a dremel      
747,5.0,                       i like the controller overall the triggers settings  fast shippping excellent condition of the package     
748,1.0,                       despite the rave reviews of this controller as far as gameplay  sadly  i won t even be getting that far with it  the controller is very tiny  feels cheap in your hands and the  long  control stick they give you is laughable  combined with the fact that no kontrolfreek attachments for this controller  an obvious ploy by razor to get you to buy their sticks without any extra grip i might add   sending this thing back and getting another elite controller      
749,4.0,                       one star is missing because the first controller i received  one of the buttons wouldn t work  i received the replacement though and this one is good and solid  i love this controller so far  if i have any issues out of it over the next few months  i will update my review but so far this seem much better than the xbox one controllers that i have been dealing with  two controllers  with with the left stick drift issue   i had the wildcat  it lasted for about     years  broke from tripping over the cable   the wolverine is easier to configure      
750,1.0,                       back in may i purchased a powera fusion pro controller   i loved the feel of it but sadly while it survived a good     hard drops  it did not survive the  th drop   i went to get another one but it was out of stock for longer than i could wait   so  i bit the bullet and bought this expensive monster   i wasn t going to go back to the basic controller  i m spoiled now    the thumbsticks are okay  the d pad is a little clicky  and the face buttons feel a little cheap and not as tactile  i ll use it and it works  but it s not a favorite at this point update              one drop and the left bumper button became stuck and those magnetic thumbsticks and d pad flew off all over the room   the powera  pro fusion came back in stock so i got it again  if this one fails i m going back to amazon basics   advice  if you don t tote your controller around or have dogs who like to wrap themselves up in cords  still avoid this controller  you re paying  x the price of most controllers for the rgb lighting and name but  not for build quality      
751,5.0,                       best controller ever      
752,5.0,                       first off  i m as cheap as the next guy  but i also feel strongly that more often than not  you get what you pay for cheap hardware gives cheap performance and ergonomics this is the second razer product i ve purchased  and i remain highly impressed with their quality  fit  and finish  and the obvious attention they pay to gamer wants and needs   i ve been an avid gamer for most of my life  but this is the first brand i can remember where i ve been actually excited to see how they will package the product   they put as much care and attention into the quality of the packaging as they do the device itself  which adds to the cost  sure  but it is another indication of the overall quality and the support they also offer to their customers an old craftsman s saying comes to mind  buy an expensive tool and it will only hurt once when you buy it   buy a cheap tool and it ll hurt every time you use it   of course  a lot depends on how often you use the thing  but i expect i ll be gaming for decades to come   i m sure this and other razer peripherals will work well and comfortably long after i ve forgotten the price i paid for them   i can t wait to see what they roll out next      
753,5.0,                       this is a controller that i bought and like    stars because it does exactly what it says  and feels very durable to my brain hands  when i die in the game  it s now because the other guy is cheating  not because my controller did be expensive      
754,5.0,                       i have purchased razer products before but was very surprised how this controller solved many problems that occur with the oem and pro controllers   rd buttons keep you from pushing the sticks in and damaging your controller  no drifting and very sturdy     
755,1.0,                       came in with damaged buttons  looks like someone cut the knobs with a razor blade  works but damaged and can t be replaced because it s out of stock again  my kid really wants this one so he s keeping it      
756,5.0,                       great response times  the long cord in well made and securely attaches  so no need to work about charging  the ability to remap the buttons and the additional two that can be left as default or change is a great advantage over the elite   controller      
757,1.0,                       first one stop working within    days  amazon replaced with new one that worked for two months  now i m outside the return window so sol  i m not getting another      
758,1.0,                       i bought the wolverine controller for xbox one wired because i m an extreme gamer the video on this controller says it s for xtreme gamer s by gamers or gamers  i bought it january         and it lasted    days it is not a controller for xtreme gamer s maybe if you re old and like to play miss pac man of course but if you re gonna play i ll break call of duty black ops cold war any extreme maneuverability required amen and precision this controller is not for you it s controller is mediocre at best     
759,5.0,                       this controller is great and highly responsive   it has improve my skills   thanks  razer     
760,5.0,                       controller feels great  love the mechanical keys as well as the trigger stoppers which make the triggers activate at half press  if you play a game that needs a full motion trigger  ie likely not a first person shooter   the stoppers slide off and you get the full range of the triggers back  the buttons are fairly easy to re map  although as a pc user it s still only restricted to re mapping xbox buttons around  you can t bind f  to the bottom buttons for example  and you have to use the xbox razer app from the windows market place since the controller is not compatible with synapse  i use mine exclusively for pc as i do not own an xbox and can say that it works great for my purposes   would highly recommend to anyone considering buying a higher end controller      
761,4.0,                       good wired controller with a nice feel in the hands good button feel  and easily programable buttons  my only con is that the triggers have a squishy feeling when they are pushed all the way down which just feels wrong playing racing games      
762,1.0,                       its   fine  it works like an xbox controller  the extra buttons are useless  and the triggers are sketchy  and the headphone jack doesn t work  it just buzzes  save your money  buy an xbox brand controller  not worth the extra coin for this  not even close also  don t contact razer about this  they don t care  just buy something else  you ll be happier      
763,5.0,                       bought this controller oct       i have gamed heavily with this controller over that span  at least     days a week        pros   durability  mechanical buttons  remappable buttons between bumpers  wired connection    i take care of my electronics but controllers by nature face a lot physical wear and tear  this controller is built like a gaming keyboard  my most used button  extra bumper  has just broken but is still functional it just wiggles freely in the controller case  i habe had minor stick drift in the past few months but it took   years to get to that point vs  a month or   with the standard xbox controller  upon dissasembly to clean  it was like a bank vault  many layers of hard thick plastic  build quality is not cheap in any aspect  also the micro usb is unscathed  usually something cheaped out on with electronics is probably the best sync cable i ve ever used mechanical keys are equivalent of a gaming keyboard  though they can be a tad noisy  the low latency and durability paired with a wired connection is superior to any controller button on the market for competitive gaming remappable keys are amazing  the bumper rear triggers next to micro usb port  binds are placed amazingly and are unique to razer  the extra   bottom buttons i dont use much because i use the   rd bumper  alongside rb rt so much more comfortably than the bottom buttons common in scuf elite etc controllers  i find the bottom buttons to be awkward to use with my less coordinated ring and pinky fingers      cons   synapse app only usable on xbox  only   extra thumbsticks synapse customization is only usable on an xbox so on pc i cannot change rgb  not a big deal i just see many complaints in reviews about this   i can manually map extra keys so it is not preventive to pc functionaly at all  there is only   long concave thumb stick    short domed stick    short concave sticks  i have been unable to find extra replaceable sticks as the rubber has worn out on mine  very frustrating but not a breaking point since aftermarket extenders caps are cheap and available overalli see many bad reviews but all in all this controllers build quality  low latency mechanical buttons  unique trigger bumper remappable binds and mid tier price point is unmatched by the elite scuf controllers  it is well worth the money and i reordered my replacement without hesitation      
764,1.0,                       my last controller lasted me over   years  i have this controller and it pulled to the right after having it    days  i will not spend money like this again for a controller that does not last past a    day guarantee  especially within    days of the warranty      
765,2.0,                       do not buy for fighting games  within   minutes you ll realize how unbelievablely terrible the d pad is  it s an okay product otherwise  but not being able to remove the remappable button is a huge turn off is it worth      with razer s reliability track record  no  is it worth      no  it s probably worth like     if compared to the basic xbone controller  it s not even wireless         
766,5.0,                       ok  let s pro con this product   as with all products  there are good and bad points to them all pros   wired means no more batteries dying mid game    additional buttons over the elite controller  works great for monster hunter world   m  m  buttons feel more naturally placed than the elite paddles   abxy buttons are more responsive and feel more like a mouse click   controller feels lighter due to the absence of a battery pack   cord is a durable  nylon braid  and has a breakaway feature to avoid accidentally pulling your system off the shelf  or kids tripping over the cord    synapse software is easy to use  and the controller can store multiple profiles for several users or games  with quick switching enabled with the touch of a button   no more fumbling to mute you re mic with on board mute button  switching between game and party chat volume levels is as easy as holding the volume button and pressing left or right on the d pad  no more going into the xbox menu   this can be a life saver when you need to talk to a party member or hear some boss fight details and need to do it fast   on the fly button remapping is simple and quick with the remapping button on the controller  without having to go into the software and wasting time      ft cable gives you plenty of distance between your tv and couch chair   the color system  chroma  can be set to a number of modes and colors  making it ideal for any situation  and can be set up different for each profile   thumbsticks move more fluid and feel more responsive than the stock or elite controllers   button placement   the m  and m  buttons i feared would be more in the way than useful  but was i wrong   with monster hunter  it was always a pain to cycle through my quickbar to use an item  the wolverine allows me to remap m  and m  to the left and right d pad controls so i can swap items without halting my attacks   swappable dpad and tilt pad designs are easy to change and both are quite responsive   no more rubber below the buttons means fast response time  and no degraded functionality over time cons  wired cord means restricted sitting distance   this can be solved with a usb extension cord or midi extension cable  but out of the box you only get a    ft reach as you can see  i don t really have any real cons for this product   i am ecstatic about it and love my new controller      
767,1.0,                       i liked the item  was an awesome controller  but after using it for a few days the top left upper trigger button stopped working  for this i m very disappointed   i would like to try another controller before i give up totally on the idea of having this controller      
768,4.0,                       edit  after about    months of use  the left stick does not click in anymore  i still love this controller  but unfortunately i can barely sprint in warzone anymore   from the second i picked up the controller it oozes quality pros  the buttons don t rattle like normal xbox controllers  quality construction  m  m  are all conveniently placed and feel normal  the sticks have solid grip and seem to be pretty grippy even if you sweat a little cons  they only have a single audio jack which is unfortunate  because i can t use my small a   astro headset mixer that plugs into the controller other than the one con  i think this is a great controller for the price  definitely more cost affective than buying an overpriced xbox elite controller      
769,1.0,                       hesitant about buying this controller at first  the big price tag along with some iffy reviews had me worried sure enough as soon as i pulled the controller out of the case i noticed the rb button was loose feeling  definitely something wrong with it it is very disappointing that a new product could come like this      
770,5.0,                       it s like the elite  but in my personal opinion  a bit better  wired means less input lag  which is helpful  a big thing is that all of the buttons on here are really responsive  and some click almost like a mouse  that s a really good thing  though it may throw you off at first      
771,4.0,                       i have had this controller for   months  i really like the extra bumpers  i hardly use the back paddles because the placement of them isnt comfortable for me  i do have some issues with the the extra bumpers my right one was loose out the box but wasnt that noticable but over these   months its gotten more and more loose it still works but is just really shakey but overall this is a fantastic controller      
772,2.0,                       played division   with the out of the box device  it worked for about   minutes before it locked up  no response from paddle  unplugged  plugged back into usb     port  used the razer wolverine app and all   no changereturned   hopefully it was just a defective device     
773,5.0,                       i have many controllers this one is by far one of the best i own      
774,1.0,                       this is my second elite  the first one the rt button housing separated this one the rb button is bugging out and will double trigger randomly  i m extremely disappointed with the cost of this and the problems i have     
775,1.0,                       left analong stick doesn t register when pressing it in     
776,5.0,                       for those looking for a complete gamepad for the xbox  or pc  and don t want to spend the       on the xbox pro controller  the wolverine is absolutely perfect   the design is comfortable to hold  the sticks are responsive and not overly tough on your thumbs like a regular xbox controller while still being very sturdy  there are a lot of assignable buttons here and design layout changes  it utilizes chroma technology for the rgb nuts out there  which i am one of   and the hair trigger switches are difference makers for fps it comes with a really nice case as well   happy with this purchase for sure      
777,5.0,                       i like this controller  it feels right  i m coming from a microsoft xbox elite  and i actually prefer this razer  it s a little lighter  the placement of the paddles on the back is much better  the clicky nature of the abxy buttons is noticeable at first  but you get used to it  they feel like higher quality switches  the software to map extra buttons and control lighting is lightweight and easy to use  i m on win      no complaints so far      
778,5.0,                       the extra buttons feel like great  very easy set up and the response on the thumb sticks is exaclent      
779,5.0,                       it s a great controller for battle royals style games  keeping your thumbs on the sticks at all times really gives an edge and i actually like this controller compared to the xbox elite controller  the only negative is not being wireless but  it s not a big deal for me      
780,2.0,                       i use the d pad exclusively when i play fighting games like mortal kombat  this controller isn t meant for fighting games  the d pads both suck  the smooth one is so cheap it flops off in the middle of a combo  it might be great for a game like cod  but not mk       
781,3.0,                       the d pad are not actually individual buttons  they are one single button underneath the casing individual buttons for the d pad makes fighting games much funner and more enjoyable to play the nintendo joy con buttons are d pad are individual buttons for example      
782,5.0,                       i really enjoy this controller  the buttons are  super responsive  and i don t mind that it is wired  razer makes great products      
783,5.0,                       better than elite  period      
784,5.0,                       this is the second one i ve bought for my son  he swears by this controller and he loves it      
785,5.0,                       it is great quaility and is the best wired controller you can get way more durable then the xbox elite controller series     and btw razer has a good software for keybinding just incase you wanna disable the extra buttons     
786,1.0,                       i usually dont write reviews  but there are things that need to be said about this product and i need you to listen  before starting i just want to say a friend and i both purchased one of these and we are both just as disappointed  our controllers are also not defective as we have been able to compare numerous controllers and they are all like this  beware all the hype  its hard to rag on something a person spent so much money on and i feel a lot of users are giving razor too much benefit of the doubt  build quality is subpar at best  i dont see the controller lasting any longer than my elite controller  analog sticks are loose and are not tight enough for percision fps games  me and many other users are already experiencing problems and wished we saved our money for the new elite controller coming out later this year  this product is falsely advertised to work on pc and xbox  it cannot do anything for pc  like literally  you cannot key bind any of the   extra buttons  it is not compatible with pc synapse software  in some games such as overwatch the increase and decrease sensitivity triggers dont work  for xbox it works  but you still cannot map the buttons as  novel  buttons  only duplicate a button  for over      this controller falls short of     of what it is technically advertised and designed to do  i contacted support to see what could be done  company literally sent me in circles for hours confused about what their own product could and couldnt do  buy an elite controller  software exists to map the buttons and at least it has true dual functionality        for a controller with pretty lights  redundant buttons  no pc compatibility and and subpar build quality is a terrible investment  and lastly no  there is no  rd party software available anywhere that can fix any of the problems i have listed  i love razor  but the experience owning this was so bad i can t in good conscious vouch for any part of this product  except maybe chroma    i feel like i was cheated of a lot of money and i hope i can save someone out there from making the same mistake i made      
787,5.0,                       if you have the money  buy it  if not  then save up and buy it later  i purchased my  st x box wolverine in october  because my old steam controller kept disconnecting in game  i m completely done with wireless for the near future  after browsing several  cheaper  options with bad reviews  i decided not to take any chances and go with an official controller  worth it the grip is comfortable and the controller feels durable  i ll write an update if it breaks in less than a year  which is the bare minimum an electronic should last in my opinion protip  you can save     if you buy this on prime day or a holiday sale like black friday      
788,5.0,                       as of today i cannot speak of the longevity of this controller however after a full day of playing i felt i needed to help people who are trying to decide between this and the elite  i love this controller  it s strange at first because it feels like a mouse because the abxy buttons click and it is light in weight  the grips are a nice plus  the paddles are a little out of the way but when your not using the paddles  like on casual or games where it isn t necessary  that makes it comfortable and feel like a standard controller  i experimented with the agility and focus modes  not great on the game i was on but i see the potential on other and future games  the lights were a nice aesthetic too  but i forgot about it in about an hour in summaration  i felt that it was money well spent  it s seems sturdy  it has the hair trigger and long pull like the elite  plus two more mappable buttons with the addition of on the fly mapping and quick swap profiles  also the magnets on the joy sticks are strong so i feel confident about that  if you had to choose this seems wise but you couldn t go wrong with the elite either  that being said i do not regret this purchase  it boosted my ratings in one day by a significant amount      
789,3.0,                       i ended up returning this device  i love razer and i buy most of there products and normally am very happy  but this controller kinda felt cheap  i actually had returned it and got another one because within a few days the joy sticks started to drift but then  nd on did the exact same thing out the box      
790,4.0,                       love the feel  nice quality  the only con i have is the buttons are not as crisp as i would have liked  it has a softer feel which feels squishy and unsure of an actual button press      
791,5.0,                       razer wolverine ultimategreat controller   feels sturdy and built well  the performance compare to elite controller is way better   i like the mechanical keys   they are so easy to press and always pressed not like the reguler sometimes they not   all the buttons are similiar to the elite controller which is great cause i wanted the same feel of elite but with better feedback and better analog sticks because the elite have big issue with the analogs   need to calibrate them because they are not      straight which makes the dead zone really effect the movement when you move to either side and lift your finger the stick would move to the other side making another movement in the game      controllers that i bought same issue  never had issue with normal ps  or ps  controllers and also this razer   so it s something with the elite that annoyed me  the windows    is great   even better than the elite xbox app  all settings there overall razer made great unbeatable controller      
792,1.0,                       was looking forward to trying this controller out  it feels great in the hands  sticks  buttons all felt good  when i turned on the xbox and loaded up the razer app  i noticed right away this controller had stick drifting on the left analog stick  it was an unfortunate first time experience with this controller  so i am sending it back for a refund  may try my luck another time but i m a little concerned with quality control  from my own experience and other reviews      
793,5.0,                       i  used to game on a console  for games like destiny   so had a hard time transitioning to a keyboard and mouse  i bought a cheap controller at first thinking there was no big difference and it was a disaster  bought the razor and it offers a variety of button mappings and sensitivity controls that vastly improved my gameplay  highly recommend this for people like myself who like the feel of a controller      
794,1.0,                       the buttons stick  i ve gotten three of these  the a button stuck on the first two and the x button on the most recent one and it s not even a month old with very very gentle use  i should have learned my lesson the first time  just do yourself a favor and buy something else      
795,3.0,                       this is a really solid controller but the manual and documentation directs the user to their website to download the razer synapse app to set up button remapping and color changes for the lighting   the problem is that the razer synapse app on the pc does not support the controller at all   if you are a pc user  and i am   you cannot control the lighting at all but the button remapping works if you follow the directions on which buttons to push in what order bottom line  i like the controller but it s simply not worth the money   for       it should do the things the enclosed manual says it will do   also note that the synapse app is supposed to work on xbox one   i have no idea if this is accurate      
796,3.0,                       a good wired controller  but for the price it should be great  bare minimum should have had a braided cord  a bit more sturdier triggers  d pad is ok  button don t seems like they will last durability wise but ok   months in      
797,3.0,                       edited  today i received a replacement from razer  update the rating to   stars because the customer support exists and functions i don t usually write review  but i have to write one for this controller i bought this on oct            and it broke on oct            the button  a  just suddenly stopped responding  no matter how many times or how hard i press it   all i did in those    days with it  is i used it to play ori  on average   hours per day at most  and i guess i pressed  a  too many times so it broke then i went to contact razer support via email  and it s been   week since my first contact  they have been asking tons of questions and even asked me to upload a video to show my controller s problem  but there s no solution provided after i read some reviews of this controller on amazon  i realized the quality control is just so bad and issues are very common  i lost my faith in this product and went to order a scuf  while waiting for scuf to ship my new controller   i purchased another razer controller  because to be fair this is a good controller  i ll be happy as long as the second one can last another   weeks till my scuf arrives however  for you guys that do worry about spending       on a controller that might stop working in   month  think twice before you order it      
798,1.0,                       works for a couple minutes then says  controller disconnected  and the lights don t even turn off  so it s plugged in  lights on  but doesn t work      dollar paper weight     
799,1.0,                       the left trigger and bumper on the controller just get stuck at the bottom  it is really irritating and i can not get a replacement since i had the controller for a month and   week and the amazon warranty is for   month  i would be willing to change my review if i got a replacement or money back but as of now the controller lasted me a measly month      
800,1.0,                       owned for just   months with minimal play and the sticks already drift so bad it s unplayable  had to go back to my original xbox controller that i ve had for   years       disappointed because i own a headset and laptop from razer and they have been great      
801,5.0,                       this controller is great  i ve been an avid user of the xbox elite controller but their poor construction causes them to eventually break no matter what  only reason i stuck with the elite controller is because i had a protection plan at best buy so every time one broke i was able to trade it in for a new one  i m done with that now  this controller is just like the elite in performance and accessibility but has a more of a precision feel to it  the abxy buttons have a completely different feel than normal buttons  they are more like mouse clicks  no real push to them  at first i didnt like it but i quickly got used to them  the grip to the controller is amazing  take it from a guy who puts in long hours gaming that this is the most comfort ive gotten from a controller  no cramps  nothing  the extra buttons are in great spots  unlike the elite controller  overall i highly recommend this controller  only down side is that its wired but the cable it comes with is quality  braided and very long      
802,1.0,                       its nice they built the grips onto the controller instead of using the sticky type like the wild cat but   the feel of this controller is iffy the wild cat had a sturdy feeling this   the buttons seem super light weight n loose plus i had to ship my first   back because the a button did a double click   no matter how soft or quick it was pressed this new   has a catch in the right trigger n right bumper if pressed together   not to happy with the controller over allupdatenew controller now does the x  click on the x  isnt present during game play neither was the firsts controller but   xbox messages or in game messages it x  clicks for x so yeah this controller either has horrible quality control or the button design itself is flawed   loved my wildcat just a shame the sticks where none quick replacement    i wouldn t recommend this controller     
803,4.0,                       great controller  woulda gave a       only complaints are  wish the sticks were a lil taller  just a hair smaller than standard xbox controllers tho it s barely noticeable  and the d pad needs work   the extra buttons placement suuuuuucked at first but easy to use now that i m use to it so    i think it was just me     
804,1.0,                       after three uses the controller stopped working  i have plugged it in to both my xbox one and pc and both share the same indications  the lights wont turn on and both end points do not register the controller as turned on i called the razer helpdesk and had a technician walk me through the troubleshooting steps and came to the same conclusion  he said he would follow up with an email in regards to further assist me and the email never came  he gave me the ticket number of                 and still nothing update  i called the razer helpdesk again and was stuck on hold so i decided to email them requesting on my existing ticket  it has literally been   months and i have heard nothing      
805,5.0,                       love the concept and design and look  hate the feel  just didn t feel right in the hands and didn t like the thumb sticks  but overall product worked very well  just not the overall feel      
806,5.0,                       works great for the games i play on my pc  and the only problem is that the  extra  buttons cannot be programmed as  extra buttons  such as extra macros  they will only do buttons like a  b  x  or y  etc        
807,2.0,                       update  not even a   years of use and the left bumper is sticking all the time nowbest controller you can get for the money you spend  love the customization  a tad disappointed with the app you have to use to fine tune everything though  used one app on xbox live for about   months  then razer switched over to a new app which is prone to crashes as of late     
808,5.0,                       the perfect gaming controller for pc or console  this controller feels durable and is super sleek in design      
809,1.0,                       yikes   already broken  cant return or exchange  yikes      
810,5.0,                       i like the additional buttons  it makes it easy to use x y a b buttons  i use the controller on a pc  it has a quicker response then a xbox controller      
811,1.0,                       the product worked well for a few months then in the middle fo a gta session while driving my audio cut out from my headphones  i thought this was an issue with the headset so i bought another only to find out the razer controller is the issue and no longer plays game audio properly while a standard controller works fine with a  d audio headset  this is unacceptable for the product to just partially break in the middle of a session less than a year of owning it  i d be willing to try another but sadly this was a gift and the buyer didn t select the insurance plan so i am left in the void  just wanted to warn anyone else about this weird issue i am having with the controller      
812,2.0,                       don t buy if you want dedicated directional pad input for games like tekken  i ve played tekken for a long time and this is the worst d pad i ve ever played on  on a positive note the custom usb port on the controller and slotted usb cable are great additions to protect the most vulnerable part of modern controllers      
813,1.0,                       cons   the software for this device comes from microsoft  there is absolutely no changing the extra buttons  on the back  to a useful combination of the face   trigger buttons  which made it no better than the one i already had pros   the construction is sound and the buttons are super responsive thanks to razer      
814,3.0,                       pc review  it s a great wired remote  the ability to adjust the trigger press depth is nice  buttons are very clicky and feels like good quality remote  the software is xbox software copied over to windows which is just odd  no mouse support  no instructions for said software  still unsure of some settings  button remap is not what i expected  was hoping to make a lb rb button but can t be done  additional buttons have yet to prove useful since it can t be programmed to a key button  you re locked with just gamepad buttons  i found it dumb the controller isn t recognized at all by synapse software  color change options done via controller app  i switched to this controller due to regular xbox controllers disconnecting randomly during long game sessions on pc      stars for a pc controller      if it was used for xbox which isn t what i bought it for      
815,4.0,                       without this one flaw  it would be   or   stars  the controller feels well made  nice weight  buttons are very responsive however  sometimes pressing r   pressing down on the right joystick  causes aggressive drift of the right stick  for fps games  this means you begin looking directly rightward  i play on a high sensitivity  so my player will turn     degrees very quickly  this flaw makes the controller unusable for fps games  unless you don t mind dying or losing   i will be attempting to get a replacement for the controller and will update this review if that happens edit          got a replacement controller  updating to   stars from     the controller feels fantastic  hair triggers and buttons are very crisp   just feels good to hold  honestly   if the first item hadn t had the flaw above  would have been   stars from the get go      
816,4.0,                       such an awesome controller for the price  i was stipulating getting the elite   but i always hated the paddle layout and therefore only could ever use two of the paddles  with this razer  i utilize all   of the extra buttons which are laid out very well only one con so far out of the   months of using it and that is the a b x y buttons seem to be wearing out prematurely  currently the a button is my most problematic and is constantly sticking  i will be contacting razer since they back the controller for   year      
817,3.0,                       it s ok  i don t like how i feel like i have to use the extra bumpers instead of the normal bumpers  it s like the controller is designed so the normal bumpers are as unreachable as possible and you have to use the extra bumpers  and the back peddles aren t detachable  so it s uncomfortable to hold  also  the description said  adjustable sensitivity curve  but what it really is  is a configurable button that makes your sensitivity super high or super low  it s not a set thing  you have to actually assign one of the extra buttons to make it fast or slow  now you can configure how high or low the sensitivity becomes when you press it  but the description failed to mention that you have to assign it  i thought it would be like the xbox elite controller  but nope  kind of disappointed  the chroma is kinda cool  also the a b x y buttons are way too far apart and way too far up  i got pretty big hands and my thumb just could not reach the y button comfortably  i wish they would have lowered it and made the buttons a little closer together  the d pad is good  the thumbsticks aren t too bad either  everything was pretty responsive  but the trigger is too smooth compared to the normal controller  and what i mean by that is that the normal xbox controller has some resistance to it  but this has none  the trigger stops also feel odd  i also don t like how the cable has a detachable part to it  i don t know why they do  but it got kind of annoying  also if they re going to make it wired  i wish they would allow you to use other micro usb cables instead of their own  the cable is stupid long  i think that s about it      
818,3.0,                       this controller is great all around but the back paddles are terrible for people with smaller hands  its so uncomfortable to reach that far  elite v  has the best paddle placement wasnt terrible  hopefully they release something just like this with elite type paddles and they are almost mouse click     
819,5.0,                       hands down one of the best controllers i ve ever had the joy of putting in my hands  i was a die hard fan of the old     controllers  but wanted to give the wolverine a shot  i ve had a razer huntsman for almost   years and have even chosen it over a much higher prices competitors version  so when i saw they employed the same switches in their controllers  i knew i had to try it i have not been disappointed  at all the only con i can even mention is that these are not built to handle someone with hulk hands  bad clenching issues   i got a little sweaty playing nfs heat and realized i was squeezing the hades out of the triggers  so bad i made the chassis pop  however  this is a user issue  not a manufacturing issue  if you want military grade  look elsewhere lol but this is definitely a controller meant for the serious gamer        would and have recommended
