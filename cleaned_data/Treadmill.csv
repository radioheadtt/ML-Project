0,1.0,                       buyer beware after setting up your treadmill and turning it on  the screen will say  go to ifit com and register to activate   it will appear that you need to sign up for ifit to turn on your treadmill  ifit will ask for your credit card and will start a free trial  after which you will be automatically charged        a month you can get around registering for ifit  but nordictrack does not state this anywhere in the manual and the packaging says you cannot start your treadmill before registering with ifit  this is predatory  and i actually think criminal behavior on the part of nordictrak to get around this scam  hold down the ifit logo on the treadmill for    seconds and your treadmill will work  i hope this helps people from being forced to give out their credit card and personal information      
1,1.0,                       i just got my nordictrack t     treadmill today  i had it professionally installed  the installer told me that it is impossible to activate the machine unless you go online to ifit to register the product  once there the wanted me to give all my personal info  give my credit card information  download their app  and signup for ifit that cost      per year  the installer convinced me to sign up and said i can cancel anytime during the first month for free  feeling like i didn t have a choice i went ahead and signed up  after the installer left i decided to go back in and cancel ifit  first i tried to go to their website to cancel and could not find a link anywhere to cancel  next i tried calling them and got put on hold for    minutes  i finally hung up and decide to try their chat  for the next     hour i kept getting messages saying  thank you for your patience while we connect you with the next available agent   after a half hour of waiting i decided to try the phone again  after being on hold for another half hour i finally got through they told me they prefer i go online to cancel  when i asked them where the link was to do that he said he wasn t sure  i finally got them to cancel over the phone  it only took about   hours all total  i am beginning to think this is a scam and am considering just sending the treadmill back to amazon      
2,4.0,                       i would of given it     if i could  let me start by saying that i am more than satisfied with this treadmill  some people were saying that this treadmill was only good for fast walking or light jogging  this is absolutely inaccurate  the speeds are      and most of the time i can t even go past   for my fast jogging  i also read people saying that you couldn t increase speeds in increments  another inaccuracy  you absolutely can  incline is very good  solid  and responsive  i feel as if people are trying to knock this perfectly solid treadmill to make way for newer models ok  so it doesn t have fans  or tv screen  or a doughnut maker  really people  are you here to get a good workout or watch tv  most of the time i use my phone for music anyway  that way i can have the music blasting in my ear  my basement is perfectly cool for my treadmill and if necessary i could always just put a standing fan in front of it  i agree that the panel speakers suck  use earphones or your stereo  problem solved the cup holders are nice and large to put your keys  watch  socks  if you like running barefooted like an animal  cellphone  or your big gulp drink that you got form   eleven the panel has plenty of options to keep track of all kinds of stuff  honestly i only use time  or distance  but i understand it s cool to have little preset workouts and other options  i might want to keep track of how much lard falls of my body one day with the calorie option i guess my light humor comes from the fact that i got such a great deal for such great quality and competent treadmill          
3,5.0,                       i had a tough time deciding on treadmill  i was looking into the     price range but every time i read a review they said things like  don t try to run on it  so i kept raising the price range until i found one that i was able to find the qualities i was looking for  i wanted something that you could run at least    mph on and had an incline but not a manual one  and also a fold up one because it would have to be placed in the living room  i read a review on this treadmill that convinced me this one was the one  i am     and     lbs  i used to be a runner but then i had kids  between work  kids and making dinner i found little time to exercise  now i am so happy i made the choice of buying this treadmill  this treadmill is well made and sturdy  it does not shake when i run and is easily portable  when it was delivered i had to schedule to be there because it needed to be signed off by the delivery company  they brought it into my house in a very large box  it does take   people to assemble because someone has to hold the console piece while you connect the one wire  it took about    minutes to assemble  my husband did most of it with no difficulties  after plugging into the wall there is a switch at the bottom in the front that turns on the treadmill  the first week i received it i ran    miles with a     mph  no problems so far  i am extremely happy with this purchase      
4,1.0,                       i bought this for my mother  it arrived on time  no issues  i paid for the expert installation  which we had no problems     minutes after the technician left  the thing stopped working  of course i was at work  so when this occurred my mom did not know what to do  she called the tech back and he confirmed he could not figure out why it stopped  later that evening i stopped by my moms house to see what the story was  everything seemed to work except the belt  now i have to call nordictrack and see when they can send someone out  amazon  is pretty good about offering solutions as far as returns i was given   options    call norditrack   have a local repair person fix it  and they would refund me           complete refund on both the unit and shipping  i would assume the   year maintenance plan  i am giving this   star because despite some of the good and bad stories  there should be no reason why this thing should have died i am hoping i get a quick response tomorrow and we can work from there i will update as we go along                updateso it was initially decided that the motor was broken on the machine by the technician who was dispatched about a week later  it took about   weeks to receive another motor  add a few days to dispatch another tech at this point we are talking almost a month since the machine has arrived   i was actually contemplating of just doing a return because it was nearing the time to pay the charge on my credit card   back to the story  so the tech shows up  we have the new motor  and an excited mom  i then find out that its not the motor  but the control panel  again back to square one  another   weeks for delivery  again a couple days to dispatch a technician once the part arrived  tech arrived installed the new control panel and the machine runs  and hasn t had a problem since  its been working with no issues for about   months now  mom is happy  but i m not really sure it was worth it  at this point i can t recommend purchasing this unit through this sales channel  amazon was perfect but i don t know if it is norditrack  the warehouse who holds this equipment  xpo who ships this equipment  the tech who installed this equipment    bottom line    a product was purchased for over      and it didn t work for almost two months from the day the transaction was completed  we weren t given anything for our troubles  yes we weren t told  oh well sorry no refunds  all sales are final   we were offered a refund of      if we decided to let norditrack off the hook and go with a local repair person  but there was nothing saying  we are sorry for what happened  the month and a half that was lost will be on us   the company that failed to delight you as a customer   the only power as a customer is a review  to forewarn others of such an awful experience i work in the customer service industry  so i know how hard it can be to please customers  in this case  the product offer and the services to support it were abysmal sincerely sam k      
5,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          great treadmill  gets the job done  i had it assembled via amazon because i didn t want to take any chances on messing it up i will say it super squeaky  i m not sure why  my previous  much cheaper  treadmill didn t squeak  not really sure what to do to remedy this      
6,3.0,                       the machine is great and delivery and set up went very smoothly  however  the claim of a free   year ifit membership is false  after getting the run around from nordictrack and ifit  i called amazon support  here s the deal  the customer pays upfront for the one year ifit membership and then supposedly can cancel a year later and get their money back  to me  that s a      gamble  no thanks       
7,1.0,                       i will start with the main reason why you should not buy this treadmill before going into details nordictrack deceptively makes you believe that the treadmill will not work unless you sign up for their ifit program requiring your credit card and other info  the info on how to bypass is not found anywhere in there manuals  their website  youtube or google  shameful strong arm tactic  after you give them your credit card number then they will tell you to hold down the ifit button for    seconds  i found this out after hours of trying to figure out of how to avoid giving them my credit card number after i signed up  i called the next day to cancel the subscription and was on hold for    minutes before the call was disconnected on their end  the second call   i held for about    minutes before i hung up  the  rd time i called when they first open and held for    minutes before someone picked up extremely disappointed that this is amazon s choice  purchased this treadmill based on the fact that is showed amazon s choice  assembly date had to be rescheduled a couple of times  finally came on a sunday about  pm  assembly guy was a good guy  not his fault  he let me know that the cover to the motor was broken  i am now on hold    minutes and    seconds trying to get a replacement      
8,1.0,                       if i could give it a zero i would  i received this machine defective  it will not work  my husband and i assembled the machine exactly how the instructions stated  its no damn cake walk either  a lot of the parts were built improperly so they did not fit together very well  it took a lot of pressure to get the parts to come together appropriate enough that we could insert the screws  one of the bolts i got was completely welded over the on the head and i could not use it at all  after we got the machine together and went thru the set up process  the machines belt was not moving at all  we called nordic track customer support he said the control board was bad  so we waited a week for parts  replaced the board and went thru the setup and calibration process  still did nothing    called customer service again  now they are saying its the wire leading from the board to the console     which means we have to take the entire machine apart and replace the wire and set it up all over again and to be honest they don t even know if that s it    if it isnt that part they send a different part in the mail  if i want a tech to come out i have to wait till he calls me to schedule a day  the whole process takes a week or two  do this three times and it s just not worth the time and energy  i just paid a lot of money for this machine and here i am rebuilding the whole thing  nordic tracks customer service and warranty is a joke      dont buy from nordik track  here we are with a broken machine due to no fault of our own and no one is willing to get their butts out here to fix it or replace it update  thanks to amazon im able to returm the machine for a full refund  they are sending out their delivery guys to come get the machine  i dont even have to box it back up  thank you amazon            
9,5.0,                       this was my first large treadmill purchase and i was a bit reluctant to purchase such a beast of equipment online without first trying it in a store  to add to the excitement  i decided to opt for basic front door delivery with prime and put this machine together without professional assistance  i ordered the treadmill on a friday afternoon and received the package the following tuesday  it was packaged extraordinarily well and arrived on a wood pallet  this thing is heavy   but my husband and i were able to move it with minimal issues  moving coasters helped    as for putting it together  my husband was able to accomplish this in about an hour and a half by himself  he was surprised at how straightforward the assembly was  although quickly admitted that it was definitely a two person job  once we remembered to put the red magnetic key in the front of the machine  we were in business  this is a very well made piece of equipment that operates beautifully at the highest of inclines and at all available speeds   and it is sturdy  we are very happy with this purchase  thank you amazon and nordictrack      
10,4.0,                       the good easy for   people who have put together a lot of you build it furniture over the years to assemble and took about    minutes the belt  motor  and critical mechanical parts appear to be well made with quality materials  the display console doesn t quite have the same premium feel as the rest of the assembly  but on a machine at this price point i d rather made tradeoffs there than the mechanical parts ifit is a double edge sword  with half of the experience falling in the  this is a total game changer  and the other half falling in the  this is an unacceptable trainwreck  category  when you manage to navigate your way through the impenetrable user experience to finally load the workout you were looking for it justifies the price    the live video instructor led workouts are phenomenal at this price point the bad you won t actually be able to find this stated anywhere online  but the treadmill has no outputs or bluetooth capability so you re forced to watch everything on the     screen  the s has bluetooth because it doesn t have a screen  but you lose bluetooth with the si   the     screen is great if you don t have the ability to connect to a larger external monitor  but from the number of questions on this topic it s safe to assume that  like myself  many people want to output the video to a larger screen  some of the more expensive nordictracks apparently have this capability  and frankly had i known this i would have purchased a step up model  it s fine if you don t want to offer this on the economy model  just make sure it s called out  e g   video output through integrated screen only  no support for external monitors or tv   you can t use headphones with ifit workouts and must use the integrated speakers  non starter if you re working out when others are sleeping or if you live in a smaller space and don t want to disturb others  again  it s fine to not offer this  but it needs to be called out  e g   audio output through integrated speakers only  no support for headphones  ifit in general  thousands of confused and angry users have said everything you can possibly say about the terrible ifit user experience  it s doesn t reflect professional commercial software standards for interaction design  lacking even such basic functions as search    it s true  there s no way to search the large library of ifit videos unless you pay some dude who scrapes the content another    bucks a year for access to his private database  the lack of search is just the tip of the iceberg though    ifit is one of the most poorly designed interactive experiences i ve come across in the last few years  falling down at almost every step of the user journey ifit people  if you re listening  the actual service you provide is stellar and the quality of the content is exceptional  you re shooting yourselves in both feet by ignoring basic usability  and this has been going on long enough that if you don t get serious about fixing it one of your competitors is going to eat your lunch and steal your users by doing the exact same thing you re doing but actually delivering an experience that works  you ve already done the hard stuff  for crying out loud    the work to get the experience out of the gutter isn t rocket science  fix it      
11,1.0,                       received it and it broke within a week  nordic sent us a bunch of different parts to fix it but none of them worked and they refused to replace the unit  out     bucks  i cannot say enough to avoid this brand     
12,1.0,                       this is a great machine absolutely ruined by the software  if you dont want to spend     a month you are in for a frustrating and infuriating time  i read the mostly positive reviews  and got one  i wish i hadn t  i had no intention of signing up for ifit because it seems gimmicky  the software pushes ifit sign up so hard it makes the machine almost unusable  please dont make my mistake thinking i could look past the horrible software  you can t  this is an outright scam      
13,5.0,                       i usually don t write reviews  but this treadmill absolutely deserves one i have had this for a little over a month and i am in love   a few things i think worth noting  i have bad knees and the belt on this treadmill doesn t hurt them at all  i love the fact that you get an ifit membership free for a year   having all of those personal trainers and different workouts available in my home makes morning exercising enjoyable  as enjoyable as morning runs can be      they really make the runs go by much quicker  the sound system on this thing is amazing  my roommates and i actually had a little dance party in the workout room because it sounds so good and connects easily to bluetooth   it is beautiful   the screen is a great size and is very high quality   it s honestly a better treadmill than the treadmills at most gyms   fans  ugh having the fans is a game changer for me  it has a great range of incline and speed i m      and it s the perfect size for me  highly recommend if you want a great way to get in shape in your own home  it s very high quality for an amazing price   it honestly makes me want a nordictrack elliptical and whatever else they offer too      
14,5.0,                       i am a big guy as you might know from such reviews as my desk chair and many other   don t know my reviews  ok then i will let that pass this time     this treadmill will work up to    lbs so they say  luckily i am still slightly under that number   this can incline    degrees and go up to    mph   i trot along between   and     really impressed by it and so far  i am not yet aware if it holds my laundry while drying  as most of my exercise equipment in the past has done putting together would be really easy with   people  i was in an accident and i don t move around so well and i put it together alone   hardest part was the underneath bit where you have to put the bars in for holding it up while being stored   however i managed   the thing is a beast and is quite heavy  it does not move on the rug at all while i am using it is it loud  well yes but no louder then any treadmill i have ever been on   faster you go  louder it gets  is it too loud  no my only complain is that the video they show the unit is not the same as this one  but the pics they show are the same   if you are thinking of buying this  do it   for its size  it didn t take up as much room as i thought  here it is wedged between my   other machines     
15,5.0,                       simply put   this is a fantastic machine   i m an avid runner  who has run on many treadmills over the years  and this machine is awesome   it has all the features and feel of a gym machine just not as bulky or expensive   it s got a lot of bells and whistles  some of which we are still discovering but probably our favorite are the touch screen display and the bluetooth  also  it s nice to have a built in speaker and the fan       this will be gold in the summer  our last treadmill didn t have this and we had to have a ghetto fan rigged up to the machine we have a pretty small workout space in our garage where this will live and it fits nicely there and can be more compact using the nice hydraulic fold option   even our   year old daughter can lower and raise the machine by herself   our whole family is really pleased with this treadmill a word about delivery and set up   because it s an oversized product  it s not handled by regular amazon delivery  i am always a little leery about the reliability of getting assigned a delivery window  but i will say delivery was prompt and the treadmill arrived within the delivery window as promised   i was not prepared for the size  the box was huge   it is a treadmill though so it makes sense  ha  we chose to assemble ourselves which was a job i passed off to my husband   self assembly is doable   my husband said the instructions were extremely detailed and there was no problem with assembly as long as you read and follow each step   you d better give yourself a few hours for set up and an assistant to help hold pieces in place  etc i wouldn t hesitate to buy this treadmill   so far  it s a great machine      
16,3.0,                       as for the treadmill itself   assembly was strait forward  took a little over   hours   roomy  i enjoy the small features like fan and blue tooth headphone jack  seems solid  i m       lbs and don t feel like it s being battered when i run on it now for the bad   ifit is   for lack of a better term   a money grabbing joke   they needed to figure out how to move a one time purchase into a  subscription model  profit generator and this is what they came up with   although all the adverts i get for  extended warranties  are coming in a close second highlights  or is it lowlights    free year isn t really  free  you have to give them a credit card and hope they don t charge you   even if you don t do this  you still need to make a login to login to your treadmill   luckily  they don t verify so farts mckenzie is the actual owner of my treadmill   the benefits of the program  pre programmed workouts  have been available on workout equipment since the late    s and didn t require a      dollar a year investment   the other benefit  hey it looks like i m running through mountains   falls flat when you are staring at an     tablet screen i like having a treadmill in my home as i don t have the time to get to a gym   but for spending over a grand i should be able to program a workout  or deal with a small list or preprogrammed workouts   as it is i have to constantly adjust the speed incline on the fly as i need to ifit is a transparent money grab and needs to be put in the garbage   i will not invest in another treadmill with this garbage  i ll suck it up  get a gym membership and make the time to get there   it d still probably cost under      a year      
17,1.0,                       i had a nordictrack treadmill for    years and used it everyday   when it died of old age  i bought a new one in march   it quit in july  it s now october and    emails later nordictrack still hasn t fixed it   they send parts and links to youtube videos on how to replace them  but the problem persists  i thought i was buying from a reputable company but i have since looked online and there are dozens of complaints about nordictrack  this faulty machine  and their very poor service response   there are other companies out there  buy from anyone buy but nordictrack  they aren t the company they used to be      
18,4.0,                       i upgraded from a    year old proform   this review is in some ways a comparison to that treadmill pros feels very solid and  comfortablereasonably quietvery large running belt   year motor warrantyaudio jack   speakersamazon s assembler put this together in    minutesreasonably pricedcons requires ifit activation subscription at a monthly cost to operate treadmill  but see bypass below monochrome screen  on the    model  is not very good and without  any real  track  displayno fanno  resume  option  if you stop the treadmill for more than a minute  you have to re start from   distancethis is a great treadmill   but it will not work at all if you do not subscribe to ifit  monthly cost    fortunately there is a way to bypass the ifit activation  see heading below for      the treadmill will be delivered to any location of your home   this is a very heavy box that required two pretty big guys to carry  with some difficulty    this is a worthwhile cost if your front door is any appreciable distance from the location where you will be using this treadmill i used an amazon assembler to assemble this  as i write this review  amazon is offering this     service  free    these guys are pros   he didn t even open the assembly manual and had this fully assembled in    minutes or so after assembly the treadmill does not work without ifit activation   in fact a red sheet of paper in large letters is included with the assembly manual which says  your treadmill is locked   final assembly step   go to ifit web site to unlock my personal opinion is that this a scam   ifit requires a smartphone  what if you don t have one   and requires giving ifit authorization to deduct the monthly subscription costs directly from your credit card   i believe that the reason the treadmill is so reasonably priced and delivery and installation is free because of the all the money they are making from the ifit subscription   fortunately  there is a way to operate the treadmill without activating ifit  see below how to bypass ifit  there is an ifit logo button on the display console   after assembly  hold down this button until the  treadmill unlocks  about       seconds    sears posts these instructions on their site   i respectfully suggest that amazon should also consider doing this there are two things about the treadmill that felt like a downgrade from my old proform  although overall this is a much better treadmill    this first is the lack of a fan   the second is the very spartan monochrome display   it s only    big  small  and does not even have a real     mile track like every other treadmill   it has a really small track  like     inch  that does not really show your progress   if you like to see your progress on a track while running  skip this model   nordictrack makes this same model with a much larger  and color  screen but at almost double the cost which is really hard to justify the treadmill itself is great   smooth  solid and reasonably quiet   there are built in speakers and an iphone type audio jack   the running belt is large   because of the large running area  this treadmill is a bit larger than other models      
19,1.0,                       ifit freezes and crashes constantly   makes it incredibly frustrating to complete a work out  i would not recommend this product      
20,5.0,                       after years of contemplating buying a treadmill but always deciding it wasn t worth the money since i d rather run outside and had access to them at the gym  i started looking seriously a few weeks ago  the weather in dc is atrocious right now and at    weeks pregnant with   other little ones  i wasn t able to find the time to run  i saw this deal and had to take the chance  the cost was less than   months of gym membership when you factor in child care and would allow me to run at home anytime i wanted  i could run or walk during naptime  while the kids played  etc i ve had it a week and i ve used it almost every day  i love it  i can t believe i waited so long to get it  as an avid runner  an athlete and half marathoner this treadmill is perfect  i haven t even used any of the settings yet but the basic machine itself is wonderful  incline and speed  comfort  etc   spacious enough to not fall off the back  a wonderful ridge to hold an ipad but still able to see the information display  etc  it s awesome  i see a lot of time spent with it this pregnancy and even in the future once baby    is here  running during naps  walking if he won t sleep with him in the ergo  etc   such a great machine at a great  affordable price      
21,4.0,                       i ve done a lot of research on treadmills  i ve read every single review of this model on amazon  yes it took me hours  now you won t have to let me get the one thing that is constantly mentioned in many previous reviews out of the way  you do not need to sign up for ifit to unlock your treadmill  just press the blue square ifit button once your treadmill is powered on for about    seconds and it will go into manual mode  no need for an ifit subscription there is a lot to like about this treadmill      s model   wide space for walking and running comfortably  plenty strong motor  easy to use buttons  very bright    screen  relatively quiet  two spacious compartments to hold a drink  etc  a thick lip to hold a tablet  magazine  smartphone  etc i don t recommend the more pricey     si model with the     touch screen unless you absolutely will subscribe to ifit  otherwise you can use the ifit app on a tablet and sync it with the cheaper  s  model   i m using my treadmill in manual mode  there are two things stopping me from giving this treadmill a five star review  one is the way nordictrack essentially scams you into thinking you need to subscribe to ifit to get your treadmill up and running   yes you can cancel before your free month expires  but you need to provide a credit card to subscribe and why put your new customers under such a hassle  especially when you can bypass all this which by the way isn t even mentioned in the instructions  the second issue is with the treadmill  motor hood  and  hood accent   these two pieces are directly in front of your feet as you use the treadmill  both pieces cover the motor of the treadmill  the issue is that the hood accent is far too close to your feet as you use the treadmill  looking at the technogym treadmills at my fancy local gym not a single one has the hood accent as close to your feet  essentially you will need to use the treadmill probably   inches further back then you might normally in order to avoid hitting the hood accent with your feet  i ve only seen this issue mentioned in a handful of amazon reviews  but i m not sure how more people haven t noticed this  i m assuming it s a feature you would not find on a pricer treadmill  i m using my treadmill for casual walking so it s really not a huge issue  but i am making a point to start further back when i use the treadmill  otherwise my feet could easily clip the hood accent   for reference i m   ft tall  perhaps less of an issue with shorter people  and even more of an issue with taller people longer strides  you can easily move and store the treadmill by raising from the back and locking into place overall i think this is an excellent choice given the price  i don t see anything better currently in the      range  and i ve looked at just about every treadmill on the market before my purchase delivery from xpo logistics was no issue  they came to my home and i pointed to the room where i wanted the box left  it s a big and heavy box i highly recommend you have amazon set up the treadmill  a nice young man came to my home the day after delivery and did it all by himself in about an hour  i tipped him well  please tip the person that assembles the treadmill  it s not super easy and most people writing reviews said they wish they never tried to do it themselves lastly you definitely should get a mat to place under the treadmill to protect your floor  countless options are available on amazon also when i was searching for treadmills amazon had by far the cheapest price when it came to both purchase and delivery assembly  i highly recommend you purchase from amazon if you are going to get any kind of treadmill      
22,1.0,                       beware before you purchase this treadmill   it s full of glitz and glamour   however  unless you have a dedicated   amp outlet this treadmill will trip your breaker every time you turn it on   and i had it plugged into a    amp breaker with nothing else plugged in   called nordictrack  they told me i had to have an arc filter due to they type of breakers newer homes use   bought an arc filter   still tripped the breaker   called again   went through a diagnostic with customer support   turns out the motor was bad   i had the choice to wait over a week for a technician to come and replace it or they ll send me a new motor in   days and i can replace it   i ask will i still need the arc filter with new motor   yes  i will        for a treadmill that won t work in a modern day home    go figure   once i get the new motor  i ll update this review      
23,1.0,                       with covid here for the winter and no access to our gym  we decided it was time for a treadmill  our needs are pretty basic   the treadmill has to be able to handle two people running  k about three times a week  i m a    lbs     guy  and while i don t run fast i do a bit more than jogging  cheaper treadmills get too wobbly or bouncy at anything beyond a jog  not this one  the t   s does just as well as the one at the gym as far as i m concerned  the only difference is that the track is a bit more narrow  but it s plenty wide for our needs assembly was pretty easy  or so my wife tells me   she put it together almost all by herself  there were a couple parts that are easier with two people   our only hitch was that after it was all assembled  we couldn t get the panel beyond the  register at ifit  screen  we thought we didn t connect the panel properly or something  but after taking some things apart and putting them back together we realized we just needed to attach the safety key  duh  this was our fault as it does mention this in the instructions  still  an error message like  attach safety key  would have been nice versus an ambiguous  beepbeepbeepbeep  error now   this is all pretty complimentary  so why one star  it s all about the digital ecosystem  this treadmill has bluetooth  which gives it the capability to sync detailed workout stats  however  this feature is      worthless due to intentional choices made by nordictrack and ifit  bluetooth stat syncing only works with the ifit app  the ifit ecosystem does not integrate with any other ecosystem  like apple healthkit  fitbit  google fit  etc  the only ways to get your workout stats into those ecosystems are to either    input them manually  or    do a cumbersome export import process  every time  this is ridiculous for a treadmill that essentially has this feature built in but intentionally disabled so to our friends at nordictrack  if you read this  please reevaluate your partnership with ifit  i understand that everyone wants a recurring revenue model  i understand that peleton is super successful with theirs  it s totally fine to offer a subscription service for live and on demand workouts  i like the model of offering on an ipad app for that purpose versus requiring a more expensive piece of equipment with an extra touch screen  what is totally not fine is requiring a     per month per person subscription just to sync your workout data and to our friends at ifit   you are getting the business model wrong  the correct model is to offer a free basic service with a fee based premium service  the free service really needs to do little more that store workout data and offer an api to sync them with other ecosystems  i understand you do not even have this capability today on the paid service  this is almost certainly an intentional decision  but let me be clear  you will never a dominant health ecosystem using only proprietary devices  you just won t  i have no interest in switching all my health hardware to any single vendor  i have no desire to be forced to use your ifit fitness tracker instead of my fitbit or apple watch  and you will never keep up with all possible device categories   you don t even have a connected scale  what about sleep monitors  posture trackers  blood pressure monitors  stop  just let your ecosystem integrate with others like every other successful health company ends up doing of note  previous negative reviews were upset that the seemingly  required  ifit activation also required you to input a credit card number to bill you for the monthly service unless you remember to cancel  this is no longer the case   the ifit trial registration does not require a credit card  and you can still bypass the whole thing by holding down the ifit button for    seconds  so  this is not what i m upset about  i m upset that i would need to pay     month person to use the bluetooth  and even if i did pay i would have to use the ifit app exclusively to track my health data in conclusion   if you just want a solid treadmill with no digital features  this is a great choice  if you want something that integrates with the rest of your digital heath data  look elsewhere      
24,3.0,                       i received the treadmill today and my husband put it together  it is exactly what i was looking for and i m sure i will be happy with it  unfortunately  the bottom right rail next to the track is cracked  the box was damaged as well upon receiving but was unable to see the cracked piece until removing all of the contents  i emailed nordictrack and am notifying amazon as well and i m hoping the piece will be replaced and sent out asap  disappointed to receive a new item damaged but should be an easy fix  otherwise  i m anxious to start using it      
25,3.0,                       the product arrived on time and the xpo delivery people were kind and friendly   this has been one of those rare instances where amazon was not helpful and has made me reconsider making these types of purchases through their website   while the product arrived in good shape  one of the advertised aspects of this product was free in home assembly   i contacted amazon on   separate occasions trying to get help in this regard   they reassured me repeatedly that they would get it taken care of and that free in home assembly was included  however  no one knew how to help me and they just kept transferring me from department to department   eventually the home services people called  but just placed me on hold immediately and then hung up i was left needing to find a way to move and set up a very heavy treadmill   with some help  it go taken care of   but looking back i wouldn t have purchased the treadmill if i had known that the advertisement for in home setup is just a ploy that amazon makes very difficult to make a reality the treadmill itself is operating well and seems solid   the controls are not the most advanced  but for the price i feel it is nice   the operation is not noisy at all for a         lbs person and operates smoothly at running speeds   the incline and speed changes     speeds with fractional speeds in   ths  are a great feature and good for this price i will update after   months   right now i would say its a decent treadmill and i m glad to have it  however  the set up experience was deceptive and difficult and a service that was part of the purchase was never instigated by amazon and never performed after multiple contacts      
26,1.0,                       this treadmill has malfunctioned   times since i purchased it   when the stop key is pressed  if the treadmill does not stop and i press it again  it still doesn t stop but increases the speed from     mph  my usual walking speed  to   mph  the first time it happened about   weeks ago  i had a friend with me and he pulled the key to stop the machine so i did not fall   the second time it happened was on the  th of nov but it was running so fast i couldn t grab the key to stop it and when i did  it stopped but i fell   the last time it happened was yesterday nov   th but i was able to pull the stop key before it increased in speed   i did however  see the speed increase on the monitor and it was at   mph   luckily i pulled the key before it sped up   that s when i called customer support and filed this claim this machine is extremely dangerous and needs to be remedied   i want a safe treadmill and not one that will kill me before my time i have filed an injury claim with the icon legal team and it is being reviewed and they will look into some options to remedy this problem      
27,1.0,                       do not buy this     this treadmill was to come with one year ifit plan  to activate said plan you have to put in a charge card well ifit charged my card        and now i ve been waiting  hr    different times  min for someone to pick up the phone to ask why they charged my card    update  nordic trac contacted me and argued with me that ifit was available and then transferred me to the same number that i waited on last time  nordic trac customer service is a joke   should of gone with rebox like my old one  i am replacing   if you want headaches  order this treadmill      
28,2.0,                       i don t need a lot of fancy stuff on my treadmill  so i was looking at the cheaper ones to replace the one i had for about   years that cracked one day while i was jogging  however  that treadmill went to a     incline and   mph  and once i noticed that the cheaper ones only went to       on those measures  i moved up to this price range i was immediately frustrated that i was required to sign up for ifit to use the treadmill   are you kidding    fortunately  the installer  my order came with free installation  told my son a fantastic tip to what i guess he heard as a common complaint   if you hold down the ifit logo on the console for       seconds  you can bypass the opening screen and actually use the console treadmill   it is absolutely asinine that nordic track attempts to force buyers to sign up with ifit   i can t tell how much of a major turn off that is pros      incline and    mph  once you figure out how to bypass the initial console screen demanding an ifit registration  console is pretty easy to use  though instructions are scant on the buttons immediately below the screen  and what instructions there were were not consistent with the screen s behavior   unit  appears  sturdy but only time will tell     built in exercise routines  though i am a  manual workout  person myselfcons   see ifit comment above   asinine  absurd  ridiculous  plastic protector at head of running board is about   inches too close to my feet  so i occasionally land on it while jogging   yes  i like to hold the rails and interact with the controls while running   this was also an issue on my last treadmill   the cupholders are plastic and  thus quite noisy with a plastic bottle or remote control on them   come on  for      you could afford a little felt   i had to insert my own felt to cut down on the ridiculous noise   the side bars and pulse bars are about   inches too low for me  i am   feet tall    they are almost ok at zero incline  but at    incline  it is uncomfortable   i have to stoop over to use the pulse bars   again  for       it seems like it would have been extremely easy to make the console side bars adjustable so everyone could be comfortable   there is no  pause  button   you must hit  stop  and after some indeterminate relatively short time  the console will reset   when i use the pulse monitor and the reading appears  often it intermittently returns  overtaking the calorie reading  and i haven t figured out how to get that to stop   pulse monitor is erratic and does not seem to give consistent  accurate readings   see comments above re  screen settings  no control buttons  e g   speed incline  on hand rails  the incline does not return to zero after you are finished   this is actually quite shocking   you have to hit zero to return it to flat before powering off  console does not power off unless you remove the emergency key  there is no  off  button for the console   instructions tell you to power off and unplug the machine after every workout    or it will shorten the life of the unit    really      fortunately  the power off button is very small and near the floor   why not actually put it where it s easy to reach if it s so vital    does anybody think about how to best design a treadmill before they build it      
29,5.0,                       in the early   s   about    years ago  i bought a nordictrack treadmill   for around          recently  i decided we needed one with a shorter ramp because we re running out of space and spot where i wanted to put it   was about   inches too short   and one day while running on the old machine  i looked back at how much ramp space there was behind my feet that i wasn t using and wondered if anyone made a shorter treadmill now   the ramp on the old machine was like   feet long and i really only used the first     feet of it i went on amazon and looked them up and sure enough  to my delight  they make shorter ones now since my old one had lasted so long  even though it didn t really get much use    i decided to go with another nordictrack despite several negative and disturbing reviews i was very happily surprised to see these things selling for around      now   but i figured the quality will be worse or it will have fewer features   when we received it and got it all set up   i was amazed that the quality was as high as it was on the        machine and happy to see it had all the same features   the funny thing is   it literally has exactly the same features   they re just laid out and displayed in a different way   the buttons for speed and incline are easier to press and far more attractive to look at the center screen that supposedly has workout programs that you can follow   i find to be totally useless   i just use it to monitor my progress    how many minutes  how much distance i ve done  etc   but if it has some workout programs in it   it s not instantly obvious how to access them  so i haven t bothered   i don t care enough about that feature to worry about it the really nice thing about this newer version is that when you want to put the ramp up  do they call it a ramp   anyway  the thing your feet touch when you re running on it   when you put it up   you can literally do it with the touch of a finger   you just barely lift it   it s like lifting a   pound weight    and the hydraulics take care of the rest when you put it down  you unlock it and then just let go of it and it will settle down to the floor very gently on its own   you don t have to lift or hold any weight at all when you put it back down   on the    year old machine   that thing was seriously heavy and you had to have some real strength to lift it up and down   which was fine except it was a little scary   what if you drop it   and over the intervening    years  my back isn t exactly what it used to be   so it was actually a bit of a problem for my back   so  this new model is really awesome in this respect we also bought the     assembly package   the guy who came out was awesome   he put it together in about    minutes   the thing was a big complicated mess right out of the box   if i had attempted it   i m not even sure if i could have finished it   but if i could have  i am sure it would have taken at least a week   so  the     was well worth it   oh and by the way  keep in mind amazon doesn t really pay these guys all that well   amazon takes     of that fee   why   i don t know    because they re not doing any of the work or incurring any of the travel expenses   they really should give these guys     of it   so we left him a good tip   we knew it had taken him an hour to get to us from the last place he was   so  for amazon to pay him just     for what amounted to   hours of work we didn t really think was fair all in all i m very happy with it   it s not only every bit as good   but it s even better   than the old machine that cost  x more    years ago      
30,5.0,                       we received this machine this morning   i was curious to see what type of delivery we were going to get as it was free with my prime membership  but the delivery guys even brought it downstairs for us  it weighs over     lbs   so i wouldn t hesistate to use amazon again   i still need to figure out how the ifit works on this machine as it was included in the elliptical we have along with wifi connectivity  but as far as a treadmill goes  it works great   assembly did take a while  but we were being very cautious throughout the process   make sure you have a good ratchet set because the provided hex key would have been brutal to do manually   using my ratchet set  i was able to make sure everything was nice and tight   also  follow the directions carefully   there is a reason they tell you not to tighten the screws all the way sometimes   oh and don t forget  like any workout equipment  the machine won t turn on until you put the magnetic key in  with the safety strap    i quickly realized that after i plugged it in and the screen turned on and then turned off   we gave it a quick test run so far and the incline works  speeds seem good  it tracks all of the information you expect from a treadmill   we haven t tried the mp  input jack yet for music  but we have a tv in front of the unit  so i m not sure how much we will utilize the speakers anyway   the cup bottle holders on each side are nice   it folds up nicely and the provided pump ensures that it unfolds smoothly and won t come crashing down on your feet if it slips out of your hands   we plan to get the extended service plan just in case any of the parts go within the first few years  its included in the directions   but it seems pretty solid and i don t anticipate any issues  if i do  i will be sure to update my review      
31,5.0,                       without question  there are better and more advance treadmills out there but for the price of this one  you can t beat it  i m a runner  regularly training for marathons and i feel content saying this treadmill is everything you could need unless you are a competitive sub   minute mile runner  i ve been using this treadmill for about a month and a half  mostly so i could get runs in with a newborn at home and i haven t been disappointed in any way  i ve seen a lot of home treadmills that look very fragile but this one is solid  i m     lbs and run hard and even at various inclines  this thing is a rock  i m not scared that its going to break or fall apart  i haven t really played with the various training programs built in since i ve been following my own running plan but there are quite a few and they do auto adjust pace and incline which is nice i elected to put it together myself and it s rather simple  i had the whole thing together and running in maybe an hour  with it being such a sturdy treadmill  it is very heavy  i had it delivered directly into my garage and took everything out of the box there and then moved it piece by piece down to my basement  most individual pieces are very light except for the running deck track  i actually did it on my own using a handtruck but i do not recommend doing it with out at least one other person  i was inpatient and couldn t wait for a friend to come and slowly moved the deck down step by step   my only  complaint  which is hardly a complaint since i didn t order it for this feature  is the  speakers   there is a  mm input for your phone or tablet but the speakers are a joke    if you don t care about sound quality  then maybe they re ok but i d recommend your own headphones  i did mount a tv to the wall in front of the treadmill  with firetv  which when running at a fast pace  needs to have the volume turned up because the motor is a bit loud  but i don t feel any louder than an average treadmill  if you re in the market for a treadmill and don t want to spend thousands  this is the one   especially since amazon offersfree shipping   which for something over    lbs  i feel is a deal      
32,5.0,                       i ordered this treadmill a few weeks ago and it was delivered last week   i paid     extra to have amazon delivery  subcontracted  move it to the room of my choice which was the best     i have ever spent   why   this thing is sturdy and not the short average online order treadmill   this is full length gym size   not sure what the description review says but it weighed about     pounds and was in a   foot box i assembled it in about   hours  should have been one but i was distracted by game of thrones re runs    there were some steps that were a bit hard to see on the instructions but in general it was not tough at all   early feedback   the treadmill is sturdy  doesnt bounce around and fairly quiet for a treadmill  the handles and design are good and well made  the screen is a tad small but works fine  the ifit login is a bit annoying every time but maybe i can figure out how to bypass that  the incline and acceleration buttons and features are easy to use and slick  love the built in fan and bluetooth  some of the plastic molding is a bit wonky to snap into place as you build it so if it doesnt look right just keep at it  they eventually will pop into placeall in all we are really happy with this   the alternative was a       gym treadmill and i think we made a great purchase   will amend if something pops off tonight  besides my knee      
33,2.0,                       i bought this model     s on purpose because it said it was compatible with the ifit    i was aware of a monthly ifit subscription of       a month for   years totalling      upfront     however there is no true compatibility and this machine requires an extra ifit module to be purchased for        very misleading in the pictures and the info   wouldnt have purchased this if was really clear it would take another      just to have the ifit work on this machine   be aware      
34,1.0,                       this purchase has been a disaster from day one   first  it took a month for it to get delivered   now a month into using the thing and it stops after five minutes of use   of course this started after the return period lapsed   now i m trying to get a hold of the company that handles the warranty and i haven t heard a peep in two weeks   so i just got myself a big ol  hunk of junk that i use to hang my purse on      
35,1.0,                       i thought i would buy this for the convenience of rolling out of bed and doing cardio   in only three months of irregular use the belt comes off and gets twisted up as per photo      
36,1.0,                       this review is specifically for setup  as many others have complained about nordictrack really goes above and beyond to try to scam customers with the ifit subscription  i paid through amazon to have my treadmill assembled for me  the tech left the treadmill with all the notices on the display to activate ifit in order for the treadmill to function  the treadmill will literally be locked and unable to operate  i had already read reviews stating that this could be bypassed by holding down the ifit button for a few seconds  the tech claimed that the company must have disabled this feature and showed me that holding it down wasn t working  he told me i would have to sign up and then left without the treadmill operating  after a few hours of reading through the manual  going on the website  and trying to connect to both amazon and nordictrack customer service with no luck i finally found one random review that mentioned the safety key cord  holding down the ifit icon will only bypass the subscription if the safety key is in place  well mine was no where to be found  i went out to the trash and found it in the packaging at the bottom of the trash that the tech had offered to remove  i really have to wonder if it had been thrown out intentionally  as soon as i put the key in place i was able to bypass ifit and operate the treadmill in manual  shame on nordictrack for misleading customers with a forced subscription and for not making it clear in the manual or customer support info that it is not required  i will be thinking twice before purchasing a nordictrack product       
37,2.0,                       not listed on this web page are the warranty requirements  a friend stopped by while it was being delivered  and after discussing his experience i learned some surprising details after confirming it with nordictrack support    this treadmill must be placed in a climate controlled room  if it s used in the garage your warranty is void    it can t get warmer than    degrees while upright  this will stretch the belt  and void your warranty  this is a problem for people like me who go on vacation during the summer  and turn off the a c while i m gone  in a triple digit climate     this treadmill requires a dedicated circuit  if not  your warranty is void  after hearing it needed a climate controlled room  i figured i d put it in my office  until i learned that room has a single circuit for all the outlets  like most bedrooms do   an electrician offered to run a dedicated outlet for       ymmv my friend had his nordictrack warranty voided when the motor died    months into ownership  the service guy had a long list of reasons why they can void the warranty  make sure you know the fine print because repairing a broken treadmill can be expensive given this information that isn t mentioned anywhere in this description  i ve decided to return the unit  it s not worth the total cost and inconvenience of meeting the unmentioned warranty requirements      
38,5.0,                       i really love this treadmill   i paid the extra     to have them deliver it to the basement   well worth it   i assembled it by myself  which took a few hours over   nights   it wasn t the easiest to do  but it is certainly doable by one person   also  don t believe the nonsense requiring you to sign up for ifit   it is bs   i bypassed it using the instructions another reviewer left and it worked like a charm   here they are    how to bypass ifit  there is an ifit logo button on the display console  after assembly  hold down this buttonuntil the treadmill unlocks  about       seconds   sears posts these instructions on their site       
39,1.0,                       two of the main reasons i bought this item was because it had the google maps app that would allow me to walk some of my favorite roads across the country and i also liked this unit because i wanted an integrated heart rate monitor when i assembled and turned on the treadmill i found that to activate my free ifit account  that includes google maps  i would need to supply nordicktrack with a credit card number so that they could automatically bill it for      a year later as a renewal fee of my ifit membership with all the stolen and hacked personal information going on everywhere  i don t give my credit card information to anyone who does not absolutely need it  i tried calling nordicktrack to explain that i had zero intention of ever renewing my membership with them and just wanted the free year that i was promised but after being on hold for over    minutes without speaking to a real person i hung up as far as the heart rate monitor is concerned it is totally worthless  the numbers jump around like crazy  one second my rate is      then it s     and then it s     the longer you hold onto the inputs the more numbers you get and they never stabilize  luckily i have my fitbit tracker on so i know my true heart rate  still  i paid for an integrated monitor on the treadmill and it is worthless so instead of walking my favorite roads on google maps  i bought a     tv and hung it on the wall in front of the treadmill and instead of a heart rate monitor on the treadmill  i wear a fitbit  essentially what i have is a         vintage      treadmill  which in all fairness seems sturdy and solid  but the bottom line is i definitely would not have bought this model or this brand if i knew then what i know now  buyer beware      
40,4.0,                       overall a very good product  be aware that it is huge and heavy  however  ideally  assemble it where you plan to keep it  it doesn t fit through doors easily  certainly not with one person moving it      
41,4.0,                       i picked this treadmill for two reasons  reviews of the previous version     s  said it was built for running  not just walking   and i wanted the    inch screen and accompanying ifit workouts because i tend to get bored  it took two people about     hours to assemble  one wire wasn t where it was supposed to be and thank goodness for small hands  because i had to reach into the panel and fish it out  i m new to treadmills  so i don t know how loud it is compared to other machines  but it s louder than i d hoped  in order to hear the trainer talking  over the motor and my own panting   i have to turn up the volume pretty high    to a point where the speakers crackle sometimes  overall the music track is too loud and the trainer track is too soft  other than that  i have no complaints about the machine i view the ifit programs membership as a big part of this product  and the price   and i adore them  the ifit website is hard to navigate  they have so much amazing content  but it can be hard to find the type and level of workout you want  i started with the  true beginner  antarctica series to get used to using a treadmill  and kept with it even though it was maybe too easy for me just because i enjoyed it so much  i m also very grateful for the iberian beginner running series  which eases you  back   into running without overdoing it and getting hurt this was a huge splurge for me  but one i m glad i made      
42,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill in place of a gym membership because i find it extra hard to leave the house in the winter to make it to the gym  this has been a great solution for our family  even my husband likes to get on and go for a walk before work which makes it all worth it  the ifit program is awesome  you can work with a trainer in a gym doing high impact cardio or go for a hike through alps  love the versatility and variety of programs  much more motivating to have an instructor guiding you through a workout than a traditional walk run on a treadmill  the touch screen is great  sound is ample and i love the bluetooth function to stream my own music  easy to use and has everything you need to keep your work out comfortable  it is like having a nice gym caliber treadmill at home   the machine is not too loud and belt runs smooth  cannot say enough about the quality  i will say this   setting it up was a workout in itself   have a good set of pliers as the bolts are a bit tricky  so worth the investment      
43,5.0,                       ok  before i bought this machine  i read all reviews and i was scared of this investment  i m a body builder and cardio is part of my life style  i wanted to make sure that this is the right one for me  i been using this treadmill for   days and so far it s amazing  assembly toke me     hr  nothing hard and all hardware and parts arrived perfect shape  now in regard to i fit and set up  man don t stress or sign up for anything  just once you turn the power on  hold press i fit button for    second and boom it will start all programs and you won t have to worry about it  don t sign up or nothing   if you looking to maintain or lose weight  get this treadmill  its worth the money  as far as the motor i ll keep update later if i have any issue  get your   years warranty  you need it too  be safe everyone     
44,1.0,                       bought the treadmill like     months ago and it started making noises two weeks ago  contacted nordic track and they told me i need to buy a warranty because i don t have one  treadmill is making loud grinding noises and is impossible to use but instead of fixing it  nordictrack is trying to push and expensive warranty on me and even then i don t know if with their  great  customer service they ll actually do anything to fix this  i was under the impression that there was a year long warranty on the treadmill already  never buying another nordictrack treadmill in my life never mind the fact that i don t know what to do now  i have an expensive broken down treadmill  and no one to help fix it      
45,1.0,                       unfortunately i have to send this back  i had the guy come to assemble and once he opened it all up there was a hole in the belt  i waited over a month to get it  very disappointed  the treadmill it self looks well made and nice but due to the damage i have to send back and again it s out of stock  although amazon was very helpful with getting me a refund it s a bummer that i still have no treadmill  what a pain      
46,1.0,                       product was damaged in the box  motor housing and incline hydraulics damaged  nordic track lost our registration  even though we received a confirmation email from them  which evidently had the wrong model and serial numbers listed  nordic track has been unable to resolve the issue for us  so we have a useless  defective treadmill sitting in the room  how appalling      
47,1.0,                       i ve had it since january and it s been working fine until the firmware was updated this week  now i just get a loading screen and can t use it when trying to do an activity  when trying to see if a newer firmware is available it is stuck on  checking for update  update  i wasn t able to find information on online how to do a factory reset  but i found it at the top of the machine factory reset steps turn off the machineget a paperclip and push it in the hole as seen in the picturesturn on the power with your foot or a second person  but keep the paperclip held intake out the paperclip after you see it updating  see picture      
48,5.0,                       this review is for the nordictrack t     si treadmill     year ifit membership  worth it   with the    inch screen i have owned this treadmill for   months   day as of the current date writing of this review  may          this is the first treadmill i have ever owned  i actually bought it as a gift to my girlfriend  and it has been awesome  she loves it too  of course assembly        the assembly was interesting  to say the least  but with the help of my girlfriend  it took us between an hour or two to finish  i m pretty sure it was much closer to two hours  i do not think it is possible to assemble by yourself but kudos to you if you manage to get it assembled on your own  then again  try it by yourself and you ll be so worked up from not having an extra    pairs of hands to help that you ll be ready to run    miles when it s all said and done  i personally would not recommend it  though  you  in some instances  need someone to hold the upper half of the frame while the other is screwing stuff in to anchor it all together  i mentioned the assembly was interesting earlier in the sense of how everything eventually came together so perfectly  there s always one or two small hiccups with getting a screw hole to align   maybe it is just me but that seems to always be expected when i put anything together  i do recall having a slight issue where some wires on the right hand side needed to be tucked away  i think we were able to rig it so they stayed put so no real big issues there   they are actually run through inside the right bar that stands vertically touching the floor  the only bar connecting the bottom of the treadmill to the top   it s maybe at a slight    degree angle  anyways  those particular wires are used to connect either the speakers  monitor  or both  either way  you have to have them  i rate the instructions and everything assembly related a     deducting one star because you need a second person  as far as how well written the instructions goes and the lack of wtf s that didn t happen  much  which is good by the way   i rate that a     quality        i personally think the quality of the treadmill  build materials  the built in    inch screen  speakers  and any other random odds and ends to be pretty good quality  there is a lot of plastic but it all feels solid and sturdy and should last for many  many years to come noise        i think the noise is about as quiet as you can make a treadmill  then again  if you re running in place on something suspended off the ground then there are bound to be thuds with each step   i speak from firsthand experience  the speakers get quite loud so that s good noise if you are playing music or watching some of the ifit videos which will be discussed further down but not too far in depth since i want to keep my review specifically on the treadmill itself  yes  i realize ifit is more   fit   to be in the feature section below yet here it is    features          if you want some good bells and whistles without dropping three grand on a ferrari like treadmill this is absolutely more than enough  especially if you re like me and have never owned a treadmill before  it is a    speed treadmill with    levels of incline that increment from being flat       all the way to     degree angle upwards maybe       at     increments  the ifit membership i think is stunning  running in another country or hillside with a trainer all while enjoying the scenery  don t wimp out on monitor size or this is less enjoyable  while getting a good workout makes using this treadmill so much more enjoyable pleasant  i m not sure what the little orange yellow cushion things are called but they are there as support for your joints  when you land  from jogging or running  they squish down to reduce the impact on your knees and other joints  i thought they looked silly but now that i know how well they work and what they are for i don t think they are so funny anymore  the other features you can more easily see from viewing the posted pictures  cupholders  how big the speakers are  buttons  other little knickknacks  i have not had to use the folding feature of the treadmill to  tuck  it away in a corner but i did enjoy playing with the feature when putting it together  i have only used it honestly like     times and from what i could tell it works well  i do like that there is a  no slam  feature where if when you are letting it down and it slips it won t come crashing down  it will catch itself and slowly lower itself down automagically safe and sound   so that s neat  i docked half a point because the heartbeat sensor s  you put your hands on don t really work all that well  i don t expect them to be      perfect or accurate by any means but i found that i have to  more of than not  situate my hands jusssst the right way for it to start giving me a readout  no biggie for me personally  since i have a fitbit watch  but for anyone out there who is curious   it doesn t work very well for me personally  you might not have any issues with yours but i do with mine  again  no deal breaker for me by any means ifit membership        this i am going to briefly touch on and recommend everyone visit the nordictrack website under the ifit section  i would post a link but i don t know if amazon filters those out or not so i ll leave it up to you to learn your way around google  there is a ton of information there if you are interested for more information  our purchase included the   year free ifit membership  i am pretty certain that alone is a      value  what i like about it the most is that my girlfriend and i have created our own accounts and can share the membership  this way i can track my workouts and she can track hers on our own unique accounts  logging in and out is pretty seamless  couple touches and you re logged in   i believe once you login once it doesn t log you out automatically so it s a matter of swapping accounts based on who is about to workout  you can keep track of things such as what days we worked out on  what workout we did  for how long  calories burned  and a lot more  the membership is honestly a really great idea though  just make sure you have your treadmill somewhat close to your modem or router  for internet   like most things nowadays   the videos need to be streamed while you are viewing them  aka  you need to be online and connected to the internet  so be aware of your placement when deciding where to put your treadmill i hope this review has helped anyone on the fence as to what they want for their next treadmill happy treading      
49,2.0,                       i received this new treadmill with broken motor hood on              i contacted amazon  then nordictrack support   i made too many calls  chats   i even registered my treadmill with nordictrack and created a new support order to report the broken hood   today is december           i have not received any response   what kind of company is that   sale the product with all warranties and run away      
50,1.0,                       these are discounted due to preexisting damage    they all arrive pre broke that s why there so cheap  there where several other reviews on here with same damage i have to support this     
51,5.0,                       ok  first of all  what s up with these b ogu s reviews  i got a fairly good bargain on this machine and it came brand new  keep reading though took me about   hr to set it up  only tool that didn t come in the set was a x   mm  i think  wrench which was fine  i was able to set most of it up myself to the point where i was walking on it in no time  only part you need a person   is when installed the hydraulic bar first impressions really nice  the incline is smooth  belt pull is powerful with the     hp engine  i barely have any room now to walk around in my room  but with this baby i will be having my beach body in no time   contrary to popular belief  it does not squeak while running on it  at the time of writing this  i weigh around    lb         and i am able to comfortably walk incline and run on this machine in a carpet setting some people think that you need to purchase the ifit membership to use the machine     this is not true  i simply put it together  then put the magnetic emergency fitbit on the bar  push and hold the ifit bluetooth button for a few seconds and it ll beep and over ride the screen will update if i have any problems although i doubt it  am very satisfied with purchase     
52,4.0,                       the delivery people brought the treadmill right in to room of choice and unboxed and removed all the trash  i laid out all the parts and they are well marked right or left  the hardware is all separated by step as in the manual shrink wrapped to cardboard and labeled by step  the manual assembly instructions are very good  i noticed that the steel supports are really heavy gauge steel and well anchored to the treadmill base  the assembly was pretty straight forward and i did it all myself with the help of a ratcheting tie down strap  i used this to hold the treadmill base up while i did the steps underneath the base like the hydraulic holdup support for when you fold up the treadmill  this hold up support is great  it helps when folding the unit and slowly lowers the base to the floor to use  the only negative thing i can see about the treadmill is the lock on the treadmill mill until you log into ifit and give them info so they can charge your account every month  it s like planet fitness you give your checking account info and they charge monthly and make it hard to cancel  this is very bad move by nordictrack and should be discontinued  i should not have to signup for a service that is in fact part of icon fitness along with nordictrack  now you can bypass this by pressing the ifit button and hold down about    seconds  this didn t work for me and i was upset until i read you have to have your safety key in place for anything to work  guess what  i didn t have the key in place  i put it in place and treadmill starts right up  the thing i wonder is wether nordictrack does away with the bypass which would be criminal and i wouldn t buy this  as far as i can see the product is well built and functions well  i will revisit this review with updates as i see how product and service goes  we have been using this treadmill for a while now and it is actually fairly quiet as compared to our last treadmill      
53,3.0,                       you must have an ipad to use this device as shown in the pictures and video   i should have looked closer   i m right at    lbs  which is its max weight rating   when i walk on it  i can feel the belt momentarily hesitate with each footfall   hopefully this will improve as i lose weight  which is my goal   the most annoying  feature  is that if you touch any of the controls after you start your workout  it will stop completely and you have to start over   even if you ve been walking or running for    mintues  you better know which buttons you can push to keep it going  this is the only treadmill i ve ever seen that works this way   there is no pause button   so if you have to stop for a minute to refill your water  or if you accidentally push one of the buttons  you re done and have to start over it went together okay  but you can t do it alone   you need help   and plan on one screw not going in right   it s not idiot proof by any means  and trust me on this one  i m an idiot   lolthe heart monitor doesn t seem to work very well  though i do have an alternative method for monitoring that   it says it has it  and it should have it   it doesn t work so if you can find a cheaper one that you don t have to pay extra for stuff that doesn t work  if you weigh    lbs or more  or if you don t have an ipad  get the cheaper one   what happened to nordictrack      
54,1.0,                       treadmill delivered today  delivery was smooth  assembly was difficult but we got it done  registered with ifit as instructed  downloaded the app  then decided to switch to manual  turned on the treadmill without a problem  i calibrated the incline as instructed in the manual  set the speed to   mph and started walking  when i increased the incline  it went up to level    and stayed there  absolutely stuck  fortunately  i had registered my treadmill with nordictrack  i called customer service who walked me through trouble shooting  nothing worked  the rep  who was very patient and courteous by the way  said it was a problem with the display not communicating with the incline function motor sensor  a new controller is being sent but will take      business days  all this on day    i m tired and frustrated  i ll update my review once i install the new controller update  installed new controller  incline still stuck  called customer service who suggested i perform calibration  that didn t work either so i m being sent a new incline motor  sigh update  based on problems from the start  i began to question this treadmill s overall reliability   i made the decision to return  i will say that nordictrack s customer service was courteous and responsive parting thoughts  unpacking as well as assembly was cumbersome and difficult  screw holes didn t always line up and screws often took a great deal of strength to drive in properly  instructions weren t as clear as i d hoped  despite multiple mediums including the bilt app parts can take over      business days to arrive and can be a challenge to install  after reading other reviews questioning price fluctuations and whether this treadmill may be a returned or refurbished item  i m beginning to wonder the same  on the plus side  customer service from nordictrack and amazon was excellent  if you have the time and patience to work through assembly and mechanical issues  this could be a great machine  the belt ran smoothly  if only for a few minutes  the folding mechanism is convenient and simple to operate and the display panel is bright and clear      
55,1.0,                       there is one huge flaw in this machine   and that is if you intend to use the incline feature you will no longer be able to reach anything out in front of you  meaning you can not reach your water bottle   music device   digital read out display   or even to use the heart rate grip handles   if you look at the machine in the pictures   you will notice a black plastic insert that runs on top of the actual tread mill just below the display   as you incline the machine   this part of the treadmill comes closer to you    meaning you have to move more backwards on the machine in order to avoid stepping on it   you have to move back so far that you literally have to bend over at the waist just to use the heart rate grips   i found myself keep having to step on the sides off the treadmill and stop my walk anytime i wanted to change my music or change a feature on the unit   very very frustrating  if you walk for say    to    minutes and you watch videos on youtube or something like that   you will have to literally stop walking and step off the machine as many times as the videos run out   or your music choice changes   i don t hold onto the rail in front of me anyway  but if you are someone who does   you will not be able to do so with the unit inclined   you will keep stepping on the plastic piece and can literally injure yourself the first time you do it   machine seems nice otherwise but this is to huge of a flaw to give it anything but   star   i guess everyone else is not using the incline feature   and no   i am not   feet tall    with long legs  only       and my wife is      and has the same issue   just note the above and take into consideration when purchasing  i wouldn t buy this unit again   and already put together and box tore up to return   frustrating      
56,1.0,                       defective  motor was out on setup  customer service was not very good  i am stuck with a treadmill until friday that will not run  also the treadmill was suppose to come with assembly and shipping  the system didn t work right so we had to wait another week for the technician tom while he was good he suggested i call nordic track    hours of calling to find out the machine has a bad motor in it  this was not a good experience  if there was a zero i would put it      
57,5.0,                       i am     pounds and       it shakes a little when i am on it  the handrails are a bit short and the front plate should be further up so people that want to stand really close to the console are able to do so without stepping on it and tripping all that said i love this treadmill  i personally feel it is sturdy  i love the one touch buttons to change speed and incline  i don t know why i didn t buy one of these for my home sooner  i got a good sweaty workout as soon as my ex boyfriend set it up for me   he set it up basically by himself but the delivery men put it where we needed it  for a fee  so we did not have to move the heavy box at all  the large cups hold my remote  my hydroflask  and my cell phone  while the lip of the console holds a book  with a book opener clip holding it open hands free  lastly  holding down the ifit button for    seconds did not work even after multiple attempts  i bit the bullet and put in my credit card  i was able to immediately cancel the membership online via ifit com   my account   cancel benefits pro tip  watch a youtube vid on assembly  there are multiple i am very pleased with my purchase i will update if i get charged for ifit or if the machine malfunctions in anyway      
58,1.0,                       in order to use this treadmill it seems like you are required to create an account with ifit including giving them all your personal contact information  and your credit card information   you can cancel the  free  trial after the    days but i find it outrageous that corporations can get away with this kind of invasion of privacy   i should be able to use the treadmill i paid good money for without being forced to give away all my personal information to another company so that they can profit from it   luckily i found out that you can override the registration to use it by holding down the ifit button for    seconds  but that is nowhere in the manual or instructions   nordic track and ifit should be ashamed of their predatory policies      
59,2.0,overall seems ok for the price  size and features   would go for another treadmill in the future   bad stuff   belt  belt is closer         not       not a huge deal i guess but  i expect actual measurement to be listed  not what they round it up to   especially since these seem to be largely priced out based on how wide the belts are  belt also seems to flip up slight on the edges   lubricant belt is self self lubricated so that is good  what i do not like is that they want you to call them if you think the belt needs lubricant  i m assuming that is so you pay for one of their service people  or vendor that they get cut in on  or try to get you to sign up for a plan  they should just list reasons lubrication would be needed and a recommended lubricant  updated            the belt seems to slow down each step when you walk on a slow speed  not sure if that s a normal thing but  i ve tightened the belt quite a bit and don t want to anymore at risk of damage  it is also kind of tough to tighten each side  you basically have to fish around with the allen key on each side   ifit i guess they want you to login and create a profile with a credit card  it doesn t say it anywhere that you can just hold the ifit logo for something like    seconds to bypass it   tools they just have the allen key included  used to assemble and adjust belt  but you also need to a philips screw driver  which most people have  and a wrench  would be a real pain to use a regular wrench  i used a ratcheting with a    extension  considering how expensive these things are  they could included more tools and design it to were everything is more accessible   board there seems to be   random screw holes on the bottom of the board   maybe for an add on item  maybe they don t have much quality control and something else is messed up   good stuff   heavy and sturdy when assembled it seems very sturdy and hopefully built to last   display easly accessible and you can adjust speed incline by pressing arrows or number         price we got this  this month for           for a machine with what they call a     belt           and the incline decline it seemed to be a good price   tips   i recommend not tightening the base screws too tight until your done assembling  it mentioned this at the end of the instructions  i do not recall seeing this at the beginning   sorry for all the typos  
60,4.0,                       overall this treadmill is very good and gets the job done  however for its price point i will nitpick at a few things that bothered me  the setting up process was a bit tedious and took a few hours  no big deal  however one of the side arms did not properly fit into the main console and it took a while to jimmy it around to get the holes to align properly for the screws  it fits but there are pieces of the plastic that aren t sitting right  my biggest complaint is with the ifit program on the screen  if you re looking to be able to sync your treadmill to the ifit cardio app  the blue one  you cannot do this with this model  as we found out  this model does not have the option to press the ifit button to allow you to enter a code on your phone and sync the two products via bluetooth  only audio bluetooth is available  however  you are able to keep track of your progress with the ifit coach app  the green one   while there is no bluetooth syncing that takes place between the treadmill and your phone  logging into your ifit account allows the phone to simultaneously keep track of your steps  what trails you ve done  how many miles you ran walked  etc which is nice  my only con is that we had to do a little digging to figure out which app actually worked with this model  and i would have liked it to have been more clear in the paperwork that came without the treadmill      
61,5.0,                       this was everything and more than i expected   sturdy  quiet and filled with options   i paid to have it put together and the men were so profession and did a great job   great purchase        
62,5.0,                       in order to bypass ifit registration  i had to put the red safety key magnet in place and then hold down the ifit key  i tried holding the ifit key down for    seconds multiple times before that with no success per other reviews  but worked like a champ in about ten seconds after putting on the magnet      
63,1.0,                       the treadmill looks great   however  they don t tell you that once you buy it for           tax  get it assembled          although this was included for this deal     you can t just plug it in and use it     you have to first sign up for ifit membership  whether you want it or not        day free trial  but you still have to provide your credit card information and remember to go cancel it after    days if you don t want to continue getting charged   the reason for the   star  there is no   star option   is that i still can t get it activated     i ve signed up for the ifit membership and i got a nice email that said that the machine was unlocked and is ready to go    but the treadmill display still says go to ifit com activate    product live customer support is only during us business hours mon friday    so although delivery and assembly were completed on a friday evening  the machine is useless until they are back on monday    warning for future buyers   buy it knowing that getting to actually use it is not as easy as just plugging it in   i am very disappointing that i won t get to use it over the weekend    and depending on if the activation gets resolved on monday  i may have to return it  which will be a hassle after getting it assembled    the person who assembled did not mention this little tibit of needing to  activate it  beyond plugging it in until he completed the assembly        
64,1.0,                       pulse sensor wildly erratic  nordictrack offered bogus solutions  ignored request to send someone to repair  and  refused to acknowledge that the treadmill is defective   amazon  thank you   resolved the problem      
65,1.0,                       don t buy this   i bought this treadmill   the first thing you see once you unpack is a big red sign  saying your treadmill is locked and you must visit ifit and accept their membership to get your treadmill unlocked   you must give them your credit card number and although your first month is free  then they will charge you        a month  unless you cancel   what a scam   i paid over      bucks for this treadmill  put it together and i still have to pay to get it unlocked   i could understand if they offered the ifit as extra and additional coaching helps to buy if you were interested  but to actually lock your own property and force you to give them credit card information          
66,1.0,                       nordictrack honestly has some down right criminal tactics in order to make it seem like you have to buy a subscription in order to actually use the treadmill  they count on setting up a free trail you will forget about so they can continue to bill your account     every month  like they didn t just sell you an      piece of equipment  the truth is you don t need a subscription  or contact them  you just have to press and hold the ifit button on your treadmill for about    sec  and it can be used as normal  the treadmill itself isn t bad    but nothing special either  if only i had done my research about this company i wouldn t of supported such shady tactics  the only reason i gave it one star is because no stars wasn t an option  despite what they lead you to believe you never have to interact with this company  don t visit their god awful website  support their criminal behavior  or give them your card s information      
67,4.0,                       the delivery was so unreliable because amazon handed it off to xpo and despite multiple calls and sms confirmations  they delayed the delivery and only after i complained to an amazon rep was it scheduled and delivered on time again  the delivery guys delivered it inside the door but it s really heavy so if you want it moved somewhere you will need strong people to move it from an assembly point of view   it took my husband and me around   hours with a tool kit to assemble it  the instructions were really clear with no scope for confusion and all the parts were labeled really well  thanks to the multiple reviews with the trick to not have to register to ifit  we were able to start the treadmill without signing up or paying anywhere  the screw and bolt for the part that helps in folding the treadmill is very weird and we were unsuccessful in getting that fixed but since we do not intend to fold it and the treadmill stays in the basement it wasn t a show stopper for us performance wise it s been a few weeks since it was put to use and there are absolutely no complaints  very easy to use  feels exactly like a regular gym treadmill      
68,3.0,                       i had concerns ordering this  many people had bad experiences and i had one too  this thing is heavy       pounds  so if the item is mishandled improperly  there is going to some damage to the plastic covers  it s very flimsy  and there is no protection on the side  mine was broken when it came  so i called amazon on the same day and they approved it immediately  i asked what to do about the installed one  the lady on the line said to dismantle  wrong info   and put in the box  i forgot to check the return information in my amazon account  my bad   it said that the person who will come will dismantle and take it  but i did it anyway  because of the original info from amazon support the installation is pretty straightforward  but you do require one more hand and then go methodically over the instructions  the console support stands are a problem when screwing  so recommend you tilt it to the side and screw them in  the screws are tight  the unit requires    amp actually  my    amp breaks the circuit  with both units   the good and the bad pros  the unit is sturdy and looks nice  the speaker connection is nice   in low speeds  the unit is quiet  the dampers allow you to run without much force on your feet  the one touch incline is quite nice  the heavy duty motor is good  the     wide walking belt is great  the hydraulic support for folding the treadmill is genius cons  the unit is very heavy  requires two persons to assemble without risk of injury   some assembly routines are hard to do  bolts are hard to do manually   not easy to move around because of the weight  wheels are not that helpful to move it around the room   don t count on support from nordictraccheck the unit when it arrives  if there is damage  call amazon and let them know  they will ship a replacement  don t try to assemble it  because it may end up being a waste of time      
69,5.0,                       this was my first treadmill purchase and i spent several weeks researching various models and reading product reviews to become as informed as possible  to start with  my wife and i love our new nordic track  is it perfect  no  those who reserve   stars for only a perfect item will never rate anything   stars  it is a very good treadmill in my experience and while i did read of some people having technical issues  that has not been my experience  i have been regularly using my treadmill for   months now  so i do have a decent amount of experience with it in order to leave a fair review one of the things i really like about this treadmill is the ifit compatibility  there are so many different types of workouts you can select with a full range of beginner to experienced in all categories  you can choose walking  hiking  running  cross training  walk run  etc  and there are several series for beginners and advanced users as well  weight loss  running series  incline series  and more  they have a great assortment of trainers and the treadmill syncs to the workout you choose and adjusts the speed and incline automatically throughout the workout  you do have the ability to easily override the auto adjustments in case you need to slow it down or want to speed it up more  but it is really nice being able to just focus on form and enjoy the workout without having to change speed and incline throughout i assembled the treadmill myself and it was very easy to do  only the last part required a second person to assist and in total  it took me about   hours from start to finish  the instruction manual is concise and easy to follow  i was missing two small screws that secure the cup holders in place  but one call and they were quickly shipped out to me and arrived   days later  these missing screws did not prevent me from using my treadmill in the meantime i don t fold my treadmill regularly as i don t need the floor space  but i did include a picture of the folded position so you can see how it looks  if you have a lack of floor space but still want a treadmill  this may be the answer  the motor is not very loud in my opinion  it is a treadmill and there is going to be some noise  when the incline is increasing or going down  the noise is more distinct  but it really does not sound louder than one should expect to hear from a motor raising and lowering a heavy treadmill with someone on it the incline has a range of      and that is perfectly good for where i am at  i suppose endurance runners and very advanced users may want more of an incline  but it is ideal to me  the speed range is from      miles and i have only taken it up to    mph so far  maybe one day i will hit   mph and wish i could go faster  but i think i am pretty good with the speed range for a long time i purchased the   year maintenance warranty on amazon and recommend it if only to have it professionally serviced once per year  i do not want to have to deal with extra out of pocket costs if something breaks down and for      you can hardly go wrong  you will see when you register your treadmill on the nordic track site that they will offer you the same coverage  but it is a lot more expensive  buy it through amazon finally  some people don t like the ifit membership cost  it is     per month or     per month for a family plan  i received   free months with my purchase and renewed it as soon as my free trial was up because it s such a great feature  if you do not want an ifit membership  you can still use the treadmill in manual mode as well as the    preset programs the treadmill comes with  i think it would still be a great treadmill without ifit  but i encourage you to at least use the free ifit trial period before deciding you don t want it the other models of this treadmill include bigger screens and higher inclines  i may upgrade myself in   years  but if you want a great first treadmill  i highly recommend this one      
70,4.0,                       it just arrived yesterday and i am very excited to try it out   i paid extra for the amazon assembly because i didn t want to set it up wrong  i didn t any scratches or dents like others have posted it  i am giving   stars because i think they should have at least included a free trail for ifit   other than that i am happy  i will update if anything goes wrong  great purchase  fast shipping and great assembly      
71,1.0,                       treadmill did not work from the start   had to trouble shoot with a customer support rep remotely to find out the motor did not work   so they sent a new motor and a link to a video on how to install  the video is for a different treadmill    after i did install it the belt did not fit correctly   another    minute hold for tech support to tell me to adjust it according to the instruction manual   disappointed with treadmill but more disappointed with horrible service   wish zero stars was an option   a nice person on the phone would have been worth   stars      
72,5.0,                       uh mazing  i paid for assembly and delivery to the exact room where my treadmill would go  after months of stalking treadmills online  scouring offer up  and diving deep into the reviews sections of websites  i decided to go with this treadmill as my quarantine machine  honestly  i wish like heck i had just taken the plunge sooner because this has been one of the best purchases of my year  i m not the best runner  but i like to get a good sweat in and wanted something that offered at least up to   mph of speed  this treadmill offers that and level    incline  the fold up mechanism is also brilliant  it s so easy and there s some sort of suspension thing that make folding it up down a breeze  i have had no problems with this treadmill and i ve used it every day since owning it  usually  walk run sprinting anywhere from     miles  there are pulse tracking sensors on the handles  but i don t use them because i have an iwatch  i also don t use the bluetooth speaker stuff because i prefer to use my alexa as it works better to annoy my slytherin upstairs neighbors  all in all  i m enamored with this treadmill and honestly wish i had gotten this thing as soon as the pandemic hit so that  quarantine fifteen  would have been in the opposite direction on the scale  this is a great piece for the casual runner and you can get your workout in any time of the day  for reference  i m about       weigh around      and have a pretty long stride  the treadmill has a bit of a quake when i run  but it doesn t feel unsturdy  final take away  this is a good little machine  spring for the assembly if you don t like lifting a     pound box and doing spatial math  you won t be disappointed    can t recommend her enough         
73,3.0,                       this treadmill broke after only two weeks of light use  we have never had a treadmill do that  nordic track customer is terrible  there is no human you initially talk to  everything at initial intake is via computer only  we are on day two and have had no contact from nordic track  for the amount of money you spend contact should be a human not a computer update cutomer service finally contacted us         via email only  they still aren t sending a technician out to fix it  very dissatisfied with service on a high price item second update          icon fitness parent company to nordic trac still hasn t called or emailed regarding a service visit i finally called amazon product support and they were great  the machine was not broken but needed to be reset  this machine needs to be plugged into a surge protected power strip  power outage tripped the electronics up and that is why it wasn t working  the gentleman that helped me at amazon was very good  but nordic trac customer service was no help at all  so for that reason i am only upgrading the review to three stars      
74,5.0,                       this treadmill is a great value  i paid close to double the amount for a treadmill with less features approximately   years ago  at home equipment keeps getting better and cheaper amazon coordinated the delivery service and that was a tremendous value  i was very happy that i paid for it here  to coordinate the same service through nordictrack s website was going to cost triple the amazon price i consider myself to be pretty handy  but this still took me about an hour to assemble  nothing terribly difficult  just time consuming i don t love the graphical user interface and the fact that it works over wifi  i tend to use manual workout mode  so the extra features aren t very desirable to me  starting a manual workout is pretty easy and quick though  it s not really a negative   i just don t care for it this treadmill provides a smooth  steady  and quiet ride      
75,4.0,                       i ve had this treadmill now for over two months and have been using it fairly consistently for almost   weeks now  i walk and briefly run on it     days week  i assembled it by myself  and can tell you while it is possible  it will be much easier to do it with help  for reference  i m a   yr old       female  the hardest part was putting in the storage latch bar  which definitely screams for another person to hold the tread up while putting the bar in  after assembly  kept trying to bypass the ifit membership requirement but failing before realizing the emergency stop clip has to be on before you can bypass ifit  after that  started walking on it  by  rd day  saw that the belt was shifting to the left until it was right against the side of the track  read the instructions on how to fix this  but the fix was very short lived  have not been able to fix and the belt is all the way over to the left of the track  it hasnt jumped over the edge of the track though and hasnt caused any issues so i just use it while continuously monitoring the situation  basic treadmill that does what it needs to  so fairly satisfied with my purchase for the price i paid  that could well change depending on how long it continues to work without issues  the warranty is also not   year  but a disappointing   months  was not pleased to see that in the paperwork packet      
76,2.0,                       machine is noisy   i contacted the company regarding it and another question  the reply was  we will get back to you  and that was  weeks ago   the  whine  seems to be the belt or perhaps the motor  that seems to hesitate when first turned on   also  it  squeaks  when i walk  i weigh      and don t use it for running    i had another brand machine that i had used for over five years and replaced it with this one   not a good decision         
77,4.0,                       i ve been looking for a treadmill for quite awhile  and while i would have loved to buy one from peloton  i didn t want to wait around until may  and i also didn t want to spend a fortune   believe me  i thought that purchasing a treadmill under       was a risky proposition  but ultimately  i am very happy with t   s from nordictrack let me start by saying i was skeptical about the price of      from amazon   why was it marked down so much   i think i discovered this when the treadmill was delivered to my home   be aware that this treadmill comes in a very large box and weighs     pounds   i paid the extra     for it to be delivered to the room of my choice  which was down a flight of stairs that has some pretty tight corners   i live alone  so this was absolutely the best option   unfortunately  i wasn t able to open the box  which had some pretty severe gouges rips in it  by the way  until that evening   had i been able to open it with the delivery crew present  i would have sent it back immediately   the side rail  made of mostly plastic  had ripped from the mdf underlayment  surface just under the tread   and had shattered in multiple places   i discovered this after removing several of the parts and packaging well  i went right to my computer and contacted amazon chat support to inform them of the issue   they were great  actually  and immediately scheduled the delivery of a replacement treadmill   i boxed the damaged treadmill back up  though the email from amazon that i received a moment later told me that was unnecessary as the amazon staff that were to pick up the damaged treadmill would bring packing materials so  a week later the delivery men for the new treadmill showed up   they immediately told me they wouldn t deliver the treadmill down to my basement  but after i told them that i paid for that service and argued a bit  they agreed to   i have to warn you  the design of the packaging of this treadmill is pretty poor   if it is rested on a corner of the box  or even the side with any force  it will likely get damaged   it might be a good idea to warn the delivery guys about this before they transport it to the room of your choice   i also now wonder if amazon tried to pawn off the damaged one to me initially  knowing full well it was damaged   i guess i ll never know in any case  the new treadmill made it to my basement unharmed   after unpackaging all of the parts  carefully placing the foam inserts aside in case i had to repackage it   i was confident that nothing had been damaged in transport   i then read the entire assembly manual  which i highly recommend doing  so that you know what is coming   after getting the necessary tools  screwdriver  adjustable wrench  and a socket set if you have one   i assembled the treadmill in about an hour and a half   i was able to do it myself  but it would certainly be easier with two people  particularly the point where you have to hold the treadmill up at an angle while you assemble the piston that allows you to lift it up and down for storage if you want to  i just leave mine down  once the entire treadmill was assembled  i plugged into the wall with a power strip  also  recommended  and turned it on   yes  i m sure you ve read all of the other emails about the requirement to sign up for ifit   well true  the ifit icon does show up on the screen  and there is a bunch of documentation in the packaging about it  but as everyone else has mentioned  you just hold down the ifit logo button on the keypad for about       seconds and the warning will go away   note  you need to have the safety stop magnet applied to the grab bar  or this process won t work   also  i ve notice that you only need to do this the very first time you power the treadmill on  on every subsequent power up  it goes straight to the regular dashboard as far as the functionality of the treadmill goes  it s actually pretty great  and just what i need   it s quite simple with settings for incline and speed  both up to     and i like that i can just touch     for   mph if i want to  instead of using the up or down arrows   there are some other features for different workouts that i haven t used yet  but i m sure i will get to them   i ve also discovered that it is very important to have the treadmill on a very flat surface   otherwise  the tread will shift to one side   even with the slightest incline in my floor  i noticed this a little bit   once i figured out the best placement though  it was fine   also  i noticed that the surface under the tread was virtually free of oil  probably from laying around in the amazon warehouse for some time   so i purchased some silicone based treadmill oil that you apply every    miles or so  and it works great   the display also comes with speakers installed  which guess you can plug your iphone or ipod into with an auxiliary cord   not sure i ll ever do that  as i just have headphones   also  the sensitivity of the pulse meter on the grab bar has been hit or miss   oh well  can t have everything so  was the process a bit of a pain   well  yes  but overall  not too bad  and well worth it for the price   i m totally satisfied with this treadmill and it does everything i need it to do      
78,5.0,                       we have had our nordic track treadmill for about   months now and love it   i bought it as a way to continue walking exercise during the dark rainy winter months and assumed i might try the ifit training but would never use it   i was very wrong   the ifit has been a huge part of my success with the machine   the treadmill itself is great  the delivery was fairly easy  we had to unbox it and take it to the basement in pieces  but it worked  and assembly was okay but there was a broken piece on ours which made the assembly much harder than it should have been   we did contact nordic track customer service and they were very helpful and got replacement parts to us quickly   we all use the treadmill and i love the ifit training   at first i would just watch the walking tours as i walked to keep myself entertained  london  edinburgh  portugal  morocco  etc  but then was enticed to start doing some interval running and walking   i am not a runner  never have been  but though using the ifit programs with trainer tommy rivers puzey i am now working on a   week program to increase my running ability and i love it   this treadmill has been the thing that finally made me like to exercise  we love it and highly recommend it      
79,3.0,                       we purchased this on sep   th and were supposed to have it delivered on oct  th  we also set up the in home setup service  which i scheduled for october  th  when   pm came around on oct  th and no sign of the treadmill  i called amazon  the rep was quite understanding  and after a few minutes on hold he got back on the line with me and said that our treadmill was lost in shipment  he proceeded to order us a replacement  which wouldn t arrive until oct   th  i rescheduled our in home setup appointment for oct   th  the following saturday i decided to call amazon back as i was having trouble understanding how it could be lost in shipment  the rep i spoke to was again  very courteous  she explained that she could put a tracer on the treadmill on monday morning to try and find out more details  on monday afternoon i received an email saying that they had found the treadmill and it was scheduled for delivery oct   th  i once again called in home setup and re scheduled my appointment to oct   th  on oct   th the in home setup guy called and said he couldn t make it on the   th and asked if i could reschedule my setup to the   th of oct  i said that wouldn t work for us and so he asked me to call him after it arrived  and he would see when he could fit me in   the treadmill arrived today  oct   th   and i decided to tackle putting it together by myself  well  me and my kitchen chair  see pictures   i tipped the delivery guy      and he helped me carry the  heavy  box to the room in my single story home  where it was going  at a casual pace  the entire process took me an hour and a half  i used my dewalt impact driver  a      and      hex drive bit  a phillips bit  and screwdriver   a small adjustable wrench  and a utility knife  putting it together wasn t terrible and the instructions are reasonably thorough  be careful not to over tighten some of the small phillips screws   there were a few things i wasn t thrilled about    the packaging took some shipping damage  resulting in product damage  which i detailed in the attached photos    there was a random nylon locking nut laying loose in the box  i looked all over and could not find anywhere that it appeared to belong      when i tipped it on edge to unwrap it from the shipping plastic  i heard small plastic pieces rattle as they slid to the other side of the motor compartment  one small plastic piece fell out  and on examination  i found that the right side of the motor hood was not as secure as it should be  there s about      to       of play where it really shouldn t be moving  i would guess that the brackets that hold the hood in place are plastic and i assume that is the piece that you can see in my photo  it doesn t seem to have an effect on functionality  but being a new unit  i would prefer no problems   the unit powered up and works fine so far  if you have any questions  i d be happy to try and answer them  i m satisfied with the treadmill overall  it seems decent  i ll be sure to update if that changes  it wouldn t hurt for amazon to comp me      for shipping damage  i will add that they did comp me     for the extreme shipping fiasco  i also apparently have a replacement treadmill still enroute    i guess i won t sign for it        
80,3.0,                       product page says  interactive personal training at home powered by ifit    year ifit membership included with your treadmill  gain access to on demand  interactive trainer led global and studio workout programs       value  this seems to be false  when i started the treadmill  it asked me to subscribe to ifit for     month  so i contacted amazon about my free membership  which routed me to nordictrack  i contacted them  and they said it s not their problem  but ifit s  finally i contact ifit  no response  i almost gave up when i stumbled upon this email address  amazon ifit zendesk com   sent a request there and monica was very nice to help me out activate my free membership this seems like a case of misleading advertising in any case  treadmill works fine  i m happy with the ifit integration and the screen quality  it s just   stars because it was a nightmare to set up the ifit   year trial      
81,4.0,                       i m happy with the money i spent on this for the most part  the     si is a solid treadmill that as a taller guy i feel very comfortable running on  the maximum speeds and inclines don t match the higher end models  but for me the    mph speed and     incline are more than enough for my uses  assembly took a couple hours  but was fairly straightforward  i initially had some trouble activating the   year ifit membership  which was frustrating given that was the reason i didn t go with the     s and decided to spend the extra money on the si  i was eventually able to get it activated after getting in contact with ifit though  the ifit programs are pretty fun and the     screen looks great  but the built in speakers are not great and it was tough to find a balance that allowed me to hear both the music and the trainer clearly  still  i do think the   year membership with the guided workouts add a lot of value over the     s and that s not even factoring in the     screen      
82,2.0,                       we have had this unit for less than two months the first issue we experienced was the incline motor getting stuck in the up position  after a long wait to chat with customer service  i was asked to take a video of the issue and submit it  the whole process took about    minutes  and it was determined the incline motor was defective we received the replacement motor about   days later  i installed it  and it worked for about   weeks  it got stuck again in the up position  i tested the original motor and found that i could retract it by hand  but when i installed it  it immediately went to the up position again i contacted customer service again  this time it only took about    minutes before a csr came online  i explained the issue  and told her i believe the computer was bad  again  i had to submit a video  i also provided the number of my previous service ticket  it was determined that  this time  even though the symptoms were the same  it was the controller that needed replacement we are presently waiting for the replacement to arrive  may update at that time      
83,2.0,                       i walked on this for the first time today and would have given it a   star rating  except for the following     i checked the measurements in the description as best i could  and it didn t seem that there was a lot of difference between the current one that i had and this one   the console did seem larger  but there were no measurements given for it  and it is in fact  much larger than it looks in the pictures   and so i cannot get the treadmill into my bedroom  standard    inch door  without taking it apart   i didn t have it assembled in that room  because i was afraid i wouldn t get it back out   i would think that nordictrack would consider that the majority of people want to hide treadmills in bedrooms and would design them to fit through those doorways   now i have the option of having this large machine in the middle of my family room or my living room     when you are looking at this on the website  they show a video of a young lady very easily moving the machine on its wheels   the fact is that it is nearly impossible to accomplish this  unless you have some serious muscle   you have to tip the machine so that it is resting only on the wheels  and in fact  the manual advises that it may take   people to do this   it also advises you that the unit must not be moved using any other method   so now  in addition to having a treadmill that i can t hide away in my bedroom  i can t even move it out of the way after i walk on it    a little bit of minor irritation   when i got ready to walk on it for the first time  come to find out that i could not even start the machine until i signed up for the free trial of ifit  which included giving them a credit card number so that they could automatically charge me in    days for the program   so now i am obligated to cancel it  which i most definitely will   i should have had the option of being able to start the machine without signing up for the free trial bottom line is that i like the machine  but i don t know if i am going to send it back or not   i don t want it in my living room or family room   if anyone has any suggestions on how to get it through the bedroom doorway without taking it apart  i d like to hear them      
84,5.0,                       delivery   i received my nordictrack t     s via local delivery truck the morning of dec             the delivery guys called me    minutes prior to arrival to give me a heads up on their arrival time   they brought the treadmill down my driveway ramp through my basement level garage and into my basement   they removed and disposed of the giant cardboard box and all the styrofoam   what a great delivery service   i paid an additional        to have the treadmill delivered to a room i specified   this was totally worth the price then came assembly   my techie roommate was able to assemble the treadmill in about    minutes   there was a point when i provided an extra set of hands to help with something   i can t remember what  but it was nothing major   i see that amazon is currently offering professional assembly for no added cost   this is a pretty amazing offer that i would have been thrilled to have  especially had i not had the techie roommate that i have   at the time i purchased the treadmill  the professional assembly cost was around      performance   i am so happy with the nordictrack t     s treadmill   i am able to walk and run to my heart s content   the belt runs smoothly and is not excessively loud   the controls are great   if i am running at     mph  i am short  so this is fast for me  and get tired  i can simply press the number   button on the right side of the panel  and the belt quickly slows to a speed where i can recover safely   if i want to slowly speed up or down in decimal increments  there is an up down button on the bottom of the panel   there is also an up down incline button to adjusts in    increments on the bottom left panel  or i can use the buttons on the left side of the panel to increase the grade in whole numbers   i had been looking at purchasing the nordictrack       which is more of a commercial treadmill with a much steeper price   i am so happy i did not purchase that more expensive treadmill   i do not think it would have been worth the price difference ifit  i am not using ifit  so i cannot comment on it   i learned how to make youtube playlists  so i am now watching the music videos  etc   that i want to watch   it s a heck of a lot better than being subjected to whatever it is they have playing at the gym      
85,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have been a fan of nordic track for a long time    but this new nordictrack while being much more expensive than the powertrack      i have been using for the longest time  is incredible poorly made if your looking for a treadmill that is sturdy  simple and quick to use  enjoyable to use  quiet  or doesn t have loads of huge and sharp seams all over it this isn t your machine pros it works with a    lb guy  and keeps up wellits a decent footprint  definitely a little narrow folds up well    or it would if the handles actually aligned with the frame  and didn t interfere with the folding feature    actually that s more of a con   cons very flimsypoorly made extremely low tolerance on every part you will need to buy a proper tap and die kit to assemble this as nordictrack failed to tap several holes that the threaded bolts are to be installed into  more annoyingly the ones that they did tap where not tapped all the way through  to tap a hole means to put threads into such that a bolt or nut can thread or be screwed into you will need a       coarse    tap with a long shaft it takes a couple of minutes from the time you turn it on and get on it before it boots up and actually let s you use it its got a touchscreen    one smaller than your phone     so unless you have       vision or glasses on  theirs no using the interface at all    it also loves to pop up ads  and constantly wants your information and wifi access  no just hopping on and enjoying a workout anymore the fan you see in the picture  it s not real  just a fake grill  which behind it isactually a    wide cage fan sometime found in very cheap car accessories or electrical boxs  it s hyper loud  but manages to push a usable amount of air and that s coming from a user that has the treadmill in a server room   overall i ll probably have to keep it since it s a oversized thing to have shipped of picked up by amazon  and i throughout my back getting it inside      
86,2.0,                       wow   beautiful treadmill it would be really nice if i could actually use it be aware when you buy one of these  you will be forced to register it on line before it will operate   apparently you have to purchase a  free     day trial ifit membership   of course it s only free after you give them your credit card information and purchase a subscription for more than      per month  after which you can cancel   if you don t forget   and maybe they will actually cancel it before the    days is up   or they may not   who knows in the meantime  it takes them an hour to process your registration  before they can even help you   then you get to wade through their labyrinthine phone mail system to get to the right help line whereupon you get placed on hold until their phone mail system hangs up on you for no reason   then you get to repeat the whole process several times  provided you have two to three hours to spend waiting on the hold for them to get to you   if not  come back again another day when you have more time and try it all again   this is called  customer service  pros   beautiful treadmill   looks lovely   has awesome reviews from people who apparently have been able to get it to work   meanwhile it makes a great coat rack and place to store stuff   how well does it work   personally  i haven t the foggiest   because until i can get someone to give me some kind of access code or something i can t get past the stupid welcome screen that tells me i have to register the product   which i ve done   several times   several different ways   and still have no idea how to get past that stupid welcome screen cons   have i mentioned the stupid welcome screen   why can t i just plug it in and start running one star each for for appearance  speed of delivery  ease of delivery and ease of set up minus two stars for difficulty registering the product  and for the sheer stupidity of forcing your customer to buy a product they don t want just to get the thing to work in the first place     oh  you want a steering wheel with that car        
87,5.0,                       going to be very blunt about this machine  i m a    year old female who was able to put this machine  norditrack     treadmill  all by myself and it s honestly the best purchase ever majority of these negative reviews are about how you have to sign up in order to get basically their package of running with instructors or watching the view  there s a tab on the top right where it says manual workout and you re able to get straight into your workout  i didn t need to sign up for anything or pay for their membership  also  the machine came in one piece  so disregard the other bad reviews if you don t mind just running on your own with your favorite tv show playing to pass the time        would buy again     
88,4.0,                       i purchased this product primarily for walking when the weather doesn t cooperate   five months of snow on the ground    the treadmill itself is excellent   i did have a couple of issues that were annoying   one is the requirement to register the product and sign up for a fitness program  ifit  using a credit card   i refused to do that and was prepared to return the treadmill until i saw another review where the author explained how to by pass the registration process by pressing the ifit button for    seconds    the review from  amazon customer  stated   to get around this scam  hold down the ifit logo on the treadmill for    seconds and your treadmill will work  i hope this helps people from being forced to give out their credit card and personal information     thank you amazon customer   the second annoyance was an  undocumented feature   at least i didn t see it in the manual    the third time i used the treadmill  i put the red key on the console and i heard a motor running but the tread wasn t moving and when i pressed any of the buttons they just beeped   nothing appeared to be happening so i removed the red key and tried several times more   thinking that there must be some simple reason for it not working  i messaged the nordic track help desk describing my problem   they next day i received a reply from a nice lady who told me that the treadmill was behaving normally   it was calibrating the incline   i should put the red key on the console and let it complete the calibration process   the tread inclined all the way to the top and then all the way to the bottom   after it was finished doing its thing the treadmill worked like it should    i m not sure why it waited until its third use to do this   perhaps it was because i raised the platform to the store position overnight and then set it back down the following morning   i haven t done it again  so i m not sure that was what caused it   i call the calibration process an  undocumented feature    but  i may have just missed reading it in the manual    would i purchase this product again   definately yes   it is a well build product and is easy to use  once i got past the two annoyances i mentioned above   if it weren t for them  i would have scored this product a solid five      
89,1.0,                       just had the treadmill delivered today  it is very heavy as expected  assembly wasn t difficult  but having two people makes it easier  once the unit was set up and turned on the screen was stuck at  activate with ifit   the machine does not need activation via ifit to work  just hold down the ifit sync button for    seconds to bypass  that is not listed anywhere in the book  once that was done  i activated the manual mode and increased the speed  the belt is making a horrible clicking noise  searches online confirm it is a bad motor  i tried to do an amazon return but they require the unit to be disassembled and we re no help  it took forever to get through to nordictrack customer service  make sure you register your device online before you call or you won t be able to get through  once i did that  i was on hold for thirty minutes before i realized they had already closed  even though the phone system let me on hold  i will try again monday to get a replacement motor but will never buy this brand again      
90,5.0,                       i purchased this treadmill to replace a proform elliptical that replaced my proform treadmill   because i suffer from arthofibrosis  af  and my knee is frozen in place  i had to pass my previous equipment to my daughter  i need to do rehab from my home  so i do not want to cheat myself on quality  i selected this norditrack and i am so impressed with it  it came with a    day free trial of ifit an interactive workout with instructors  better than peloton  but i have no chance of ever keeping up with them  so i do not utilize it  but i did enjoy the world tour   i see people have made comments about it  but they obviously did not read the instructions     no credit card info is required  and they send an email at the end of the    days if you want to purchase it monthly  i photographed the ledge where i store my ipad  because it is wide enough  i do not have to remove the keyboard  bonus  and the  cup holder  is way larger than others  feel free to place your     gallon water bottle      someone really thought this out   look at the large operation area  it looks like it belongs in a commercial gym  yet it fits perfectly in my small gym  which is the size of my smallest bedroom  i can not go outside to walk  so this is a life saver for me  i treated myself without emptying my bank account  the shock absorbers under the platform are easy on my sore legs and the rails are long enough that i do not have to purchase separate medical safety rails   they did not miss a thing on this model   the more expensive models are great too  with huge screens  but with the space for the ipad  i can still enjoy the large screen without the large price  my therapy room is complete and i am on my way to a healthier body      
91,5.0,                       took less time to assemble than it did to unpackage  easy lift and lowers with an automatic shock  i read previous comments and learned you can skip the ifit registration by simply holding down the ifit  blue  button for about    seconds  then you don t have to pay to subscribe and it works like a regular treadmill  i d suggest to watch for a good price bcz they seem to list the same product with different prices occasionally  the week before i ordered it was      when i ordered it was      so far i love it and it s not holding any clothing yet      
92,4.0,                       this is a heavy duty machine  you can not set this up by yourself  it definitely needs two people   the speakers are decent   since this is for home use they are loud enough  if you want something a little louder then you have to connect another speaker with the aux cable in order to amplify the sound   i have used this machine every day for over an hour   it runs quietly   my only complaint is that it makes a popping noise when you first increase your incline   i am going to ask norditrac about that sound   it folds at an angle so it still takes up space  the machine is heavy so use two hands to lift it when folding   when opening it  the machine will take over halfway and descend slowly so you don t have to bend or fear dropping it   i walk  jog  run and climb on this machine and i feel great afterwards     
93,5.0,                       i ve owned this machine for   months and could not be more pleased with it   it performs flawlessly and does everything you could ask of a treadmill   i especially love the smooth automatic incline that gives me the  hill  resistance i need to train   i m        and     lbs  and the sturdiness and deck length are perfect for me   i would guess the machine would be well suited for anyone up to     lbs and        but beyond that a larger heavier machine might be needed   folds up easily for storage between workouts  assembly requires two people  or if you ve assembled treadmills before  as i have  you can manage it alone   as to value    it s worth way more than the asking price   get it      
94,5.0,                       please listen closely to this review  i just recently purchased this treadmill  all the reviews you read about how difficult it is to put together is not accurate  if you are just the least bit handy you can set it up no problem  it took me about an hour and a half to get it setup and running once i got it out of the box   the only reviews that are accurate are the ones that mention the ifit subscription  they state you must login to activate the machine then you are asked to pay     a month  this is true however all you need to do once the treadmill is setup is turn it on and hold down the ifit button for    to    seconds and it will immediately activate  shame on nordic track for that however from scam perspective i bet they have a great legal team that could argue to that point  now to speak to the treadmill itself it works perfect  very sturdy can t even hear the belt or motor while using      
95,4.0,                       you can bypass ifit and activate the treadmill by holding down the ifit button for about    seconds it is such a scam to imply that a membership for ifit is required to activate the treadmill  i started to register for ifit  then stopped immediately when it asked for my credit card info  we were able to successfully activate by holding down the button      
96,5.0,                       the mrs  and i were wanting  just a treadmill    we didn t want  nor need the wifi enabled  networked  ifit instructors on the screen yelling at you to run faster      p     tv screen so you can watch your movies while running  running experience          we just wanted a solid treadmill that we can get on for    minutes a day and get a workout on   and this is the perfect machine for what we were looking for it s solid  so don t expect a   person lift         this thing is heavy  and you ll need a dolley to move it around to where you want it in the house   it s also not super easy to assemble   it took my teenage son and i about   hours to get it all unpacked  assembled  and remove all the packing boxes and material   there are several pieces that you really should assemble with   people       one person holding the part s and the other one screwing bolts together   now  that being said  the assembly was not complicated  and the instructions were easy to understand and follow   i would just strongly recommend that you move it around and assemble with   people and so far  this machine is working awesome  and is used just about every day   it s also very intuitive to get it going    turn on the power   step on the treadmill   push the big green  start  button   push the big     or     buttons until you get it to the speed you like   push the big     or     buttons to incline to the ramp to the slope you want    enjoy until you want to stop  and then you just hit the big red  stop  button that s it       too easy now  it does have programmable settings  and a heart rate monitor  etc  etc  etc        but we ve not even looked at those   the mrs  gets on and puts the speed to     at slope    and goes for       minutes   i get on and put the speed at     at slope     and go    minutes  and we re both happy would highly recommend this product oh  and fyi       if you want to turn it on without having to register with ifit online       just hold the little blue ifit button that s just below the led screen for    seconds       and you can bypass all the online registration for ifit   that s one we had to figure out the hard way   we had to register online for an ifit subscription for them to tell us that all we have to do it hold the button for    seconds to not have to register   of course  they tell you that after you register      
97,1.0,                       ok  so  i ve had this treadmill for   months now and i feel like i can give it a thorough and fair review   let me preface this review by saying this treadmill gets used     times per week  used by in shape and not overweight people and used typically below its speed and incline maximums   for comparison  my previous treadmill was one that purchased from sears and used in the same manner for almost    years with no issues at all   now for the reasons for my   star rating   after only   months of use  the treadmill stopped working  the belt would not start   i contacted nordictrack customer service and it was determined that the control module was bad   they sent a new control module for me to replace  but i was left with no treadmill for   weeks while waiting for the part   fast forward to just   days ago   while running at a moderate pace at an incline of     i heard a loud crack and realized the entire board that the belt runs around was cracked lengthwise right down the middle for the entire length of the board   i am about    lbs and this treadmill is rated for    lbs  so please know weight was not the issue   i reached out to nordictrack customer service today and now i m waiting for board to be shipped to me  which is currently out of stock   this will have me down for at least another   weeks   i purchased this treadmill based on the rating and  what i thought to be  a reputable brand   i couldn t have been any more mistaken   if you re going to drop some money on a treadmill  don t choose this one   if you need to  spend some extra   and get a treadmill with actual reliability   if your treadmill is going to become a clothes rack  then go ahead and get this tread  as it will function quite well and reliably for that function i need to add a short bit about assembly of this treadmill   i am very mechanically inclined  i do most of my own home repairs and i assemble everything i purchase   this treadmill was poorly constructed and some of the parts did not fit and align properly  which made the assembly difficult and frustrating   some parts of the assembly instructions were vague as well one last thing  once fully assembled  you will not move this through interior doorways without removing the door from its hinges   even after removing the door  it s a tight squeeze that i wouldn t recommend   most likely it will require some minor disassembly in order to move through a doorway with ease i hope this review helps you in making your purchase decision      
98,1.0,                       i just want to start by saying i had researched treadmills for quite a few months before purchasing this  the price was great  not too fancy but not too basic  that s pretty much where it ends upon arrival  the metal frame in the front of the treadmill at the base showed up damaged   i tried calling  i tried chatting  i tried emailing  getting the run around over and over and over again  they wont even acknowledge the fact that it s damaged  i am beyond frustrated with their customer service the free year of ifit set up was not in my package  that i can see  i tried contacting them about that an assured me it is and to look again   i dont see it here the treadmill has been powered on in the past months to set up my account  i went to further look at the ifit stuff on the actual treadmill to see what s free and what isn t  it wasnt loading anything so i turned the whole thing off  now it wont turn on at all   i do not have it in a gfi outlet and yes the outlet works  nothing has been tripped  so not only do i have a damaged treadmill that they refuse to talk to me about  and a free year of ifit that doesnt seem to exist  the thing now just doesnt work so i guess  buy at your own risk      
99,4.0,                       this treadmill performs well  for my purposes  it is perfect  the uphill function isn t that great  but it will give a slight incline  the machine is rather loud  so i have to use headphones when i want to watch or listen to anything  moving it around is a little challenging but i like that it is foldable so it doesn t take up too much room  i took a star off because the machine was cracked during delivery and they try to trick you into buying a membership to use the machine  there is a very small selection that allows you to bypass the membership to start the machine      
100,1.0,                       this looks like it could be a nice treadmill  especially if you enjoy the ifit app and video workouts   unfortunately  my machine arrived defective out of the box   despite being properly grounded  it shocked me any time touched   not a humidity issue  not a sneaker issue  just a faulty machine   unfortunately  it looks like faulty machines are common with nordictrack  perhaps that is why they have discontinued this model   think about that before buying it    even worse  customer service is non existent   extended warranty   doesn t matter service is slow and difficult to work with   in my case  they decided to send a new cable  despite explaining to them that i had checked the grounding   so  i had to wait two weeks for a cable to arrive  knowing it wouldn t work   not surprisingly  the issue wasn t resolved  so i called them to have a technician come   apparently  they forgot to arrange a technician   i called two weeks later for an update and was promised a call within    hours     days later  still nothing   i finally received a technician s call   weeks later   when they arrived  it was clear they wouldn t be helpful    they said they were only there to reattach the cable  and not actually diagnose the problem    they ripped the mat under my treadmill   and they not only left three screws out of their holes  but also left a loose screw in the motor box   i realized it because every time i lifted the treadmill up and down  i could hear it fall   so i opened up the motor box and there it was    lucky it didn t blow out the motor despite explaining all of this to customer service weeks ago  i haven t even received the courtesy of a response or a simple apology  never mind getting someone here to fix the original issue    i ll be returning the treadmill and look forward to the new sole f   i just ordered      
101,5.0,                       so for a    hp treadmill with this belt size  the price was right delivery  i opted to pay     extra for  in room of choice  delivery   without a helper this thing would have been impossible for me to bring in the house   it is quite large box   ft long      ft wide   and quite heavy     lbs    so     well spent   two people came and delivered it   they scheduled with me    hours in advance  it was a   hour window of delivery   i just needed to be home and point where i wanted them to leave the box assembly  i see a lot of complaints about assembly   i would say it is about as difficult as similar fitness equipment   you will need a few hand tools  screw driver  phillips     mm wrench  an sae size also seemed to fit  but   mm fit better   it comes with an allen hex key   an electronic screwdriver or drill with hex key bit and phillips bit will make things easier   but be very careful not to overtighten small screws that go through plastic fittings   assembly likely took me about   hours   a helper will make things much easier   though i did it by myself i wouldn t recommend it   there were a couple of times the book said get a helper and i didn t and it occurred to me that if i slipped or lost grip it was going to hurt really badly if something came crashing down that i was holding in place while i used my other hand to turn a screw or bolt   basically i ll say this   if you don t think you could assemble a kid s bicycle  then pay for someone else to assemble it   if you don t have screwdrivers or wrenches  pay for someone else to assemble it   if you don t have a helper  pay for someone else to assemble it   i m really lucky i didn t slip and hit my head or crush my hand when i was too impatient to wait for a helper to come home from work   functionality   as has been reported in other reviews  you turn it on and it says it won t do anything until you activate it only   activation basically signs you up for an account   i didn t bother   i m never going to use the ifit function and i don t want to give my info to one more company that doesn t need it if you turn power on  then hold down ifit button for    seconds   it will skip the activation process   i read this from another reviewer  and it worked other than that   features are as described   it s a treadmill   it s not any more quiet or loud than any other residential treadmill i ve seen   i m sure that in a year i ll need to adjust the belt  and lubricate it   that s pretty typical      
102,5.0,                       this treadmill is absolutely amazing   fits perfectly and nicely in my bedroom  i was able to assemble it in about two hours  two people would def help but honestly nothing a secure chair and a little manipulation can t help  you will need help to get the base where you want it  but once in place you can put it together solo   sound  very quiet for a treadmill  i am able to workout at night and share a wall with other tenants and no complaints or issues  some people say it squeaks  it should not  mine does not at all run  this thing works like a charm  i ve only had this a week and logged over    miles and been able to use this machine twice a day some days without any problem con  the factory defect that those speak of on here is true  the controls are missing buttons  but honestly for the price i m not completely worried about it ifit  you don t have to register for it before starting machine  just turn on and hold ifit for   secs to bypass and you re all good  also you can still sign up and use your   year ifit after you have done this      
103,1.0,                       the assembly was a little more than expected on this machine  but doable  i downloaded the ifit app and did some of the workouts which i enjoyed  but not enough to pay monthly  i decided to just jump on and do a manual workout without the app and quickly realized there is no way to pause the machine if you are interumpted during your workout  kids  bathroom break  etc  i contacted the company and they said unless you pay for the monthly membership there is not a pause option   so i have to pay to pause my workout which is a basic feature on treadmills    and this one is supposed to be smart   well i don t agree   i would not recommend this product unless you plan to pay for the membership  and even still you have to connect to the app to have the pause option   still rediculous     
104,1.0,                       this review is more of a warning for buyers in early       apparently there was a manufacturing issue with this model and an entire row of buttons is missing  i had this with   of them  so i would assume all that were produced around the same time have this problem amazon was great and sent the replacement and then ultimately picked them both up first photo is what i received   nd is what it should have  there was no way to set a workout without these buttons if you rubbed your fingers across the area you can feel where the buttons should be  but they did not function      
105,4.0,                       without my gym and pilates studio during this pandemic i have gained quite a few pounds  this treadmill was the best purchase i could have made to help shed those extra pounds  as you can see from the picture  i mounted a little television and fan on the wall in front of the treadmill  i love to come home from work and immediately put on my workout clothes and spend an hour on my treadmill running or doing hills  i just zone out to something on netflix  and if it s a really good show  i ll stay on for    minutes or more  i love that you can adjust the shock absorption  great for my joints when i m running  the only downside is you can t program your information into the treadmill itself  you have to subscribe to ifit at     a month  i am taking advantage of the one free month  but the only feature i use is putting in my own workout  i don t care to use the workouts they offer  they really aren t that great      
106,1.0,                       i recently purchased this treadmill  in hopes of getting back in shape   let me begin with it was not an easy treadmill to put together  it took my husband and i over an hour and a half to get it up and running   for the first   days that i used it  i loved it  i was even able to use it without the ifit option  by holding down the ifit button for    seconds and it opened so i could use it manually   so  on my  th day of using the treadmill  i go to turn on the switch and the motor is running but the treadmill will not start  i  unplugged it several times  turned the reset switch off and on and still nothing   i have a call into nordictrack for support   will see how it goes   i will update once i get an answer wednesday january           i had the treadmill pickup and returned to amazon today   after talking to several people with nordictrack and amazon  i was advised to return the item   nordictrack is a good brand  but i guess you could still find lemons there too   good luck to you all  i hope you are able to find what your looking for      
107,5.0,                       it s been nine years since i went for a run  that length of time shocked me  i used to run a couple times a week  i kept giving myself the excuse of not running because it was always too hot or too cold outside  i never went to the gym because it cost too much and the added       min  roundtrip each day adds up i gave in and in a moment of mania bought the best treadmill i could afford  paying         for me and my spouse to use a gym to run  means that this treadmill will pay itself off in     years  we ve been using it for two months now  it gets daily use i ve managed to eliminate the excuse of too hot or too cold by having a home treadmill  i ve eliminated the excuse of not going to the gym because it s too far and is too much added time  i ve had my cardiovascular health improve by leaps and bounds over the last to months by just jogging for    mins  or by running intervals for       mins it s a habit that needs to be developed  it s a commitment that needs perseverance  but it s a commitment and habit that is worth it beyond measure  especially for someone like me that works mostly behind a desk at a mostly sedentary job the  treadmill has two cushions on either side  the cushions reduce the impact and wear and tear on your joints  the controls are easy to use  you can pay an additional     month to use ifit  and must create an account in order to first set up your treadmill  which is stupid   the app is cool and pairs nicely with a treadmill especially using the ipad  in the end  not needing or wanting the app  it s just annoying that you have to set up an account to use the treadmill i m       and have a decently long stride  my wife is      and fits perfectly on the tread  i  however  could have used the additional     but paying another      for a     tread length was out of my budget  i don t use the aux in jack or the built in speakers  they sound much worse than a decent pair of headphones and it s a bummer that the bt connection doesn t work with music the heart rate monitor is incredibly inaccurate  but a fitbit or apple watch is just what you need  there s a big discrepancy between the mileage of the treadmill and my apple watch  which is more accurate  overall it serves a purpose  namely allowing me to run in my home  i use it for that  i use the incline  i use the speed controls  i don t use all the other features  the cushions are wonderful it would be great to have both more cushioning and a longer tread length  but in the end  all the added cost and unused features weren t worth it for me  this was a worthwhile investment for me and i m glad to have made the lifestyle change  i can t wait to see where i am in a year      
108,1.0,                       had i known about the ifit nonsense i certainly wold not have purcahsed this how dare you require me to go online and enter a credit card to activate a treadmill that i already paid for   what an awful company   never again     
109,2.0,                       two stars due to setup instructions that pressure you to provide credit card information to use the treadmill to expand on this  once you set up the treadmill  there is a sticker that reads  your smart treadmill is currently locked  it will not start until you go ifit com activate   when you visit that site  it will ask you to enable cookies  when you decline  it breaks cookies into four categories  one of which is  essential   once you make it through to the site  it looks like a marketing landing page  to create an account  they try and get you to enter your full name and credit card information  the model we purchased does not even have an hd screen  so we do not want an ifit account and certainly do not want to share our personal information to bypass this  do two things  first  make sure that the red emergency key is engaged on the treadmill  second  hold down the ifit button for       seconds  this will allow the treadmill to function in short  the printed instructions regarding ifit are simply false  this is terrible customer service and a potential legal liability for nordictrack  i hope that they will value customer experience over subscription revenues in the future      
110,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the belt literally stops while it s going   even at higher speeds    i can stop it as i am walking    and as i step it will slip under my feet   i m not sure this is normal       
111,4.0,                       so far so good  machine has been in house for a week of steady use between my wife and myself i did not pay for the  free  installation service  and although it would have saved time  i was able to put it together myself pro tip  one of the last steps is to put the adjustment bar underneath the frame so that you can lock the machine up in place when not in use  do this before you put on the legs when you can flip the base on its side  this was a pain in the rear attempting to one arm hold the machine up and then unscrew and place that pole in place i hope this helps   mr j     
112,5.0,                       at the beginning of the covid    crisis  i decided to purchase the nordictrack   we comparison shopped and selected nordictrack based on price  features and company reputation   we anticipated our local athletic facility would close and did not want our cardio health to suffer given the ongoing pandemic crisis  i am so glad this was purchased observationsit is width is greater than a standard doorway   you ll need to assemble where you want to use it  or have an extra wide doorway  i moved mine and had to remove the monitor place   inch padding underneath unless you place it on concrete reasonably easy to move       wheels on baseit is heavy and requires   person to relocate     lbs      if moving in narrow spaces       people power cord is not long enough  a nice extension cord works or circuit protected outlet strip would work nicely installation is fairly easy  just follow the directions   no freelancing packaged nicely and parts are marked this model has a small screen with character graphics     really nordic this is          in  real  screen drives price to   k and for me that defeats the purpose of a backup while we wait for covid    to pass be careful the tread bed seems shorter than a commercial model    so beware and adjust accordingly it s made in china   however fit  form and function is good   again nicely packaged  we ll see how long this lasts so far we are very happy with it prosprice   overall performancefeel of the beltgeneral features are great  note  this is not a commercial product it feels substantial not inexpensivein closing  this product fits our needs   nicely and at a reasonable price recommend it for home use      
113,3.0,                       for the cost  i expected far more  advanced technology   seems like this might ve been made in the early   s    just an aux connection not a pile of dodo by any means though  it s actually easy to assemble and somewhat durable  but   the cost is far too high because you will never get your roi here  joining a gym would be a better idea important to note   this treadmill comes with a few documents asking you to  activate the treadmill  by going to some ifit website  in my opinion thats borderline  false advertising  because it could not be further from the truth  simply hold the ifit blue button for    seconds and you bypass it  no problem      
114,1.0,                       i wish i could comment more on the treadmill itself  but instead i am still dealing with the nightmare that has been getting it  this is the first time i ve gone so far as to write a negative review  i am not usually a  karen  about things  but it has been that awful  amazon gives no other recourse for such feedback that i was able to find  so here we are chapter one   monday  the original treadmill showed up from priority express looking like it came through a wood chipper  so i wasn t surprised to find it broken once unpackaged  the return process sounded easy enough  a new one could get here quickly  but it would take two weeks for the broken to get retrieved  i do not have room for two  so i waited the two weeks to have a pick up drop off scheduled on the same day  they were kind enough to offer an unsolicited     credit for the inconvenience  which i thought was nice  since nothing too bad had happened yet chapter two   monday  the new one arrives as promised via priority express  but they  have no paperwork  for picking up the old  i m informed it must be a different third party doing that piece later in the day  by  pm i am calling amazon and asking for an update  and i m told they re not sure what happened with the return piece  but the soonest they could have it retrieved would be four days following  fine  i ask for a confirmation email this time  since this was my second attempt  i received an email from pilot with a scheduled pick up time date and confirmation number  great chapter three   thursday  no one from pilot shows up  though my tracking   says someone is out to pick it up as of noon  i call their number and i m told no one was in my area today  and the soonest they can come is the following monday  i inform them this is the second time i ve had to arrange my schedule around this pick up that keeps not happening  so is there a way to confirm this will happen  internally  i m lamenting this stupid treadmill is still taking up a ridiculous amount of space in my small house  amazon doesn t even show that i m still owing them this return  it s clearly been lost in the ether at this point  but i still don t feel right not getting it back to them somehow  i m told by the gentleman that if i leave it outside with a note  then i don t need to be home  awesome chapter four   present day  it s now  pm and i m about to cry  so  i call pilot again  after    minutes on hold  i m told it is scheduled for pick up today and they will call me  i confirm it s still ok i m not home for the pick up  as the treadmill is now sitting in front of the house with a note  i m told no  someone needs to sign for it  i explain the last person told me that was not the case and could they please be informed of their misunderstanding so other customers are not being confused  to this  i m told there is no record of me speaking to anyone before  so they don t know where i got that information  but i need to sign for it  i m now speechless and beginning to question my sanity epilogue  amazon  i really am trying to get this monstrosity of exercise equipment back to you  but at this point  if the thing isn t off my front lawn by the time i finish work tonight i will likely go office space on it acknowledgements  if you made it this far  thank you for reading my tale of amazon woe  to my husband  thank you for your unwavering support during this trying experience  and finally  to my brother in law  thank you for helping us get the stupid beast of a thing outside  we literally couldn t have done it without you      
115,1.0,                       i purchased this treadmill because i wanted to exercise indoors   the hardware itself seems sturdy and it only took me about    mins to put everything together   that s when i discovered that you cannot actually use the machine unless you  activate  it with ifit com   this involves you setting up an account  downloading their app  and giving your personal information and credit card info   then the app pairs with the treadmill and you can use it   i find this to be deceptive   had this  requirement  been clearly stated on the marketing info  i d have purchased another product   after the treadmill was activated  i promptly cancelled my  subscription  that i didn t want in the first place   it s too bad because the actual hardware seems pretty nice and i ve enjoyed using it so far edit   i noticed after the purchase that it s possible  though not documented in the materials shipped with the unit  that it is possible to activate the treadmill without forking over your credit card info and personal data   pity i only saw that after the fact   it s the review with the most helpful  likes    read that before purchasing      
116,5.0,                       warning  treadmill box delivered is    lbs   couldn t lift it myself  had to slide the box into the house  but box wouldn t fit through the door   took treadmill out and slid it on a rug into the room   assembly instructions were really straightforward   took me a couple hours   also  the threads on the   silver ground screw were defective  so it wouldn t screw in   this screw is important because it grounds the machine to prevent electric shock   replacement screw is     cents plus shipping   amazon support credited me for the replacement screw   will update this review again once i receive the replacement screw  edit  never received the replacement screw  bought one from local hardware store      
117,1.0,                       first  the speed calibration is way off  i set it for     mph        miles  and timed the belt  it was running     mph         if you re a runner at all  you know that s a huge difference also  the ifit app is terrible   the app takes over your phone s screen for your entire workout  i use my phone to play music when i work out  want to skip a song  nope  can t do that  the ifit app has taken over the screen  read the text i just got to see if it s an important work text  nope  can t do that  so not only does it require your phone in order to work out  but it turns your phone into a useless brick for the duration of the workout   when i start the treadmill it gives me a   minute warmup before the  workout  starts  but i warm up before i get on the treadmill  always have  nope  can t do that  you re gonna do our warmup  which would be fine  i d ignore the warmup and just set the speed to my workout pace  except that it resets the time and distance indications at the end of the   minute  warmup    this would be terrible enough if the whole app wasn t a blatant attempt to get me to pay     month for the privilege of using the treadmill i just paid      for  i did read the fine print that the credit card number was optional  so i didn t enter it  does that mean my treadmill will stop working when the    day  free trial  is over  since amazon s return policy is also    days  i don t intend to keep it long enough to find out based on comments in the reviews  i tried holding the  ifit sync  button down for    seconds to bypass the app  yeah  that worked  as long as you don t let the treadmill sit for a few minutes    it then resets back to needing the app  and pushing the button doesn t work any more  you need to switch the treadmill off and back on again and then hold the button down for    seconds i regret buying this treadmill  it might just be usable  i could adjust my speed setting based on measuring the belt speed  and i could hit the sync button for    seconds every time i want to use it    but that would require me to trust that the thing will continue to work once the    day free trial   amazon return window has expired  let me get this straight  you want me to bet      that that this thing won t hold me for     month ransom when the whole experience has already been skeezy as heck  yeah  sure  i totally trust you guys plus  frankly  i m pissed off  i paid twice as much for this treadmill as the      entry level model i had previously  and what i got was badly calibrated equipment  a terrible app  and a blatant grab for more of my cash  at least the entry level model was honest about what it was      
118,5.0,                       once upon a time  i was an all american track athlete  but alas  age  life and children have caught up with me  enter my new mechanized running apparatus  i bought it for the sole purpose of losing weight  it s working the rundown it s a treadmill  and does what a treadmill is designed to do  relentlessly circulate a belt at variable speeds helping the user lose weight and get in shape look  it s not hard to put together if you or someone you know has any inkling of mechanical knowledge  and if you can read and follow basic directions for assembly  then you re golden  if not  pay someone who is to do it for you  i d wager it ll take most people     hours to assemble  make sure you have help  it s a two person job the ifit is a joke for the price  bypass this feature by installing the red  magnetic kill switch thingy   then simply hold down the blue ifit logo for       seconds  boom  done  you can now use your treadmill without paying a king s ransom for a gimmick that is in all honesty  not worth the price this is perfect for what i need it for     minutes a day    days a week  and a great coat rack in between      
119,5.0,                       overall  i am really happy with this purchase  i waited to write the review until i had enough time using it  first  the bad   it was not easy to put together  it took me and my daughter about   hours and countless expletives to assemble  i almost have up at least twice  and i still can t bring myself to finish installing the fold up bar thing   we just leave it open because we don t need the space  but tbh it doesn t look like it would help much to fold it anyway   i m not an expert at anything mechanical  but i have never encountered a piece of furniture or household repair that has been as frustrating and difficult as this  if i had to do over  i would ve paid extra for assembly now the good  this is a very high quality treadmill  it s not something you would see at the gym  but i am really impressed by how well made and sturdy it is  it also has a lot of shock absorbtion  which was one of the things i really looked for  i have trouble with knees hips from years of  over training  the combo of this treadmill and my hoka bondis or saucony endorphin shifts is perfect  no pain another plus   i was wary of the ifit thing after reading some reviews that said it was a rip off and basically ruins the utility of the treadmill if you don t pay  however  the account is free and you don t have to give them any credit card info to automatically charge when the trial runs out  i might actually pay for it  which as a serious cheapskate  i never thought i d do  i have really enjoyed the workouts  you watch a video with a trainer running in awesome  exotic locations and the treadmill automatically adjusts incline and speed to match what you see  as someone who needs to be pushed  i lack the ability to voluntarily move out of  light exertion    my workouts are waaaay more challenging and productive when i m following an ifit trainer  i haven t actually tried using the treadmill without it  but my daughter runs intervals on  manual  all the time with no issue  she says it s like a regular treadmill that way bottom line  if you have already spent a ridiculous amount of time researching every possible option  it took me   months to decide   you know that this one pops up on most of the  best  lists  rightfully so  if you can get it for under   k  go for it      
120,5.0,                       this is my best purchase since covid   totally worth the moneyhowever to be honest the shipping was quite a hassle   i have heard similar issues with everyone that has ordered this item the final mile delivery in may city is done through one provider   and all of my friends have faced the same issue with their treadmill delivery   they don t communicate and are not on time  i had taken a day off to accept the delivery and assemble it   however the treadmill did not arrive  i had to go through many amazon customer service calls to finally get a status of my shipment   and it didn t arrive till a week later  once it arrived it was a task to fit it inside my home   the box is    lbs and the delivery is doorstep only  no in home delivery once unpacked i noticed the treadmill shipment was damaged   delaying my installation process   the damaged parts were replaced free of cost but they took   weeks to arrive   so overall i was only able to use my treadmill   weeks after i got it   it was just lying around occupying space for that long    the treadmill does require two to assemble  and while the assembly can take time its not impossible for novice handymen you do need to follow the steps precisely and i had to watch the youtube video numerous times to capture the detailsbut once assembled the product is great  the screen is great and the user experience is seamless too i skipped signing up for the ifit membership but i will do so at some point to utilize my free year  the one thing i do want   is video streaming on the screen  you d think that a    inch screen would allow streaming netflix  but it does not   i hope this is something they introduce with a firmware update in future  in the meantime i use the google maps feature a lot i would recommend the product  but please be aware of the hassle that comes with  shipping and installation   i wish a company like amazon would have the best supply chain   shipment network  but clearly this is not the case with their nordictrack shipments     
121,1.0,                       treadmill arrived damaged  it s bad enough that you have to set it up yourself following their very poorly written instructions but then it arrives broken will update when i ve finished putting it together  but if you are planning to buy one  just know they will not install it for you due to covid and the machine itself weighs about    lbs so be very sure when you tell the delivery guys where to put it update  the spot that was cracked when the product arrived completely broke in half after first use  and by first use  i mean walking slowly for two minutes or less  after this first use  it also became obvious that the belt is over an inch off center  so we will have to fix that ourselves as well  no doubt  will update again regarding my experience with customer service      
122,4.0,                       i just finished my first running workout on it  so far so good  i ran   miles on it  at up to     mph  as far as assembly  the instructions are good  and the parts are well marked  it isn t too hard to assemble  but small manufacturing faults make it harder than it should be  i had one hole that wasn t completely threaded  by repeatedly tightening and loosening an extra screw i was able to make it work  several threaded holes were painted over  making hand tightening a bit difficult  annoying  but not a deal breaker  the     number wants you to register the product to talk to someone  i didn t bother and figured it out myself  in spite of their crafty wording  as others have said you do not have to register with ifit if all you want to do is manual workouts  simply press and hold the ifit button when you power up i have had   months  i use it for running when it s too cold or raining outside  so far     no problems      
123,4.0,                       given that it is a very sturdy product  it s no surprise that the shipping box isvery heavy   if you aren t comfortable moving     pounds of box from your front door  you might want to arrange for a delivery option that includes putting the box where you want it inside your house   also  unless you really enjoy diy with lots of parts  you might want to also chose an option that includes setup   in our area  which is off the beaten path  nordic track contracts with icon for setup   i cannot say enough nice things about the tech which set ours up   watching him made me very thankful that we opted for professional help   after   weeks we really are enjoying the treadmill   it is very sturdy and has a lot of features that make working out safe  easy and enjoyable      
124,4.0,                       this review is for the t    s  i did not buy it off amazon  i am trying to write this review solely on the treadmill and not the ifit  since i ve had the free trial of ifit since day one  not sure if some things will be different for those who skip i ve had this treadmill for   months now and have used it daily  sometimes even more than once a day  i have the free ifit and love it  that being said  i m not sure how much i would love it without ifit  i m not sure if it impacts some of the features   like  it  takes a good minute or so to start up  i could see how this could be annoying  i go fill up my water and put on my running shoes etc  by the time i am done it s usually loaded up all the workouts  even manual  start up with a   min warmup  this is annoying to me on my manual workouts  not a deal breaker  just a minor annoyance  you can skip  but you have to wait for it to load also  one day my internet was being dumb  i could not get my treadmill to start  even for a manual workout  this really upset me  if some chance the connection is shaky during the workout  it will still go but not save  if you are doing ifit it will just leave you where you left off and not change or save  so this is something that makes the treadmill not recommended if not using ifit i like the big screen  it has   spots on the side for cups or phones or whatever  i can also put my phone in the middle  the bluetooth connects to my phones and the speakers are pretty good that i can still hear my music while running fast  it also has a tray underneath  i put my  lb dumbbells there for a little extra for some walks i do like my treadmill  and i really like the ifit  but i don t think you should waste your money on this one if you don t plan on doing the ifit  it might start up right away without internet  but i really don t know      
125,5.0,                       so far so good   i have had this treadmill      si      inch screen  for almost   months and it is still going strong   putting it together was not difficult but it just took a while   the functionality is good for a light runner walker   the ifit software is great and i have just completed a   week beginners running program   it really helps to give variety to working out on the treadmill   i had an issue where the ifit programming stopped and there is a way to submit an issue straight from the treadmill and it was resolved quickly   you need to have wifi to connect to and you can still use it without logging into ifit  but it comes with a free one year subscription and i was able to activate it without providing any credit card info   without ifit  you still have some stat measured workouts like speed  distance  incline based workouts but it just shows a lap graphic screen or there are some map based screens   not as exciting without the trainers motivating you but it is still good as far as treadmills go this one is a good one comparable to ones i used to use in gyms   sure there are nicer ones but they are a bit more expensive      
126,5.0,                       the delivery was scheduled during checkout and came within   business days  took me   hours with a   year old and   year old helping with a few stop leave it alone breaks  when i finished it took seconds to get this turned on and running  the treadmill is quiet smooth walking  faster than i need and overall a cool treadmill  have not tried the ifit yet      
127,3.0,                       runs great when it runs   about every two uses  it blows the power out in the room   we called nordic track and were told since our circuit breaker was large enough to accommodate the equipment  we need an  arc filter    after my husband gave the a piece of his mind for not listing that anywhere or including it with the treadmill  they sent us one   the treadmill ran for two days with no power issues but has now blown the power again   very frustrating to spend this amount of money on something that has caused so much trouble      
128,3.0,                       ok it is fine  skip the sub junk and hold the button down for apx     seconds whoever the cross eyed s o b that was in charge of pre drilling holes the day mine was made needs to be fired  i fought this thing like it owed me money      
129,2.0,                       followed instructions to the letter  then  in step     instructions tells me to install covers over frame base  this step requires me to dissemble about     of  what i just put together  this should have been step    not step     i am very irritated  i just left the covers off as they are purely cosmetic  also the left tray would not attach because screw points were missing broken off  so i glued it  activation with ifit looked like it was going to be a bitch  but it turns out there is a bypass      
130,1.0,                       got it august         set up professionally           broke             customer service reps advised me to buy tools i didn t need and instructed me via video chat to attempt to remove parts not needed to  waited   weeks and  replaced motor  waited another   weeks and received a motherboard as it was still not working  will only function if no one is standing or running on it at this point  paid for   year protection plan  upset that i have replaced the motor and motherboard within     months  highly upset  as the reliability and customer service via repairs has been a      so far  on hold for another    minutes currently  hence why i am writing this review while i am waiting for them to answer i d recommend to avoid these models and buy something cheaper     
131,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this treadmill back in june of this year and was waiting a little bit to give my review   even though it came with a tiny chip on the plastic cover on the right hand side  probably damage during transit   it s not such a big deal because it doesn t affect its functioning when i bought this treadmill  i wanted something that would be reliable  great quality  foldable  quiet and not so big that it wouldn t fit on the corner of my room  i have to say this treadmill checked all the boxes and even more   i am glad i took my time to do my research and decided on this treadmill as other reviews had mentioned  the box is really heavy  so make sure you have someone to help you with it   thankfully i was lucky that my husband assembled it which didn t take that long to do it i made sure i bought a mat to protect my white floors i ve been using this treadmill for a good   months now and i certainly love it  it is easy to fold and also easy to unfold  it is quieter than i had expected which is a win for me  i have attached a video for you to see the machine feels sturdy  it has   cup holders that are large enough to fit a bottle of water and even more  incline and speed controls are on both sides of the front panel to select in intervals from      or if you wish to select a specific speed for example      you can adjust it in the controls that are at the bottom of the panel  incline can also be adjusted the same way  i opted out of the ifit feature by following the instructions of other reviewers  hold down the ifit logo for    seconds and you ll be good  for me it took me probably less than    seconds but i held it down for more time to avoid any issues  i haven t been able to use the auxiliary music port yet because i mainly use my iphone and wireless ear buds for my workout in summary  i am absolutely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend others to buy it      
132,1.0,                       i received the product quickly  no issues what so ever  it was packaged very well  and overall it seems pretty sturdy and well built  the delivery guys were super nice and helped me carry it inside  it s exactly what i wanted  except for you cannot use the treadmill until you create an account w i fit  it s completely locked out and dysfunctional until you register w ifit  during the account creation  they require your credit card info  just in case you forget to cancel  so they can auto bill you each month and suck more money out of you   upon creating the account you are then forced to download and install their stupid mobile app  and then use bluetooth to unlock the treadmill  verifying they got their hands on your mobile device s  as well  i tried to avoid this by calling support  but i was stuck on the customer supp lines in an infinite loop of  you must create an ifit account before you can contact support  press     once the trial runs out  your treadmill is basically crap  and you re back to a limited set of features  so buying the treadmill isn t enough  you also need to sub to ifit  give them your email  credit card info  phone number   install their mobile app if i knew all this before i hit buy  i never would have bought it  and  i recommend you don t  in my opinion this type of crap is not only misleading to consumers  but it s just down right dishonest and bs  you should not be forced to dig through their fine print in order to ensure the product you re purchasing is what they depict it as online  i just wanted a treadmill  as a consumer  i paid for that treadmill  but  i got     a treadmill after my trial runs out  additionally  i now have to hope they don t get hacked and lose my info as i rely on their  infrastructure security   which  conveniently  they do not openly disclose to me  it s not right      
133,3.0,                       the treadmill arrived and the two delivery people placed the box in my living room  great service  it took about three hours to remove  the treadmill from the box and assemble  then in a very large red stop sign image the treadmill is locked and you must join ifit to unlock  well i don t want to join ifit i just want a treadmill  after further research  other posters on amazon stated the workaround is to hold down the ifit button for about    seconds  so now the treadmill works without joining ifit  now it is time to register and again their marketing arm gets into the act trying to sell upgraded warranty  awful     by the way the treadmill works as advertised although rather large for my house  word of warning be sure to assemble the treadmill in the room that it will reside as it is    inches wide at the console and won t fit through my doors without disassembly      
134,5.0,                       i ve had this treadmill for a week and it s safe to say it has exceeded my expectations  nordictrack doesn t make junk  i was a little worried that at this price point it might be suited to walking only  no way  i ve been running at a          mph pace and it s incredibly sturdy  the folding feature is super easy  when you let the track down from the upright position it releases very slowly so as not to crush toes kids pets  the ifit feature is a slight annoyance  but just make sure the red safety key is in place and hold the ifit button for    seconds to disable  worked like a charm for me  this is  by far  one of the best purchases i ve made in years  the downside is that the machine is really heavy     lbs  and  while i paid someone to do it for me  assembly sounded like a beast  i d recommend paying for the assembly  also  this nordictrack isn t loud in comparison to the average treadmill at the gym  but it s still loud enough that i can t walk on it in an otherwise quiet house without waking up the baby sleeping in the next room  so  use that information as you will  bottom line  i have no regrets about this purchase  i love this treadmill      
135,5.0,                       we love it and we definitely love the ifit option    you get the first year of ifit for free however you do have to sign up with ifit so they have your credit card info so that when the year is up it automatically renews   i did the family plan which isn t cheap approximately         for my family members and i     people    please look for the card in the box with the promotional code      without the code you cannot do the free year   so far we love it and would recommend this treadmill with ifit    i would recommend picking the option where they put the treadmill in your room of choice  for         trust me it s worth it  it was fairly easy to assemble    you just have to take your time and take it slow  the treadmill is very quiet  i m giving it   stars and  the delivery with amazon was seamless   also sign up for text messaging regarding delivery     they let you know the exact time that the treadmill will be delivered if you have a smart tv you can connect the screen on the treadmill to your tv  enjoy        
136,5.0,                       machine is well built  sturdy and easy to use    there are warnings all over the packages and instructions that state that you need to unlock your machine by signing up for an i fit membership   this is not true   all you need to do is  after the machine is assembled  turn on the machine  press and hold the i fit button for    seconds  the machine will reset and you re good to go      
137,1.0,                       i bought a nordictrack t   s treadmill for over      through amazon and received it as expected   no issues with amazon   i followed the user s manual on how to set it up  including purchasing a surge protector according to required specs  made sure it was the only device in the circuit  etc   it seemed to be a pretty good product but less than a month after receiving it  it stopped working   i filed a warranty claim with nordictrack and received a response asking for a picture video of the motor s led lights  i emailed the video the next day  october   th   it s been two weeks and i ve received no response   i have submitted several requests for status    nothing   the only good thing i can say about it right now is that my cat likes to sit on it   if customer service finally comes through and provides some resolution  i will update my review      
138,1.0,                       update  ifit has charged us yet again  even though we have canceled twice     please be aware if you buy this treadmill you ll be permanently stuck with a     monthly charge for a ridiculous app  my advice  but a plug and play and add what you actually want to from the thousands of free workout apps treadmill is relatively easy to put together with decent instructions  it does take two people or one very savvy person to get it   it s definately not gym quality  but it works  when you step off to the sides to start and stop it feels like there is no support  but so far hasn t come crashing in on us the number one issue we had is that you cannot start the treadmill without first logging in and subscribing to ifit  silly  the ifit isn t necessarily bad  but i want to make that choice  not be told i have no choice in the matter  ifit is also very hard to get unentangled from  you have to log in from a desktop    who has those anymore    and tell it   different ways you want to end the subscription in the end if i d have realized that ifit was a must  and the sides and front of the machine were such cheap thin plastic i d have spent a little more and got a better product     
139,4.0,                       we just got our    s today  so i ll have to update this review after using it for awhile first thoughts  assembly was a little tricky  we did it ourselves from the box   but no too bad the screen is gorgeous   touch works well unlike some reviews has suggested  you do not have to have for an ifit account to use the treadmill  but you won t be able to take advantage of all the features without oneit does come with a free   year ifit family plan promo codeall in all  it s a nice machine  the only complaint i have so far is you can t use headphones with the unit  all you can do is pair your phone or tablet so you can play music  or whatever  through the unit s speakers  even the included aux cable is for input only      
140,5.0,                       i only need a treadmill to run on days it s too cold  hot to run outside   i bought the simplest nordic track t series because i did not require any extra features    it s great so far with my maximum speed of     mph  yet i m more in the zone of    mph until i rebuild some speed and endurance   it s relatively quiet and  just for assurance  i padded the front legs through the middle roller  for now  with a repurposed yoga mat  to cushion on wood floors in an older     s home for a home treadmill  it recalls what i liked and needed the most from a gym machine   the lip on the display easily holds a magazine or an ipad   i really like to zone out and listen to music when i run  so all is well here regarding assembly  i wish i added that option with delivery   a local handyperson helped me with most of it  yet at one point needed help stabilizing the treadmill while adding the hardware that helps it fold and re lower   three thoughts on this      for safety  it s a two person assembly     don t overestimate how strong you are  and     when you discover how this treadmill lifts and lowers to save space  it makes you happy you bought this product   it gliiiiides down to the floor i am so happy this fits in my  nd bedroom   the folding up feature will help with guests in town  i heeded some reviewers  advice and held the i      button down for   s   it worked   i was able to run and such without needing to subscribe to anything else   i already subscribe to a running app and try to keep myself accountable in other ways      
141,5.0,                       ok  so the first  and most important  point i want to make  you do not need a subscription to ifit for this treadmill to work  this thing is plastered with stickers that say the treadmill is  locked  and it wont work until you  activate  it  this is absolutely not true  based on other commenters posting about this  i wasnt even going to buy this treadmill  but the other one i had my eye on wound up getting sold out  so i decided to take a leap of faith  hoping that the bypass methods mentioned in other comments would work  and i bought this one  so that being said  everything written in other comments is true   you can bypass the activation of ifit and the treadmill works perfectly fine      the treadmill was actually pretty easy to put together  i d definitely say it was a two person job  it took us maybe   hours  i dont know how anyone did it in    minutes  but maybe they have more experience than us      it s really quiet  like  shockingly quiet  the last treadmill i owned was    years old  so maybe that s skewing my perspective a little  but i am very impressed with how quiet this thing is overall  i am extremely pleased with my purchase      
142,5.0,                       i have been looking for a treadmill for some time  since working from home in the age of covid means i am more sedentary than i would like  i am nothing like an athlete  i am in my    s and have some mobility problems so walking is essential but i am not likely to be running at any great speed  i do  however  prefer an incline this treadmill was a relatively good price  for the aforementioned reasons  i had no interest in the ifit program and did not need a large screen  so i purchased the   inch screen which is far lower in price than the larger ones what i liked about this machine was    it has a wide    inch belt which seemed safer and more comfortable than a narrow one   it supports     lb people which means it s sturdy and solidboth of these appear to be accurate it s a heavy monster  i lavishly tipped the delivery drivers who graciously wrestled it down a flight of stairs for me  and i hired a fitness repair company to assemble it  both were well spent investments in my opinion  ymmv i also purchased a   year maintenance agreement  if you look at the prices on amazon  they range all over the place for the same deal  so shop around  in my case      got me a three year agreement with a yearly preventive maintenance visit  assuming it is fulfilled  it seems like a worthwhile investment there are elements of the unit that i do not love  the heart rate monitor does not seem accurate  the instructions are meh and the website is as well i avoided the ifit scam because of the reviews here that noted that all i had to do was to hold down the start key for    seconds to bypass the credit card request  there is a big notice on the device that says stop  and tells you that a credit card is required to start the machine   not true and tacky at the end of the day  i spent less that        including the extended warranty  delivery and assembly  i feel it was a good value and it appears to be a solid machine  it fits my needs well  it may or may not be what you need      
143,5.0,                       we ve owned this treadmill for   months now and absolutely love it  glad i read the reviews that state how to disable the ifit program prior to purchase so there were no surprises  definitely a lot harder to assemble this unit than i realized  i ended up hiring a professional to assemble it using the thumbtack app  it cost me     and was well worth it  the only thing we ve had to do maintenance wise is adjust the belt  the belt had shifted to one side and was rubbing against the side molding  i watched a   minute video on youtube that showed how to fix it easily  the instructions for how to align the belt on the nordictrack website were useless  so glad i found what i was looking for on youtube  i m very happy with this purchase      
144,5.0,                       brief background on me  so you can compare your running style and needs to mine in your decision for this treadmill or another   my details  mid   s        small to medium build   running history  i ve been consistently running   miles     times a week for over    years  speed  at the moment       to      minute miles  i d like to get back to      to      minute miles  though   style  almost entirely treadmill running  which has allowed me to avoid major injuries and strains when the gyms closed due to the pandemic i was forced to take my running outside  which left my feet  ankles  and knees aching   i knew i needed a treadmill   i am a treadmill fanatic  having run on many over the years   i am very picky about what i like and don t like and knew what i wanted  a durable treadmill with good shock absorption which would stand up to almost daily use   i ended up choosing the nordictrac t series with the   inch screen   i have had this treadmill for over two weeks now and have run on it almost every night since i got it   it meets and exceeds my needs in almost every way pros   running is very comfortable  the shock absorption is very good  i noticed a difference right away in how my legs and feet felt compared to running outside   it has been comfortable every night i have run on it  no aches or strains   it sits flat  i absolutely hate running on a treadmill that is slightly inclined when it is supposed to be at a   grade   if you ve ever experienced this you know what i m talking about   the size is comfortable  plenty of room on the belt  but i am short so take that into consideration   the screen allows me to track my distance in either laps      miles per lap  or with a standard distance tracker   i m a total nerd about tracking my pace and this shows distance to the thousandths spot rather than the more usual tenths and hundredths  i e  it shows you have run       miles rather than      or        it s dumb  but i love this feature   the speed and incline buttons are intuitive and user friendly in their positioning on the console   it s very easy to fold up and pull down   you can crank it up for a hard run or interval training   i have it up to   mph on occasion and there is no wobble or shake   the range of incline is good and the movement up and down is smooth   if inclines are your thing you should have plenty to work with here   the price was right  for a treadmill of this caliber it was a great deal   higher end commercial grade treadmills can be upwards of two grand or more  and this was less than half that cons   during assembly there were a couple of times where the screws almost or just didn t quite fit where they were supposed to   we  fixed  it by brute force and a drill  but it was frustrating at the time   i do wish this version had a fan  but you can always purchase one to attach to the treadmill if you need one   the heart rate monitor is useless  but whatever unknowns   i haven t tried the speakers   i watch my tablet or listen to music podcasts on my phone and use headphones   the shelf for your tablet is really nice though  for what that s worth  update  i tried them  they re pretty terrible   definitely don t rely on them   they are too quiet and the sound quality is pretty bad to summarize  this is a worthwhile investment if you want a solid treadmill for your running routine  or if you re looking to make running part of your daily life    i m extremely happy with it and will be using it for my daily run from here on out update i ve been using the treadmill about   times a week or so since i bought it a couple of months ago  so i thought i would update on how it s holding up  if that is useful    overall  still sturdy and comfortable   still very kind to my knees and ankles  which is important to me   no issues with shaking or squeaking two issues i do notice    the belt has a tendency to slide to one side or the other while running  so i have to keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn t get chewed up by sliding too far   adjusting the belt does help but it still does slide   for whatever reason  once the machine seems to be warmed up and i am running faster  the sliding is much less of a problem    also  as a side note  the last home treadmill we had was far more prone to sliding than this one  it may just be something endemic to home treadmills     on occasion when i switch the treadmill on it goes all the way through an incline cycle   by this i mean the platform raises itself as far as it can and then lowers itself again   then it s fine and i start my run i would not deduct from my original rating for these issues   it s still a great treadmill and i m so happy not to have to go to the gym right now      
145,5.0,                       i purchased this item for only      before the weather got cold  my wife and i dropped our membership at the local fitness center last march because of covid risk  we went to our local city park to exercise during the spring  summer and early fall weather  with the risk still high  i started shopping for something we could use during the winter  i had owned the nordic track ski machine for several years but at     i don t have the wind to use it anymore  i looked at the nordic track web site and then checked amazon  i got a great deal on the model i purchased because it has a much smaller screed display than the current models  i wasn t interested in the ifit features so the smaller screen was fine  i paid for assembly but when the guys showed up  without masks  i decided to just assemble it myself  i had them unbox it and put the heavy parts inside the door  they were really nice guys so i didn t even consider asking for a refund on the assembly  it took me   hours to assemble it  mostly because i was working in a pretty confined space  i did register for the   month of free ifit rather than using a simple override  it s a good thing i did because the machine comes set to metric as the default distance setting  i switched it to miles on the ifit site and it retained the setting  the machine is heavy and seems to be very high quality  i plug my iphone into it to play music while i workout and the speakers a surprisingly great  i had to do a good bit of tinkering to get the belt to stay centered but it s fine now  there is a very intermittent squeak and i have not been able to get rid of it in spite of youtube videos on lubricating a few points  i m betting that when the machine gets a few more hours on it  it will stop  we are using the machine in a pretty confined area but once we put it in the storage position  it doesn t interfere with using the area   overall  we love the machine and the build quality should provide us with many years of usage and at the price i paid  it was a true steal      
146,4.0,                       i bought this to work out at home during the pandemic i have been using it   mn a day for   months without any issue i like the safety side which relies on a small cord attached to a magnet which gets pulled and shuts down the treadmill if you stand to far back on the tread you need at least   persons to assemble it i personally am not interested in ifit and i prefer watching tv while exercising when you open and setup the treadmill  there are notes and signs that tell you yo register with ifit to start as explained by one of the other reviewers  you do not have to register with ifit  the first time you start the treadmill  press the ifit button for about    seconds and then you will be able to use the treadmill normally i am not a fitness addict but i feel this treadmill from a trusted company is worth every penny and at a price significantly lower that many other models      
147,5.0,                       prosincline adjusts from      and speed from    mph to    mpheasy to fold  even for a    granny like me and unfolds with lift assist cylinderfairly easy to assemble  i did it with my grandson  the hardest part was the screw for the ground wirerapid response to speed adjustmentseasy to access the drive motor area  had a wonky connection and customer support walked me through it  so it looks like maintenance will be a breezemost treadmills at this price range do not have incline adjustment or very little  this one has     i watch my  tablet when using the treadmill and the ledge for it is large enough that i don t worry about the tablet bouncing offit s great to have   cup holders   i use one for my iphone to monitor my heartrate with a myzone belt  the pulse rate on the treadmill is usually pretty close to my chest strap readings  although sometimes wildly off neutral   i did not use the ifit feature so i cannot comment on that consthe audio is horrible   really very little volume  use your headphonesthe display is very small  that is a non issue with me  when using the treadmill i stream amazon prime or netflix videos to my fire tablet overall impression   it s a great basic treadmill without a lot of bells and whistles  it s made for you to work out  not watch tv or play music  you ve got other devices to do that      
148,3.0,                       pros easy to put together but had a few things come up during the build  you do need two people at one point when attaching the folding guide rod  the cable you also fish through was confusing on one step where it should go  i took a picture for reference  very quit  maybe i have not bought a new treadmill in awhile but i don t have to blast the tv to ear over the unit  a simple interface makes it easy to do quick changes to incline and speed  easy on the knees so far  it seems like the treadmill takes my impact fine  the calorie counter seems more accurate update  another feature i realized is that if i accidentally pull the safety clip it will remember my spot instead of losing everything  distance  time etc consreally i have to unlock the treadmill through an app that i first have to register and give a credit card to for ifit  i mean give me a break  i canceled the account right after creating it  i just shouldn t have to do this  there is a number you can do it over the phone but i didn t try that just used the app i am not      convinced this folding lock is safe compared to my last one  i mean there is no pin to lock it in place just the rod that you push with your foot  i could see a kid knocking it  i mean it does come down slow enough they should be able to get out of the way but i am not sure how often i will have this in a folded position update  i had some issues with the incline getting caught on the bolt coming down  it looked like comparing the lift bracket to the other side the one on the left was bent a little too far out  i did have to use a rubber mallet to get it over just the little bit so i could go up and down on the incline without it getting stuck      
149,1.0,                       pleasantly surprised it was delivered a few days early   installation manual was actually quite good  detailed and correct  the reason for   stars is the quality of parts and service  most items requiring lots of screws  nuts and such  usually would pack extra in case of anything  not nordictrack  they gave only the exact count   there was a special screw for the ground wire  and as i screwed it in  the tip broke off  then  i was unable to screw in one of the screws needed to attach the display to the handrail because the screw had metal in the groove so that i can t get the screwdriver in  never seen defective screws like this  i called nordictrack  and it was going to take them      business days to get one screw to me  i chose nordictrack for its supposed name brand  but the lack of quality control and service was disappointing update  i m lowering to   star because it s been   weeks and i am still waiting for one screw      
150,5.0,                       when researching this treadmill  i saw a lot of negative reviews  i realized that all of the negative reviews were due to nordic track s partnership with ifit  i was a little apprehensive about having to deal with ifit but decided i would give it my all  a few months later  i can say that i am not a fan of ifit  it was hard to use and would take so long to start the workout that i felt i d rather just do without it  it wasted my time  taking so long to load  and would be a source of frustration  therefore  i unsubscribed after the first free month and thankfully  that s was quick and easy as for nordic track  i recently purchased my very first treadmill from them  however  i m very familiar with nordic track  i ve witnessed my cousin using a nordic track treadmill for years  she raves about its durability  comfort  and quality  i am excited to finally be able to start my own journey  with nordic track finally  at checkout i choose to pay amazon an extra fee in return for delivering the machine to  room of choose   upon arrival  the delivery company was unwilling to take it up the stairs  the stairs were included in the package i paid for   i had an impossibly heavy treadmill sitting in my front room for a few days  amazon was unsympathetic  about this and were unwilling to help  even though i had paid to have them take it up the stairs  in the end  they refunded the amount and my husband and i carried it up the stairs  it was back breaking work but well worth it      
151,4.0,                       i received this nordic track treadmill back in november      and am so grateful to find one in stock that would ship directly to my home   our old treadmill lasted about    years so we weren t looking for anything fancy with big screens to follow along with workouts but just a good quality machine with an easy to use display   it took a little time to put together but my husband was able to follow all the instructions and got it assembled in an afternoon   one part was broken in shipping and it was easy to use the customer service links on the order to request a replacement part  which we received after about a month   we weren t upset because it was right around christmas when all shipping carriers were delayed   the treadmill folds very easily  the display buttons are large and easy to see  the machine is heavy duty and responsive to incline and speed changes   i ve seen a lot of complaints about the ifit claims included with the machine that you must create an account to use it   all it took was a little research to discover that is not the case and all you have to do is follow these easy instructions to bypass that   hold down the ifit logo on the treadmill for    seconds and your treadmill will work   it has other features like internal speakers and heart rate monitor that i don t use  since i wear a fitbit and use my laptop and wireless headphones to watch tv and movies while i work out but this treadmill is definitely a great value for the price      
152,4.0,                       there was one tiny screw missing for a wire grounding so it wasn t a big deal  since the screw is super tiny and had a substitute screw that didn t fit as well but you could put tape around it so it wouldn t fall out for the grounding   i may use my warranty soon to ask if they can look at that part   but this product is extremely well made  the usability is super easy with the button options and monitoring tools  love the space it saves because you can push up the tred for more floor space  and the assembly is very easy with the organize instructions and pictures and organized packaged tools  running on it is smooth and doesn t hurt the floor      
153,4.0,                       i must say  i read the good   the bad  the ugly  i had major anxiety while building this as the negative reviews were flying through my mind  once i plugged the machine in and started it up i was in fact able to bypass the ifit membership and was so happy  i pressed speed   and man is this thing peppy  it picked up fast overall  the machine feels solid    it is not eating up the small room it is in as it is a great size  it lifts and comes down with ease to save space my only con  the incline seems a bit outdated  if you do interval training you may have to alter the amount of time you walk or run on that incline to account for the amount of time it took to get to that incline i am relieved that i did not experience any of the horrors other customers seem to have  i would      recommend if you need something basic but solid for your home      
154,1.0,                       ifit is engaged in a coercive  deceptive relationship with nordictrack   you are required to provide a credit card and pay    to simply start the thing   after you have gone through the trouble of ordering  delivering  assembling  now you are required to subscribe to the ifit service to simply start the thing   there is no way to decline the service   you have to create an ifit account  provide your credit card details  accept a    charge  accept you will be charged     month  and then install an app on your phone to start the thing   if you were as put off as i was  then you immediately  turn around and try to log back in  and trudge around looking for how you can  end benefit    also  now they have your cc info   so i cancelled that cc account to protect that information   now about assembly   the instructions need a lot of work   there is a table at the front that provide numbers to the parts that correspond to the diagrams  but are not referenced with the parts package   simply continuing the numbering reference to the parts package would have taken care of it   after finally getting the thing assembled  we noticed that the frame was not square and would not sit on the floor squarely  one foot was always in the air   so we had to jump on it a few times to get it to bend back to square   so now that we have it assembled  activated  and squared  we can attempt to use it     writing this review has been very therapeutic  thank you amazon  update to follow  st update   we had this just two days  it did something strange today  we turned it on and it immediately began to rise  once it reached the top it began to lower  once it got to the bottom  it just stopped  waiting to be used   it was just weird  thought i should mention it  otherwise it seems to be working normally now      
155,5.0,                       i use my nt treadmill every other day for approximately the past   months  sturdy  quiet  i would definitely buy it again  you can t beat the price for quality  and the payment option is appreciated  caution   you definitely want to have an experienced technician assemble it unless you have the time and some  handyman  skill  a second person might also be a benefit  instructions are fairly clear criticisms  adjusting the belt tension is an aggravation and necessary  there needs to be a guide tube to enable easy insertion of the allen wrench  provided  into the two hidden sockets  especially considering the need to lubricate  by loosening  the belt on the platform every   months  a smaller criticism  the platform on each side could be a couple inches wider to comfortably put your feet  i appreciate that the design is to be as narrow as possible  it s a great machine overall      
156,5.0,                       per the headline  i ve had my machine for   weeks now and am loving every minute of it   the only reason i had a gym membership was to use their treadmill   i canceled that after only   workouts on this machine   below are the details of my experience from purchase to assembly purchase   as some reviewers have stated the treadmill is a bear to assemble by yourself  which is what i did    however  if you have a competent friend family member willing to give you an hour of their time i would bypass the professional assembly   however  definitely pay the extra     for in house desired room delivery  even if you live in a one story house    the box the treadmill comes in weighs about     lbs   you do not want to try maneuvering it around your house apartment without help delivery   as stated above  i use the desired room delivery   the amazon delivery service was on time  professional and capable  although i did have to help the guys get the box around a tricky corner in my building s staircase    they called once when they were on their way to my location  and again as they were pulling   i ve always been gun shy about purchasing large items on amazon  but if this is the level of service one can expect from their delivery service i may do so more often assembly   again  assembly can be done with one person  it s in no way easy  and you should be able to lift at least    lbs by yourself   but i don t recommend it   however  having gone through the steps there wasn t anything that i thought would warrant paying an extra     for a professional to come do   just make sure you have a phillips head screwdriver   and either a socket wrench  with plenty of socket heads  or an adjustable wrench   all other tools needed come with the treadmill   as others have stated some of the bolts are in hard to reach spots   take your time  follow the instructions and assembly shouldn t take more than an hour   pro tip  there s no need to purchase a mat for the bottom of the treadmill  to protect your floor  if you re strapped for cash   when you take the top off the box  simply cut off the side pieces  put the belt motor component on the top and use it as your floor protection   the cardboard doesn t slide slip at all when you re on the treadmill usage   unlike some others i actually bought this machine for the ifit functionality   i have an ifit account and absolutely love the service   from what i read you can cancel the membership  almost immediately  after the machine has been activated   personally i love just being able to focus on my run walks and let the machine self adjust speed and incline on its own   full disclosure though   you really don t need an ifit membership to take advantage of this function   while you can manually adjust settings like any gym treadmill  this machine comes with  i think     preset workouts that also self adjust   i haven t used any of them yet  but from scrolling through the menus they look pretty varied in terms of challenge level   the machine is quieter than any gym treadmill i ve ever used   i workout watching tv and routinely run at   mph without having to adjust the tv s volume   transitions between incline and speed levels is smooth and natural   i also love that you can adjust the cushyness firmness of the belt storage   the treadmill doesn t take up that much space   it s a little shorter than a child s twin bed  probably about the same width    while it can be folded you really don t save that much space with the belt bed up  since it rests at a angle that s only slight shorter than the length when fully deployed    i generally leave it down and ready to use overall i m extremely happy with this purchase   i haven t any issues or complaints   weeks in  but appreciate the length of the warranties that come standard with the treadmill  i did however buy the   year maintenance plan     i would definitely recommend this machine without reservation      
157,4.0,                       first  thanks to reviewer who tells how to over ride activation to ifit by holding down ifit button for approximately    seconds until activation screen disappears and normal screen shows up  great job  and i agree this is just a  s grab  also  this unit is heavy and awkward to get into your house to setup and locate to final location  based upon how beaten up  dented and crushed my box was  i would say transportation and delivery was an issue for everyone who touched it  surprisingly only minor cosmetic crack in motor cover   assembly was harder than necessary because of manufacturing and design shortcuts taken by nordictrack  instructions were adequate but not great  some machine threads were not done in the frame  so they supplied a self threading machine screw  if unfamiliar with a thread cutting screw  i m sure some would assume either the hole was too small or the screw was incorrect size  how easy would it have been for them to machine the threads  also  some of the parts had smaller holes than the screw needed to pass thru to attach part to body of treadmill  just sloppy parts forming  some better and more detailed drawings for assembling would have helped  two people is nice for speedier assembly  but one handy person can accomplish on their own  final bug  the clip for the safety stop is incredibly cheap  it s like a paper clip  for a few pennies they could have had a clothespin type device that lived up to nordictrack quality for the good  once together  it s a great treadmill  very solid  lots of options  easy to set and change while using tho controls for     on side handles would have been a quality touch  little to no bounce sway  lower noise level  nice wide tread  incremental speed by     mph from  mph to   mph  so  all in all  a great treadmill at        wait for it to be back in stock at amazon and avoid those      prices       
158,5.0,                       we bought this treadmill to get cardio in during covid    lockdown  and are very happy with it   for the price paid  it is very high quality and a great value   the machine was packed very well for shipping   i recommend registering the product as soon as you get it built my wife is pretty happy with it   it does appear to move faster than the treadmills on a similar speed setting at the health club   the belt was slightly misaligned to the right  but i found an online support article showing how to make a few turns with the allen wrench to center  super easy   the stride length is very good for us both  so we never feel like we re going to fall off the back   the electronics are attractive and simple to operate   belt operation is smooth and relatively quiet the treadmill releases very easily to fold up if you need to move it out of the way   we have dedicated a space in our media room for it  so this is less important to us   assembly took maybe an hour  and the instructions were very easy to follow the only complaint i have about the workouts is i wish the arm support bars extended a bit further back   i find that when resting my hands on them  i have to orient my body a bit too far forward  and the tips of my shoes will sometimes tap on the kick panel covering the front of the belt   also  there are some rough edges to the plastic where they were removed from the mold right at the end of the hand rests so i need to file those down   very minor annoyance i don t use the ifit com subscription   you can disable this as others have noted on first use by holding down the ifit button and letting the machine reset itself  maybe    seconds   i prefer to watch movies or listen to music while using so this was not a feature that mattered to me overall i m very happy with this purchase and with the support from nordictrack pros   quality sturdy construction  ease of assembly  fluid motion incline  excellent support  attractive design  great value price  well packaged   easy to fold up move  wheels are great cons  ifit unnecessary imo  wish arm rests were a bit longeri would not hesitate to buy this treadmill if you re considering one in this price range      
159,2.0,                       first and foremost follow others advice  the thing will beep at you like crazy in attempts to resist and they have put flyers all over it claiming to sign up for ifit to unlock it  hold the ifit button for    seconds to unlock no need to pay  shameless scam  absolutely disgustinginstructions say need   people to assemble this is not a joke  if you are not a handy person do not buy this  they don t provide you the correct tools to assemble  the pieces don t fit together properly  the screws don t fit any of the holes  and the parts are cut wrong too big or to small  the parts in the shrink rap are labeled wrong  the instructions refer to the wrong parts and wrong locations i consider myself very handy  the horrible design  poor production and lack of attention to anything that might be considered  detail  made this a horrific profanity laced      hour assembly  the  assembly  comprised of having to force pieces together  use an impact drill to get enough torque to get screws intended for discard out of the damn holes and then to get the intended screws that were too big to fit in the hole into place i can t rail hard enough about how horrific the design on this nightmare of a product was  you would think nordictrack as a recognizable brand would mean quality  far from it once it was together it appears to work as designed although it leaves plenty to desire in aesthetics  options and software quality  user friendly     this product is lazily designed  slapped together and farted out for consumers to hate every life choice that led them to this nightmare is it a treadmill  yesis it also a demon spawn sent to torture your last cell of sanity  also yesis it a blatant scam that they company has still refused to rectify  also  also yes      
160,2.0,                          takes long time to assemble and it takes two common skilled people to put together    folding is a joke  when it folds up  it only folds to about    degrees  not straight up    degrees to get out the way    trying to move it while it is folded is impossible because of how awkward it folds and where wheels are positioned    i am       the front and side grips are way too low to hold onto while walking so useless you want to hunch way over while walking    the heart monitor is useless  it always reads in the    s and    s    the sides of the belt where you step off to take a break while the belt is still moving are useless  they are dangerous because they are angled towards the belt and are way too thin to get your entire foot on them  try stepping on them and part of your foot is still on the moving belt which can make you fall on your face i am very disappointed in this purchase all these good reviews are either fake or from short people who never need to fold it  move it  use the heart monitor  or use the side steps      
161,2.0,                       i assembled the treadmill with great deal difficulties  when i turned the tread mill  i heard brushing noise with out anyone running on it  attempted to call nordic  it took me   hours to get my message to them  i get the e mail from nordic asking me to trouble shoot by removing many parts of the treadmill  my question is they are asking me to troubleshot brand new treadmill  it should have been checked before the tread mill left the factory  even registering the warranty on their site is a head ache  when you spend over        you should get a quality product  hope nordic stand behind their name and reputation  they have very limited online hours for trouble shooting resolution      
162,4.0,                       first of all  i would like to mention that my husband and i were very happy that our treadmill arrived earlier than we expected and the packaging was in very good condition  no big gouges in the box   thus  we felt confident that the treadmill did not suffer any kind of damage during transport   we removed all parts from the packaging and assembled the treadmill   it requires   people to assemble this treadmill  but it s not complicated or confusing as the instructions are clear and easy to follow i ve been using this treadmill at least   times per week for   months now and i have been very satisfied with its performance   i find the treadmill to be sturdy and it doesn t make any annoying sounds while in use   i like that there are   ways for adjusting incline and speed   the only feature that i wish the treadmill included is a cooling fan   however  i have remedied this by placing a small fan in front of the treadmill to cool me while i m working out   i actually look forward to my work outs even more now that i own this treadmill      
163,5.0,                       i wanted to write a review on this because of all of the reviews saying the ifit was a scam or whatever  i got the old model and it came with the basic ifit   year plan  i set it up when i set up the machine  i didn t have to input my credit card number or anything  it will just end after the year is up  you can still use the machine without it  i usually just use the track anyway because i listen to my own music and the ifit coach people annoy me  my kids use the ifit coaches because they like the videos of people going into pyramids or caves  it only has the walking  jogging  and running videos  anything that involves other workouts is not included with the basic ifit membership now  my review  this machine was super easy to set up  i did pay the    bucks to have someone bring it into the house since it had to go up a flight of stairs and around a tight corner  my husband set the machine up in maybe an hour  i only had to help with a couple of things i absolutely love the incline on this machine  it does it automatically and totally rules  you can make the machine go faster and the incline higher in single increments or    increments  i m not an athlete so i ve been slowly working my way up  for example  i started at   mph and a   incline and i m now at     mph and a   incline  it s nice to take things down or up a notch depending on how i m feeling the machine is also very easy to fold up and down  i do it with every workout since i have the machine in our bedroom it doesnt have a fan or anything but theres a fan in my bedroom so it s fine  it s just kind of annoying if i get started and forget to turn the fan on  but it s easy to pause the machine as well so not a huge deal i dont like the big power switch on it for some reason  i m on computers all day so it feels like there should be a shut down switch on the screen  it makes that  you shut the computer down manually  click noise that makes me uncomfortable  but that s just a personal preference and not a real complaint  this treadmill is the best for the money      
164,5.0,                       like a lot of people who were used to using the cardio in the gym  this virus lockdown was problematic  we bought this early into the stay at home orders in ca   given the relatively low price i was concerned about it being stable but it is plenty solid for us   we use it primarily for fast walking but i put     miles on it a day  sometimes more   don t expect what you can get for     thousand  it isn t like a gym model but functions similarly    nice incline  good read out   if you are fairly handy can use simple hand tools and carefully follow instructions  you can do the build yourself  there are a couple of places a second set of hands helps   it is a process i think it took me a couple hours  and i build things a fair amount    the reviews that tell you not to fall for the attempt at selling the on line trainer crap are accurate   after you get it set up just hit the blue ifit button and it will bypass the screen that has you enter the code to sign up   once you do this the machine stays in manual mode and you wont have to mess with it again  if you want the ifit thing you get more functionality out of the preset controls but all i want to do is walk  jog and incline sometimes   there is also a pair of speakers that you can aux cord connect to  would be nice if it was blue tooth   there is a small shelf on the monitor that you can put your ipad on   overall  super happy with this for the price      
165,5.0,                       i was looking for a high quality treadmill for jogging walking that had simple features  i ve used really good treadmills at various gyms and wasn t willing to use a cheap feeling treadmill  it is great quality  it is easy to use with manual features  increase speed  incline  etc    but also offers shortcut buttons to quickly get up to speed use programs  you can track all the basics  calories  distance  etc   from the treadmill  i started out by using the ifit app  which is pretty simple to use  but decided to discontinue my subscription because i enjoy pretty basic  quick walks runs  other people wrote reviews about issues cancelling ifit but i had absolutely no issue and was glad i tried out various programs  it was nice to know i have the option in the future if i want it  assembly takes a bit of time  but i don t think that s uncommon for workout equipment  overall happy with the quality and functionality      
166,5.0,                       the nordictrack t    si arrived on time and in one very long and heavy reinforced cardboard box   it took two delivery men to bring it inside my house   with the help of another person  i wanted to get it upstairs but we had trouble maneuvering this    lb unit in its large box around a turn in my staircase  so i decided that it would go in my office on the main floor   no problem there   i carefully followed the instructions and found them to be extremely well written and with adequate detail   if you prefer to use a video to help build it  there is a free app called bilt that has this unit in their catalog and it follows the same exact steps as the written guide but with the addition of some nice  d images that you can rotate   it took me about   hours to assemble but i worked slowly and double checked all steps   for someone who has built one  it might take       hrs   once assembled  i was able to login using my home wifi and immediately it told me that there was an available firmware update   no issue updating  but it took a good    minutes or so to complete it   i logged in using the included   year free ifit family membership and added myself and my wife as users   there is an option to bypass the ifit membership but why do that if   year is totally free   after that  i calibrated the incline as per instructions and that worked out fine i have tried two of the ifit level    the easiest    workouts and i loved them   first i took a walk called  niagara river cultural walk    this was      miles in duration and basically mostly flat with a few includes up to      i love the way that the machine adjust walking speed and incline automatically and the instructor provided an excellent overview of the area while walking along with you   the next day i tried a different walk  inner crater walk  rano raraku  easter island        miles   this one was also level   but slightly more challenging as the incline went up to    but still a relatively simple and easy workout   the instructor gave a great overview of the history and the views were spectacular   not quite like being there but very nice and easy to see on the    built in lcd monitor what i like  so far    a very nice solid machine  well built and sturdy   it looks good and is almost as sturdy as those expensive ones at the gym   this model was in stock at amazon even though it was on backorder at nordictrack s own website  go figure     i got it something like   days after ordering   i found a better price on amazon  check several vendors   as price varies    in fact it was lower than direct from nordictrack   great instructions on assembly and very easy to follow   there is a step that recommends two people for safety reasons   love the ifit app   i know this isn t a material part of the treadmill but it certainly makes using it a lot more fun   anyone that bypasses this app is losing out what i didn t like  so far   the built in android tablet boots up slowly and some of the touch screen functions seem slow to react   not a big issue but it is a bit slower than modern technology should be   no bluetooth to connect audio from an external device to the built in speakers   there is a      jack socket so you can use a  not included  cable   haven t tried that yet   the built in handlebar for measuring pulse rate seems to be very erratic   during the walks i took it wandered from     too low  to      way too high  but occasionally it seemed to be about right   you can buy a chest pulse rate monitor which i am guessing will be more accurate overall  i really like this treadmill  i think it was a great purchase   recommended      
167,5.0,                       i can t even begin to explain how much i love this machine     i do feel like it s important to mention that it was very difficult for my husband to put together and he s been a carpenter for    years so he s really handy  also  once it was all assembled  it wasn t working properly so i contact tech support at nordictrack  they were very patient and helpful and worked through multiple troubleshooting techniques for over an hour  unfortunately  the problem was deeper than the surface so we couldn t fix it  they apologize multiple times and sent out a new console which i got about   days later  i connected the new one and it works great  i love love love it  the workouts really keep you engaged and the fact that the machine does all of the work in terms of adjusting the speed and incline makes things so much easier  i don t have any joint pain so i feel like the suspension works really week  i got the    inch screen  t series     si  and the screen is roughly the size of an ipad   much larger in person than it looks in the picture   plus the video clarity is great        
168,2.0,                       warning  if you buy amazon s expert assembly and want to return a defective item  they will make you disassemble it yourself as soon as we turned it on  it made a terrible noise that gets louder and louder as it increased speed   sounding like a jet engine  something is definitely out of sorts with nordictracks quality control  i paid for amazon s expert assembly and they even tested it before  approving it  but they disregarded that it was obviously defective  which we found out only an hour after they left other issues  the belt moved over to one side so i adjusted the tension to balance it out  hoping that would make it stop  but it did the same thing while the belt was perfectly centered   very disappointing for a brand new treadmill  would be much better off getting one locally from a sporting goods store     
169,2.0,                       the treadmill was delivered on time and in perfect condition  assembly took about   hours and was very simple  the treadmill looks great and the touchscreen is gorgeous  but without ifit is loses a lot of the appeal  the big problem is that the   year subscription to ifit is nowhere to be found  and nordictrack  icon fitness  have horrendous customer service  it took over    hours to get a response which was just a canned request for my activation number to  look into the issue   if i had the promo activation code i wouldn t need to contact you from a functional standpoint the unit seems good  it s solid and runs fairly quiet  but the missing ifit subscription really hurts the value proposition  it does seem like other people have received their code  so your mileage may vary  but if this is an indication of how customer service works you better pray the machine never breaks      
170,5.0,                       very glad i picked this one after studying so many of them  for      you get a quality  treadmill with a very basic information screen  treadmill section is high quality  however that basic    screen will display everything you ll need to know during your workout  and believe me when i say  you do not have to register for  and pay extra for ifit to use this treadmill  once i first held the ifit button down for about    seconds i never had to do that again  everytime i power it up i get on it  set my speed and start walking      
171,1.0,                       not what i wanted  when we received the package the top of the console was already broken  i thought this looked professional because of the personal trainers and such  even though you had to sign up for ifit  yes  and we found out about the broken piece in the console that exposed the inner hardware so of course we couldn t have that  so we returned it  we had to take the treadmill apart which is as hard as putting it together  which used up   hours of my life  not easy to assemble      
172,3.0,                       i have this a three star review for a few reasons  none of which deals with the function of the product first  the  timed  delivery was two days early  while this was a positive  it was completely unexpected  the drivers were very curtious  they even brought it into my apartment  rather than leaving it in the hallway as requested once they left  i inspected the box  it was completely damaged  there was pieces of the box missing  and the product was actually exposed  i immediately contacted amazon and confirmed it was safe to open the box while my husband assembled the treadmill  there was a piece of the base that was broken  we completed the assembly  the dimensions they provide in the description are for the deck only  this became a problem  since i live in a small apartment  i pre planned the designated space for this  this was pointless  so we  rearranged our living room for it that being said  we ve used it several times now  it works flawlessly  i like the functions  i don t subscribe to their workout thing  i feel the main console is way oversized  the heart rate monitor is not acurate  but neither of us use it  overall  i think it is a good treadmill  just didn t enjoy the  set up       
173,5.0,                       i am an avid runner      yrs  and my wife is an avid treadmill walker at the ymca   we both have been considering getting a treadmill back into the home as an alternative to the y and  yes  i will run on it when the weather is bad outside   we wanted to keep the price point to below   k and after a bit of research decided on this model   it arrived on time and after i gently got the heavy device down to the basement i assembled it within   hours   thanks to some prior amazon posts  i knew to press and hold the ifit button to activate without having to enroll in the ifit subscription   the product registration is separate   the treadmill is great   purchased the floor pad as well   we don t need all the ifit extras   this is simple to operate and nice to have now that we are all locked down   happy trails       
174,3.0,                       i chose this mode because it seemed to be one of the most reasonable priced in the     lb weight limit family  and it was a good name brand i felt i could trust  put it together myself  it s definitely a project and you ll need a second set of hands to help hold things in place  my first issue is how you have to bypass the ifit subscription which other reviewers have mentioned  you do that by holding down the logo button as others have said  but more so than that i m only about     and i feel like i m too tall for it  especially the handles and the screen and all of it  my second major issue is how far out the plastic comes on the top part over the track  because of this the handles don t come out far enough so you re stomping on the plastic when you try to hold onto the handles  it s a really big design flaw in my opinion  the track also is jumpy and not smooth at all  it seems to go way faster than other treadmills  the   speed is extremely slow but   is a full on brisk jog  i can t imagine what    is      
175,5.0,                       disable ifit  press   hold ifit button  should hear one beep  and console will boot up   bypass ifit sign up  if you hear some r d  type stuff  take your finger off and try again   note  assembly was pretty easy  i did it myself and took my sweet time with it  be mindful that the console support bar comes attached to the console  i almost went hulk thinking i was missing a part and the instructions make no mention of having to remove it from the console to install on the upright arms aside from the above  i love it    cardio is key to good health  noise is on par with others i ve used  i am somewhat tall with a long stride and heavy landing feet  its nothing that will drive you crazy or anger the neighbors  pressing   holding the numbered speed keys will increase in    increments   from   to       no clue why it wouldn t be    but its cool   no need for a fan on a treadmill lol thats silly  same with some fancy lcd screen  running is about zoning out and getting lost in your mind  not having a fan hit your face while watching youtube  easy to adjust   center the belt  you will need assistance to install the parts under the belt assembly  i ve owned a nordic track treadmill in the past which is why i got this one  they are built very well and assuming you arent trying to be usain bolt  should hold up    yrs easy      
176,2.0,                         things very wrong with this item    st  the price fluctuates by       week to week   if you bought it  the cheapest one with    screen  for         you got ripped off and are kicking yourself        i paid        a week later it was        today it s        i would be livid if i found out the following week that i overpaid by       nd  they make it very difficult to opt out of ifit by making it seem you can t use the treadmill until you unlock it by activating ifit which is bs   what they don t tell you is to press the ifit button for       seconds and it will disable   you have to call customer service or do research to find this little tidbit out that being said  it s a treadmill   does squeak a lot when using it   the fact that it folds up brings nothing to the table unless you plan to put it in long term storage   you re certainly not going to be moving it around after each use   weighs      pounds   assembly is not complicated but will take an hour or two      
177,5.0,                       we bought this treadmill to replace one that required service twice a year each year for   years   this treadmill has been so easy to set up and use for both myself and my husband   we don t use ifit  we just select manual workout  and get exactly what we want from it   i am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this treadmill to anyone      
178,1.0,                       as other people stated  they try to force you into the ifit scam  just hold down the ifit logo on the console for     seconds to clear the locked screen so you don t have to give your credit card info and get scammed by the manufacturer i have only used it one day so i am not able to give an honest review of the functionality and longevity but it seems good so far the assembly is not near as bad as other people stated  it probably took me an hour and i wasn t in a big hurry my only reason for the one star review is them trying to trick customers into giving their credit card info when it s absolutely not necessary  i ve seen other people complain on here how they waited hours on hold trying to either cancel the membership or find a way to use the treadmill without signing up for a membership  the fact that they try to scam you into signing up tells you something about their business practices and gives me concern regarding warranty issues that may arise  let s hope i don t need to find out      
179,3.0,                       the treadmill has    chp motor which is barely minimum for running workout  but the bluetooth is for audio only  cannot be used to synch with ipad for better streaming experience  either buy the t   s which is underpowered with    chp motor  with bluetooth ipad support  or the expensive t    which has the larger     screen but is      more expensive  there are some liars out there that give wrong answers yes  to my questions about use ipad synch with this machine  as console  there is a tablet holder but is not at eye level  you have to keep head bend down to see it  since  you cannot pair ifit on ipad to this machine  it allows you to run the video without pairing  this is the workaround i am using  i run my ipad and the   inch console program at the same time to give me a better view of the streaming scenery  i would not have made this choice  if their website information is not misleading      
180,4.0,                       purchased this treadmill about a week ago   assembling unit was a horror   for e g  before put handle rails on their are four screws that d to be removed   whoever put together parts overtightened these four screws so much that we could not undo them   lucky my exterminator was around and after working on screw for about five minutes he freed them   calling nordic track is a joke   you hold on for    minutes snd then get disconnected while speaking to someone   they don t even call you back   the unit is working good right now  hopefully it will stand up well i have been in high profile sales for over fifty years  and if i gave service the wa they do  i would have been out of business in a short period of time   h b      
181,4.0,                       i gave it a   star because i had to do a lot of adjusting of the belt to get it centered and also to get the tension between   and   inches   also the belt squeaks when i walk on it  it is quiet when running without a load the assembly was easy but it takes me time to work on bolts that are close to the ground  i have trouble with my back so it took about   separate efforts to finish the bolts  not counting the final tightening required after assembling the display panel  if i were younger i would have done the job in about    mins including understanding the instructions thanks to the reviewer who told me how to bypass the internet stuff   pressing the ifit button for    seconds did the job it will take a little time to get in shape   i have arthritic pain from walking so it will take a while for me to get a decent  workout    at the moment i am doing    minutes about  x per day folding and moving is not too hard  it is on a rug and that is where the resistance is made more difficult   if it were on a hard floor it would be a cinch the delivery guys were great  it was well worth it to pay an extra     to bring the unit down a flight of stairs      
182,1.0,defected treadmill would not recommend  do not buy   pros    the treadmill absorbs the impacts when running at    mph and does not shake the surrounding area   cons    some of the manufactured parts were defected and would not align accordingly which made assembling difficult     activating ifit   and the loophole to getting around it  courtesy of another amazon customer   after assembling your treadmill  turn on the treadmill  attach the key  then hold down the ifit logo on the treadmill for    seconds  this will skip the need to activate ifit and your treadmill should be working now     nordictrack customer service experience was not helpful     the incline decline buttons would not work upon activating the treadmill  treadmill was stuck at    incline grade upon activating the treadmill   breakdown of unpleasant experience                day     received and assembled treadmill                day     ran on the treadmill for the first    minutes with no problems at incline    and then the belt stopped moving  i figured to turn off the power and let it cool down for a couple of minutes and would attempt to run on it again  the belt would barely move and i had to drag my feet as if i was kick starting it  but the belt would just stop moving again  i continued this pattern for about    minutes and gave up                day     i attempted to run again at incline    and the first    minutes was a success until the belt stopped moving again  i attempted the same method as day   but to no prevail  so i decided to look at some reviews on amazon   common concerns with the treadmill per amazon customer reviews     the control panel needed to be replaced and ordered through nordictrack customer service which can take weeks to arrive  the control panel is a green computer hardware looking piece underneath the hood       the motor was misaligned and needed to be adjusted      the walking belt was not tensioned correctly  walking belt is the part that you actually run on    all this requires the removal of the hood of the treadmill for examination  the hood is the part your toes point to while running and is attached by   screws                  day     i removed the hood to examine the motor and it s aligned  so i decided to run on the treadmill with the hood off to see if the belt stopped moving due to an overheating motor  to my theory  the treadmill worked perfectly for    minutes straight at incline    and different running speeds  curious to see what nordictrack customer service had to say  i decided to give them a call   i explained how the treadmill belt would stop and the theory about the overheating motor to customer service and their response was for me to record the control panel the next time the belt stops moving and to call customer service back within their hours  the control panel will blink in a pattern of red green yellow orange light which then will determine the issue  so i wasn t able to confirm the reason why the belt would stop moving    minutes into my run   so i then brought up that my treadmill would not incline decline and was stuck at    grade   so customer service made me run through some diagnostics with them  i had to download an app called  visual support  which worked like facetime  customer service was able to see through my camera and walked through step by step with me and see how the treadmill was responding   the first diagnostic was to open the hood and review the cables connected to the control panel  they verified that none of the cables were damaged and that the cables were plugged in all the way   the second diagnostic was to review the red and green light that the control panel was emitting   the third diagnostic was to test the tension of the walking belt and lift the walking belt about an inch high to ensure that the belt was not tight which would create friction and not rotate  no issues there   fourth diagnostic was to slide my hand underneath the walking belt and confirmed that it has been lubricated  no issues there   the fifth diagnostic was to recalibrate my incline decline function as i was not able to get it to work upon activation  the steps were     click on  settings     then the      three buttons away from settings     then click on  incline    the treadmill will begin recalibration and start to incline to      then the treadmill is supposed to decline back to     however  my treadmill was stuck at     and would not go back to    no matter what we try  customer service examined that the control panel was flickering red and green light but not reacting to the commands   customer service was shocked and confirmed that the control panel was faulty and not reading the commands of the display board  so they placed an order for a new control panel  customer servicer stated that i will receive a confirmation email that an order for a control panel has been placed and is being processed  then i will receive a separate email that confirms that the order has been shipped  then i will need to replace the control panel myself by watching a youtube tutorial                day     the control panel order is still in processing and has yet to be shipped   i am stuck with a treadmill that is inclined at     and cannot be lifted to create extra space   i am on the verge of just contacting amazon customer service to just return this faulty treadmill 
183,3.0,                       overall  it s a decent running machine for the price  but i have three problems with it  first  one of the screws  the silver screw used with the grounding wire  they gave me was the wrong type of screw and did not go into the hole  i had to use a drill to widen the hole and only then did it go through  second  the machine shakes more than i anticipated  some reviewers said it doesn t shake at all but it does  if you want a running machine that feels rock solid  you ll have to go with a more expensive model i m afraid third  and most importantly  there are numerous bold messages that tell you that you cannot unlock or start up the machine without registering at ifit com  it s written everywhere and no where does it give you an exception  but as other reviewers have noted  you can bypass the ifit registration simply by putting in the red magnet key and holding the ifit button for    seconds  i agree with others that this is grossly misleading and may even qualify for false advertising  a major brand like nordictrack shouldn t stoop to these gimmicks  they should do better hence  my honest   star review  if i could give     stars i would      
184,5.0,                       excellent addition to my home  i m a fairly large wide structured man           lbs  and i am able to run  jog  and walk without any issues or problems on the treadmill      
185,3.0,                       not to bad to setup   i think it took me around two hours alone and taking my time   the box had one tear in it but nothing was damaged   shipped on a pallet   my only problem with shipping was they did not deliver it to the room like i paid for   i eventually dropped it on my foot getting it into place and two weeks later it is still having slight pains   amazon refunded the fees for me though   the company was pilot  so if you end up with them know they are taking covid measures seriously and won t help you out treadmill itself  its nothing fancy   the screen looks like its from the   s the speaker is garbage the floor board seems cheap  but works so far kinda loud    with airpods pros noise cancelling i still hear it the cupholders seem dysfunctional  maybe i haven t figured them out yet  but everything rattles very loudly   i have went around and given everything a retighten as well the fold up shock works nicely the quick speed settings are nice  seems to take awhile to slow down   such as     to   slow jog  or   walk  which is somewhat jolting and dangerous heart rate monitors don t seem to work wellthat s all i can think of  overall not bad  beats paying double the price to run in place     
186,3.0,                       haven t used it yet i just put it together today  but i wanted to write a review about the assembly at least  it was a pain in the ass  i spent way too long on the grounding screw  had to go to home depot and get one that actually fit and fit flush with the arm  so if you re wondering if you re doing something wrong  you re not  don t question it  just get another screw  you ll also need a ratchet set to tighten like   bolts i assembled everything myself  i m      and it was a pain but possible  once i use it i ll update this      
187,4.0,                       i ve had the treadmill      si  since april           it came a day early  pre arranged with the delivery service   which was nice  i love it  don t regret buying it  and have used it every day what i didn t know is that you need   people to assemble the treadmill  if it stated that somewhere in the specifications before i purchased  i missed it  but  it is written on the first page of the manual  which you should read before assembling  you could probably use a third person to read the instructions while the other   assemble and bicker    i consider myself pretty handy when it comes to putting stuff together but i made a few missteps  the whole thing took   hours to assemble  subtract a half an hour for the missteps  sometimes confusing instructions  and difficult screws  it s very sturdy and bigger than i expected wanted  it s very easy to fold and open but also requires   people to move it  also stated in the manual   i suggest that you assemble it where you plan to use it and don t plan on moving it too much or too far  and if you plan to put a mat under it make sure you assemble on the mat   the screen is a nice size  i got a    inch touch screen  which is big enough  no bluetooth  has an audio jack to connect other devices it came with a   free year subscription to ifit  which i like  although i think that ifit could stand some improvements  like better organization of the classes by level but it could be that i haven t learned how to fully use the app  the subscription allows you to sign up four secondary users  you can use the treadmill manually as well  but i like that when you do an ifit class the machine automatically adjusts the incline and speed to the terrain in the class update          i have no complaints about the treadmill  it s still working well and definitely worth the purchase  additionally  over the last few weeks months there have been some improvements to the ifit program  it is now bluetooth compatible and you have access to contemporary music playing in the background  you can lower or turn off the music as well as the trainer s voice during the workouts  which was always an option      
188,4.0,                       this treadmill is probably overkill for us  but we wanted to make sure that it would last as we planned to use it   it has a large screen so that it is easy to see   controlling the speed and incline is easy and can be done in two ways   it is comfortable to use and quiet while you are using it   you are also given several choices of pre pepared scenes that will give you a choice in your workout there are a few things that we are disappointed with though   this particular model does not allow you to set the time that you want for your use   it is not the end of the world  and you can clearly see the time and distance you have walked run on the screen   the heart monitor leaves a lot to be desired   perhaps we would have been better off had we bought the optional bluetooth version that goes around the body   it is still an option for us  but our watches do keep an accurate account of our heartbeat   the other thing that needs to be included is a warning that the hex key  that comes with the treadmill  has different sized ends   while trying to adjust the track  i was unable to make the adjustment   it did not appear that the hex key was matched to the adjustment screw   it occurred to me later to look at the hex key to see what was wrong  and that is when i noticed that the two ends were different  i was using the wrong end of the key   once i noticed that and used the right end  i had no problem making the proper adjustment      
189,5.0,                       i bought this norditrack treadmill and i absolutely love it   i put it together all by myself  i m a girl  and i had no problems   i did have some defective part issues but i was still able to use my treadmill while waiting for replacement parts  free of charge   norditrack customer service went above and beyond to provide me with the utmost in customer service   i also enrolled in the ifit on demand work outs  it is not necessary to purchase any packages to make your treadmill work so please don t be frustrated   i am so happy i bought this treadmill   it will be will me in use for as long as i m alive        
190,5.0,                       i am completely satisfied with my nordictrack t series treadmill  it is very substantial  making me feel perfectly comfortable walking or running   i weigh around     lbs   it was easy to assemble and easily fits in the smallest bedroom in our house  it makes a little bit more noise than i anticipated  but my family swears they can t hear a thing from other places in the house  it is extremely easy to program use  there are short sidebars for steadying if you need that  i feel like i have more than enough room and almost never use the sidebars  there are   areas  pockets  for holding your water bottle  mobile phone  or whatnot  the emergency stop feature is there if you need extra assurance in the event of stumbling or falling  i especially like the incline feature  i sometimes want to be able to raise my heart rate without having to run  so i set the incline to      for additional intensity      
191,4.0,                       much nicer than my previous treadmill  gold s gym   wide track  very powerful motor  easy to use features  can adjust speed and incline from control panel  reasons i did not give it a top score  instructions were not well written and clear  seems to squeak  raising track up and lowering seems awkward  and the main reason was the big push by nordic track to use the online trainer to the cost associated with it  if i had not read the reviews online i would not know how to bypass the online feature  also  what was point of putting a speaker in the unit if it sounds weak and terrible  drop that feature and write better instructions instead      
192,2.0,                       delivered broken and belt will not move when turned on  very disappointed   now i have to take my time to contact support for an almost      product  i will revise my review if issue is solved      
193,1.0,                       firstly  assembly is backbreaking work  i consider myself handier than the average person  solid with tools  etc  and this is not for amateurs  save yourself a terrible evening and get a different product or a professional to assemble the product after about three hours  despite many parts not fitting into eachother  poor drill jobs in steel frame pilot holes   i finally assembled the product into a usable state  only to find that it was not positioned well and was lopsided  i m an engineer so i took the frame of the base apart to diagnose the issue  the freaking factory never finished  assembling three small pieces that are absolutely integral to the product s use  a      jam nut  a      plastic bushing  and a      washer were nowhere to be found the product is unusable  i ll get parts at home depot and attempt to salvage  but i m awfully disappointed in such a poor product from an otherwise well known name lastly  you can t even use the product until they push you through a clunky series of websites  links  and apps that coax you into purchasing their ifit monthly membership  you ll be so frustrated with your product setup you ll probably do it just to get to use the product  and i imagine most people probably will i expected a lot more out of nordictrack  but i guess they ve lost their quality over the years  next time i m going to spend the extra few hundred dollars with a competitor  really kicking myself for not getting a peloton at this point  would have been worth the headache my advice is try a different brand  hope this is helpful      
194,5.0,                       we researched treadmills for weeks  then i read every negative review and almost didn t buy this treadmill  but my gut kept telling me this was the right one  it arrived securely boxed with no damage  we added expert assembly  initially thought we could do it ourselves but many of the negative reviews started with  i assembled it exactly like the instructions said  but                         so we decided to let a professional do it    it was assembled in     hours when we were quoted     hours  the delivery company and the assembly company were very professional and organized  familiar with the equipment and knew exactly what they were doing  we opted out of ifit  when you first turn it on  just press and hold the ifit button down for       seconds and it ll jump to the home screen  and have used it several times since receiving it  it s on wheels but is still pretty heavy  so we set it up behind our couch  my family can sit in the living room and watch tv or a movie with me on the treadmill behind them  it s not any noisier than treadmills at a gym  so the tv volume just needs to be bumped up a smidge  i ll edit this review if anything goes wrong  but so far so great      
195,1.0,                       the product works fine as a treadmill but i was highly disappointed that it does not connect to my mobile device  i mean this thing was over        i expected the company to make a app that connected to it and to either apple or google health apps to allow my apple watch to integrate heart rate and such nope  it only works with ifit  which is this very expensive  monthly exercise service   that s it  the bluetooth connection only connects to ifit  that is your only choice  wtf my wife bought this as a surprise  frankly  i would not have bought this  she does not do research on things like i do and i would not have bought this thing knowing that i was paying this much for something that they want to charge me      a month just to get all the automated functionality out of it don t buy this freaking product   for the money you can get ones that are not proprietary      
196,3.0,                       i ve had my treadmill for a couple weeks now  and it s not great but good enough for what i spent  the console is nice  and it comes with   free year of i fit which is pretty cool  although i doubt i will renew it because the renewal costs more than a gym membership   the features are nice  and the treadmill seems solid  here are the problems  the heart rate monitor doesn t work at all  i have an apple watch so i can live without it  but it s listed as a feature and doesn t work  i can be drenched in sweat  panting and my apple watch is registering a heart rate of      and the treadmill bounces back and forth between    and    bpm  another flaw is the area on the front of the tread is too short  if i hold onto the heart rate monitor rail my foot steps land on the cowl that covers the front of the tread  i weigh      and it seems the treadmill slows down a very small amount every time my weight comes down on it  it s definitely not as robust as the ones at the gym  but in fairness the cost is much less  it is very slow to transition between inclines  it takes nearly a minute to go from   incline to     overall i m happy with it  it s good enough to burn some calories on days when i don t feel like a trip to the gym  it s pretty quiet      
197,5.0,                       i like this treadmill a lot  it doesn t have all the bells and whistles of a treadmill in a professional gym but it doesn t cost as much either  i think for the price this treadmill is a great value  it feels solid  it has the electronic incline function  not manual   the speeds should cover most if not all home users  i run a lot and the speed settings of       are about as fast as i d run outside  i m still considering the extended warranty since sh t can happen  regardless of the extent of use and i m sure it d be expensive for parts and labor  i saw some negative reviews of the extended warranty saying that it doesn t cover the technician s trip to your home  please read the fine print  below  taken from nordictrack s site  and note that you ll be charged if you live      miles from an authorized service center overall  five starts  fits my needs and meets my high expectations for a well built  versatile treadmill service plan       service deliverables there is no deductible required to obtain service for your covered product  you will receive service on your covered product using the same type of service provided during the manufacturer s warranty as described below carry in  covered products must be delivered and picked up by you at an authorized service center during normal business hours  in the event a covered product must be shipped to a central service facility  we will pay for the return shipping cost in home  service will be performed in your home  the authorized service center may opt to remove the covered product to perform service inshop and will return the covered product upon completion  additional time and mileage charges for in home repairs outside of twenty five      contiguous land miles or the normal service radius of the authorized service center are not covered by this agreement  in the event a covered product must be shipped to a central service facility  we will pay for two way shipping to the point of repair and thereafter      
198,1.0,                       we assembled the treadmill  took several hours  and after my ifit subscription registration and treadmill machine  product  registration  i turned on the machine to get started  unfortunately  after successfully connecting to my wifi and ifit account  the treadmill immediately went to the screen  uh oh your safety key was removed and your treadmill won t work until it s put back on      problem is the safety key was on  my connections seem good  called nordictrack and after some troubleshooting she said she ll send me a new key  which is just a magnet  and i told her i don t think it s the magnet  she said there is no choice and this is the first step    well that was feb   th and i still don t have the replacement safety key     i did talk to another rep and she said that it s probably gong to be a new console but they can t send one of those out until a they send me a new key to try  and i m like that s a crazy amount of time wasted     she even said it will take weeks for the console to be replaced  so here s where i m at  a     pound machine just taking up space  fresh out of the box and assembled successfully by me and my husband  to only sit in the corner and be useless  nordictrack is messing around by  taking certain steps  towards remediation  problem is it appears they sent me a junker  i dislike having a machine malfunction upon arrival but then to have to wait weeks for a remedy  i don t like it nordictrack  i have called amazon and asked to return the machine     it is scheduled for return on feb     this machine has been nothing but a space taker     took my time upon delivery  i wrote a review of the amazon delivery  experience i had   then took up time to assemble it  it took my time to call nordic track twice  it s literally taking up space in my bedroom  it s huge box is also taking up space in my bedroom waiting to be be picked up by amazon  i will be giving up my time waiting for a delivery pick up window to get rid of the darn machine  ugh i am unhappy  a       machine that wouldn t work out of the box and the company has the slowest response  i didn t pay over       for a huge machine to just sit and take up all my time and space but not work update          new red safety key arrived  of course  the treadmill still doesn t work  i called and spoke to a super rude nordictrack rep named gabrielle who told me it would take another   weeks at minimum for them to send me a new console  i explained how that is the most extremely inconvenient and tbh awful solution  remember  this was a brand new treadmill i just bought from amazon and it ll just be collecting space and dust in my room for another month  and with no guarantee it ll even work when their solution  console  arrives  i am so upset and this has been the worst fitness purchase i ve ever made      
199,5.0,                       the treadmill itself works great   it is sturdy and much quieter than the one we had previously  the one hesitation i had buying this was the ifit trap they try and pull you into  but the recommendation on how to skip it worked for me  just hold down the ifit logo on the console and it will bypass it   once bypassed it does not return  for assembly  i was able to put it together alone just having my girlfriend hold pieces upright now and then  just make sure you have your own tools  the ones they provide you are not adequate  of particular note is that their screws are very shallow  so you may need to play around with different phillips heads before you find one that works properly on a side note i had my delivery time with amazon listed as between    pm and   pm on a saturday but woke up to repeated phone calls and text messages at      am that morning because the delivery guys were outside   i am not going to have this reflected in the product rating because it was clearly a mix up with the delivery company but i was not happy about it      
200,5.0,                       i am very pleased with my treadmill  i knew when i purchased it didn t have a lot of bells and whistles  and that s fine because i just need it to track my distance  press a button to incline  and work for running  it does everything i need it to  i assembled it by myself in a little over two hours  and the directions were very straightforward   i followed the tip about holding down the ifit sync button to move past it  i didn t even want to deal with the hassle of cancelling it in a month so i didn t bother setting it up   it s not obnoxiously loud and i can hear my music and tv over it well  i recommend this treadmill for anyone wanting the basics and an affordable treadmill      
201,5.0,                       my treadmill came undamaged and on time  it wasn t as difficult to put together as some of the reviews might have you believe  my adult son put it together in an hour   he did need help holding things a couple of times  definitely a   person operation the treadmill works just fine  it doesn t have its own fan  as others do  but no biggie  it does have an option for ifit  but holding the button down for    seconds clears it off  and you can use the treadmill without it i will update this review if any problems come up but so far  it s great  thanks      
202,1.0,                       if i could give this bike zero stars i would  i would give it negative stars if possible  from day one  we had issues with product  when we ordered the product it let us pick the date to be delivered so we picked the following saturday  apparently this company doesn t deliver on saturday  company outside of amazon  and they moved our date two weeks away  i called amazon and they told me to contact the shipping company which was awful   they changed the date on us again four more times before receiving it  once we did the box looked like it had been dropped and destroyed  not to mention the two young men who brought it in looked    and dropped it twice bringing it in from the car  we get it and it takes   hours to set up  everything works fine for a few weeks until i use the incline and it stops working  my fianc  manages to get it fixed and it works for a few more weeks until i use the incline again  now it s completely broken the screen won t turn on and nordictrack says it s no longer under warranty even though i bought it in july and it s now november  i have been a runner my whole life and was trying to train for my first marathon  i will never buy another nordictrack treadmill or exercise equipment from amazon again  this entire process was a headache and now i have a useless expensive treadmill in my house      
203,1.0,                       there is no customer support  i even purchased a         extended warranty and still have trouble getting help  i hate i even made this purchase  it turned out to be very stressful process      
204,2.0,                       now that i  have finally assembled the beast  so far it s great  it was delivered by truck  one man  the treadmill was on its side   then pushed off the truck so it landed on end  handle with care was not in this guy s vocabulary  i m    and have a bad back  i had to help him slide it onto my ground level porch  really awkward and heavy  i drug it into my living room and unpacked it  then i carried it into my family room with the help of my grandson  it was assembled fairly easy  i plugged it in  it didn t work  i registered it with nordic track  called  got help from a tech  she determined i needed a new main board  i waited eight days for the part to be delivered  i installed the board  put all back together  plugged it in and it didn t work  called again and was guided through the analysis again  by the way you need a smart phone for that  that s so they can look at what i was seeing  this tech determined it was the power cable that runs through the leg  i waited another eight days for that to arrive  again  didn t work  called again  now the tech said it had to be the upper unit that contains the tablet  he ordered that  another eight days  the next day i was getting prepared to install that  so i unplugged the two connections for the electrical wiring from the upper unit to the base  i noticed that three wires were missing that come out of the cross handle where the unit measures your pulse  i called back  talked to tech  he looked and said whoops  it s not the upper unit  it s the part where the wiring comes from the key  he cancelled the upper part and fedexed the handle  this time i only had to wait   days  i got all back together and everything worked  oh  the treadmill doesn t like my satellite internet so i now don t have ifit  other than that it works just fine      
205,1.0,                         do not buy this  this item is impossible to return even when it malfunctions or does not work as advertised  i am    lbs and the tread mill stops when stepped on in lower speeds  after    miles of use in higher speeds the motor is much louder than it should be when i attempted to return the item that is not working  the amazon selected freight company never showed  when called the stated they didn t have a route driver  the second attempt wouldn t pick it up because it wasn t returned in its packaging   not sure who has room to keep a   foot box and tons of styrofoam laying around  but if i did it wouldn t have gone back into the package that was ripped during delivery basically  the return process is designed to make you keep the item  please don t waste your money      
206,4.0,                       i ve had this for about a month and i love it  it is sturdy  but it is a heavy piece of machinery so although it folds up and down very easily it wouldn t be easy to move it out of the way  so it stays put in my apartment which kinda defeats the folding but hey  it s there if i must move it  this is my third treadmill from amazon and i m keeping this one  to be fair this one is twice the price of the other two that i have returned  so if you can afford it pay the double amount and don t deal with putting them together and then deal with disassembling and sending back  this was easy to put together but you need two people and follow the instructions step by step  i m also very greatful to the person who put in the review for not turning ifit on by depressing the button before first use  it really takes care of dealing with cancelling it later      
207,3.0,                       after having a neighbor help me move it downstairs and around two tight corners  it took me about   hours to assemble   were i to do another one  could probably do it in two hours   pretty much a one person job  though there are a few steps where an extra set of hands are useful for short periods   i m a bit unhappy that some of the fasteners were missing and one of the hand holder bolts simply would not install  not sure if the hole was stripped or the bolt made poorly    i ll make do with three of four holders since they re pretty large bolts  and i was able to scrounge up the other missing fasteners in my garage   the instructions could have been a bit clearer  but they were workable however time consuming it was to figure things out   i opted for the    screen  it s a bit small  but workable for ifit and i ve got a large tv mounted on the wall  wish i could throw the    to the big tv  but there s no hdmi port on the     as there is on some of the more expensive models    considering that i purchased this at a huge discount during a sale  i m quite pleased with it   edit        now that i ve put a few days of workouts on my treadmill  i like it even more   maybe my favorite part is the ifit google map application   i live in a hilly part of town and now can walk those hills without fear of getting run over   amazing how the incline adapts as i climb    hit a flat area    then climb again   you also get more or less a slide show as you walk  based on google maps tracking   yes  it may be dated  but there are plenty of recognizable landmarks   i ve also tried a few of the ifit routines and they re pretty good and interesting as well   i d probably opt for the individual subscription after a year since my spouse is more of an elliptical user update            loving this treadmill more and more everyday   it s a   star as far as performance goes   during the covid isolation  i enjoy that i can go for a run on easter island with a trainer  or simply devise my own routes wherever google maps exists  today  london tomorrow the rest of the world   very cool   btw  my wife doesn t use her elliptical much anymore once she got on this treadmill update           raised this to   stars   the benefits far outweigh the almost forgotten installation process   now if only it had a decline mode  but that would make it cost twice as much  so i guess i ll have to get used to running the downhills on google maps at    elevation instead of an actual decline   since this was first installed in early march  i ve dropped    pounds  obviously by incorporating exercise with better eating habits  and my resting heart rate has gone from   bpm to   bpm thus making my heart a lot happier   additionally  have reduced my     meter time by more than    seconds   this really isn t  about bragging as extolling the benefits of having this machine in my life update              i ve dropped two stars from my review   the treadmill is horribly out of calibration and has been since i received it   how would one know   in my case  i bought a garmin forerunner for outdoor workouts   lucky me  my treadmill was calibrated in a manner that i was running and working much harder than it indicated   so now when i m training for a  k with a       goal  hey  i m over    so don t laugh    i ve learned to use training methods for       outside and       on the nordic track   that s a huge difference  but it works  so its telling me that it s around    out of calibration   the big problem is that the nt website states   many recent models  including all models with touchscreen consoles  do not have the capability for the user to calibrate the speed    well  what the heck sort of lousy engineering and lousy build is that   it s difficult to get through to a csr  but when i do i expect to hear the same answer i read on their website   too bad   guess i ll have to to use my mathematical skills every time now as i reach different goals   unfortunately  they have some great races on zwift which i ll never get to credibly compete in since my treadmill is so out of whack and zwift uses the treadmill distance indicator      
208,3.0,                       not a bad treadmill   the only issue i have is the squeaking noise while walking   when the last tech service came to my house to move from one room to another   i mentioned it to him   he said add oil  i said where   where it squeaks   but this is brand new machine  had not been use because of the location   he just left without solving the issue the squeak is totally annoying  i have a question  with the new technology these days  how can you connect you phone to the machine to hear the music through the speakers without signing up for ifit   there is no ubs port but a pinhole   current smart phone use usb ports      
209,1.0,                       this treadmill is not a good choice  hard to assemble  the advertisement of free assembly by an expert seems to be a scam  they tell you your order will arrive in     days  but that only includes the assembly service and not the treadmill  if there is nothing to assemble at your address how can they assembly the treadmill  the treadmill takes about    days to arrive  my first review was denied because i didn t follow  guidelines   i have a feeling a lot for the reviews for this product ate denied making it look better than it is in reality  if this review is denied i ll just write another and another until it s posted  because i had to write this again the review went from   stars to    dishonest service and advertising for this product  do not buy on top of all that after you have it assembled you are forced to sign up for a trial session of ifit  the fitnesss workout program that comes with the treadmill  there is zero mention of this when you purchase the product  i find this highly misleading as well dishonest  shady  just not good all around      
210,1.0,                       last august  i bought a nordictrack treadmill at amazon  two months later  it stopped working  i am asking the company for help  they are not finding the solution to the issue  after two hours of waiting for the phone to talk with a representative   i asked them to exchange the machine  and they answered that they could not exchange it because i bought it from amazon  this situation is making me anxious and very upset  i am feeling disrespected as someone stilled me      
211,1.0,                       short version  pretty sure the product is decent  but couldn t even get it fully assembled  and the customer service is an absolute joke  very unprofessional and super unresponsive  hopefully your product works good and assembly goes well otherwise you re in for a rough time trying to get anything done or hearing anything productive from them long version  purchased treadmill at the end of july  began assembling it and noticed the screws on the left handrail that supports the main console could be secured properly  it had to be a defect of some sort as the screws on the right handrail had no problem  we probably could have forced it in  but we didn t want to compromise the console as that is a pretty heavy portion of the treadmill that should be properly secured  especially with all the impact coming from using the treadmill we contacted icon fitness  parent company  about the issue and they said that the spare part is on back order but they will send it as soon as they can  after a month  we checked up on the situation  and was told the replacement handrail was sent two weeks later  unfortunate part  the new handrail had multiple defects including the same problem the old handrail had  not only were the screws unable to be properly secured  but the rubber grip and the plastic cover on back end of the rail were both missing completely naturally  this wasn t ok  and we proceeded to contact them  icon fitness  again about this new part  only to be constantly told over the next several months that the part is on back order and will be sent as soon as they can  given the pandemic at the time  we chose to be patient  but eventually that patience came at an end  we had gotten the product in july       and by october      we still hadn t gotten anything and our attempts to speak with a representative were met with vague commitments and unprofessional interactions on their end  we wanted to get a refund  but they wouldn t even give us any kind of options since it was sold through amazon  even if we ve had a partially assembled treadmill for almost four months  we managed to get something sorted through amazon  thank you so much  but the whole experience regarding nordictrack and icon fitness has been a nightmare but the story doesn t end there  we had the product returned through amazon around november       just the other day  which is why i m writing this review  we actually got the new handrail delivered  at the end of january       despite receiving it in july      and returning it at the end of october       it ended up becoming more comedic after such a frustrating experience if you read it all and are still considering purchasing one  i hope you either get it professionally installed  or have a smooth installation experience  otherwise prepare yourself for a rollercoaster of a customer service experience      
212,3.0,                       overall i would give this treadmill a     out of   stars  assembly process was not bad  took about     hours to complete  instructions were pretty easy to follow  however  the incline motor for my treadmill is defective  thankfully i have a warranty but so far customer service has been mediocre at best at helping me fix it  they  said  they ordered me a new motor and scheduled a repair person to come out but that was about   months ago   a less patient person would probably be freaking out by now but im cutting them some slack with the c  virus going on right now  i paid for   years of extended warranty and honestly i don t think would recommend the extended warranty  the performance of the treadmill  aside from incline  is good  motor runs strong and it s a comfortable run  there are a lot of different runs you can go on with the ifit too which is pretty cool  if they actually do come out and fix the incline i would give this treadmill   out of   stars  minus   star for customer service   nordictrack it s the year       you guys really need to up your customer service game and make it look like you are on standby waiting to attack any problem your customer might have  currently i can tell the people you have in place are probably some teenagers reading from a manual while chewing bubblegum and watching anime      
213,5.0,                       so i ve had this treadmill for about a month now  i did so much research on treadmills and read so many reviews  the biggest issue i read was people hated the ifit that comes with the nordertrack  i can honestly say it is my favorite thing about using this treadmill  it motivates me so much more than i realized  love love love this machine      
214,5.0,                       for me the unboxing and assembly took some time  in fact i still don t have the bar underneath  the treadmill so you can fold it upright connected  first off i m only         and i was able to get the treadmill from the garage to the basement family room by myself  a don t do this at home idea  as far as the assembly it was a little more difficult compared with other complex assemblys  the parts were all there  that was nice  all you need is a wrench  and phillips screwdriver  there are very few parts  i normally have tons more screws when assembling another product  the manual is clear enough  i wish the holes in a couple of important parts were a tiny bit larger  however  i switched to my own screws and then came back and used there s  in other words it takes a lot of force for there s to go through the steel  a power drill might work better than screwdriver  i had a confusing part with the dashboard cable caught in the bolt hole area and called customer support  they took had me take a photo and she was able to determine how the cord was misplaced  excellent support help that i might not have figured out i don t see what everybody is complaing about this ifit problem  my theory is take the one month free and see what the maximum features are and if you want to eliminate the monthly charge just cancel and it runs great without ifit  the features on ifit are fun and i love the way the coachs control the incline and speed according to your exercise  you do have the ability to override the features the product is typical nordictrack quality  a very nice treadmill to run on  its big  comfortable  runs quiet  variable incline and speed measurements at      intervals  plenty of room on the sides so if you want to hop off and keep the trainer going while you rest is nice  the bluetooth connect to the ifit works great  with an ipad it works nice  you can realign the belt which i didn t need to use  i haven t tried the ipod speaker idea  there are speakers but haven t had a chance to use them  i like the display with many different features to so and emphasise in front of you  nice pulse tracker if you like  being able to just hold onto the crossbar and measure how much effort you are putting into the exercise  nice easy to read display and i have the smallest one  that is plenty large for me  again i watch the videos on my ipad which sits nicely on the display overall  i wasn t happy during the assembly  always complaing but that seems to be the norm when its a difficult assembly  once i had it together i really like this machine  its heavy  sturdy and made to last  haven t had it for long but for the price its a top of the line model and glad i didn t go with a lesser known brand  i would recommend the free one month ifit just isn t all that bad and you can bypass that idea but i didn t consider that idea      
215,1.0,                       i wish i could comment on how this treadmill actually works but after   months i still do not know  i ordered this treadmill in october       it took a month to receive the treadmill  i put it together immediately to discover it doesn t work  i contacted nordictrack that same day i put it together and they determined there is a short in the console   they ordered me a new console  however after   months i am still waiting for said console  i have contacted nordictrack numerous times to only be told it would take     weeks  however after   weeks i m still waiting  after the  th time of contacting them i finally got answers saying the part is back ordered   no one at nordictrack seems to care that i ve had an inoperable treadmill for months  i normally wouldn t write such a review but i was recently contacted by nordictrack to write a review in which they stated  we value customer feedback and are willing to send either a floor mat or maintenance kit as a thank you for posting a review  so here is my customer feedback   do yourself a favor and do not buy this treadmill or any treadmill from nordictrack unless you want terrible customer service from a company that clearly does not care about you after you have bought their product  i imagine any glowing review of nordictrack it because someone received a free good  poor business tactic      
216,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          absolutely love this treadmill not a bunch to assemble took my husband about    minutes to set up and we used it right away with no problems  the quality is exceptional  came really fast even during quarantine  happy customer  no fan but it s still a great product     
217,2.0,                       i have never written a bad review until now  bought treadmill and paid to have it assembled    weeks later it stopped working  on thanksgiving  no one was available to talk to until the following monday  off for holiday and they don t work weekends in service department   said they needed to order a part but it was on back order with no eta  continued checking back regularly and finally was told it would arrive by the end of december  it is now jan    and no part   i ve called several times over the past few weeks  sat on hold for an hour before hanging up  being disconnected  or told to call back because they were training employees and not taking calls   today  i was on hold for over an hour but finally got to talk to someone  same news as last time  part should be in within the next     weeks and then they will ship it to me  i m not holding my breath  i loved the machine for the month that it worked      
218,1.0,                       i received my treadmill about two and a half weeks ago and hired a professional technician to assemble it   it took several hours to complete the assembly   when we finally turned on the unit  a huge tear in the belt  hidden throughout the assembly process  rotated into view   i registered the product and requested service to replace the torn belt under warranty   that was two weeks ago  and the company has made no effort to contact me or correct the problem this is a brand new     lb treadmill that i ordered weeks ago and had professionally assembled   i do not want to return it and start all over again when all that is needed is a new belt   however  nordictrack is leaving me with no choice with their abysmal customer service   what a huge disappointment my advice is to stay away from this company until they improve on their commitment to customer service and to correcting issues with brand new units update        i received no response from the three online service requests i submitted to nordictrack over the course of three weeks   i finally steeled myself to an endless wait time and called their customer service number   the rep offered to send a belt but expected me to perform my own repair   for a brand new product under warranty   i m not handy  and have no interest in doing treadmill repair i arranged for a partial return with amazon  who discounted the product sufficiently to cover the new belt and technician   i sure hope this machine never breaks  because nordictrack won t provide any support amazon handled my problem very effectively      
219,1.0,                       update   in my review below  i mentioned that amazon nordictrack won t just replace the panel  they needed to replace the entire treadmill   delivery of the new treadmill arrived this morning   the drivers stated that they were delivering only and weren t picking up my  st defective treadmill and that i would have to make different arrangements with amazon for that to happen   we opened the replacement treadmill and surprise   this one also has the manufacturer s defect   the entire row of preset workouts is missing   makes me believe that nordictrack is just trying to see how many of these they can offload to unsuspecting customers without them noticing   we refused the delivery and called amazon back   this time  they offered me   options   try a  rd replacement  no thanks    return the treadmill altogether for a full refund  we considered it  or they would give us a refund of       we felt this was a fair trade   not only would it save us time and money  any loss of value if we try to re sell this in the future will hopefully be accounted for  my suggestion   it is a great machine but go buy it at your local store and make sure you have the right buttons on your panel before accepting it i ve attached photos of how the panel should appear and how the panel from amazon actually appears i ve scrolled through the customer review photos on this treadmill and see that many of the buyers have had the same issue and haven t even realized it   there is an entire  nd row of preset workouts on the top row of the panel  the row that has the ifit icon    it is missing on many of the photos here and was also missing on my panel   i called amazon and they reached out to nordictrack   it is a manufacturer s defect that they are aware of but for some reason aren t requiring a review of the equipment they have in stock   the bummer   they won t just send me the replacement panel   they have to send another entire new treadmill   amazon stated that we could just open the box and take the new part that we needed and put the defective part back   i hope so because my husband spent hours putting this together for me and i don t want him to have to do it again other than this glitch  which is hopefully easily fixable   the machine is a beast   it is solid and sturdy  substantial and very quiet  i may or may not even use the presets once i get more familiar with the machine  but for this price  i want what i paid for      
220,5.0,                       let me start by saying you can bypass the ifit registration  that is not necessary to use this treadmill   press the blue ifit button on the display and hold until it flashes and beeps  then you can use the manual or the manufacturer built in workouts i assembled  the treadmill by myself  but yes  having a second person to help hold is nice  i m sure ha ha     the instructions are super easy to follow  and the best advice i could give you is lay out all the parts and separate the packaging right from the get go  keep your work area tidy and put your tools back in one location before you start the next step  took me about   hour to do alone the treadmill is great for what i need and was looking for  it s very sturdy and is fairly quiet  i find running is actually quieter than walking   it doesn t have a lot of bells and whistles  and it allows me to control my workout a few words to the wise  when you hit stop from running or walking  it stops  like almost immediately  it doesn t have a slow down  so just be ready for that or put your legs on the sides before you hit stop   also  when you stop the workout and have the incline up  you have to push the button to lower the incline before you shut it down  do not forget to put the incline to   before folding up for storage  i also read a lot of reviews that said the customer service was terrible  so i did get the protection plan as well when i purchased and registered it with the company  i also read all the other companies had terrible customer care  so i figured it s all the same  and hope i never need to call them so if you re looking for a great quality treadmill thats simple to use for your daily run  walk  workout routine  go no further      
221,5.0,                       great treadmill for the price  i almost cancelled my order when i read the bad reviews  do not read the bad reviews they are not all correct i didn t read all but whatever i read  scared the hell of me  first of all do not assemble it yourself  i don t care how handy you are unless u assemble treadmill on a regular basis  i hired an company they did great job everything works as stated  heart monitor is exact  one of the reviews mentioned that heart rate is false it s not  i wear an apple watch and heart rate is same as what apple watch displays  yes it came with a plastic part broken during delivery but it s just cosmetic it doesn t affect the running or walking factor  bottom part and motor cover were broken but called manufacturer and they are sending the parts and schedule a tech to replace them   amazon was great to give me an extra discount because of that as long as it s safe  incline is correct i know because i belong to a gym i know how incline works  i think most of the reviews are from people who tried to assemble the machine themselves   true some said machine came with manufacturers defect but  you always can call nordictrack and get help   i love this treadmill especially my gym is closed now      
222,5.0,                       as for the treadmill  it seems well constructed  was very easy to assemble and has made my wife pretty happy   win  you can press and hold the ifit button down for approx    seconds and bypass the monthly reoccurring membership to work out if you want   thanks to whoever posted that in their review earlier as i clearly do not want to pay a monthly gym membership at home as for buying large objects like this through amazon   think it out and set your expectations  i have found amazon to be completely reliable for printer ink  woodworking hand held tools and equipment  cleaning supplies    coffee    but i have not had good luck buying larger freight shipment items  this was scheduled for delivery on july   rd and we received it on august  th  we paid for the deliver to room of choice   xpo the subcontracted delivery from amazon almost left the box on our curb but we heard the truck and went out and after a short discussion they agreed to bring it       up our driveway and roll to our back patio where i assembled it  xpo was absolutely awful  i had to call amazon to get in touch with them and they are a freight service   not a customer service type business  they could give a hoot what you think  feel  or want    they ll deliver it to you when they are darn good and ready  from the package tracker we saw that the treadmill arrived in our city on the   th of july  amazon said we needed to wait until the  th of august before they would refund or reorder and viola  on the  th of august in the afternoon it arrived  the box had significant damage  the packaging inside the box was rumbled  the upright rails were scratched and one of the side plates on the belt assembly has a cosmetic dent in it  i say all of this to help you temper your expectations  prime meant free delivery but     you might want to pay a local retailer to deliver your machine as for the treadmill as a whole  this is a very basic model which is exactly what we wanted  if you re looking for a fancy full of features and video deal you ll need to spend some more  as for us  we ll watch tv or listen to our bose sound and really just want the workout      
223,5.0,                       bought this treadmill   months ago and am surprised how often i ve been using it  it is quite heavy but was easy to set up  it takes up remarkably little room when folded up  it seems to be well made and no  you don t need ifit membership to use the machine  set up my ipad on the tray and listen to audio books or music during my run  highly recommend the treadmill      
224,5.0,                       great treadmill  especially for the price  yes  the ifit button hack is one of the main reasons this is a five star and not a three star  but w e  can t knock a company for trying to come up with extra monthly income  let s talk about the machine itself first off  definitely try to get the delivery people to deliver this as close to the room you want as possible  especially if you live alone  i didn t think      lbs was that big of a deal when i saw it in the description  but trust me   it is a chore lugging up and down stairs  thank god for delivery folk next  just putting this together can be daunting if you don t have another person  the first couple of steps are manageable by yourself  putting the handrails together  getting the wire through etc   it s annoying  but definitely simple and straightforward  however  at the end   when you are trying to get the hydraulic lift pole thingy in place by holding up the     lb machine and unscrewing then screwing in bolts   yeah  that can be a real b word if you are trying to do it yourself  i highly recommend having a friend or husband or large dog or something holding the machine up while you work it lest you have it just fall on you and kill you running on this thing has been pure joy  thanks to covid  we re all trying to avoid icky germs and being around other people  hence gyms   nono  i found this machine as good as any that i have used at most of the gyms i ve been to  though it is without some bells and whistles and it is only ever going to be as sturdy as you make it since   well  you are putting it together it s a good buy  worth the price for sure  just remember what i tell you      
225,3.0,                       first and foremost  i had quite an issue in the beginning  like many of you  my treadmill came broken  initially  i didn t mind it at all  i just called customer service and said that i don t mind keeping it but i am not willing to pay for the full amount only because it s not brand new  it s broken  they honored that and i was happy  however  as my boyfriend and i were building this thing   note i highly recommend at  least two people  we realized that there are missing pieces  so then i call amazon again  after a hour of being transferred like three times  i was able to get a brand new treadmill for the same discounted price  especially since it took hours to put this thing together like others as well  do not sign up for ifit  press the blue button for about    seconds and it ll turn on  don t get scammed into the credit card scheme  i m sure it s great and all but i don t like things being forced on me now in regards of the treadmill  it s pretty nice  granted it took forever to build  assembly directions are garbage  google or youtube it  because there s a step at the end that you need to do actually in the beginning  it s like the wire covering sliders that goes over the wires on the sides  you need to do that like in the beginning stages  youtube it you ll see what i mean  the directions are written poorly  the screws sometimes don t even fit  you ll see what im talking about  we used a hammer etc the treadmill after it was put together  it was great  i did my workout a few times  it s a bit loud but that s normal in my opinion  it s like as loud as going to the gym and using one of their treadmills   the speakers are a nice touch  ipod is a bit outdated lol  overall  without the ifit program  it still inclines up to level     speed goes up to     measures your pulse by the grip  time  calories  and distance  the important stuff  i hope this review helps ps  yes the exchange was annoying but it was worth it for me because i m not paying     something  protection plan included  for something broken  cheers      
226,1.0,                       got the product  and the plastic frame around the belt was broken  i will update my review once i receive the new one in  hopefully  new condition      
227,5.0,                       first let me start by saying the treadmill is amazing  one of the delivery guys was bringing it in and their first comment was man this is heavy you can tell this isn t a cheap one  it s incredibly sturdy and everything works as desired without unnecessary frills  i ve been on treadmills with fans before they don t do anything    the delivery guys were fast and polite now the negative which has nothing to do with amazon or the treadmill itself  but the deceptiveness and out right lies that are printed inside of the manuals and the screen when you purchased this treadmill claiming that it literally will not work if you don t activate the ifit subscription  this is not unique to just this treadmill  it is the new wave sweeping exercise equipment  they will outright claim that you have to subscribe to their subscriptions or equipment will not work and it is not true  to be honest i m really surprised this is legal  however    the    second trick does work  hold down the blue ifit button for    seconds and it will get you out of the screen telling you to activate ifit and your treadmill will immediately start working  at the end of the day i would recommend this treadmill  and hope that lawmakers stop this immoral  practice praying on people who fall for their lies      
228,5.0,                       this is an awesome treadmill  i m     pounds and i can run on it just fine  ifit  is predatory and annoying  but i knew from other reviews to override it and never give my credit card information  it works great without it   the programs and incline are great  and i haven t had any issues so far  it is a bit noisy but if you shut the door it isn t that noticeable  it is heavy to carry up the stairs  so make sure you put it where you want it to stay  some of the reviews said it was hard to lift it to fold up  but i don t think it s heavy  i m an out of shape     pound woman   it took my husband a few hours to put together  the cup holders are super huge which i love because i can fit a large mason jar of water in them  thanks      
229,5.0,                       so far i love it  it s the perfect price  some people don t want to get this because it says you have to subscribe to the ifit program  i never had to  i learned that if you hold the ifit button for about       sec it skip the whole having to sign up to it  doing that i didn t have to worry about having to call to cancel the subscription  it comes with   programs that have   different levels in each    in total  they are not all that easy i have to stop on one about    min into it because i couldn t keep up  i know i m not that in shape but i m not that out of shape either  i m           lbs and have had   kids  the hear rate monitor works  at first i thought it didn t because it would start to blink like it was going to give me my results and then it would disappear  i learned that even if it did that you have to keep your hands there and your heart rate will appear you just have to be patient the incline works great  haven t had a problem  same with the speed unless you know for a fact that you can run sprint more than    mph then you can consider getting a faster treadmill  i could barely keep up going   mph for a little bit  cup holders are great  it does have a plug for an auxiliary cable if you want to use your phone with its speakers  the side rails not sure if thats what they re called  help when i lose my balance to get back on track  it also has the emergency stop that you can clip on to yourself in case you fall it won t fit through all door frames so measure  it helps if you know what room your going to want it in so it gets assembled in that one room  it not too noisy  i don t think i ve ever used a treadmill that was dead silent before  it doesn t have a fan but even the ones that do are not even that strong  i think the treadmills that have them are just to make it feel more like your outside rather than to cool you off  just grab a fan you already have at home and done  overall i believe i made a great purchase      
230,1.0,                       after a lot of research i purchased this treadmill for my birthday  i immediately loved it  the i fit software is fantastic and i really enjoyed just being able to run or walk without having to think about adjusting my speed  it really improved my fitness  that is  until one day i was running on it and my treadmill started going crazy  the belt started moving extremely fast out of nowhere  fortunately i was able to react quickly and pull the key but i could have been terribly injured if i hadn t done so  after that each time i would turn on my treadmill it would do the same thing  to make a long story short i bought this treadmill in january of       it stopped working march       yes just   months later  and guess what  it is now september and i still do not have a working treadmill  nordictrack cannot get me the part needed even though its still under warranty  they keep blaming covid even though it has been months  i am very understanding of the issues caused by covid especially with shipping from overseas  but this is beyond ridiculous  their customer service has been terrible  meanwhile i m still paying for in i fit membership i can t use  i wish i could say this was a one off situation but if you google issues with the control board  you will be shocked to find this has happened to many people  i highly caution anyone who is considering buying this product  it is a shame because it could be such a great product if it actually worked      
231,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          manufacturing defect i was very excited to have received t series    s treadmill  however  upon assembly i observed the main frame of the treadmill is crooked and is very wiggly when on the floor and impossible to fold up because the main body  that houses the belt  gets stuck at the right arm because the frame is tilted to the right  that part came pre assembled  check the picture and the video  this is an obvious manufacturing defect nordictrack customer service the package included a big signed   please do not return to store  and it has an email address  not a phone number i sent an email with the problem  with pictures   days passed  no responsethen i visited their website and i found chat support   waiting for     min in queue  the agent responded  explain the issue again the agent said this is fixable  please don t return  but you need to register the product first i registered the product the day after received email asking me for my info to verify me  i replied with the info the day after received another email asking me to confirm all screws are in place and tighter i replied right away that screws that i was asked to install are in the right place and the highlighted again that the crooked piece came pre assembled   days passed and no response i believe nordic track customer service are testing my patience i will update this post with my experience and see if the issue is resolved or i had to contact amazon to get someone to take it back      
232,4.0,                       this is certainly a very impressive machine  and help you with many functions   i am surprised that such a powerful machine  with its strong name  takes away services  instead of adding it    the machine will not start working unless you join the ifit  including a charge card  something i don t like to give so easy   so i press the join bottom holding it for a while  and this lets you overpass their request  but they don t tell you that    most machines have an automatic coll down button  this one doesn t have it    most machines have at least    pre program exercises for    minutes each on the different levels  this doesn t have it anymore  unless you join them and pay a monthly fee overall is a good machine for basic people like me  if you expect a high level of functions  you better pay the monthly fee      
233,5.0,                       assembly was a little tricky and really takes two people   one needs to hold certain parts while the other tightens screws   however my    year old grandson was able to assemble in about    minutes   it is very sturdy and did require two people to move   it weighs over     pounds   as it is in the basement  i have no need to fold it up so i can t review that option   i like the solidness of it compared to some less expensive models   it has a bluetooth connection and can be used for live interactive  training with ifit   this is free for a month and a monthly subscription after that  i have not used this option  but it is a nice feature for some   the only complaint i have is i wish the bed was a little longer  when on incline my foot keeps hitting the motor cover and the hand rails could be longer also   in order to use the handrails  i also tend to step on the motor cover overall  it is a great  treadmill and i am very happy with it   i use it almost every day as does my husband      
234,4.0,                       i purchased this after finally realizing my days at the gym were over  i researched treadmills for weeks  finally  after asking for recommendations on social media  a friend gave this treadmill such an amazing review  i purchased this immediately after her response it arrived as scheduled  it was bigger than i thought but that s not a bad thing  i m     pounds so i wanted something secure  note  it takes two people to put this together quickly  and  it takes some muscle getting it in the house it took us a couple days putting this together because we didn t follow the instructions       once we got it together  we found a faulty wire  i called support and they have a great method to provide service  i downloaded an app and the app allowed her to see my treadmill  it was like facetime via an app  she saw the problem and sent me what was needed after getting everything together  my free ifit membership was about to expire  i sent them an email and asked for a couple weeks to try it out  without hesitation  they gave me a new    days i ve used this treadmill a lot  i really like it  it has two huge cup holders and a ledge to hold a book  tablet  or phone  i learned how to silence the beeps so it s not waking my husband up in the morning it s easy to fold and unfold pros  it does what it says  it s sturdy  it s high quality cons  it s not as quiet as i would like  it may be due to me putting it together but there is a sound of the belt when using      
235,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill about   weeks in to the gym being shut down during the pandemic  it kept me sane until the gym opened back up and now that the gym is open i still find i am using it quite a bit to jump on it in the middle of the day or when i log off at work at night to get steps in  it is very easy to use and i did not purchase the norditrack software it said you  have  to buy  i read a review on here that showed you how to bi pass it and i have had no issues  i would definitely recommend      
236,5.0,                       this is a nice solid treadmill   all pieces were securely wrapped in the box  which came undamaged   we are slow but it took about   hours to put together   time went fast   this thing is heavy  which is good when using it  but not so great for moving it around   we like it enough to deal with that though the ifit    i know you don t have to subscribe but we took them up on the free trial   we didn t have to put in a credit card number   that was optional i thought ifit was going to be glitchy and gimmicky but it s really great for keeping you company while walking and also keeping your mind off of how long you ve been on the treadmill   for walking  there are guided tours of so many places around the world and you learn so much   the treadmill automatically adjusts the incline and speed so you get to keep up with the tour guide and get a workout at the same time   it s very smooth and not choppy when changing the incline and speed to match terrain you can use this treadmill manually without ifit  but it really is worth trying out if you have some sort of tablet   we are using a  nd generation ipad and it works great the belt is longer than our old treadmill  and it is wide enough that i dont scrape the sides constantly   i feel like we got a decent bargain getting this treadmill    update   we have had this treadmill a while now and it still runs great   still loving ifit   even my husband is using it   nordic track customer service has been good too   i had to call because it was squeaking and they sent a free bottle of lubricant for it   it takes a while to get them on the phone but once you do they are very helpful   love the new treadmill      
237,4.0,                       after reading numerous reviews  i decided to take a chance on a treadmill i was not able to actually test out in person   happy so far  except for the weird stuff required for activation  signing up with ifit which i have no interest in continuing with  the good thing  is  i did not have to give ifit my credit card info  i was really amazed at the quality of the treadmill and how big it actually was  my husband put it together in about an hour  have only had this for about a week  so will add more to my review if i have more to say good or bad      
238,4.0,                       so i am giving this product   stars but only because they truly try to force ifit on people  you don t have to register the ifit to make it work or provide your credit card  simply hold down the ifit button for about    to    seconds and it will unlock the treadmill  you also only have to do this one time  nordic track doesn t advise customers of this either  so that to me sounds a very deceptive practice as far as putting it together  you do require two people as you ll need to have someone hold up the panel while being installed  the tools needed were socket wrench set  a philips screwdriver  along with the tool they provided  my    year old son put this together and without any issue  so it is not hard to put together and save yourself on the installation fee the machine works perfectly for my needs  i also paid the     to have it delivered to the floor i plan to have it installed and it is a great idea as the machine is heavy  i also purchased a mat for the treadmill to sit on to keep it from damaging the carpeting  raising and bringing down the belt for storage is very easy as well      
239,5.0,                       literally would purchase         times over  i despise running with a passion and i am now running between       miles a week which is unheard of for me  i love the recorded sessions  and i am absolutely in love with the fact that the instructor controls the incline and speed  i think over time i will go ahead and purchase the more expensive version but at this time this is absolutely perfect for my beginner intermediate  running level  i m slowly climbing the classes intensities and am beyond happy  a piece arrive broken and the customer service was prompt and sent me a new piece immediately      
240,5.0,                       it s been a couple of months since we bought this nordictrack treadmill  our overall experience has been good  my wife uses it to walk and i use it to run  it is a solid and stable structure the model we bought does not have any fancy screens or functions but it works great if you are looking for a very functional treadmill to walk or run      
241,4.0,                       my previous treadmill stopped working  it was   years old  so i decided to replace and started my search  after a few weeks  i decided on this model  this treadmill is awesome  great value  i have only had a couple days  but i am very satisfied so far   st of all  the delivery was on time  the delivery folks were awesome  they had me all setup in      minutes  secondly  i did read all the reviews before i decided to purchase  was concerned about the ifit and having to register in order for the treadmill to work  it can be bypassed without registering  there was a review on how  so no worry there  thirdly  after   days and   runs so far  i can say this treadmill feels like i am running on a treadmill at the gym  very happy with purchase  will check in again in about   month to provide an update      
242,4.0,                       after   week  overall i like this treadmill for running and walking and think it was worth the money the biggest potential issue i see is the     hp motor which is on the small side if you plan on running  time will tell how this holds up to regular light running  so far it is smooth and works flawlessly  the i fit thing is a bit of a joke  but as long as you know how to bypass when you  st plug it in  hold down the i fit button   it doesn t bother you after that  i do find it annoying that the manual does not tell you how to do that dislikes   at a slower walk  the motor does not run smoothly  it has slight jerks twice a second  it s a bit distracting and doesn t feel great  but i m getting used to it  at faster speeds i don t notice it  cannot resume your walk run after stopping for   min  it still shows the details for your recent run walk for about   min  but if you attempt to resume  it just gives an annoying quadruple beep  this is really annoying if you have to stop for a minute  you have to start over  also the backlit display stays on indefinitely unless you pull out the magnet  which is not a big deal   bluetooth capable but only works with i fit app and some heart monitors  this renders the speakers in it worthless unless you want to plug in an ancient    jack  if your device even has one   i tried this and found the speaker in my phone to be vastly better likes   number buttons allow  you to easily dial in the incline and speed without holding down the up down buttons  assembly was fairly easy  but there are a couple things that require   people  pretty stable even when running  it has a little bit of wobble when running  but for the price it s great  i run at      mph and the motor seems to handle it just fine     
243,5.0,                       love  love  love  much better than i expected   solid machine and seems like it will last it was a little challenging to put together   as some people mentioned  some of the screw holes are tight  but it nice together it s easy to fold unfold and has a mechanism to support the weight as the bed is laid down works on full speed incline and has already been a great addition to my fitness routine   definitely recommend      
244,5.0,                       my initial review here   will update after additional usage this is a solid mid range home use treadmill   as someone who has only every used professional grade ones at the gym  i was a bit afraid i d see a big step down   i don t   the treadmill does a good job maintaining consistent speeds and is rated to up to     lbs  i weight about        the track bed is amply sized for my  ft height yet folds up conveniently   nb  it is still big even when folded up   there are a bunch of preprogrammed workouts but i have no intention to ever use these nor will i pay for ifit   the controls are intuitive  but i do have a few gripes   i wish it listed pace not just speed   i wish you could see distance and time at the same time  but they alternate back and forth   i also wish the speakers were a bit louder   some have complained that the treadmill is loud  but it is no louder than any i have ever used in the gym   the acoustics of a small room might perhaps make it seem loud delivery was on time and they brought it right inside   it is heavy so make sure they do   assembly was a mix bag   scheduling and rescheduling was a pain   when they did come  the gentleman was nice and efficient but he made a few mistakes while assembling   i fixed these but how do i know there aren t more   for the discount price of     not a bad deal  but i might be really annoyed at     so far i am pleased with this purchase      
245,4.0,                       warning   if you are using this on a second floor then pay the extra cash for  nd floor delivery   i did and i m glad i did it  this thing is well packed in a wood cardboard create it s huge   delivery guys were extremely fast and professional  as for treadmill i love it  i m     and     pds it s feels solid when i run   i do sprints at  mph on it and its solid as a rock   my only complaint is the screen is really hd clear  but i wish i could use my ipad screen to watch the ifit videos on it instead  next time i ll buy the larger screen   the create your own maps feature sucks really bad  it s a joke   but the ifit training videos well make up for it   they really are something else   the only reason i dont give   stars is because i cannot use ipad to watch ifit video on it   you can stream sound to treadmill speaker for music but i have a google home speaker next to it with a bose bluetooth speaker so i have my spotify playlists    aside from me crying about that lol it is a well built fast treadmill   and because of this treadmill  and diet  my cholesterol dropped    points               
246,4.0,                       so  we ve put  one to     hours on this treadmill and like it a lot    install  we paid extra for install  it was on sale   so i couldn t be blamed for any warranty claims we might have in the future  the install did not take long  but  in the end  the installer handed me the remaining lock washers  which was   all of them  still seals against the cardboard  i asked the installer if he needed these  whether he used all of the parts required in the instructions  and he said   yes   he seemed like a nice fellow  so i guess i ll just have to trust him  nothing has come loose so far    touch screen  this thing appears to be as low budget as you can get  it s sloooow to respond to touch inputs and transitions slowly between screens  i m not sure if it s related  but animations for guided workouts run at around   fps  that might just be to save on space  not the screen  but i thought it was worth mentioning    workout  flawless  the speeds seem accurate  the buttons are easy to push for speed and elevation changes  and the failsafe magnetic dongle is very easy to knock off in case of emergency  i ve only had to do this once  when my daughter decided to climb onto the treadmill while i was running  the track stopped nearly instantaneously  i don t attach it to myself while running  but it s within easy slapping distance to swipe off and kill the mill    outlook  with the wonky touchscreen i opted to buy the   year maintenance and extended warranty  this will cover annual maintenance  probably just a check of tightness of the belt and other visual checks   however  more importantly  it will cover any issues in this period  i m hopeful that if something like the screen were to go bad  it will do so within this period i ll update this review with any issues  should we experience any      
247,3.0,                       we re happy with the treadmill overall  it s the cheapest one  by a well known brand  that can have the elevation raised and lowered without getting off the treadmill and doing it manually like a lot of people  i didn t want to be forced into buying ifit or even answering the personal questions they ask in order to get a free trial  i went to the ifit website only after i was unable to bypass ifit on the treadmill note that in order to bypass ifit on the treadmill  using the    second hold down method of the ifit button   you must have the safety key in place  i did not at first and it wasn t obvious because the treadmill powers up the first time regardless of the safety key being in place i m also happy that i put the treadmill on a rubber mat even though i have it on carpet  rust came out of the treadmill during assembly and would have potentially ruined my carpet  something to think about      
248,1.0,                       step     page    written instructions describe connecting   sets of wires m to n  and o to     but there are   set of wires  the  rd set is in the middle on console assembly and console base assembly  there is no mention of the  rd set of wires  on the phone with the icon fitness for   hours asking what to do with the extra set of wires on the console assembly and console assembly base  my husband downloaded the visual support app as recommended to assist icon in trouble shooting   patrick and his supervisor  recommend to keep going with the assembly and worry about the extra set of wires later if treadmill does not work   this is not the answer we were hoping for  icon fitness team leader savannah reached out by email and phone  she says a technician will call in      business days to tell us what the extra wires are for   we buy a treadmill from amazon with a   year extended warranty but without an expert to answer a basic question   icon said they will send a technician out to assemble for       my husband is very handy   if icon service support  knew their nordic track treadmill  product they would be able to explain this step to my husband over the phone  the written instructions are incomplete  if anyone has experienced with this problem please reach out to amazon with the solution      
249,5.0,                       loosing weight is not easy  using this nordic track foldable treadmill makes it easier  i had the amazon delivery with included assembly and i m so glad i did  the only thing i have to do is push the metal bar with my foot and down it comes into its regular position  perfect for at home use and great to get in shape while watching tv  i like that this has several options for speed and incline and even built in work out modes for high intensity interval training if you re into that  i appreciate the design and ease of use from this machine  you will not be disappointed by the price point or functionality of nordic track  you get what you pay for and i believe this treadmill has it all      
250,4.0,                       pro solid machine  gets the job done  ifit videos at least interesting  but definately not worth the giant recurring fee once trial runs out interface no longer requires ifit to start up  but will block all but the basic features as soon as trial runs out as far as i can tell leaderboard is a neat feature con tablet interface and ifit app really clunky and slowmachine takes a solid   minutes to boot up every time you turn it on in     weeks  ifit has lost     of my workouts to errors and bugs becareful of sharp edges during assembly generalsome steps really do require   people to safely assemble would be nice to be able to take existing workouts and just be able to say   do video with trainer  but add x to baseline speed  you can adjust manually  but once you do  it will no longer adjust with the trainer if you do so i had to manually set the belt  its a good thing i knew what was going on from past treadmills  since  d setup instructions didnt make mention of making sure belt doesnt walk left or right  turned mine on at  mph  and belt ran off to right almost immediately  thankfully i caught the issue before the track was damaged  hole for balancing the track wasnt exactly lined up  so took some flopping around to get the hex tool into the set screw      
251,5.0,                       i ve had this treadmill for a couple months now  and have really enjoyed it   first  don t fall into the ifit trap if you don t want need it   just hold down the ifit button at first start up  after    seconds it will proceed to normal operation and you ll never had to do that again   being       it works great for my power walking  occasional jogging needs   the deck may be a tad cramped for long legged running  but that s not my thing   operation is smooth and quiet  so far   and it easily folds up vertical to be out of the way   features are fine  decent variety of programs and settings   all in all  for the price  features and fit for my needs  it s been a great treadmill      
252,5.0,                       i love walking and this is the perfect treadmill   i have been searching for so long   i wanted something that would have an automatic incline  long and wide belt   i weigh     lbs  and needed something to hold all of me   i can do all kinds of workouts on this   i can even dance on it because there is room   i have it in my bedroom   i live in an apartment on the second floor and sometimes use it at night   i asked my neighbor if he could hear it at all and he said   no    runs nice a quiet   i actually put this together by myself   it would have been faster with another person but it is possible   easy directions to follow   i recommend this to anyone that makes excuses for not being able to exercise   you have everything you need to feel good and stay healthy all in one place      
253,5.0,                       we purchased this treadmill when the fires took hold in california in       all this telecommuting and now our exercise being taken away  we were going nuts  we saw mixed reviews  but mainly they hinged on the use of the app  we found the workaround  implemented it  and never once have been pestered about the app again  it s a fantastic treadmill for the price   note  i m     lbs  run in minimalist shoes  and at     mph on the treadmill       
254,4.0,                       i just received this treadmill yesterday  i ve only run on it once  i have some pros and cons pros it s very sturdy not super loud feels solid wile walking and running  i only got up to     mph  the display is a good size and easy to read cons  i was very disappointed when i realized that while the ad says it is totally ifit compatible  but does clearly state that you have to buy a subscription   but it is only compatible when you buy a separate module for it  i got on an online chat with ifit and they told me the module is        i won t be doing that i m also not happy with the  settings  feature  the settings are  demo on or off  and english vs  metric for distance   that s it  it seems there is no way to set your weight   so the calories burned feature is totally useless  i d also like the ability to see minutes per mile instead of miles per hour  but there seems to be no way to change that either the free scheduled shipping was a bit of a disappointment as well  it did come exactly when they said it would  but this thing is a huge box that weighs almost     lbs  there was only one delivery man on the truck and it had to come it up a full flight of stairs  i was very lucky that my husband and another man were here at the time and it took all three of them to get it up the stairs  if they hadn t been here it would have been sitting on the porch  even the paperwork that came with it said    man delivery  i will update this review later if i find any ways to improve the settings feature my overall impression is that is a very sturdy basic treadmill  if you want to simply turn it on and walk and or run and don t care about tracking anything other than your mph  distance  and time on the machine  it s fine  i paid         plus tax  free shipping  so it s not a terrible value  i will say that i feel the ad description regarding the ifit is deceptive      
255,4.0,                       this is a great quality  sturdy  treadmill  with the features we wanted  up to     incline  up to    mph  foldable   moveable  and     lbs  not as heavy as the commercial model so maybe the two of us could move it if needed  the delivery guys unloaded it in the room of our choice on our waiting floor mat  my husband  mostly  and i had it together in a couple of hours  if you are more mechanical than we are  maybe not that long for you  we deducted a star from   because of the ifit scam  thank goodness i read reviews so i found the work around for this  but shame on nordic track for doing this to their customers  as least put the over ride on the front cover  sheesh      
256,3.0,                       i ve only had the treadmill for one day and as far as the product itself and its functionality goes  it seems fine so far  the biggest issue and reason for my   star rating is that the item description on amazon was incorrect  the description incorrectly states that the speed is adjustable up to    mph  but in fact it only goes up to    mph  that may not be big deal for some but i was specifically looking for a treadmill with a max speed above    mph for those high intensity workouts  i m in the process of returning it and replacing it with a different model  nordictrack c     which costs about      more  as i said  the product itself seems pretty good but just be aware that the true max speed is    mph not    mph      
257,1.0,                       update after constantly contacting amazon customer service for more than two weeks of returning this treadmill   i finally got my refund   the customer service has been horrible in this particular c purchase of this treadmill   they keep stalling me by telling my request has been sent to the return department so i called them and that s when they refund me whole thing is garbage  i will start by the package   it came in one box that was almost impossible to move so me and   other people had to tear out the box and take the parts inside  assembly was a nightmare only because they can make more money in assembly services  i read many reviews and thought that the bypassing ifit registration would work for me as well but it didn t   in fact when i tried second time and pressed the button for    seconds the whole screen went blank  i went online to do troubleshooting   nothing worked  i chat amazon they immediately told me to contact the company   i contacted them they said contact their special department so i did  then the  special  department automated system told me no agent will attend your call unless you register  which means i have to put my credit card info  there is no way to use this treadmill without monthly subscription  i decided to return this item and so i contacted amazon but now amazon wants to specifically disassemble and put this whole treadmill back into a  box  how and where am i supposed to get a box this huge that can carry this over    lbs treadmill   i m warning everyone out there to not buy this treadmill you can get a gym membership for less than     a month      
258,1.0,                       we got delivery a couple of days ago  tried to assemble  we do not want anyone coming into our house as a precaution   parts do not fit  we called amazon  they said someone from the seller would contact us in     hour  no one called  we called amazon again and there was no record of our phone call  apparently  after about    minutes we were put in touch with the manufacturer  they will send parts but it will take     weeks  in the meantime         piece of unusable equipment is sitting in our living room  we got this so that we would use it for relaxing exercise  all we ve had so far is elevated blood pressure update  we just checked and the price went down by      since we purchased it two weeks ago  incredible      
259,1.0,                       treadmill goes up but will not go down   spent two hours with customer service   they informed me that they would send a new incline motor and after i receive it to schedule a service person to come out to replace the motor   this will be another    days to two weeks  just amazing to have to wait one month      
260,5.0,                       this treadmill is amazing for the price  we wanted to get a cheap treadmill without spending thousands  we wanted a very basic treadmill  with incline  that was narrow for our bedroom  we specifically only wanted a treadmill for walking on incline or power walking  this one gets the job done  we paid for amazon to deliver and set it up  they were in and out in under and hour  ifit offers a one month free trial  but after that ifit is not required for use of the treadmill and you could cancel ifit  i tried out ifit and it was great  but the only downside is that the treadmill does not offer decline  ifit has many walks with decline so while they talk about how nice your decline break must be  your just walking on flat surface  not a big deal  and nothing to take a star away   just don t use the ifit if you don t like it  the treadmill itself is pretty quiet  good quality  this one is better for walking or power walking  you could run  however the treadmill does tend to bounce side to side a little with heavy feet and quick movement  i would recommend a different treadmill if you re main purpose will be running  but if you want a treadmill for the same reasons as us  buy it  you won t regret it      
261,5.0,                       i had my original nordictrack for    years and was finally ready to upgrade  i used my previous one regularly  so it was worth it to buy a good one in the mid price range   i love this one   my husband and    year old son assembled it in about two hours and set up with ifit was relatively seamless   i initially figured i would just use the trainers every so often  but i am now hooked on the various training series   i just recently climbed mount kilimanjaro w  jake norton and today walk jogged up to germany s neuschwanstein castle w  casey gilbert  which was fun because i have actually been to the castle in real life    i can t imagine walking on my treadmill without the videos now   however  it s fully equipped to operate either way  i can do manual runs jogs and follow a regular track  as well as follow an ifit trainer  the belt is smooth and i love that it saves my workouts and charts my progress   i bought a portable fan  which i desperately need because i m in florida   and it gives me ample space for my phone  water bottles  etc  it s sturdy and the handrails are well situated   i actually love getting on it every morning   i ve been using it daily for over a month and so far so good      
262,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          great product  we love it  well built very sturdy  it runs very well  incline and decline is quick as well as speed change we did get the amazon guys to assemble it  donald and kenyatta  houston texas  both of this guys were great  professional and able to put the machine with no problem  they did help us move this machine inside the house  i would recommend this   guys awesome job      
263,1.0,                       i purchased in january of       i have been using it     times a week for exercises  one fine day this week it stopped working  the i fit screen would not come up   the fan   the incline works but the treadmill won t start and the screen doesn t come up  pathetic   not even   months     
264,4.0,                       arrived on time and in good shape   took two hours  two guys with experience and knowledge to put it together   did not work immediately   wanted me to do the i fit registration   called in to nordictrack    they were immediately helpful  less than   min call   simply hold the sync button down and it reverts to a traditional no frills treadmill   it is nice   it is light weight   that can be good or bad depending on size of person and how many persons will be on and off of it   i want it for only walking   was told this would do the job   i m sure it will do running but that was not my purpose   i am      i do know a little about fitness equipment and i never recommend treadmills for the bulk of your work out   it is hard on your back and your knees   sometimes weather does not allow that but down here in texas  outside is best for walking running  but weights and classes are best for our age group   seems to be a good machine   it is best suited for someone at average height            to         i think if a stabilization bar were added between the uprights  it would really make it an excellent medium machine   it is just right for the price      
265,4.0,                       i bought this treadmill about a month ago and while i was lucky that the installation wasn t too bad  i didn t have horrible problems like other people mentioned  this stuff is heavy    you will need two people  there is a step where you have to hold the belt in an upright position and attach this bit at the bottom of the machine  it s unsafe to do alone there are a few things they don t tell you you re going to need   wrenches  the instructions say an adjustable wrench  but there are a few places where an adjustable just wouldn t fit  i think i used      for those spots  phillips screwdriver  most people probably have this at home   surge suppressor  has to match their ratings  you can look on their manual for that  amazon customer services was helpful in finding one that worked i had one issue with the motor hood arriving cracked in several places  not due to any kind of shipping damage  i had to register my treadmill with nordic track but then they replaced the part   although the little connectors i had to pry off the old hood to install the new undamaged hood because they didn t send me any hardware    but it works as for use  it s quiet so far  my walking on it sounds louder than the treadmill  to me  it s easy to fold up  though i don t unless i m cleaning  i ve had it trip the breaker when i tried going directly to  mph from  mph  but i also tested it to  mph with no problems  i had nothing else plugged in and i didn t try to go past  mph  i m not in great shape  i m pushing it at  mph right now   i took off a star for the ifit stuff  it s annoying but easy to get past  just press the blue ifit button until your screen changes to show the regular display   time distance calories etc  it should say lap     if it s like mine      
266,4.0,                       the treadmill seems to be working well for my purposes   i like to jog at a relatively slow pace and add the incline   i really love the fold up down feature   it seems to be designed well and operates on a piston   as other have noted the company gives the impression that you must sign up for their program which is not true   i didn t appreciate all the warnings in the packaging but i was aware of the workaround from the amazon reviews   also  the treadmill delivered with my original order was damaged and the end shipper would not accept it   i have to thank amazon from scrambling and getting me the replacement in time for christmas      
267,1.0,                       this is a very sturdy  robust treadmill  the belt moves smoothly  with consistent speed  controls are responsive  i cannot attest to long term reliability  as i have had the product for   day only    however  should i experience any major problems  i would be very concerned with how customer service would handle them and potentially apply warranty    see notes below  amazon delivery was excellent assembly was surprisingly straightforward  i did it by myself in   hours  with some occasional help from my wife  eg  hold the console for a moment   you will need some basic tools  the assembly instructions are good  but a couple videos on youtube were helpful  the package is  heavy       lbs   so i recommend to spend the extra     for the delivery guys to place it in the room of your choice  for clarity  no heavy parts have to be moved to assemble the treadmill the user interface looks more like from the   th century    eg  ipod connection or no bluetooth connectivity    but not a big deal the built in hr monitor using handgrips is useless at best  the values jump completely randomly around in a        bpm range  in about   second intervals  for example  something like this                        all this during one minute  while consistently walking and steadily holding the grips  my true hr was about     but more importantly  this brings me to my earlier point about customer service so i called nordictrack to let them know about the heart rate monitor problem  the troubleshooting process went as follows      they told me that i should not move to get accurate readings    ironic  given that we are dealing with a treadmill    so i tried to stand on the side rails  without any movement    no effect on the erratic hr readings      my hands cannot be wet    hmm  isn t the treadmill meant for exercise      anyways  wiped off my hands  problem not solved      then the rep said that it is the light dimmer switch that is interfering with the monitor    turned off lights  no effect    the rep says it s the dimmer regardless whether lights are on or off    so i shut down the entire circuit breaker for the dimmer   lights  to no avail  after that the rep says that the hr monitor is not supposed to give accurate readings anyways  and there is nothing they can do about that  upon a warranty question i posed  they said that warranty did not apply to problems that cannot be fixed  they would not replace the console  they would not dispatch a service rep to fix the problem  if i want  i can return the unit to amazon  nordictrack is not responsible frankly  i don t really care that much about the hr monitor  the only reason i am sharing this entire customer service episode is to provide feedback on that part of nordictrack s business  what left a sour taste in my mouth was two fold  a  nordictrack tried to blame the customer for a problem they evidently knew about  and b  their absurd claim that warranty did not apply to problems that cannot be fixed  i can only hope i won t have to deal with customer service with a bigger problem bottom line  sturdy build  smooth run  out of date user interface  hr monitor useless  terrible customer service  warranty not honored  wishing good luck to anyone who encounters problems with the product and would like to apply warranty      
268,2.0,                       when i opened the box  i noticed that there were shards of black plastic everywhere  after i put the thing together  i realized that all the plastic pieces were once a part of the bottom right foot of the machine  it s not a structural piece  just a cosmetic piece that surrounds the rubber foot  i tried calling  but that was no luck  their livechat service was also not helpful  since it s not even a real person  nor does it let you connect with one  i emailed nordictrack customer support regarding the issue  and i included the part number as well as pictures  after a week or so they finally responded with some generic questions  so i answered  another week or so goes by and they respond with some more questions  that are not even relevant anymore  i respond  it has now been   months and i haven t heard back from them i also purchased the   year maintenance plan  the way that is has been going  i m pretty sure that was a waste too overall the treadmill is good  it goes to    incline and can speed up to   mph  there are minor creaks that i hear  but other than that  it s all working good update  finally got in touch with icon fitness  and they told me the warranty is voided because the treadmill is in the garage  even though i clearly mentioned to them that the damage had occurred during shipping  they were persistent in saying that since it is in the garage  it must have been damaged by the garage door or a vehicle  except that the garage is now turned into a home gym  and we do not park cars in there    if you have any issues with your equipment  do not tell them it is in the garage  move it back inside the house before you contact them and send images      
269,5.0,                       tl dr if you are looking for a affordable basic treadmill that can do moderate speed and incline this is the treadmill for you   hold down ifit button for    secs to skip activating ifit membership and use basic functions on treadmill  i ve been really happy with this treadmill  bout it a little over a month ago  it was relatively easy to assemble  i was able to assemble it myself  and i m a      female    the instructions were a bit difficult to understand but i was able to find youtube videos which were really helpful  the belt was very off to one side so i did have to adjust quite a bit in terms of working out  it s great my runs are typically       mins and i run     days a week  did   days the first couple weeks with no issues   with moderate speed and lower incline so this treadmill has been perfect for me  i like that as i make improvements to my speed and endurance i have room to increase both speed and incline  from what i can tell it uses low energy as well  have not seen a large impact to my power bill at all  to be fair i also don t keep it plugged in when not in use in terms of space it takes up very little space i have it in my living room near my patio and there is plenty of room to pass by without bumping into it  i normally keep the deck down because otherwise it feels like it cuts the room  but i like that it s easy to fold when i need to vacuum or if i want to do a circuit and need more space  deck is also cat approved i know a lot of reviews complain about the ifit registration  i did research beforehand and knew that i wouldn t need to activate the membership to use the machine  just hold down the ifit button for    secs   i can t speak about the work out programs or hr monitor because i don t use either feature  i prefer to set manual workouts and i wear a fitbit versa   when working out that tracks my hr and workout automatically for me  overall this has been a very versatile machine i m personally happy with      
270,5.0,                       using it for rehab  we like it i have been in gyms pretty much all my life back to the days of jack lalaine   this treadmill is an impressive midrange machine  no question  it s not gym strength  but for home use it appears to be an outstanding choice  couple of points  one  get the install   unless you can tap a hole  you need to get someone to put it together  delivery was very good as was the packaging  we ran into trouble on step   which involves attaching the crossbar  short story  i had to retap the holes with a       tap and buy             screws  also  the replacement grounding screw was unusable so we used the shipping screw  anyway  unless you are comfortable taping a hole get somebody to assemble it  customer service  donna  was a pleasure to work with and did what was possible with step    but we couldn t fix it without retaping the holes  search the reviews for step   for all the horror stories  this machine has all the features one would expect in a treadmill  you can get better features  larger screen  industrial strength  etc   but you have to  open the vault  for those  much was made about ifit  but i feel it s irrelevant to the machine itself  one last thing  the machine goes to    miles an hour and that s nice  but since we brought it for rehab it is more importantly to me is that it goes down to    miles an hour  nice machine we ll see if it lasts more on step    like many others  we got stuck at step     search step   in comments   the problem  i believe is that the screws do not match the tap used for the holes  for one  they are wood screws  anyway after the usual unsuccessful calls  we re tapped the holes with a       tap and brought the corresponding       by      inch machine screws  it s fixed  i do not recommend this to anyone  it s just what we did to get to step    photos attached  ps  we watched the youtube video on assembly  and wow  nothing on step     also  the grounding screw was uninstallable and we just used the original      
271,5.0,                       mom of a toddler here  this is the only way i get in a workout without spending half of the day packing driving and baby prepping for a gym trip  so far it seems very sturdy and works well  i skipped the ifit subscription because i hear its garbage  but i didn t get the treadmill for that  paid for amazon assembly  no complaints      
272,5.0,                       overall  the treadmill is great  i was able to easily skip ifit as i certainly do not need it     on board programs are more than enough for me at this stage  ih fact i currently use only the manual mode that provides me the setting flexibility i need however  i initially encountered a couple of issues    when i assembled the  treadmill  the incline motor did not function  i contacted the customer service and was pleasantly surprised   the customer service is great  it is the main reason i give   star overall  first they sent me the new motor  when i got difficulties during the motor installation then  they also sent a technician that made it to work great    the box as delivered is very heavy  so lifting the treadmill  to install it on the  st or  nd floor  requires significant efforts  the assembly itself is not very difficult and i did it myself but is still lengthy and occasionally requires a help of another  person but generally i am happy with the purchase and trying to excise on a daily basis      
273,1.0,                       this may be the most expensive piece of junk i ve ever purchased  preface that i m an engineer  so this isn t my first assembly rodeo in assembling the treadmill  there are multiple screws you have to take out before assembling it properly  some of them make sense to keep the parts together during transit  and some are just an unnecessary pain  the best part is that the user manual doesn t even list some of the extra screws  and those ones in particular  when removing  don t properly fit loved scratching the metal getting them out so that i could install the actual screws that belonged from the guidance in the manual now let s talk about the app  created my account online and then downloaded the app  tried to use the same login information on the app and it didn t work  tried sending a link to reset my password and it s been several hours with zero email  so i went online  logged in  and changed my password to the good ol          just in case for some reason i couldn t type like a normal human being  still didn t work on the app  and their helpline is only available     mst  so looks like i ll be calling during my lunch hour to figure this out  another fun finding   some of the links in the mobile view of the online website are broken piece of junk  through and through      
274,2.0,                       this review is for the nordictrack t   s we purchased in november       we have had other nordictrack products before and were happy  this time  not so much  assembly was challenging  but not so bad  no complaints on that front  really  fit and finish are pretty good  it makes some strange noises now and then  but generally it is pretty solid  and the buttons do as they should the real problems have been with ifit  this unit has an android operating system that drives the screen  and all of the basic functionality  even the ability to start walking or running  depends on this  ifit is the app they use for managing your workouts  following coaches trainers  etc  and when this works  it is very nice  i have been walking and running in portugal  morocco and costa rica so far with three different trainers  the machine automatically increases decreases its speed and incline based on what the trainer decides in his workout  so as you climb a big hill  they typically slow down your speed and of course do a big increase in the   incline  up to as much as     i think  maybe it s      not sure   and the trainers typically do a    or    session workout plan  one per day  so you can stay in shape  with each session getting progressively harder  it is nordictrack s answer to what peloton is doing where we re having real issues is with the login and user management of the ifit software  because nordictrack ifit are so worried about people using the apps without paying  you can t do much of anything without signing in  and that has been a big problem  my wife s account somehow got replaced with my son s  and we cannot get her back on the machine  and when i logged out of the system for my account  now there is no way to log back in  all it does is tell you all of the great things you can do with the software and offer to sell you an account  you can add a user  which fails if the user already exists   but there is no login button  it s really dumb programming  this has been the theme for ifit in general  they have so much content you can access but the organization is terrible and disorganized  nordictrack should have probably have chosen a different partner than ifit  unless nordictrack owns this brand company   and of course they only have live chat and telephone support monday friday      or something like that  real people tend to also work out on weekends  and that s when stuff happens and when we need help i hope they respond to this review and tell us why things will be getting better soon      
275,1.0,                       i received my treadmill a week ago saturday          two men brought it  one was holding what looked like a scanner  while to other man did all the work  when taking it off the dollie he tried to push it through the door  it caught on the top door frame  he  alone  adjusted it until he could tip it to clear the door frame  he was obviously worn out and frustrated  as so as it cleared the door he pushed it over onto the narrow side  after it slammed onto the floor he shoved it on inside  but wait    there is more    i found the directions and it calls for a special surge protector that i could find at the hardware store  i went to three  popular stores  in one i had three people trying to find one  i looked online  i could find one that meet all of the qualifications  so the box is setting in the entrance hall  the base is in place  and all the parts are setting around it still in the plastic cardboard  i did not want to put it together until i have what i need  so nobody it temped to use it the following tuesday         i submitted inquiry on the nordictrack website  i do not use a phone  so could not call   i asked if they could give me the name of a surge protector or if they sell them  thursday         i was contacted and told i could get one in a maintenance kit  that they sell and was asked for the model number  i replied the same day  today         i am still waiting and everything is still laying around so i have had this for more than a week  not only have i not been able to use it  the  return time and warranty time is passing by even though i have not been able to use  needless to say  this experience has not been a good one  i am considering just returning it and getting one elsewhere  for all i know  this one is not going work anyway since it was dropped to the floor      
276,5.0,                       i actually ordered a different treadmill from a different company but it was extremely damaged when it arrived so i ended up online searching for another one and i must say some of the reviews on this treadmill almost changed my mind on getting this one but i took the chance   all the features and the size and everything was exactly what i wanted so i ordered it and crossed my fingers it arrived in better shape then the last one and i was extremely happy to see it arrived perfectly and it s been a great machine so far   it s sturdy and very well made and i had no problem with exiting out of the ifit   i held the button down for a few seconds and the treadmill was ready for me to use with no problems   putting it together took awhile but my husband had no issues whatsoever and i was happy about that bc reading some of the reviews some have said they had to try calling nordictrack for help and were on hold for hrs and that right there almost kept me from purchasing bc if you can t easily get a hold of the company something is wrong somewhere   but while my husband was putting it together i figured i would test that theory to see if i would be left on hold forever  so i dialed customer service   put it on speaker and went about my business and i kid you not i was on hold waiting for customer service to get to my call for a whole   hrs and   mins          that is insane and unacceptable     they need to fix that issue and i pray i never have issues like many have to where i ever have to call them again and if that wasn t bad enough after purchasing the treadmill i returned to try and find a review with some helpful tips on putting it together and i wanted to show my husband so i signed on to amazon and starting looking through the reviews and my husband was like are you sure thats the same one we ordered and i said yes why   and he said didn t you notice the price drop from just   day ago    i about lost my lunch when i looked up and saw the price was      cheaper then when i had ordered it the day before      i have shopped on this site for years and have never seen that happen    i was instantly sick to my stomach          is a huge difference   my husband was shocked too but he assured me if i contacted amazon they would more than likely refund the difference since we just bought the damn thing and i was thinking he was right bc i know walmart and other stores do exactly that    so i contacted amazon and was told they no longer do that   so ya i was out an extra      for a treadmill i could have waited just hrs later to order and would have gotten it way cheaper    i frankly think that d pretty sickening but the fact the machine is everything i was looking for and has given me zero issues i will be happy with that but i might shop around a lot more next time before ordering from amazon again   they are a billion dollar company         shouldnt be anything to them but their greed has gotten the best of them       
277,5.0,                       so far so great   this treadmill is wonderful   quiet  easy to operate  it does exactly what i need it for delivery was great  they texted for a delivery window and were on time   the folks delivering it were super nice and helpful  there was some minor box damage which was noted on the tracking information  but there was no damage to the machine at all   all the pieces required for assembly were there   the assembly instructions were very clear and the diagrams were spot on one note on assembly   i m a    year old female       and weigh about     lbs   this was difficult for me to put together because i didn t have the upper body strength to hold position lift several of the pieces   it definitely is a   person job at some points   if it weren t for the current pandemic  i would have gladly paid for assembly   as it was i did get it done  but it took me several days because of my own strength limitations   it was my issue  not nordictrack s fault by any means   i look at it like i got a bonus workout just from putting it together   loli did not sign up for ifit   i held the button down to bypass it as described in the top comment   worked like a charm   i may sign up for ifit later  but i want to choose to do it  not  have  to do it just to try out the machine the treadmill s display works great  the interface works perfectly and is easy to use   i did have to set it to  english  as opposed to  metric   that was the only change i had to make i purchased a mat to go under it so i wouldn t risk damaging the floors overall this is a fantastic treadmill and i m looking forward to getting into better shape with it      
278,1.0,                       so i bought this a year ago  it was tough putting together  but not too bad  i used it for a few months  then an injury kept me from using it for a couple of months  then the pandemic hit  and we had to stay home  my inquiry felt a bit better so i was hoping to use the treadmill again  wouldn t start i was still under the   year warranty  plus i purchased a   year warranty  i contacted their support  automatic reply  no person ever contacted me  though  i tried a few more times  absolutely nothing  what did i pay for  so  i turned to twitter  the person in charge of their twitter responded and tried helping me  it s sad how am seo person or more reliable for support than a customer support representative   eventually i had to call in with a number the seo person helped me with  and i talked to a real person  after discussing the issue and doing video of the treadmill  she sent me a new part for it  it took a long time to ship  and when i got it i had to suddenly be my own treadmill technician and take apart the whole thing the part didn t work  same as the old part i contacted her again and she sent me a different part that took about a month to ship  at this point it s now late july or early august  seeing how bad the last experience was  and how hard it was  i procrastinated for a few weeks until i finally got it done guess what  part doesn t work contacted her again  and she says  i am not sure on other solutions  i would call back in so that we can see what is going on with the machine  it s literally the same thing  as before  but fine  i ll call  i ask her where to call    no response so i m here  with a broken treadmill  and a   year warranty    with no way to use it  i can t exactly get a refund  either    no one coming to fix it  or correctly figure out what is wrong      
279,1.0,                       don t buy this  if it didn t cost more than     of the treadmill s price to return it  between shipping   restocking fees   etc   i would have sent it back already if your wifi is down  or if it has poor access  this treadmill will not work  at all  as in  you won t be able to just start a simple run  i d understand if the ifit features were disabled without internet  but the fact that the treadmill itself can t do the most basic task of letting you run is just ridiculous to me  i asked their support why this strange limitation existed  and was told  that is the way the machine is designed  you will need a wifi connection to use both the manual workout feature and the ifit content with your machine  the second reason i wouldn t recommend it is a smaller  but still persistently annoying issue  you can t turn off  warmups   so any time you do start a workout  it s just a bunch of extra and unnecessary taps to end the warmup early and reset your speed and the last reason i wouldn t recommend this treadmill is the belt motor dynamic  it s adjustable  but the  fine point  is very narrow and you re likely to either end up with the belt slipping regularly or with the motor straining under an overly tightened belt now  there are some good things about this treadmill  and i do want this review to be honest and complete   the fan is a great addition  on warm days  it s a lifesaver   if you re putting this on a perfectly level floor  it s surprisingly quiet and stable  if your floor is not perfectly flat and level  do not get this treadmill   it doesn t have any leveling features  and we used a bunch of shims and cardboard to fill in the gaps   it folds up nicely when not in use to reduce the footprint   it s reasonably simple to put together  but the parts are somewhat poorly machined so don t be surprised if you end up with some gaps all in all  this could have been a great treadmill  but the issues i listed at the beginning are just too much  don t buy this      
280,5.0,                       covid has changed my life   i now work from home and am no longer teaching water aerobics or doing pilates   i went from a fairly active lifestyle to sitting and not getting out   my body has paid the price   i finally purchased this great treadmill to get me going again and i love it     i just wish i had purchased it sooner    i felt better after the first use and continue to feel even better as i continue to use it   i m very grateful i was able to purchase this treadmill as so many in local stores were out of stock   many other people doing the same as me   i felt like the price was reasonable  too  for such a high quality treadmill   paid       tax included    i did a lot of research before purchasing and i m glad i ordered the nordictrack t series    s   i didn t need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive models   i just turn on my music or catch up on programs i like to watch and i m good to go   i love that it folds up   down easily  too   it is a cold wet day outside  but no worry  i ll just hope on my treadmill inside and get a great workout    thank you        
281,4.0,                       i ve had this for a little over a month now   i use it at least   days out of the week  usually jogging     miles a day   i m a fairly big guy at    lb      and i haven t had a problem at all with the machine not performing as expected   it does get a little shaky at speeds above   but a mat under the treadmill helped out a lot with that   the heart rate sensors are complete garbage as they do not give an accurate reading  nor are they in a position where a person as tall as i am can grab hold of them while walking without stepping off the front end of the treadmill belt   so in summary  if you want a machine that can keep up mechanically and do what it s supposed to do to help you get fit  it ll do the job   if you want frilly stuff like a big screen  flashy buttons and that sort of thing  you need to buck up and pay more for another model   and finally  just like all the other reviews will tell you  it sucks that they try to make you think you must have a subscription to the ifit service to use the machine   that is a flat out lie   dam them for such deviousness      
282,4.0,                       love the options  had to have at least a    inch screen and be sure to sign up for a year of ifit training because it motivates you to stay on track every day with so many variations and workout with different trainers   it is heavy and  fed ex left it at the door   they are supposed to place the machine where you want it but we didn t know it had been delivered   amazon made it right and we hired a couple strong teens to move it   then the installer came and it took him a couple hours   i could not imagine trying to put this together so spend the money for assembly   totally worth it   i have been using the treadmill every day for   weeks and feel stronger with more endurance already      
283,4.0,                       this treadmill seems to perform as advertised  packaged it weighs over     lbs  and is not easy to move  though once you have it assembled  it can be moved more easily  getting it upstairs would be another story altogether  assembly is straightforward but does go easier with two people at some stages  my wife was hiding out at that point   all parts were included  as well as an allen wrench  the so called  user s manual  is not   it is basically an assembly guide  there is very little info about how to use this device  which would be really useful  previous reviewers are correct   you can bypass the ifit stuff by simply holding down the ifit icon for about    seconds and it will start right up  only challenge is there is no guidance as to what the various programs will do  be careful here   the belt will move very fast at any speed above     you must be ready to run or be tossed off  just exercise caution  i have spent several days exploring the various programs and there are a nice variety for interval training  which my doctor recommended  the machine is acceptably quiet  i bought an extended warranty as i plan to keep this think for a good while  overall  i think i made a good purchase here  as i have decided i will not be going back to the gym anytime soon  together with a teeter cross trainer  i can get most of the benefits that the y offered      
284,5.0,                       i am writing this review after having the nordictrack for       months and can say   as of today  that i thoroughly enjoy it and it accomplished for me what i wanted it to  which was to lower my a c  i have been a type   diabetic for about   years  but by watching what i eat and exercising have kept my a c mainly below      i have never taken any medication for my diabetes and am very thin  but   months ago my a c jumped to      most likely because i d been cheating with food and exercising less  especially through the winter  i immediately bought this treadmill instead of turning to drugs and now after       months of daily use  my a c has dropped to      my doctor says i don t need drugs unless it stays above   so i m very satisfied that this has worked for me  it does help if you like walking to begin with   but now there is no worry about bad weather and i use it after almost every meal  music for me is the key to enjoying it and not becoming bored  i do   to   hours a day total  i do not use any of the preset programs but set and vary the speed and incline myself as i walk  i find it to be fairly quiet and can t hear it at all with earbuds in  it can be assembled by yourself if you use something like a short step ladder as a stand in for someone holding a section up  assembly was not easy but once together it works great and i hope it lasts many years      
285,1.0,                       beware  in order to get the treadmill to run  you have to register with ifit and then give them your cc information for a free trial after which you will be charged a monthly fee of     one reviewer wrote that you can actually activate the machine without registering  unfortunately  i didn t read his review until after i gave my credit card information and registered forcing buyers to buy another product in order for the product they ve already purchased merits a one star review  i will never use ifit and i will cancel my subscription asap because of these unethical practices the treadmill itself seems solid  installation wasn t the easiest  but the instructions were decent and the parts were well organized      
286,5.0,                       i bought this tread to use with the peloton app and it works perfectly   i ve used it for a power walk  a run and   tread boot camps   the      shortcuts work very well to adjust to each of the instructors ques   if you hit   numbers consecutively  it will jump to that tenth of a mph   for example  if you hit   and then    it will jump to     mph speed   also  there are arrows to adjust the speed and incline up and down   the ipad holder is perfect and a standard ipad doesn t block the    lcd screen   the tread is sturdy and long enough for most strides   when setting it up  be sure to attach the red emergency stop magnet   also  hold on ifit button for    seconds to bypass paying for ifit      
287,1.0,                       the product  t   si  could be a great treadmill  but they neutered it with ifit   after about   months  it won t allow me to continue using without registering  perhaps its a software update  the ifit app had previously allowed you to use it in manual mode if i clicked on all the small text links to run it manually in ifit   now a new screen pops up and it seems i have to register an account  and have wi fi based internet    maybe after registering with ifit i can get manual mode back  but i shouldn t have to   all the technology is there for a great machine  but i do not want to make an account or pay for ifit and i shouldn t have to   they should just be honest  say that the company making the treadmill is also the company making the ifit system  and advertise that an account with or without  a subscription is required for the features you would expect perhaps i have missed something  but they took a good basic touch activated system and stripped all options to funnel you into using ifit   maybe the software will be changed to do this  but i doubt it update   i realized that when i started it a      am  i had mistakenly hit the larger  log in  button when i was trying to press the smaller   point font that says  continue without signing in    at the log in screen there was no back button   i had to enter the android operating system and force the app to stop   when i restarted the app i was able to operate the treadmill using ifit in manual mode   this only worked because i had earlier learned how to access the operating system      
288,4.0,                       pros   works  can walk  jog  incline  and run  nice water bottle holders  keeps track of time  possibly distance  and maybe calories   for the price and brand  very satisfied   if the treadmill last    years with belt maintenance and lubrication  will have no complaints   nordictrack sells a lubrication kit separately cons   needed    people  meaning   the rock johnsons to build  took   people to build  a challenge to build  took time and effort  it has been a month so far and every week have had to adjust treadmill belt right or left  easy to fix but then it moves the other way  folding is very heavy and wonder if mechanism is safe  nordictrack customer service referred me to you tube videos on other treadmills to do routine maintenance  but manual is vague and states not to use silicone to lubricate not important   oversized console feel like i am at worf s station on next generation  heartrate monitors only work      times  speakers are basic but work  do not need to fold  nice if needed to move it though      
289,5.0,                       i was hesitant with the mixed reviews on reliability and some being broken upon arrival  but we have had great luck so far  it was delivered on time and was easy to set up and everything works great so far  we purchased the    s so it doesn t have a large screen but very easily syncs  a push button  with the ifit app on our ipads  which have large excellent screens  which play awesome videos and control our speed and incline   it also has a perfect little holder for the ipad  we have really enjoyed this machine and hope it is durable and lasts us a while  we are loving ifit and all of the videos  they have so many from walking tours of places around the world to   k running training series  we actually both look forward to running on the treadmill      
290,1.0,                       does not work properly and it is all but impossible to get technical assistance from nordic track the treadmill works nice  love the easy lift and soft close feature for lowering  the problem is the incline does not work  i went thru the calibration steps and it does not even calibrate  called the tech support line and was on hold for    minutes and then the call was disconnected be anyone answered  then tried online chat  they could not help me with this type of issue  refer me to another website that only offers to sell you replacement part  what  it is brand new and never been used and you already pushing replacement parts    well as you can tell this one was not a good experience for me     after   weeks  we actually spoke with a person today   however  we were on hold    minutes to get to that person   she pushed us through several hoops  including an app that allowed her to see what we were doing on our end   she then determined that it probably could not be resolved and placed us on hold   after an additional    minute the called was terminated from her end   i guess this is going to have to go back   very disappointed and frustrated      
291,1.0,                       this treadmill has never worked correctly   from day   the incline function did not work   i contacted amazon who passed me to the companies customer service  icon    they were great on the first phone call to try and diagnose the problem   then they started shipping parts   not much substance just a package in the mail with a motherboard or a cord to replace with hard to understand instructions   i had someone to email back if it did t work and when i did that i randomly received a part a few days later   i have changed out almost every part and still   nothing   it does not work   this is a very very expensive lemon at this point   i just called amazon again to assist and they are trying to get the company to help  but they will not do anything as it is outside of the return window bottom line   buyer beware here   i wouldn t buy this treadmill again also  read up on ifit   it basically requires a subscription to work   that should have been disclosed   it isn t free   it is one of those monthly subscription services   there is a work around  but it is not straightforward      
292,1.0,                       from the day we received and assembled our treadmill the incline setting did not work   we immediately submitted a support request online and went back and forth over several months with support until they requested info to have a service technician come out   ever since then all communication has ceased even after repeated requests for updates   why would support be so responsive until it s time for a service request to come onsite a few months in the motor started making a squeaking sound and has been getting progressively louder   we submitted another support ticket  and after going back and forth a couple of times gathering issue details their support disappeared again and stopped responding even after repeated requests for updates so here we are stuck with a    lb faulty treadmill with a broken incline and a gradually failing motor  and two support tickets  one of which is almost   months old and support has gone silent until they get their support act together i would recommend steering clear of this brand      
293,4.0,                       so lets start with the bad  the assembly  getting the packaging off alone kind of sucked  it took forever and getting the deck out of the box was hard  i had no problems with damage from shipping though so for that i am happy to deal with the unpacking   i did assemble this beast myself  it would have been a piece of cake if the majority of my assembly time wasn t spent fighting improperly pre drilled holes  the grounding screw was a nightmare  i tried and tried but couldn t get it to find any threads  i think it was overly powdered coated  i finally forced it through with an assist by the place holder screw  which i could barely get out to begin with   then on the other side one of the   bolts on the base would not go through  the o was shaped like a d so no amount of force was going to make that work  anyway  after all my frustration and struggle to assemble it started right up and runs like a dream  it is wide and comfy  very stable  it is more like a machine i would use in the gym than other home treadmills i have tried  i think the heart rate monitor is way off though  it was         bpm s away in both directions from what my apple watch said each time i check but i don t really need it so i don t really care  i had no trouble bypassing ifit at all  thanks for the tip to hold down the button for    seconds  it cleared the ifit stuff and it didn t come back even after unplugging the machine for a while edited to add photo of the grounding screw that wouldn t fit  it just kept spining and collecting shards of metal  i did eventually get it in there by pushing the place holder screw through first but it took a lot of work and fustration      
294,4.0,                       the delivery was near perfect  the dudes should have had masks on  but it was on time  well communicated through the chat feature in the app it s a lot to put together and you need a pal  but it is totally doable  some screws and bolts need a lot of elbow grease  but it comes together solidly   it was well packaged and not a scratch or scrape   i think maybe they ve improved the packaging since so many were received damaged holding down the ifit button bypassed that nonsense just fine   we use it every day and it is an excellent value for us   we are shocked by how quiet it is      
295,4.0,                       excited about the treadmill at first   i had paid an experience service to put the treadmill together for me   i am so glad i did as it took this couple exactly   hour to put it together and this what they do  so i am sure if i would have done it myself  it would have took longer   paying     was well worth it   the next step  is where it went down hill   in order to activate your product  warranty   you have to take a picture in order to photo register within    days to extend your warranty by    days  my treadmill had the wrong serial number as it kept saying i had a different treadmill then the one that i had purchased   trying to get ahold of customer service at nordic track is a joke   nobody picks up the phone  if you email them  they do not respond   maybe that is their intention   to get you all worked up so you will get on the treadmill to run all your frustrations out   i have no issues with the machine at all   you can manually do your own work out or you can use the programs designed by the trainers  the programs are fun with different courses so you do not get bored   the product itself is made well and sturdy   i love my treadmill and would recommend this product   i just hope you never have to call nordictrack because you will be disappointed      
296,1.0,                       no owners guide  inside the box or anywhere  tried calling nordic track but  their  recording i must  register the treadmill first on their website did that and no one called or  respond to my requests   and after    days of waiting i called them and i was put on hold for    minuets to no  solution to my problem     i think nordic track is one of the worst company to do deal with      
297,4.0,                       i did my homework like i do before all my larger purchases and i was skeptical at first with this treadmill  not because of the name  but because it has ifit built in  many if not most treadmills do today  the problem is out of the box after assembly it tells you an online registration is required before it will even turn on  this is a ploy to get you to sign up for the ifit program at     month so you can use the online features of running to scenery or to work along with others  hey all i wanted was a treadmill  not a subscription to a service i didn t want  well it takes a solid   hours to setup unless you re a pro installer and you will swear a few times  holes don t line up  screws won t go in and you ll struggle a bit but unless you pay the     setup fee expect that  mind you this thing is heavy     lbs in the box so you ll need help  got mine set up and works like a charm  now  the jewel of this review  how to unlock the treadmill without registering  after setup install the red key on the console  then power it up  after you see the  registration required before use  on the screen  hold down the ifit button for       seconds  it will then unlock your machine forever  i also like this treadmill because it has a    lb capacity and with most treadmills having a    lb limit this one suited me best  it s solid and has a good warranty on the motor and parts  and nordictrack must get a kickback from ifit because i hear even installers won t tell you how to unlock the machine without registration and it s certainly not in the manual  they must make millions off ifit so of course they won t tell you how to disable it      
298,5.0,                       been using it for about a few months now  so far so good  its delivered with motor and belt assembled already  you only have the handrails  console and hydraulic latch to put together  it s sturdy and no louder than any other treadmill  you can t find a nortictrack for this price  only problem i found so far is the quality of the speakers  which are not that loud and the sound quality is not that great  but other than that  this treadmill it s a good buy  one person can assemble this on their own  it will take a few hours and you will need a stool or chair to hold treadmill up while you install the hydraulic latch to make your job easier  oh and once installed  hold the ifit button for   sec to skip the whole activation process      
299,5.0,                       i purchased the nordictrack ntl      t     s treadmill for       so far very pleased with it  but there are a few issues to be aware of when ordering and setting it up i had it delivered to work and used a dolly  a medium size suv  and then carried it in pieces with my son to an upstairs room where it was set up  the box is about    x   x    and weighs     lb   not light for two people to move  even in pieces  the largest  main unit is well over     lb and requires a strap  not included  to keep the folding base from opening  to carry  the set up instructions are sufficient but not ikea level of hand holding  also  in addition to the tools listed on the instruction manual  it is useful to have a       socket wrench  and based on other reviews and my experience  you will likely need to open up a hole with a        drill bit  which usually requires a drill with the larger       chuck  i used a drill press i am very impressed with the engineering of this machine  it was designed to be at the upper weight limit of what can be handled in a home  took me about an hour to assemble  but most of the time spent was reading the instructions ahead to understand how it all comes together and drilling out that one undersized hole  i give an a to the engineering and value  c to manufacturing because it is unforgivable to have an important structural bolt hole too small  b  to the assembly instructions and f to some genius business executive who decided to plaster all over the box and the manual that it cannot be turned on before activating ifit   with your credit card of course      ignore all those warnings     as many other reviewers have pointed out  after it is assembled and powered  you just have to hold down the blue ifit logo on the panel for about    sec to get past the initial registration block  our unit is quiet and so far works great      
300,5.0,                       i bought this to work out  mostly walk at home  the quality is excellent and very sturdy  it did take   people to drag it in pieces up the stairs to the room it was going into  take everything out of the box and transport in pieces  the track is very heavy but easier that way  once together  it was easy to set up and run  i like the larger screen and would not want smaller  everything works great  but the hand heart rate sensor is poor at best  it only works on the right hand  and is never close to accurate  so i ordered the ifit chest strap heart monitor  that works excellent and usually in the first minute of a workout it is recognized and giving your heart rate  the machine is fairly quiet  though the fan if you use it is a little loud  i love the ifit and its worth every penny  and the first year is free  i am           lbs and this takes everything i can throw at it  i wanted to walk  but i m now running intervals and working up to a half hour of running with the help of an ifit workout trainer  i am very happy with this  i did purchase a   year service because i m putting in about    min a day     days a week  so things will wear out  all in all  excellent machine for the price and quality      
301,4.0,                       after searching for a good price point on a treadmill  on amazon prime day  july            i finally pulled the trigger and purchased a nordictrack    si  which i had delivered to my home  i m an older guy who works in an office and previously could never seem to get enough cardio  though i ve heard stories about how the average treadmill becomes a coat hanger after six months  i was determined to never let this happen to me  i looked at several pre owned units that were for sale on various classified ad websites and also a number of new units on the major reseller websites  after carefully considering all the collective info  i eventually decided on the nordictrack    si as the best value for the money to meet my goals deliverythe unit was delivered on time and no parts were missing upon receipt  i m super glad i had the unit delivered because there is a small set of cement steps leading to the entrance to my home and the shipping carton was very long     feet  and extremely heavy  two large men took a fairly long time to negotiate the cement steps doorway area into my home and were greatly relieved to finally be able to set the unit down once inside my home assemblythough i m fairly mechanically inclined  it took   hours with only a few breaks  far longer than expected  from the time i slit open the carton to the time i tightened the last bolt on the treadmill for use with only a few breaks  so plan your full saturday or sunday accordingly  the project wasn t technically difficult  and instructions were clear just a significant number of time consuming steps involved in the assembly process  also  there s a point toward the end of assembly in which you will definitely require a second person to assist for a few minutes  no human can simultaneously bear the weight of the entire treadmill deck  belt area  while tightening the underneath bolts that are attached to the frame  unless  of course  your arms happen to be five feet long and you can also bench press     lbs  trust me  i tried to accomplish this alone for a long time beyond what i can describe and still failed workoutthe next day  though i was still pretty sore from assembling the treadmill  i changed my routine to include getting up   hour earlier for my treadmill workout  bio break  two glasses of water w a handful of raw spinach  then force myself onto the treadmill regardless if i m tired sick lazy  as part of this  i also made a stalwart commitment to never miss a treadmill day no matter what  for the first couple months  my treadmill routine strictly comprised  manual  mode in which i manually shifted between treadmill speed   with the incline feature on level    then to speed   w no incline  then to speed     w no incline  and repeat this cycle for    minutes  after a while  my body adjusted to running on the treadmill five times p week  and i started to mix it up twice a week or so with the available on demand workouts to prevent boredom  these modules are interesting to watch and run the gamut from fairly easy novice to insanely challenging expert level  though i also purchased the upgrade for a personal trainer package  i have not yet tapped this function to date  since i m still not ready for that high intensity level of cardio  suspect some of these pro trainers must be t     model cyborgs   astonishingly  between following mark wahlberg s diet  older ripped guy  right     along with a very light weight training push ups sit ups regimen  i m actually starting to get ripped despite in my ever multiplying     years   doesn t matter if it s raining or     degrees outside  every day i get my cardio  never thought i d see my abs again  but right now i can probably squeeze out a four pack  i m convinced the treadmill is the key to this  since nothing else has really changed in my routine  save for the treadmill portion treadmill operationoverall  the nordictrack    si is a great little unit and i m super happy with the investment  precise and well crafted  the unit smoothly folds upright to reduce the footprint in my living space  the console immediately synced with my home wifi  graphics audio on the    inch monitor are crystal clear  however  the console s operating controls must have been designed by a millennial or someone else with       vision  because i can t see the   point font displayed in white on the control buttons without reading glasses  which i don t like to wear when i m running on a treadmill  moreover  the issue is exacerbated by tiny control buttons that are way too small on the touch screen  it s like trying to hit a tiny moving target while running  inevitably  i ll hit the wrong speed or incline button  which is a distraction from my workout  it would be great if some day nordictrack can add a voice activation function  so users don t have to push buttons whatsoever while working out the on demand modules are interesting  and the aesthetics are breathtaking  sometimes  it kind of takes the sting out of a challenging run  since the vibe feels like you re running next to a pro trainer on a beach or through the woods in some exotic location  there are countless varieties workouts levels to choose from  that said  i wish there were a few in which the trainers didn t speak at all  most of them won t stop yacking  which is disruptive when i m trying to get my head in the zone  also  it could just be me  but i was unable to find a headphone jack or any way whatsoever to sync my sony xm wireless headphones to the treadmill  the only option i could find was to play audio or my own music through the treadmill s built in speaker system  this is not a plausible option for me  since i m not confident other people in my home would like to listen to slipknot or the equivalent cranked for a     hour every morning  as a work around i usually listed to music on my iphone with headphones and turn the sound off on the on demand modules the motor belt have worked perfectly with plenty of power under constant change  however  the console software frequently gets  hung up  while updating and i have to reboot at least once a week  in fact  a couple weeks ago i had to perform a  hard reset   which was a hassle because it seriously delayed my only window to work out in the morning and killed my routine overall  i couldn t be happier with the nordictrack    si  for me  selecting a treadmill was a big investment decision  which  fortunately  turned out to be the right one      
302,1.0,                       i wish i could rate this machine but i have been unable to use it at all  i received the machine on december       the box was a little beat up but i decided to inspect it further before sending it back  i did not see any further immediate evidence of damage from shipping  i began to assemble the machine until i got to assembling the heart beat monitor cross bracket  the bracket was bent on one side  not due to shipping but rather a factory defect  it would not fit on the machine  no problem  i got an extended warranty from nordictrack  i sent them a picture and asked for a replacement  i was contacted that day and the replacement part was ordered  it is now february         and i have not received the part  i called customer service and inquired about three weeks ago and was told the part was on back order  the tracking number they gave me just says   in progress  as the order status  they told me that the part was going to get to the factory on february  nd  i am not inflexible and can understand that the part is on back order and i just have to wait  today  february          i still cannot use the machine because i have not received the replacement part to make the machine operable  the tracking status still says  in progress   i am beyond frustrated at this point  if i have a customer that has been waiting for over a month for a replacement part i would make sure to expedite that order because that is unacceptable under any metric  i wish i was hopeful to receive the part before spring but i am not  i am going to give them the benefit of a couple more weeks and then try to send the machine back to amazon      
303,5.0,                       picked this up due to covid gym closures in my area  it s a nice basic model with everything i wanted  minus the fan  but no biggie  i have a standing one near by  assembly was easy  and i was able to put it together in about   hour max  instructions suggests   people to assemble  but i was able to do it myself taking extra caution when needed  when attaching the folding spring under the unit  i used a chair to prop it up as i saw someone in another review  it worked great the treadmill is super heavy  so if you re moving it upstairs  you ll def need two people  it s pretty sturdy  though not as solid as a commercial treadmill i don t care for the ifit programs and was able to set this up and bypass the sign up prompt by pressing the ifit button for    seconds  as mentioned in other reviews   contrary to the unit saying it s locked and can only be started by using the ifit program  you can get around it with no problem it has nice size cup holders that can hold   lb  dumbbells  i use these intermittently when i power walk   and it has a good size ledge that can hold a iphone  ipad  remote and skinny water bottle all at once all in all    stars from me  i do recommend this for anyone looking for a decent basic treadmill with horsepower to run  jog or walk  along with a push button incline  and i believe it s made in the usa      
304,2.0,                       this treadmill works  the belt moves  the speeds change and the elevation also changes  if youre looking for something that will measure your heart rate or accurately account for how many calories you have burned or the distance you ve gone then pass on by  none of those features work properly  not to mention the frustration with the ifit program that several other people warned about in prior reviews  the trick with holding the button down did not work for mine  i had to sign up for the free trial and then go into my account and cancel it right after to make sure i was not charged later on  i m very disappointed that the heart rate monitors are way off  telling me my heart rate is    after running for    minutes even when trying it standing completely still  it also will tell me i have burned almost      calories in    minutes  i am in shape but i m no olympic runner  its completely off  buyers beware      
305,5.0,                       important  you do not need to sign up with ifit to use this machine  you have to use the treadmill key  the small red rectangular shaped piece of plastic attached to the black string with clip on the end  to bypass ifit and workout on the machine  manually  access wise  or  old school   i registered and signed up for ifit because i was interested to see what they have going on but it is not for me  i like to hear my own music when i m running and not someone talking in my head ears  it s cool though but not for me machine  absolutely love this machine  this is perfect for busy parents with little to no time to workout during the day so we can put in the work after the children goes to bed  assembly took about     hours maximum    person plus some help here and there   it is very heavy    it is very easy to fold and unfold too  it is not very noisy so that s good  the   inch screen is small but it s budget friendly and we manage  nothing too fancy but it s okay  i would recommend getting a treadmill mat to protect your machine and floor  delivery was good to so i highly recommend      
306,1.0,                       this was professionally assembled by amazon services  the control console with screen and handles wobbles sideways very severely when walking  even worse at higher speeds when running  the amazon assembly man said this happened on all of these nordic track treadmills and could not be fixed  even at   mph  the whole top that you hold onto swings sideways  left right left   with every step you take  this made me quite seasick when watching the workout progress screen and i have never been seasick in my life before  i have worked out on treadmills for    years and never had this issue before  my wife had same problem  saying even walking on this treadmill was like being in a small boat during a storm  the faster you go  the more severe the side swaying wobbling  going to have to return this to amazon      
307,5.0,                       i think it s important to leave reviews for others on a purchase of this size   especially considering there are so many negative reviews   my package was delivered without any issues   no damage  and it even sat out in the frigid upstate ny air for over    hours before being brought inside   i also opted for the free service which meant it was delivered to my front porch   it s heavy  don t get me wrong  but two people can easily carry it up a flight of stairs   when i say  two people   i mean two women  one of which has zero upper body strength   talking about myself here   anyway  assembly is certainly complicated  but not impossible   the hardware is all labeled by each step of installation   i think it s important to read each step carefully  and even jump ahead     steps to get more information   some of the parts has screws already attached that were discarded before assembly   just pay attention and you ll be good to go   you only need a second person for installation of the hydraulic leg for folding by the way   everything else can easily be managed on your own enough about this ifit nonsense   get your phone out  indicate that you have the standard screen  not color touch screen   and select the option to skip set up using your smart phone tablet   it unlocks the treadmill practically in an instant   anyone with a healthy set of eyes should be able to figure that out no problem so far so good on the operation of the machine   it s not any louder than any other treadmill and the flex step definitely absorbs a significant amount of shock   no wobbling  squeaking  shaking or anything else that shouldn t be happening   i m a bit confused by the way it tracks distance by the    th of a mile instead of   th  but i can get used to that i prefer to run outdoors  hate the gym setting   however  i ve still got my planet fitness membership when a feel the need to run with a buddy while the sidewalks are covered in snow   really excited to have this treadmill for those quick morning or evening workouts that don t require driving  let alone changing in a smelly locker room   i ll update this review if i find any issues with continued operation      
308,5.0,                       i ve been wheelchair bound for   years  then used a walker  remain unstable on a cane  this treadmill can be set to     speed setting  warning always start the warmup and trail with feet straddling the track  the video gives me focus to keep going  a mirror in front helps with foot placement  started doing just the warmup  now up to    minutes at speed     for me i see my feet work better going up hill  taught me to add stretches to improve walking on level ground  i may walk again normally with practice      
309,5.0,                       i ve had my t     si treadmill for a month and have used it every day  i m so incredibly happy with this purchase  i assembled the treadmill by myself without difficulty and have had zero problems with it so far  the only issue i had is that there was no code for my year of free ifit included in the box  but i called ifit support and they immediately activated my membership over the phone  i cannot recommend the ifit program enough  the quality of the videos is outstanding  the trainers are fantastic  and the workouts are incredibly fun  i enjoy them so much that i have to talk myself  out  of working out several times a day so i don t overdo it  my only complaint with ifit is that the user interface leaves a bit to be desired  difficult to search sort through available workouts  etc    but everything else about it is so great that it makes up for this inconvenience  i m a very happy nordictrack ifit customer      
310,5.0,                       the assembly of this treadmill is easy and straight forward while following the directions  once i finished assembly and turned it on i was immediately impressed with how solid it was when i ran on it  i haven t used the ifit programs yet  but i have used the basic run program  it s great to see the run time  speed  and distance all at the same time on the display  it s easy to connect to my wireless gateway  the bluetooth is great to connect to my phone  the speakers and display are awesome  and the fan works great   i love the space saving option by locking the treadmill in the upward position  i can t think of any negative things  this is simply an outstanding treadmill      
311,5.0,                       i recently bought my nordic track t series      i love it  even my husband loves it  it took me a morning to put together  yes i needed a little help from my husband but was able to accomplish most of it on my own  caution on step one  i had to take the monitor off to get the bolt covers for the feet on  my fault i didnt read the instructions thoroughly  the instructions were easy though  a few questions but you also get a  d aid if you use bilt app to help you put it together   i didnt know this before i put it together  again i should read the papers that came with the machine better  as for needing to use the ifit machine to get it to work  no you don t  there is an over ride  press the ifit button for    seconds  you can you the treadmill just fine without using the ifit  i was scared of some reviews that complained about this  ignore them   free month trial with ifit  ifit offers it regardless  although i am doing the      free trial and am really enjoying it  even contemplating buying a subscription  it really motivates me and keeps me on my workout routine   you do not have to pay  just do not put in payment information  i have a receipt that says       for my month of ifit subscription  using caution i also used a throw away email in case they asked for to much info  they dont  bare bones  height  weight  sex  email  that s it  again you do not have to put in your credit card info to get your free trial i am a stay at home mom since march of a toddler and have packed on the pounds  i am so excited to get my weight back under control and my nordic treadmill is going to help get me there  also my husband is so glad i got this so he too can use it  we ve both packed on some weight since becoming parents and then dealing with the stress of the pandemic  he s using it as much as i am  even made sure we got new good shoes while we use it to keep our knees happy i can not praise this treadmill enough  if you are on the fence or have doubts  i was there too  i got mine for a steal at a little over       watch the price and buy when you can  i have no regrets      
312,5.0,                       first off this thing is big   two men carried it from the truck   it stayed right where it was until the assembly team showed up a few days later   the thing i love the most is the i fit integration   this takes my workouts to a entire different level   the trainers really push me   when the workout is over i am really sweating    something that seldom happens when i  simply spend       minutes on a treadmill   the i fit combo is what takes everything about this to the next level  it seems there is a workout for wherever you are on your fitness journey   i am a    year old man    and they  have a lot for me to choose from   buy the machine    sign up for the i fit   it will take you where you want to go   a great value   rock solid machine   my only negatives     heart rate monitor is wildly inaccurate    it sure deserves a fan   note to all treadmill designers     why is the on off switch always in an awkward place typically at the floor    come on      
313,4.0,                       amazon freight shipping guys dropped it in our garage for us took     hours for us to assemble  probably if you know exactly what you are doing  can be done in    mins have had it for   months  so far so good  use for     mins  x a week we were looking for something relatively affordable  sturdy  didn t care too much for features beside incline and speed seems sturdy enough when running  no wobbling unless the ground is uneven will update if anything changes in the next few years some things to keep in mind   hold down bluetooth ifit to bypass ifit subscription when you turn on for the first time   walking belt slows down with every step on slow speeds     mph    can run fine  tried up to  mph  maxes at   mph   a little loud  have to turn up music when running   speakers not good for music   bluetooth is only used for ifit  not music connection   heavy  fold up function is nice and helps when you need to move it  on its   tiny wheels  also appreciate how generous icon fitness was  by offering me a small giftof either a maintenance kit or floor mat in exchange for a positive review      
314,3.0,                       nothing special of a treadmill  based on the reviews i was hoping it was better quality assembly was easy  just follow directions  i see other people saying how unsafe this machine is  it is a treadmill people  it has moving parts  learn how to walk in real life and you can navigate this machine i will say it is really loud compared to what i expected if this is near a bedroom  you will not be able to sleep if someone is on it this thing is loud at  am  when sound travels through the house  i installed wall to wall foam gym floor in the room  and i just ordered foam acoustic panels to place under and around this thing  hoping it helps absorb some sound  definitely wouldn t be able to use in an apartment complex  i will see how the panels work in a few weeks i am     pounds and  ft  it can handle my weight easy  i can t run on it while others are sleeping due to the noise  even walking on it seems to be loud if someone is sleeping better than nothing when it comes to the closed gyms due to covid    but kinda wish i dropped another couple hundred of my trump bucks for a better  quieter  machine i expect this to hold up to the miles i plan to put on it  so i would recommend  just know it is not as quiet as i hoped expected      
315,1.0,                       took me    days to get this product out of my door when i tried to return it  i spent hours and hours on the phone with amazon and the pick up service they use  the pick up service was terrible  they wouldn t call me back  they would schedule a day without telling me  they would come to my house and refuse to take it  etc  it was a freaking nightmare about the treadmill though i am quite short so my legs are quite short       but they would always hit the top cover that hides the motor when i ran  i could scoot back but then i d practically be off the treadmill  and it is hard to scoot back when you have it all the way inclined  that being said  the incline worked fine  the screen was quite good  the folding up wasn t very good  when you go to fold the track up  it always rubbed against one of the handles  left one   the ifit is annoying  we accidentally subscribed so i had to call them directly and cancel our subscription  which thankfully was very easy and the guy made it a breeze   the treadmill was just not worth the price      
316,1.0,                       the machine itself id great  after i bypassed the ifit thing   there are other apps or youtube channels that provide similar if wanting a virtual trail walk or something  if you really want the ifit option  go for it  im sure its fine ordering was fast and easy  not prime  but it was sold by amazon so there was a delivery option  i chose the earliest available which was   days after purchasing  delivery was set for sunday excitedly waiting the item to arrive but let down hard when the time passed and nothing  contacted amazon and assurances were made and credits provided  for amazon items of course    days after it was first ordered    days after original delivery date the treadmill finally arrived   just in time too  expected to snow for   days   the guys that delivered were nice however so i appreciate that but the whole   day fiasco was ridiculous  i have never had this bad of an experience from amazon in the    years i ve been ordering from them  one of the support people even had the gall to tell me  its not prime you know as for the device itself   assembly was not bad at all  went up in about an hour  like some purchasing the machine i bypassed the ifit by holding the ifit button down till the screen activated  make sure the magnetic stop key is inserted first lol  device worked great  cant wait to start using it on a regular basis  note to fitbit users   doesn t seem to register steps so keep those arms swinging youtube has some virtual trails  or other apps in the app stores   check them out so far  i recommend buying this device  i just hope shipping doesn t effect you as it did me     
317,1.0,                       scheduled service to assemble track    days ago   the appointment was for today at  pm  got a call at   am saying earliest date technician could assembles oct     that s five weeks out person on phone was very nice  very apologetic buts that s not what amazon promised just lost   weeks off my warranty first time i have used amazon s service calls and it s not a good start will keep you posted but if you are buying this for near term use    don t count on amazon assemblyupdate no     spent a few hours putting it together  instructions are very clear   the unit is securely packed to prevent damage  small parts are packaged to coordinate with the steps in the instructions  large parts are well identified very well engineered  clear instructions  easy to follow   i feel the two fit peopler are required to unpack and position the track      
318,5.0,                       first off  pay for professional installation  it took me three hours by myself and they don t even give you tools to screw in the bolts  luckily  i had a mini wrench that i found but it wasn t strong enough to make the bolts flush  i will have to go out and get a socket wrench  i researched many treadmills with the ifit model  i definitely need motivation and i get bored on machines  this was the cheapest one  brand name  with ifit  i wear a fitbit so i wasn t concerned at all about the machines heart rate monitor which was completely inaccurate  additionally  the calories burned on these preset programs on ifit was also inaccurate  do yourself a favor  get a fitbit watch or something similar to track these yourself  this treadmill is very flippin heavy  there is absolutely no way one person can move it by themselves  it is well built  it is quite it has the same quality of the treadmills at the gym  i have not tried the speakers yet so i cannot review them at this time  you do not have to get the ifit as others have stated  but again  nowhere does it say that  at     a month  if you need the motivation and you like to see the world  get the ifit  you can cancel at any time  the trainers that take you around the world are immersive  and takes your mind off of what you are doing at the time   working out  overall  i think this was a great buy considering i was looking at other treadmills from            more  this thing works  i was sore for a couple of days after my very first workout with i fit which was a simple    minute walking tour through london  the last couple of minutes had me going up a hill  the incline and speed adjusts automatically  i did not have to press any buttons myself  i was quite shocked that i was even sore as i walk at least        steps a day and walk all day long for    hours at my job  i do not regret this purchase      
319,1.0,                       i had great hopes when i bought a nordic track  great well known name  what could be better unfortunately  that became what could be worse assembling was difficult b c the bolts and holes weren t smooth and easy to thread  usually  threads are cleaned out by machine during manufacturing  they must have skipped this step  most bolts were hard to start and tighten  which i ve read in other reviews after assembly  spouse got on it and found it squeaks while in use  i tried several lubricating steps recommended in other reviews without success  not a bad squeak  but annoying on a new machine we contacted nordic track via phone and on website  no response  i also contacted amazon  and amazon left a voice mail with my number  i got no response  finally got a case opened via facebook  their response   your feet are probably dragging on the belt  please take care not to do that  because of the significant cost  we decided to return it due to an unresolved noise and poor no response from manufacturer  the only way to return it is to have it disassembled and packed in the original box  in the end  i m out     hours assembly disassembly and moving this up down stairs so  yeah  not worth the hassle  if you find this review helpful  please click on the helpful button so that others may avoid the pain      
320,1.0,                       treadmill arrived with damage to some of the cosmetic plastic pieces that cover the electronics and mechanical parts  no big deal  i had purchased the extended warranty just in case  so nordic track agreed to ship replacement parts    for me to install  the bigger problem was that when i first turned the treadmill on  and by passed their attempt to  up sell  you into their online workouts which involve a  monthly  fee  the instructions directed me to calibrate the incline motor  when i started the calibration process  the incline motor immediately jammed and would not function at all  the belt would turn but the deck was inclined and would not adjust  i contacted nordic track and after a half hour wait to talk to someone and another half hour of troubleshooting  they agreed to send me a new motor  they offered to send a technician to install the motor  but said it might take weeks to schedule  so  i waited   weeks for the new motor to arrive  installed it myself and the new motor immediately jammed as soon as i powered up the treadmill   when i contacted nordic track again  re another hour on the phone  they agreed to send more parts and a technician   a few days later  i received an email from nordic track threatening to void my warranty because the treadmill was located in a garage   they demanded photographic evidence of the treadmill s location   i sent a photo of the unit in my finished  insulated  climate controlled garage along with the large flat screen tv and home gym set up that are located there   nordic track did not respond  so i arranged a return and refund thru amazon  amazon s customer  service was amazing   i highly recommend that if you do decide to take a chance and buy this questionable product  do it thru amazon  because amazon will take care of you when nordic track inevitably screws you over      
321,2.0,                       so nordic track decided to try to get people to pay a gym membership to them from their homes with this ifit scam nonsense   this seems to be the norm with a lot of these treadmill companies   so you sign up for ifit  and then cancel it immediately   that s fine   i d spend the     bucks to get some poor soul to install it at your house   i chose to do it myself to save money and it was a huge pain in the neck   folding this machine is some what easy  but it s definitely not portable or easy to move   there are wheels that are less than    in diameter that you re suppose to pull it with again  when using it as a treadmill  it works great   just look out for the ifit scam      
322,3.0,                       i wish this treadmill had a fan built in like my previous treadmill the fact that you are forced to sign up with ifit com before being able to use it is very annoying and not very fair to the consumer  i should not be forced to do anything by a seller or product however  as someone else described the procedure to bypass the mandatory registration with ifit  simply    attach the safety cord   press and hold the ifit button for    seconds this procedure will allow you to use the treadmill without having to register  you only have to do this one time on the positive side  the treadmill feels comfortable during its intended use  it is not very noisy except when changing the inclination  folding and un folding is done easily and quietly      
323,5.0,                       first off i want to tell you that i did not even try the ifit trial  so i can not speak to that  i was looking for a good treadmill to use with zwift and have found this treadmill works perfectly for that  i needed to be able to pair it with the zwift program and found that the zwift runn paired with this treadmill and the speeds matched exactly with no calibration of the runn needed  i had first tried the zwift running pod  but found the speeds it recorded were not accurate  i highly recommend this treadmill for indoor running  especially for pairing with the zwift platform      
324,5.0,                       i ve had this for about a month now  i m a    year old that is trying to get back into jogging again assembly  took about two hours by myself now   i m not counting the hour i took looking for another screw  step     because the supplied screw did not fit after that   things went smooth i love this machine  i bypassed the ifit like every one said and held the button down about    seconds  i may consider it in the future but just starting out i just figured out this morning that you can adjust the cushion on the track  looking forward to running on that tonight i was honestly looking at the           price range but after reading soooo many reviews   mostly bad in that price range in reliability   this one seemed like a worthwhile gamble to spend the extra money  i use it about       min every other day  for the price i really think it would be hard to beat      
325,4.0,                       we have had this treadmill for a month now  my husband and i both use it a few times a week  he is the runner and i like to do inclined power walking  we are both very happy with this treadmill it s by no means  gym quality  but it fits the bill for an average home user looking to get or stay in shape it has plenty of features that make it impressive for the price point  we love the folding feature because it gives us a bit more space when it s not in use  the belt is plenty wide and long and the motor keeps up with my husband s runs the only couple things that are slightly disappointing are there is no fan but that s easily resolved by placing one nearby and the speakers in the console are not good quality  but we have a bluetooth speaker in our workout room  neither of these are deal breakers for us especially considering the price tag as other reviews have mentioned  the ifit membership can be bypassed by holing fown the ifit button for a few seconds  then you re ready to go if youre looking for a good value treadmill with lots of features i would recommend this one      
326,5.0,                       i had my eye on this treadmill for a while and i m happy i pulled the trigger  my treadmill did arrive damaged  but nordic s customer service was excellent and they had a replacement piece sent out to my house as soon as possible  i did see a few reviews say that the ifit membership was required in order to use the treadmill  but that s definitely not the case  once the treadmill is powered on  hold down the ifit button for    seconds and then your treadmill is ready to be used without having to pay for the membership fee      
327,1.0,                       this is a good quality treadmill for the money  easy to assemble  and easy to use   i don t need any features other than some simple numbers for speed  time  and distance  and this machine is fine for that without anything else   it comes with a large red stop sign that says the machine will not work until you go to ifit and activate  whatever that is   i called the phone number instead  nobody home   so i went to ifit and the only option was to type in a credit card   i did  and then and only then found that if i would just hold the ifit button down for    seconds or so  that would activate the machine without whatever ifit might be   so i logged onto my new ifit account and set the status to cancel whatever it was that i signed up for   this is pretty shady and if i would have known about their methods in advance i would have looked for a different machine or company      
328,5.0,                       i ve been using this machine for a little under a month  so far  i have no complaints  except for some intermittent connectivity issues  you don t have to sign up for ifit  there are instructions in the reviews and q   a section for activating without it  however  i m using ifit just to test out the different workouts  and i m enjoying it so far  i only did a little bit of research to find a treadmill  it can get overwhelming  but this brand and model seemed to meet all of my requirements and reliability  my husband moved and assembled it for me  it fits well into the corner of our fitness room  and it folds up conveniently so my husband can pull his bench out  there haven t been any noise issues  and i haven t used the speakers  since i normally use my headphones  overall  i m happy with my purchase      
329,5.0,                       i was going crazy  being locked in the house during covid  i have two children  the youngest still being a bit of a loose cannon and we live on a busy road  i didn t feel like i could safely go for a walk with her and even my oldest isn t old enough by legal standards to stay at home with her  i m working from home  sitting all day  at least at the office  i d walk the building  around the building  but at home      it was just sitting  this machine gives has been a god send  best     bucks i ve spent in a while  i use it daily to get my exercise  burn off steam and get the endorphins going  so far so good  it gives me a good quality work out every time  i will say assembly was a challenge at  times  as was moving the package  i had to open the box in my foyer where they left it and carry the pieces to the living room for assembly  it says you need two people and you re probably better off   it is heavy and cumbersome  i didn t have that option though  so me and my    dollar tool kit that i keep around the house got this thing assembled in about   hours  i did follow the instructions  but i also followed a video on youtube and i had no issues with having to disassemble or redo anything  even managed to adjust the belt and felt very accomplished afterwards  i love it  best thing i could have done for myself  the only thing i did not like was ifit  so i couldn t bypass it and it sounded cool  i did the trial  i signed up for a bunch of classes that sounded awesome  walk through the pyramids of egypt  yes please  i started the first  only to have my treadmill literally take off under neath me  i had to pull th cord and shut it down  the instructor wasn t even moving yet  ifit would have been great if it didn t control my machine  i need to control my pace and incline  i cancelled it that night      
330,4.0,                       the delivery drivers notified me when they were on the way  the box was in pristine condition  it was on time  and the instructions were very straight forward  it runs perfectly and is exactly what i wanted there are two cons    you must have a second person to put this together    nordictrack makes you think you have to register for their ifit program for your treadmill to even turn on  this is not true  you can bypass the registration process by just turning the machine on  putting the safety stopper fab into its place and holding down the ifit button      
331,1.0,                       i did not realize when i purchased this nordictrack t   s treadmill that it is considered a  smart treadmill   the nordictrack t   s treadmill is locked and in order to unlock it you must set up an account with if it com to activate the treadmill  give credit card information  personal information  etc   you get a free    day trial but if you not cancel there is a monthly yearly charge of          you can join a gym for as little as    per month  after setting up my treadmill i attempted to cancel the free membership and i am unable to do so  i am so pissed off that i would recommend to anyone who would listen not to purchase this treadmill and amazon should warn you before purchase  i am filing a complaint with the better business bureau  beware  don t purchase treadmill     
332,5.0,                       hey all i brought this treadmill because all of my gyms closed down on the post i work for in the military  i have to stay ready at all times  there were a lot of treadmills i researched to get to my final destination  i wanted the high end ones but this works fantastically  i have no complaints  the screen works clearly and the touch configurations work great even when you re covered in sweat  i can see and touch my buttons even with my glasses off  i had to build this alone because i brought some new shoes with this purchase  and my spouse was at work  i was too excited to start back running  it took me a couple of hours  i was watching law and order and eating lunch   the delivery team brought it to right to my doorstep that helped a lot  this treadmill is worth the money especially the ifit that comes with  the coaches keep me engaged and ready to go  the stats are saved by my wifi too  overall dreams come true      
333,5.0,                       i just got into a workout routine before covid  but thankfully when the weather turned  i was happy to get outside  my parents bought this treadmill on prime day and i realized that i wanted one  it is great to be able to walk whenever  day or night  or even in this cold weather  two things though  the ground hole needs drilled a bit more when assembling and the ifit can be bypassed when first turning on  by holding the ifit button down for over    seconds  i haven t used ifit  but it seems like an unnecessary monthly membership fee  i d totally recommend this item      
334,4.0,                       i didn t want to sign up for the ifit program so all you have to do to get around that is press and hold the ifit bluetooth symbol next to the phone and ipad symbol  it doesn t look like an actually button to press but that s what you have to touch   and it went to the home screen  super easy to assemble i do have a complaint tho  my delivery wasn t the best experience  they scuffed up my trim when they put it into the room and the box was damaged and dented in multiple places  definitely not professional      
335,4.0,                       first  i was disappointed to discover this treadmill was made in china   delivery was quite fast  but the box was damaged and the treadmill suffered minor scratches   moving the treadmill from the front porch to the assembly location was thought  it s very heavy   i removed the parts from the box to move them easier   assembly was ok  fit of the parts was ok  we ll see how durable it is   activation is a pain   eventually we figured out by holding the bluetooth button down for       seconds  the online activation is not necessary   the treadmill work fine  as expected   it seems powerful enough for walking  jogging  maybe a slowish runner   not sure a sprint would be supported   but  it does feel powerful   several workout programs are offered   the display is nice too  easy to read track graphic   overall  it seems ok so far   wish it was made anywhere but china   probably wouldn t have bought something else had i known      
336,3.0,                       everything but the delivery was good  the assembly  although it had annoying terrible instructions  wasn t too bad  the delivery was just hell  it seemed like they were delivering to the room of choice and assembling the thing but they just dropped it off on our hallway and pretty much said good luck  over     pound product and we had to get it to our basement  back corner gym  while trying not to scratch up the walls  everything else was fine though  they can definitely use a pointer or two from ikea on how to create assembly instructions  luckily we had the tools necessary to make the job a bit easier but if you have no tools  good luck so far the machine seems to working pretty well also  do not sign up for their fit thing  turn on the machine  put the key in it s spot and just hold down the blue fit icon  you can bypass their stupid registration and just use the treadmill as intended      
337,4.0,                       the good   solid  well built machine   excellent motor warranty   the not so good   tracking adjustment access is horrible   aligning the hex wrench with the roller screw is difficult because there is about        space between the hex wrench access hole and the roller screw head   the area is covered by a trim piece with limited visual access from the side   even using a flashlight  it was difficult to get the hex wrench fitted into the roller screw head the worst   the owner s manual does not tell you that the treadmill can be unlocked without signing up for ifit   the ifit deal wants you to sign up for specialized programs for a monthly fee   guess what   the same company owns both nordictrack and ifit   you can unlock the machine by pressing and holding the ifit logo on the console for    seconds thankfully  a prior reviewer made that information available   if you just want the basics with out paying for the extra frills  you don t need to subscribe to ifit      
338,1.0,                       do not buy   i purchased this treadmill and the belt never stayed where it was supposed to be   i purchased an extended warranty and asked them to repair   they said it was a known problem and sent me two screws to put into the treadmill  there are no screw holes where these are supposed to fit   as if today  i have made many requests for warranty repair service but they have not responded  total ripoff and appalling customer service     
339,1.0,                       missing a whole row of buttons     machine looks great lets make that clear but    assembly isn t that complicated    its horribly calibrated    theres dents and scratches everywhere   ifit code locked  you must purchase ifit subscription    the one that comes with the machine is not valid  also the machine i got    the model and serial numbers on the box do not match the ones listed on the machine  therefor you must be careful before activating  it will not unlock so its useless  i contacted customer service and refused a replacement was asked to ship back and pay shipping out of my own pocket for this huge box    its expensive  horrible experience  i do pay for prime  so why do i have to pay for return shipping on a useless product    amazon cs responded  contact us after    hrs  seriously    ive contacted them   days and they keep asking for tracking number    or i will not keep my refund  crazy         
340,3.0,                       i use this without the app by pushing the connect button for    seconds i like this machine sort of   it works  the price was good  but it shuts off several times per  work out  i detach the emergency stop tassel pull and put it back in and it starts back up  but it continues my timer distance while it s paused   makes zero sense for whatever reason  it was impossible ago assemble  my husband made it work but in some areas they did not bore the holes alarge enough for the screws and it explicitly says  do not use power tools   well  we had to  the screws were too big to fit through      overall it s a good ish machine  i like the one touch speed and incline buttons  i like that you don t have to use the app with it  the app was terrible for runners tbh   it fits in my large closet  it s super quiet    it s very stable with no shaking even while running  displays are confusing  no idea what half the buttons do  and i can t for the life of me figure out why my machine is stopping every      minutes  are all treadmills like this      
341,5.0,                       when looking for a treadmill i was looking for a dependable brand that was as low cost as possible   and then i learned about ifit and decided to make that a requirement and i m glad i did   this one is perfect because its low cost so it doesn t have its own screen and we just use our ipad which works great   the ifit software is pretty awesome as it has training series where the trainer will run through thailand or greece or wherever and then the machine s speed and incline will automatically change with the trainer as she   he goes through the run   walk   hike   we love it   only downside is that the treadmill now makes some more squeaking noise as it moves so i m going to check into oil and the like but i m not worried as it seems to be well constructed   all in all   we d recommend      
342,4.0,                       does not come with ifit code free trial as it states  it came with a card with an authorization code that has already been used ifit was no help they said this is a scam  it s been months of trying to get a hold of a real person that i can even get this sorted out with    the treadmill itself is sturdy and does the job but it would ve been nice to actually get what is advertised on the amazon listing as that is what swayed me to buy this over another brand    disappointed to say the least in the seller      
343,3.0,                       replacing a   yr old treadmill by another manufacture  that machine worked well for a long time   wanted a basic treadmill for the wife and i to walk on with some slow paced running   bought this product   assembly was okay  had to disassemble some shipping screws and re assemble with correct screws as part of the assembly process   all in all the fit and finish is what i expected   the belt seems to work just fine thought i wish it had a system where the belt will self adjust as it wears or an indicator that will show when the belt needs tightening   hello  ever hear of a constant tension spring use  you must sign up with ifit to get it to work  if we were hard core workout people then ifit is something that we will use  and maybe we will grow into it   did not like that we could not assemble and turn it on and have it just work  now i have to go back and remember the username and password  as if i don t have enough of those already  to discontinue the ifit subscription   wife used the most basic program to start and that was soon too much for her as it went from an incline of   to     she is using it now mostly on manual mode where she has to input her own selections as she works out   really this machine is made for a more advanced runner than a light walker  jogger   time will tell if we use it more or less than our old machine   we don t fold it and unfold it as it is part of the gym so it just stays in use position      
344,3.0,                       why in the world would you have some many different types of screws and bolts  i had three different size bolts just for the side rails  when you install the side rails  do not tighten them up just leave them a bit loose or you will never get the pulsebar installed   as for the ifit  amazon should be ashamed of itself to allow nordictrack  ifit to hold an expensive piece of equipment hostage until you provide ifit with your credit card in order to turn the damn thing on all three of you can do better on this   the bypass trick of holding the ifit logo down for    sec does not seem to work in the newer purchased units  i know you don t want the average joe to assemble these machines  when you can have a service person do it for another fee  there are assemble videos available on utube take a look at a couple before you start      
345,4.0,                       once we got it working  it is a nice machine   it is big and heavy so plan your location  including proximity to power   get your mat  surge protector   before you start assembly   it does fold easily but it still will not go through most doorways assembled as luck would have it  ours came damaged during the pandemic   we did not unbox for a while  time  procrastination  and thus missed some options like return although that would have been challenging during the pandemic as well   the damage was a dead center hit of one of the poles in the box with the electronic console knocking a crippling indentation on the display   we were sent to nordictrack for resolution and they agreed to replace the console upon appropriate documentation   it was quite a wait for the part   i suspect replacement part fulfillment was competing with new production but don t know   anyway  after   months we got the replacement part  figured out how to do the repair  and things are now great      
346,5.0,                       i was    yrs old        and     pounds when i bought this treadmill i am very pleased with this after a couple months of daily use  i find this treadmill to be very comfortable to run on  the track is large  and very fast  i have yet to go past halfway on the speed what i like the best is that i only bought a treadmill  not a computer station with it  i don t need anything beyond how fast and how far  that s what this offers very easy to fold and unfold  i am very happy with this machine overall i had no issues with the assembly  it was easy and the instructions were simple the one issue i had was with the ifit connection  the treadmill comes with giant warnings saying that it is  locked  and that you have to make an ifit account to unlock it i did that to only find out that i never needed to do so  all i had to do was hold down the ifit button for    seconds and the machine was unlocked  this was in the way back of the assembly instructions that really upset me because i had already opened the ifit account and put in my credit card info why lie to me nordictrack  i don t care what ifit is paying you  that is simply unethical to make me think that i needed to open an ifit account with a credit card to use the treadmill that i bought  then recant this at the end of the instructions so if you buy this  and i would definitely recommend it  please be aware that if you don t want the ifit account  you don t have to make one      
347,5.0,                       i happened to find this treadmill for about      and quickly researched and then purchased  i m glad i did because the price immediately went back up to almost         although i don t remember the description mentioning the machine folding  i m glad that it does  the deck is long and comfortable to run or walk on  and the incline feature works great  by the numbers the deck might not be quite as wide as what you may use at the gym  but i can t feel the difference  my one and only gripe is that the front of the deck ends too close to the controls for my liking  so i m constantly feeling like i m too far back compared to machines that i m used to   the ifit nonsense is easy enough to bypass and at this point it s obvious that it s there  the whole number speed and incline buttons are nice and work well  but i wish the     and     buttons felt a bit more responsive on the display  the start to  mph and stop ramp up down a bit faster than what i m used to  but i ll get used to that  overall  the quality feels solid and the machine isn t overly loud   i have it in my living room for reference  the additional cushioning for the running deck is nice too  lastly  you really don t need a media screen for double the normal price of this machine  the phone tablet ledge works great and i can watch shows on tv or a device while running just fine on this machine      
348,3.0,                       i d like to start by saying this thing was terribly frustrating to put together  the instructions are simple  but you have to fight the bolts to get them in place  it took me    minutes just to get the handles attached because the bolts catch so frequently two parts of it were damaged upon arrival  that i have noticed this far   a metal bar along the bottom and the top of the arm where the handles attach  i have yet to reach out to customer service i have ran on it four times so far  and one of those times the screen was stuck on a loading screen image  but i was still able to control it manually and run  but it did not save my workout data it feels great to run on  but i ve been a little nervous considering the cost      
349,5.0,                       we moved and the club we belonged to just no longer worked   we debated and opted to purchase a treadmill   we got the ifit included and wow what an experience   my knees are not allowing be to run but with the ifit and various walking trails  it s terific   the speed and incline are automatically adjusted to keep you going   my wife uses for running and she has been all over the world   highly recommend   i am not the greatest mechanic but was able to assemble after delivery put in place i wanted       rating for me      
350,5.0,                       i was worried about the negative reviews  where the product arrived damaged  mine arrived fine  although i m slightly unhappy that amazon lets you  choose  a drop off time window and ups unilaterally changed it  i chose           on saturday and ups said            however  ups delivered it in the original amazon time window  at approximately   a m    and not during the ups updated window as for the product  i don t plan to use the fitness app  and i was able to disable the prompts immediately by pressing the ifit app button for several seconds  as another reviewer noted as for the treadmill  i was able to set it up by myself  with a bit of difficulty  it is probably far easier to set it up with two people  as another reviewer noted  it is probably better to set it up in the room in which you intend to use it  it is fairly heavy  but the track lifts easily for storage  the cup holders kinda suck for most things other than cups  but there is a ledge you can use for phones tv remotes the functions are suitable for my purposes  i mostly intend to walk with it to increase my exercise while i watch tv  i tried the faster speeds  and this thing is fast  i find walking to be most comfortable between     and      you can increase speeds and incline incrementally by     of a unit  i do not really use the incline  but it s a neat feature i might explore if i advance in skill  i disabled the sound beeps  and it is now fairly quiet to operate  i can walk  at a fast clip  and watch my shows without disturbing my housemates one room over  i m happy i went with this model over the cheaper budget units  although i m not ready to use all the features of this model  i m glad i have that option for the future solid device  and about the only model at this price point with the features i wanted      
351,2.0,                       my biggest complaint with this equipment is the ability to play music  it has   large speakers but if you don t subscribe to ifit then they are useless  they have a port which the instructions state you can insert your ipod in   i think i stopped using an ipod back in the    s  at this price range you should be able to use any of the modern devices to play your music  but they have seen fit to partner with ifit and limit your music choice to only them   i hate it when a company tries to force you to use a product that you don t want and certaintly don t want to pay monthly for it folds easily but still leaves a big footprint in the folded position because it doesn t fold up even close to vertical i paid to have this assembled for me  i m glad i did because it looked like a difficult task      
352,1.0,                       this company is scamming people into registering for ifit and paying extra for a treadmill that s already not worth the price  they mislead you into believing it won t work without ifit  they should be sued for that alone also they give you the wrong screws which make it impossible to put together yourself  i had some extra in the house so i used them instead  if i m paying over      for something i expect to have the correct items to put it together update  treadmill is still trash  the belt always moves to the left side and rubs against the side rails  i hope this company is happy with the money they stole for a terrible product      
353,2.0,                       i have owned several treadmills in my time including  landice  lifespan and life fitness  i knew what i was buying this time around getting a simple  low cost unit  as i no  longer pound this by running  but merely walk briskly  it is well built for the       price point  but that is where it ends  the ifit is useless to me and therefore it lacks basic programs like hills  intervals  weight loss  etc  use  it is literally manual for speed and incline  it does not even have time set  just time elapsed  i tried to like ifit but it only has lame slow  walks  and nothing over    minutes  so  you constantly have to adjust the treadmill the entire time to go faster slower and the worst part is taking a break and then set up another walk run after a typical    or    minute session  consumers need to know    if you plan to not use ifit    this is      manual with zero built in programs the screen is nice  but would be better to have wifi used for tv or internet  no bluetooth  no way to turn the monitor off  shutting the main switch is a pain as it takes    minutes to boot up and start exercise the next time  it feels super clunky and like hollow plastic  but i forgive this for the price point  the biggest complaint is by far the arms handles  they are not long enough  it forces you to be close to the console and therefore kick the heck out of the motor cover  that cover is very poorly designed and no reason it should extend and rise in the front  likewise  the arms have almost no padding but an      of foam and this numbs my palms  i have read many complaints of the same items  no one buying this level of treadmill is a world class athlete and therefore holding the handles arms should be considered  i am sure it is all a cost savings like dropping the feet or wheels in the very front as was done recently  you have the chance to own the market as sole is the only competition in this niche  i don t hate the t    si  but it is a shame i don t like it either  icon fitness can easily make these changes for improvement and charge another       for now  i have adjusted my workout routine and use handlebar foam tape on the arms for some padding  from an engineering standpoint  the product should work around me and not the other way around  i would not buy it again and would have chosen the sole    instead      
354,5.0,                       this treadmill does just what i need it to do     provide a level walking service for    year old me  considering    the delivery guy dropped it on the front patio  considering that the unit in the box would not fit thru the    inch door  we had to  de cant  it outside and take it inside    we are both in our   s and it is very heavy    thanks to an appliance dolly   we got it into our living room   assembly went okay   the manual has clear instructions   but there are a couple of youtube videos that helped  google search  assembly of nordictrack     s  one by i con fitness assembly help  nordictrack t series assembly      and    one by m a furniture and fitness equipment assembly   it helped to watch them put one together first    we planned on putting it in the office    but the width is   inches and would not fit thru the    inch door without a major wrestling match     so we put it in the living room  at least i can watch tv in there   and because it folds up   it does not take up as much room as you would think      order the surge supressor  different from a surge protector    when you order the treadmill    we had to wait   days to get one     we did not want to risk the computer processor with our rural electrical grid   treadmill   check   surge supressor    check      major bummer the console would not light up     holiday weekend   online to activate with ifit   signed up    did not get an activation code    called amazon    they offered a replacement    at no charge   to be shipped the next business day     days to get it by freight    turns out    a couple of wires had pulled loose from the main connector    pushed them into the connector and everything works fine   so   we cancelled the replacement this treadmill will work fine for what i need    walking     the hardest part  for me  is holding it up and triggering the release latch with my short legs while standing on one leg     the unit practically lowers itself down   the balance is such that i can easily lift it up again for storage  it is somewhat easy to move   if you need to   and it is stable enough i don t have to worry about it falling over on the cats or the dog    even if bumped      
355,1.0,                       i purchased this treadmill sunday evening  aug     it delivered today  saturday  august      i just had it assembled   i just looked online to get the name of the app and see it is        cheaper  same seller   and amazon rep said they don t honor lower prices post purchase  i opened a cc with amazon to get this treadmill   i am a widow and had someone assemble it  i wanted to get exercise since i ve been this house for almost six months now  assemblers cut up boxes  and no way to return      
356,4.0,                       we just put this up today  took two ppl about    mins to complete the assembly  wasn t too bad  so far so good  dont worry about it being  locked    hold down the ifit button for a few seconds and it works  no need to pay    a month if you just want basic workouts  fold up was easy and moving from one location to another was doable for one person once assembled      
357,3.0,                       i had a pro form treadmill previously  and i liked it a lot more than i like this one  so far  the ifit  scam  is easy to get around    just hold the ifit button until the screen comes on  but  if you will have this treadmill in a room where small children may roam  you might want to rethink your plan to purchase  i bought this because i appreciate the fold up feature  but it doesn t fold up as perpendicular to the floor as my old treadmill  it sticks out at an angle and the only thing keeping it up there is a hydraulic lock bar  i would be so nervous if i had toddlers in the house  i can easily imagine the bar  unlocking  spontaneously and descending upon someone s head  it doesn t drop quickly  another hydraulic benefit   but it s not a safe look if you want to store this in a corner and wheel it out to use it  think  again  you store this in the corner  you use it in the corner  unless you want to exercise before getting on the treadmill  it s very awkward to move because they didn t put wheels in good places and it s a very heavy treadmill  there are only   wheels on the bottom and they are not in a spot that makes it easy to move  i m really surprised that a product made by such an expensive and well known brand is so poorly designed  i never thought they d place the wheels in such an unhelpful location folded  the treadmill is an eye sore  that is largely true of all treadmills  but i had a pro form before that was designed better  so the running platform didn t stick out while folded  the console is huge for how average it is  the layout of the screen information feels crowded and poorly designed i m happy to have a new treadmill  but this is the kind of treadmill that belongs in a dedicated workout room  if you are into minimalist living and or you have adventurous toddlers  maybe try a different machine also  i put this together completely alone  it took about   hours  but only because i kept wandering off to do other things  my downstairs neighbor says she can t tell i bought a treadmill  which might speak more to the construction of our building  but it s a plus  the treadmill is as noisy as most treadmills and it seems the shock absorber feature works decently  the width of the belt is perfect  but i don t feel like the motor provides smooth action  i felt some slight hitching as i walked this morning  overall  i think this treadmill is overpriced for the quality      
358,1.0,                       this treadmill could and should have been put together at the factory  most of what i had to do should have been done there  the screws don t even fit in the holes  they say not to use power tools but there is no way to get the screws in if you don t  then on the bottom front there is a bolt on each side of the treadmill that you can t get in all the way  used it twice and it makes a squeaking noise  the belt on the treadmill is thin and flimsy and is already flipping up on the sides   what a rip off   for what they charge they should put it together completely and stop using cheap parts  i would never buy from nordic track again  i was on the phone waiting for customer service today for over an hour  finally i had to hang up  poor quality  poor customer service  amazon should stop selling their equipment or they should take the blame and send someone out to fix it  i could go on and on about how terrible this treadmill is  but i think you all have the picture  do not purchase        
359,5.0,                       the treadmill works perfect  that said  even though it should take you only a half hour or at most an hour to install it does not  why  the parts provided by the merchant were the wrong size  i had to go back and forth to the hardware store to get the correct size nuts bolts screws before i could build the damn thing  took me   hours of back and forth and a lot of frustration  do not struggle trying to make a square peg fit in a round hole  use common sense and take a picture of the problem  go to the hardware store  explain the issue and have staff help you with a workaround  that is what i did  i should not have wasted my time trying to use the factory provided screws bolts as they were the wrong size  also tools are key  some tools demand an extension or they will not fit in the tiny area so make sure you have the right tools to install  other than the installation  which is easy if you have the right tools and parts  it works great  lost   pounds so far on the treadmill after two and a half weeks  i walk  steep incline for    minutes twice a day  at   to     speed and poof weight falls off me like water out of the shower   i also read my e book as i walk when i use the lower speed of        
360,3.0,                       so my wife and i purchased this on          i wanted to give it some time after i wrote a review  the ifit is a great tool  however we noticed that while the machine is adjusting on the inclines per the program  the treadmill itself is making a loud clank per the adjustment  overall it s only been a couple of months and i m definitely not happy with the product after weve spent      on what we thought would be a great tool      
361,1.0,                       i am so bummed right now  i spent a month trying to find a treadmill that wasn t insanely over priced or sold out because of the pandemic  my husband and i have been stuck inside our apartment for   months and we needed something to help us move around a bit more than our daily yoga routine  i decided to purchase this for my husband for his   th birthday after again a month of deliberating on which machine to buy  i am so angry that we are not apart of the     of people who enjoyed this machine enough to give it   stars  there are a multitude of problems so i ll just start here    the machine and the parts that are broken are not due to amazon s delivery and all parts that arrived damaged were things that happened in manufacturing  there is a bar that runs through the machine component where the motar is  this bar is held together at both ends by   large bolts  one on each side of the machine  on the left side the bolt is aligned and correctly placed  on the right size the bolt was not correctly aligned and from the looks of it was jammed by force through the machine  this has caused many problems  most annoying of which causes the entire machine to be off balance so assembling the machine was a nightmare because nothing else could fit right and needed extreme pressure in some circumstances to screw things together  how do i know that the company sent out a defective product that they knew was defective  great question  well the lid that covers the machinery is held together by   screws    on each side and   in the front  all   of the other screws are just simply screwed into the lid as they should be  however  on the side that was broken the company put a brace or a stint in the screw that holds it together because without it it wouldn t go in at all  this causes the entire right side of the machine to buckle and now and not stay together  if you lift the machine up in its storage function you can see a giant crack down the base of the machine where it was broken   and the inside of the machine where the bolt was forcibly jammed had   pieces of broken plastic just sitting in a pile i don t even know where they came from    due to problem   in order for me to stand on the machine at all i have to use wooden blocks to that it is balanced  it doesn t make me  a pregnant person feel safe  it makes me extremely sad because i feel like i m in prison and i have no way to move around in my tiny apartment and i had to wait a month for this almost      machine that i had to pay for on unemployment to arrive broken    i m trying to be optimistic  i m trying to keep the moral alive  i want to use this machine even though it s broken  because even though i ordered front door delivery amazon wouldn t bring it up the   flights of stairs to my apartment and i m pregnant and i could have miscarried walking this over   thousand pound box  i don t want to return it because i spent   hours putting it together  so i m trying to find a way to use it because i need this happiness i need the seritonin from walking  and i can t even use the machine because the belt won t stay on straight it slides to one side after   or   steps and i m only using it at speed      what a joke     and yes i did look up online how to adjust the belt but it only helps adjust the sliding of the belt for about    seconds and it just moves right over again i m so sad and depressed over this  i waited for a while to have this  it took so much effort to move up the stairs and put together  my husband had to go to the doctor because he threw his back out trying to get this up the stairs alone  i can t believe you sent this product to us defective from the get go  i really hope you fix this problem amazon      
362,5.0,                       bought this about six months ago and love it  i assembled it myself and it probably took a few hours  but it can be done with one person  although it would be easier with two  also  the instructions claim that the treadmill is  locked  and must be  registered  and when you go to register it  they ll insist that you sign up for a monthly subscription program with various workouts  etc  for an additional monthly cost  i didn t want this  so i contacted them and learned that if you turn on the treadmill and hold down on the ifit button for    seconds  it ll unlock your treadmill and you can use freely  enjoy      
363,4.0,tread mill isn t the top of the line  but works for those who want to run or walk briskly  if you have never used a treadmill before  i would caution you to get used to one before you buy  it feels different running on a treadmill than it does running outside  some people get dizzy using a treadmill  like my wife did   like all treadmills  if you run  the landing of your feet on the treadmill is noisy  we set it up upstairs  but ended up moving it to the basement because of this   being able to raise the treadmill base up right is a nice feature as it gets     of the treadmill out of the way when not in use  it is a long base  so does stick up about   feet in the air  the mechanism for lowering is nice as you can just let it go  and it will fall at a slow rate  and then goes very slow at about about   feet from the ground   mine came damaged  the box didn t look too bad when i got it but the plastic front for the motor electronic cover was cracked  took awhile to get the bottom and top cover replacement parts due to covid     i was able to use the treadmill until the new parts arrived  the bottom motor pan is not for the faint of heart to replace  you have to remove   connectors that are pressure fit into the cover  you have to remove some wires  and remember where they went when you put the new pan on    screws require you to tip the treadmill over to get at them  the packaging is robust except for the front of the base where the plastic cover is  the manufacturer could use some better packaging here   the box with everything in it is extremely heavy  we ended up unpacking the box outside and moving in the pieces  with covid     delivery would not bring inside  this was a warning given when purchased   even still the motor tread mill base is not a one person job to move  assembly takes awhile  some of the screws are hard to get at  you need   people to put the upright display stand onto the base   the display is too bright for me  but a  dim it  sheet did the trick  see picture   the manufacturer wants you to use the online registration to enable the  custom  workout features on the treadmill  your first year is free  but after that you need to pay  i bypassed this by holding down the  ifit  button for    seconds  not documented anywhere  but found other reviewers who discovered this   none of the    programmed workouts  work when you do this  but i have always been a straight run for    minutes at a constant pace and constant incline person  the treadmill has nice   to    mph buttons so you can adjust course speed  then get your   ths of an mph for fine tuning with the     buttons   the heart rate monitor does not work for me  it always reads way low and takes a long time to get a reading  by holding the handles on the top console   this is typical in my experience with treadmills  getting a good heart rate with the hand holds provided is always hit or miss  even on expensive treadmills  i use my garmin     watch and heart rate strap when i want to monitor my heart rate   the display features are busy  it is hard to see progress of your run with the bar graph that is trying to look  d  i ignore it now   you cannot enter your weight so the calories expended i assume is based on a constant weight  for me    lbs  the calories seem higher compared to more expensive treadmills i have used in gyms   the documentation requires you to use a ul      transient voltage surge suppressor      joules or more      volt or less compliant power strip     amp   i could find only one power strip that said on amazon that it was ul      complaint  i suspect most are  but amazon does not put a lot of info on their pages about the products they sell  the manual says injury could occur if you don t use the correct suppressor  but they don t say what could happen if you don t  electrocuted  explosion  fire  they really need to give you a link to some suppressors that they know are compliant  this was another       they also recommend a mat  i got a     which isn t long enough  get a      another       has an aux input for your  ipod  and   speakers  i have never used these as i use ear buds when running so as not to disturb the rest of the family   all in all  for the price i paid  it works great  not the low end that breaks or suddenly halts when you go too fast  but not the extremely robust gym style treadmills           some reviewers say they have trouble with the surge suppressor or breaker tripping  i didn t have any trouble like this  others say the belt slips  after   months of use  i have no issues like this   first pic   ifit  button   nd      workouts  button that does nothing unless you register   rd  display with  dimm it  sheet peeled back to see the difference   th  surge protector i bought on amazon is a tripp lite surge protector       joules   th  treadmill raised up 
364,4.0,                       this unit is very heavy and bringing it into the house required a lot of  dangerous  lifting in our case it went downstairs   my son helped  the instructions for me at    were difficult in so that the screw sizes are used in multiple places and exact placement is necessary to avoid disassembly which happened three times  the multiple warnings that i had to register at ifit as the unit was locked until i did were crazy as i did not choose to buy ifit   it is about    month after  free  month  the unit looks and feels sturdy now that four hours were spent on assembly some my fault as i disassembled assembled a few times to get it right  i am hoping that it will last a number of years  i will update if it does not if the treadmill does not outlasts me      
365,4.0,                       i bought this on a prime day deal and loved the price delivery promised  am to noon  and will call    minutes before arriving no message or sightings by  pm and i went on an errand  upon return several hours later found it on my front porch   never got a message   so i had to recruit some help to get this down the basement  the package is well over       unpacking and assembly is straightforward   if you have basic mechanical skills  you re good to go tried to start it up  completely dead   customer phone line not open on sunday   customer internet chat looks like a bot and unable to provide any help   next day   we re experiencing a much higher than normal call volume  please hold    eventually told to remove the motor cover panel there it is   the multi pin connector to the motor control board was never plugged in   unlikely that it came loose in shipping because it has a latch to hold it together once it s attached   we re good to go as for the treadmill  it does everything i want for walking  mph on   degree incline  and it s much quieter and softer than the    yr old one this replaced   for     bucks i d say it s a really good value in treadmills   i m not using the ifit workout stuff at all  but you activate one time initially with the blue button and it starts up right away every time without doing anything more than putting on the key like any other treadmill      
366,5.0,                       delivery left it in garage   husband   little help from me  propped it on dollies and brought inside to unbox and assemble if you are not handy   call someone   but if you can read and follow instructions and use screwdrivers  etc   you ll be fine   he had it up and running in less than an hour   you have to put together the console   handles  it weighs too much to lift now that it s up i use it everyday   i bypasses the ifit trial   i probably could have found a smaller simpler treadmill but this is pretty quiet  except my feet landing   i m going for sitting in the morning to walking while listening to stuff or reading   it will be awile before i run on it   i love the incline   it s enough to add interest and difficulty at      price point   i m happy      
367,5.0,                       i have been running for most of my life i have used and purchased other treadmills  for the last few years i have gone to a fitness center for my indoor running   winters are long   because of the pandemic i have had to purchase a tread if i want to run indoors  i read the reviews  and horror stories  and i thought i knew what to expect when ordering this product  i was wrong       this treadmill is well designed and manufactured  mechanical engineer   for the cost i was totally surprised and very pleased  it took about  hrs  to assemble  i decided not to enroll in the subscription ifit  and just run it in manual  i don t need and coaching  i feel this is a quality product    what a surprise      
368,5.0,                       i guess i didn t know what i was missing  i had an old treadmill for a long time before i bought this new nordictrack  wow    what was i thinking not buying a new treadmill sooner  this thing is so nice  it s quiet and feels amazing to run on  the ifit feature is so nice  it has so many levels of fitness that literally anyone can use it  i love this thing i also paid for amazon to come to my home and build it  worth every single penny  the guy was in and out in    mins  he clearly knew what he was doing  very professional as well      
369,1.0,                       this item started off good met my basic needs for a treadmill  i m a pretty lightweight guy  so i didn t need anything particularly sturdy however  a little less than a year later  this treadmill stopped working properly  the belt did not stay in place correctly and began to tear as it rubbed against the side of the machine  the machine is on a level surface in the basement and has a mat underneath it  it is regularly taken care of and kept in a child free  pet free home  it isn t used daily and is used by a     lb male  there is no reason for it to have deteriorated this quickly  nordictrack is unwilling to fix the issue unless i pay      parts   which makes little sense for a      machine don t waste your money on this cheap item pay a couple hundred more for an item that will last longer and ultimately save you money on maintenance      
370,3.0,                       treadmill would probably be ok if it would work as expected this treadmill was delivered on december    and assembled on january    the incline would not work you can only walk at level zero first amazon customer service has been amazing  when i could not reach nordic track through their customer service number i used option on amazon website to help with troubleshooting issues  amazon was able to cut through all the red tape and wait time on a phone tree with nordic track  the amazon rep did the waiting and called me back once a live person was on the phone  what a difference  when i had tried to call nordic track  all i got was a phone tree and recording that said if i was having mechanical issues i had to have the motor assembly cover already removed before they would even help  i m not doing that  nordictrack   most all exercise machines now come with a option to join ifit  which is a subscription service for personal work outs  i don t know if this is just nordic track  but you cannot even start your machine until you sign up for ifit  once your ifit account is activated it will send a signal to the machine and it will unlock  for me  it was about    minutes before i could turn on the treadmill  basically you re being blackmailed to sign up whether you want ifit or not   on the ifit website there is no option that says i do not wish to join  i just kept pushing through the screens  once you get to the screen that s asking for how many months you want to join and payment information just don t select anything  again there is no option for  no thanks     no incline   once i was able to speak with a representative at nordic track the representative did some troubleshooting over the phone and ordered two parts that should repair the machine under warranty and that the repair rep would contact me within a week on delivery  nordic track said that they would be tracking those shipments and a repair technician will be in contact me once they were delivered  i gave them five days and had to reach out to nordic track again  it would be another week before the repair person could get here  the repair technician was at my home on february    and installed the parts that have been ordered  the technician told  me there were some bad wiring on the motor and replaced it  however that did not fix the incline  the console also has electrical issues and does not send the signal to the motor to engage the incline  additional parts were ordered  and nordic track now tells me that the console is on back order for another   to   weeks   i m really wondering how long this machine is going to last because it seems like the whole thing has a lot of electrical issues  i have asked nordic track to simply replace the machine but i m now outside of the    day return window   i m trying to be optimistic that once all repairs are made i will basically have a whole new machine but i won t buy nordicctrack again and cannot recommend      
371,5.0,                       i run usually    x week  and i usually run     miles per run  however  in the past i have gone up to   miles on this treadmill  i am a male     lbs and about        so not huge  but not small  either   this treadmill is amazing  it s solidly built  runs well  and is dependable  to be honest  i bought one  used it for a year  sold it when i moved to a different house  and thought i would try a cheaper treadmill  within two weeks  i sold the new one and bought myself another one of these t series   they re that good  absolutely worth the few extra bucks over the cheaper           models   overall  i can t rate this high enough  and i recommend it to anyone who just wants a good treadmill that s going to just work      
372,2.0,                       i have been looking for days to buy a treadmill and i decided to get this particular one because the description says   x   tread belt and that was a decision maker to me     well the belt is like most of the other treadmills in the market which is   x       i just hate when they don t tell you the real deal         
373,1.0,                       we were super excited to get this treadmill  but when we opened it to assemble we discovered major damage to the base  it appears that not only was the hard plastic damaged  but it may have also cut into the belt  unfortunately this item is out of stock  so we couldn t just get a replacement      
374,1.0,                       i m hoping both amazon and nordictrack takes the time to read this review  i needed a treadmill for home and ordered the nordictrack t     s  i thought it was a good deal and it s a nordictrack    a well known and reputative brand name  that was my first mistake  after waiting    days for delivery  the box arrived damaged  the shipper assured me it s just the cardboard and shouldn t be any issues  why nordictrack would package a      pound treadmill in a flimsy cardboard box was beyond anything i ve seen before  upon opening the box  and i took photos of everything   most of the styrofoam was broken  not a good sign  i found one small plastic piece broken and snapped off   from something  i started to assemble the treadmill and literally found most of the hardware impossible to screw into the parts    metal going into metal  some bad screw hole locations  which made it extremely difficult to even start the bolt by hand  on step   of the instructions  step   was registering the product online and step   was fishing a cable through one of the uprights with a very long twist tie cord   the ground screw wouldn t go in  no matter how much effort and pressure i put into it  the screw wouldn t fit  i had to go into my private hardware stash and find a more appropriate screw  which somewhat worked  upon installing the left and right uprights  which took way too long than it should ve due to the hardware and hole locations   the manufacturer had   screws in the handles  in holes that were supposed to be removed and discarded  one screw snapped upon trying to remove  another screw wouldn t come out at all cause there wasn t enough clearance for the head  i have no idea how they put that screw in the first place    most likely crooked and at an angle   i managed to removed   of the   screws  when i was examining the suggested hardware to attach the control console to the uprights  the provided screws wouldn t go into the holes whatsoever  remind you  all of this is intended to be installed by hand and not with power tools  nonetheless  i tried a power tool to see if these screws would go into the metal ports  and they wouldn t go in  the holes were machined way too small for the screws  the console itself had screws put in from the manufacturer that needed to be discarded and replaced with provided hardware  at this point  i gave up  the treadmill is seriously flawed and required custom drilling and or different hardware than what was provided  i didn t even get half way through the instructions  much of the hardware was still sealed  but i was done with this mess and initiated a return online with a few grueling phone calls with amazon representatives  who didn t speak clear english and was completely unhelpful i consider myself very good with assembling these type of things  electronics  furniture  systems  etc   but i couldn t believe how poorly engineered and manufactured this treadmill was  parts alone didn t fit well together  i was also completely shocked it bared the nordictrack name on it  as i believed them to provide high quality products  sadly  this treadmill was far from that  if not the worst piece of equipment i ve ever had to assemble in my entire life the repackaging for the return was another disaster  but after strain and sprains  i was able to successfully disassemble what i managed to assemble initially  repackage  lift a      pound box and carefully shrink wrap it  it s ready to be picked up and looks far better now than when it was delivered  i have a   day wait for them to get it  meanwhile  this huge awkward box sits in my livingroom near the front door nordictrack failed hugely on this mess of a treadmill  it s quality control and engineering is a disaster  i still need a treadmill and now will have to wait for this return and refund to offset my funds before buying a different brand extremely disappointed all around with this experience      
375,5.0,                       i had a super old treadmill that was given to me and it finally wore out  i am a  wogger  so didn t need anything super fancy   the controls are easy to use  the running surface has plenty of room front to back and side to side  it s easy to fold up and easy to lower  there s hydraulics so you aren t having to lower and worry about dropping the platform as it comes down  i love the lip on the face to set my phone or ipad on to keep me entertained  my only small complaint  but it s minor is that the side rails are pretty fat and not great for small hands  can t get a good grip on them but just took some getting used to  also noteworthy  when you hit the stop button  it stops pretty quick so either hop off and hit stop or have it at a slow speed and hit stop  very happy i purchased this treadmill      
376,4.0,                       i wish the transaction had gone through in december        the correct treadmill arrived on february            if my son were not working from home  it would have been impossible for any woman to set it up   we finally decided that the best place for it was in the den that has tv in it so that i can watch morning joe and exercise at the same time  indeed  nordic track t     si is the best thing that i ever bought for myself   my workout speed is set on three for twenty minutes which is age appropriate for me i am    years old   i love this treadmill because it improves not only my body  but also my mind   i recommend the nordic track t     si for anyone who is tall enough to use it      
377,4.0,                       we researched over    treadmills suited for an at home beginner   we paid for the assembly technician   the product arrived on schedule from nordic trac   and the amazon com assembly arrived on time with tools in hand and seemed very competent   the problem was  we live in an apartment and the item was delivered to the front door   he was able to bring the treadmill in the house and fortunately  there was a construction crew next door who helped him bring in into the office where we wanted it   the problem occurred soon after when he discovered nordic trac sent two left arm rails  rather than a left and a right   he had to leave   i had to register the treadmill with nordic trac  chat with their customer service and get a replacement right arm rail and then reschedule the assembly   while everyone did their job in getting everything fixed  it s a shame so many people had to spend so much time fixing something one person in the warehouse caused by not paying attention to what is called the  pick list  when putting parts in a box update  nordic trac sent a replacement part for the missing right arm   it was not the right part   i had to contact them and start the replacement part all over again   the second  right arm  arrived and is was also the wrong one   i examined the part and saw that it would fit into the panel display even though it was longer than the left arm and did not come with the silicon arm sleeve as the left ones did the assembly tech came out as scheduled and i just hope he could make it work   he did   he removed the silicon sweat cover from the extra left arm that was originally in the box  put it on the right arm which was too long   my machine is finally up and running thanks to the cleverness of the assembly tech   no thanks to nordic trac   no fault of amazon com   my right handrail is installed  has the silicon sleeve on it and it just   or   inches longer than the left hand rail and the right hand rail is not completely covered by the silicon sleeve   i could have started round three with nordic trac  but i ran out of steam and threw my hands up      
378,4.0,                       overall seems like a great treadmill for the price  has everything i need and none of the junk i don t  love the  speed dial  buttons to quickly set a preset speed and get going immediately without having to tap an inordinate number of touchscreen controls  assembly requires two people why it s not   stars    the silver screw was damaged on delivery  based on reviews comments it seems others have also had this issue  contacted nordictrack and waiting for a response  meanwhile  using screw that was originally screwed in    ifit activation could not be bypassed on this model  maybe it s been updated  but there s a free trial with no commitment and manual mode can continue to be used afterwards  still  would have been ideal to be able to use the treadmill with no activation    there is no perfect place to put my phone on this treadmill  the cupholders are large but not in a way where i can place my phone flat  which seems to exacerbate the rattling of my phone during a run    a top speed higher than    mph would have been nice    there doesn t seem to be a way to set weight  resulting in an inaccurate calories burned count      
379,1.0,                       i like to run outside but when the weather is bad or i m on call for work its nice to get my workout at home so i can quickly grab my things and go  i wanted to stick with a reputable brand so i checked out nordick track  based on my running i thought the t    would work perfectly price was ok  assembly was fine  folds easily enough  i bought the   year service plan  not long into having it  all the issues started  not being a treadmill technician i wasn t sure what was going on but the display was not controlling the speed incline  i worked with a nordick track and they determined it was a computer board issue  they refused to send a technician but did send a new computer board  after installing  the treadmill didnt work right  a few more back and forth phone calls and the nordic track tech now says its the motor  so they sent a new motor  again  wouldn t send a technician   after installing the new motor it still didn t work right i didnt have time to be on the phone all day to figure out the issues so the treadmill sat collecting dust  then the  your warranty is expiring  calls started  i explained my situation and nothing ever came of it  eventually the emails and phone calls stopped not the best experience  try another brand      
380,2.0,                       i bought this product based upon the name of the company  nordicktrack   my assumption that this would be a high quality product as evidenced by the fact they advertise it with a three years parts warranty  however  after owning the nordicktrack for    months  the running plate under the belt cracked while i was running  i twisted my ankle and could have hurt myself more  when i contacted the company  they are refusing to stand behind the product  they are telling me that i should have bought an extended warranty when it is marketed as a three year parts warranty  that seems like a bait and switch to me  i keep reaching out the the company but they refuse to do the right thing  buyer beware      
381,5.0,                       my husband and i are both tall people              respectively  and i big concern about purchasing a treadmill for home use was that it would be too small for our long legs  we researched  read hundreds of reviews and bit the bullet  we could not be happier with this treadmill  it s a good size for the home but is still plenty long enough for a full stride  it folds up well and takes up minimal space when not in use  overall  an excellent machine and one we both would recommend      
382,2.0,                       they treadmill is locked and can not be used until you sign up for their silly app  the app is laggy and worthless  the installation instruction are ok but fail to mention to put on the covers on the posts before installing them  you won t know this until the end when it would require dismantling the whole thing to put the covers on   once you get it working its ok up to  mph  past that if you step wrong it feels too wobbly for me      lb    the cover upfront is too close to your feet when you are running as well  so if you like being close to the handles when you run your are going to step on the cover and that s also unsafe imo   over all its ok for the price  and perfect if you will be doing light running at lower speeds  and it s just barely acceptable if you are doing any sort of medium intensity running  anything serious i would look somewhere else      
383,2.0,                       a bit too much weak plastic so the plastic tends to be broken  biggest issue is there is no suppot from nordictrack  they use icon company in their warranty and i emailed to reach out to them  x so far  no response  my treadmill is left broken  one of the screw at the rear that meant to attack the platform to the rear plastic is broken  the screw is screwed in some plastic where the plastic broke off completely  so when i run the plastic vibrate and bang against each other making load noises  i also read from facebook nordictrack page that they barely reply and also no parts to fix  so don t even bother with purchasing warranty  matter of fact  stay away from nordictrack and get a peloton if you like to avoid unsatisfied customer support      
384,1.0,                       the treadmill was relatively easy to assemble  but to my chagrin the unit does not work   all the displays work  set time and date etc   but the belt motor and incline motor do not operate   working with nautilus to try and get something working  they are sending parts as problem is diagnosed   first attempt was to send a third party tech to work on it  but that fell through after two weeks   getting more parts and will replace them myself   it looks good but this problem is really annoying      
385,1.0,                       well the item arrived earlier then expected and i felt this was a positive sign  however assembly was much harder then expected  screws do not line up accurately so i spent half an hour just getting the control mounted  after assembly i proceeded to activate the machine  the instructions for this are not real clear  once activated i found out the machine has a bad mainboard so it doesn t work at all  called the customer service spent half a day troubleshooting and now i m waiting on a new main board  i can only hope this works once installed  the shipping box is gone so shipping it back is not possible   the entire experience frankly has left me with a bad taste for nordic track products  lots of hype and glitz but inferior products  wont make this mistake again  its probably a thousand dollars down the drain      
386,1.0,                       we purchased treadmill  not understanding that a     hp won t handle repeated heavy running sessions  it will only handle light walking and maybe jogging or not depending on how much you weigh  that was not clearly presented in the ad  this was first issue   the two guys that delivered it were very big men and could barely get it upstairs  it was that heavy  we finally got an  assembly  person to come out today  do not go with amazon home services     you need to have two people do the assembly  the guy that was sent out was rude and nasty  snapping at us  could barely stand and his hands shook violently  he got out a razorblade  we don t know why  as he had finished cutting the ties with scissors   and then he cut his finger  there was blood and i went to get a bandaid  and after he lost a screw and could barely screw in the post  i asked him politely to leave  he became argumentative and demanded to know why  i finally had to threaten to call the police  it was a horrible experience and we are returning the item after making numerous attempts to resolve the situation and get two people out here to assembly  which home services does not understand is needed or the item  to safely hold and support while the other person threads and connects    i hope this helps others      
387,4.0,                       this thing was a nightmare to assemble  there simply must be a better way to package this thing  you most definitely need two people  maybe even three  and you have to spend a good bit of time deciphering the instructions   i still don t know what all the numbers are for associated with the parts   go ahead and pay extra for assembly if you can  however  once assembled  it is a decent treadmill and gets the job done  our unit has an inaccurate heart rate sensor  but it is not important for us to have this feature in the treadmill itself  everything else seems to work fine our only  complaint  is that the  up  position for this treadmill leaves it leaning quite a bit on a short hydraulic bar  this is very different from other treadmills we have had that raised up completely and then locked in place  it seems to be steady  but the look of it leaning makes us a little uneasy and worried it might fall  however  there haven t been any functional problems with it and it does let down nice and smoothly about the ifit lock  other reviews are correct  you can hold down the ifit button for thirty seconds to bypass the lock with no problem at all  your treadmill will then start right up  there is no need to sign up for ifit if you don t want that service      
388,5.0,                       i ve been using treadmills for the past    year  this is my  rd one in that time  i was hesitant to purchase this because it was a tad under     dollars and i m used to paying at least a grand  i figured it would be flimsy but i was way wrong  this treadmill so far  after   months  is rock solid  the wife and i have been using it in total for   hours a day   days a week assembly i have to be honest  the assembly was a little bit tough but if you get stuck just walk away for a few minutes and come back with a clear head  some of the bolts and screws were really hard to start off but just take your time  also use some wd    i love that this treadmill uses real bolts for the main connection points  arms attaching to base   my last treadmill used bolts that you needed an allen key to tighten and of course we all know those strip after a while first use of course we all know from previous reviews to bypass ifit hold down the ifit button for    seconds with the safety key plugged in  during the first use i noticed it was really noisy  not clanking but when you walked on the belt it was making a swishing noise  i called nordictrack and after some troubleshooting i found my belt was too tight  you should be able to lift the belt at the center   inches or so  i loosened the belt and the noise definitely got better  the nordictrack person heard the swishing and send me some lube which fixed the problem i was hesitant because it only has a    hp motor but it really is solid  i notice no whining when increasing speed  it takes right off overall i love this treadmill and learned that you don t have to pay over a grand to get a quality treadmill      
389,5.0,                       so far  so good  my husband and i set this up in a little less than an hour  there are a lot of reviews that reference being duped into paying for ifit  but i think they must be doing something wrong  this treadmill came with a card that has a code for a year of free ifit membership  i followed the very clearly laid out instructions and had no problem  i am using the membership now and was not charged  i will be charged for another year once this year is up if i don t cancel in time  cancellation instructions also seem really clear  you just have to read other than that  i really like that you can quickly select a change in speed on the right side of the panel   i was not expecting that to make any difference for me  but i m realizing it s way better than sitting there and holding down a button when going between sprinting and walking   the treadmill is relatively quiet and the display is great   it s a little slow to load when initially turned on and when going between programs  but i have not had any lagging problems in the middle of workouts   so far  no complaints      
390,1.0,                       this is nordictrack product but it s locked by ifit   it s not only very challenging to activate  it s very not user friendly   grandma or grandpa for sure cannot operate   below are issues i had with this product    delivery  amazon took forever to deliver the product   it was delivered    weeks later    the plastic cover with nordictrack logo was cracked    installation      metal screw that holds the handle bar does not fit   supposed to be    metal screw instead   i had to buy    screw from home depot to get the job done   and      inch length is not okay      inch is correct spec    activation  unless you login and activate through ifit  it will not start   not sure why nordictrack did this   this is very bad user experience   certainly a big pain in the butt   and it s not straight forward either       usage  after activation treadmill started but when you  stop  you can t  start  unless it s turn off   very annoying   i suspect it has something to do with ifit activation synchronization    in summary   not sure why i can t plug in and enjoy my treadmill after long tedious installation without going through ifit activation   for sure it wasn t my best amazon delivery experience    i will not recommend this product due to many installation and activation related issues      
391,5.0,                       i love my nordictrack treadmill  it s perfect for what i need and i love the ifit subscription too  since not going to the gym  investing in my own home equipment was the best thing i could ve done for myself  so far this treadmill has worked really well with no problems and i did purchase the extended warranty through nordictrack if any unforeseen issues come up in the future      
392,5.0,                       i tried the free    day trial for ifit out of curiosity and have fully bought into the program  there s more than just running or walking in the app    also strength training  hiit and yoga pilates  the treadmill was easy to assemble by the instructions  i only needed help holding it up for me to put the storage bar in  as expected in the instructions and the other reviews   very smooth motors for incline and speed progression  great machine  delivery was via a box truck and he helped push it into the house even though he couldn t enter due to covid  when i called to confirm delivery dates they even gave me the option to move my delivery date up which i jumped on  great money saver in this unit if you already have a tablet to run ifit on if you re going to use that feature      
393,4.0,                       i hate exercise with a white hot passion  but i m ok with walking  i got this treadmill because i wasn t getting in enough steps since covid hit as i ve been teleworking  i did my research and this one fit my budget  and independent reviews were good the instructions said it would take two people about two hours to set it up  this is accurate initial operation was easy  i just logged into the website  entered the particulars and off i went my ipad easily connected via bluetooth  so i ve been using the ifit program  i m not a fan of listening to a trainer yelling at me so i go along on the walks and listen to music or podcasts  the progressively more difficult programs work very well i have a small house  and while the treadmill isn t small  it fit into a small room  folding it up us easy although rarely necessary the varying incline adds a nice dimension to my workouts  if the walk is flat  sometimes i ll increase the incline to make the workout more effective  similarly  if the walk is too slow i can increase the speed this is very good for people who are out of shape who want to do something about it  i ve only missed a couple days since i received it in early january  and unlike most workouts  i m sticking with it a friend ordered one on my recommendation so i have a sort of virtual  work out buddy   and we recommend workouts to each other   it s surfy  relatively quiet  and i haven t had any problems with it thus far my only issue isn t the treadmill  but the delivery  i paid a bit extra for delivery  to a room    it was left on a pallet in my garage  which isn t  a room    it weighs     pounds  so it isn t like you can just haul it into the house  make sure you have someone who can help you get it where you want it      
394,5.0,                       this treadmill is an absolute steal under  k  the quality is far superior than what i was expecting  the only word of warning is when i received it a month ago i put it together by myself  i would not recommend that  make sure you have someone helping you assemble the treadmill  there are some steps where an extra person really helps out  anyways now that it is assembled i use it to walk run use the ifit interactive workouts are awesome too  the membership is optional but really makes you feel like you have a trainer working with you  since i have started noticing myself get in shape i really could not be doing it without such a quality treadmill  at the price they have it at now it is an absolute steal  period     
395,3.0,                       dislikes  too many little screws during assembly  auto makers learned the lesson of build it in  don t tack it on years ago  the instructions tell you to run the wire for the screen through the bottom  wrong  the hole the wire is secured to with a screw about   inches from the bottom of the inside upright during shipping is the hole for the wiring  during operation the undercarriage squeaks alot  like an old car needing a lube job  there were two plastic covers for the bottom of the uprights that had holes predrilled for screws  but didn t come with any  they just rest on top of the inside uprights loosely likes  the motor is fairly quiet  i m glad i got the bigger belt size  both length and width  it helps keep you centered should you misstep  the software did require a credit card to use  supposedly if you cancel before renewal you get a credit  i wasn t able to find a training video that went more than about    minutes max  playing the same route over and over until you reach your time limit is not optimal and would require you to restart which means stopping in the middle of your workout  being able to que a couple videos to start when one ends would be better  why not provide an hdmi output so people can connect to their tv s    that dinky little screen is for the birds  i only used the machine for about   weeks till the good weather broke and the covid outbreak had leveled off  but will use it on rainy days and when the cold weather comes again so i can t speak to longevity or durability but i did purchase the   year extended warranty just in case  overall initial quality feels good      
396,1.0,                       unbelievable   it worked great for   weeks and dies   triggered circuit breaker and now won t turn on   called local equipment repair person and he laughed when i said it was nordictrack    they keep me in business   he said i might consider updating this review but for now  stay away   it s fantastic while it works   too bad it last    days        
397,5.0,                       we bought this recently and spent a lot of time looking for the right one  my wife and i are used to the quality treadmills at the gym  but covid is a mean mean thing  since gyms are off limits we bought this with hesitation as we re not sure it could hold up to running or that it would t few sturdy  after a solid week of use  i can tell you i do not regret the purchase one bit  it is solid  it is sturdy  it has everything we need and feels almost as good as the gym  we now have   of us using it daily and it holds up well  i had no intention of using ifit as that seems like garbage to me  just hold the ifit button for    seconds and you never have to register nor think of it again  highly recommend     
398,1.0,                       i was super excited but had the worst experience ever  it was delivered broken parts and missing nuts  just the bolts were present on one side   which shows their low qc  i called them which promptly shipped those but asked me not to use this expensive piece of equipment  so there went another week  when i finally received the parts  i noticed the nuts were old  still tried to make it work but turns out  to put these missing nuts in place i need access to the bolts  to access the bolts i need to pop the top open which voids warranty    so spoke with amazon and tried to return it but even that is huge hassle  it s just unbearable with such a big equipment like that so now back to trying to get nordictrack to fix this thing  most expensive headache i ever had        
399,5.0,                       as many people have been doing  my wife and decided to cancel our gym memberships and invest in our own workout equipment  this nordictrack has proven to be worth the investment  we both feel much more motivated to go for a walk or run knowing we can go downstairs and hop on the treadmill  it is easy to use and many different pre set workouts  it was easy to put together  definitely requires two people  and easy to fold up if required  if you re looking to cancel your gym memberships and workout at home  this is a great product for you      
400,1.0,                       had the product   weeks  and it died         screen reflects everything fine but the treadmill doesn t move   after talking with the nordic track help desk  took   hours to get to a live person  chat was just as bad   they quickly identified that the motor control board fried due to an update they sent out   it doesn t happen on all treadmills but it s a known issue thats been around for months  they were debating on issuing a recall    it sounds like my  new  treadmill tried to apply the update and it fried the control board       weeks for a replacement part to be sent out  backordered  update after    weeks  the replacement motor control board arrived and it was doa   the vendor is clueless and there warranty is useless   additionally  the   year extended warranty was useless because  the fine print  indicates that they don t cover any defects that the manufacturer should cover     nordic track customer service  phone or chat  is under staffed  to give you an idea of how under staffed they are  their online chat service has a    hour and    minute wait   i could understand the issue if this was month   of covid  however  this is an online service and this is not month   of covid   nordic track just doesn t care about the customer after the purchase  buyer beware  buyer beware   nordictrack is selling products with known defects      
401,2.0,                       assembly was annoying but not terrible   the engineering design and manufacturing of the treadmill is poor at best after assembly we attempted to log onto the ifit website to register and unlock the treadmill   the web page keeps reverting back to canada while we live in the us so we were unable to register   was not using a vpn   if this happens to you  hold down the ifit sync button for about    seconds and the machine will enable   once the machine was on we started the motor and   nothing   i could hear the motor running but the belt was not moving   pulled the front cover off  your toes point to it while running  by removing   small screws to access the motor and discovered that the belt was not tensioned properly as seen in the pic   also  and more importantly  the motor sits at about a      degree angle to the tread belt arbor  pic      this will cause the belt to prematurely wear and potentially create thrust against the bearings causing them to fail   the bracket that holds the motor to the frame is welded so there is no way to rotate the motor around the z axis on the x plane this machine seems to be designed with planned engineered obsolescence to ensure that it fails at a expedited rate      
402,2.0,                       i decided to wait a few months to write a review  i ve had this treadmill for about   months now and i feel i can give an adequate review  for quick review  go to bottom  the treadmill itself is nice  however  it has a weird feeling under foot that i have never experienced on commercial treadmills before  almost as if you can feel the belt rubbing against the surface of the machine as you put pressure from your feet down  annoying  yes  does it affect the workout  not really  just a minor agitation in sound and in the feeling for the first few rounds  going under     speed makes it almost unbearable though  running on it is nice  it has a nice bounce so i don t feel like my knees are dying quite as badly the biggest frustration is the ifit program  i find ifit to be the most annoying app to work with  i like treadmills to have the pre programmed training exercises so that i can do a good incline workout without having to figure out the incline myself  ifit only offers fitness trainers directing your workout which also triggers the speed  i am okay with a random unknown incline  i am not okay with watching tv and all of the sudden my treadmill is pushing  mph when i was hoping for a brisk walk overall   the treadmill isn t bad  but the program in it is  so  unless you want to be bound to either always manually adjusting speed and inclines or having a trainer have full control of what you re doing   i d go with something different  i do warn that i ve noticed a lot of treadmills have the ifit program so i d check that first simplified version pros  treadmill is sturdy touch screen is well lit and has good response incline and speed very easy to usecons  belt feels like its dragging   especially under     speeds ifit is awful the manual option is very limited no pre programmed workouts that don t involve an annoying traineroverall  i think the price is way too much for how strict it is with the ifit program and google maps is pretty lacking  a regular treadmill could get the job done a lot better and would probably cost around            
403,5.0,                       i purchased this treadmill for home use  i m not a super avid runner  and i only usually go as fast as      but this treadmill does go up to    for both incline and speed  i was worried at first that the belt was a little narrow  but after running several times on it i have had no problems  the buttons are responsive and the belt speed is accurate  the heart monitor  as they usually are  does not appear to be super accurate  but i don t rely on the built in one on the treadmill anyway  it does also come with built in workouts  which i haven t yet explored as i mostly use this for running and rucking  when you purchase this  it does try to make you feel like you have to sign up for the ifit trial   you do not have to do that  if you simply hold the down the ifit button on the console  it will let you bypass that  finally  this treadmill is a beast to put together  the housings for the bolts are not great  and often you have to torque the bolts pretty hard to get them in  it took my husband and i about three hours to fully assemble  i would recommend having a marriage counsellor on call if you want to make it through the assembly phase still happily married  seriously  it was incredibly difficult  and the treadmill is remarkably heavy to boot  however  i still rate this little beauty five stars  because the performance of the machine has been stellar   i would highly recommend      
404,4.0,                       i ve upped my stars from   to   now that i ve used it a few times  it works well with just a few caveats  i had to adjust the belt again on my first usage which i did and it now seems to track pretty good  note that the adjustment turn is the opposite of what is described in the manual   the only other issue is the built in heart beat monitor  its sketchy at best but i m comparing it to the       cardiac unit i had been using  i will investigate the chest monitor from nordic track to see if it might be more accurate  lastly  the incline does not retract when its stopped so if you don t want to damage the unit when its lifted out of the way  one needs to remember to set the incline to        
405,5.0,                       as mentioned in a review earlier  you do not need to sign up for ifit  just hold down the ifit sync button for    seconds and it works fine it was easy to put together with   people  i should have read the instructions instead of my husband because we made it all the way to the end and realized we never put the protective covers on the front legs    whatever not the end of the world works great  i purchased a mat to go under the treadmill however if you are planning to use it at full incline the mat scrunch up under it  so we may take it out from under the treadmill all in all i m extremely happy with my purchase      
406,5.0,                       got it today and i am in love  exactly what i was looking for  it s sturdy  the incline is great and the speed  it s pretty quite and comfortable walking on it  it does cushion nicely on walking and running  this treadmill is close to what you will find in a gym  believe it or not but my    year old son put it all together    took about   hrs so plan for some time  thanks to another reviewer on here  you can use the treadmill without subscribing to ifit  the package and the stickers said the treadmill is locked and you need to register and subscribe but that s not true  i turned it on and held the ifit button down for over    sec  and it worked  now all i do is turn the switch on and start my work out  i would say the only negative item so far is that the on off button is so far down  but that s really all i can complain about it  delivery was fast and it came in one piece and not damaged  since it is quite heavy  if you don t have muscle and a heavy duty cart you might want to opt for indoor delivery      
407,1.0,                           i despised  trying to register to no avail    internet site extremely complicated with a  trap  to keep you signed up for over      a year even with   year free trial   mega page of legalese  fine print     impossible to comprehend   see above   get professional set up   took over    hours  huge boxes  to get rid of   several bolts and screws left over after construction    because of extreme signup and registration complications   phone calls end in dead end   can t talk to any one  because  i m not registered            hello     requires a smart phone  in the process   i have a flip flop    extreme frustration with nordic track and all concerned     don t  buy   see all above   no real contact by phone or internet     extreme sorry i bought it rather than another brand    come and get it get professional     
408,1.0,                       i ve had the nordic track for   months and i tried to plug my tablet into the machine and all of a sudden it went dark and it won t power on  well i ve called nordic track a few times and it s been an awful experience  the first person i talked to was quite nasty and i couldn t believe the things she was telling me over the phone  she asked me if i heard about the  maskless protesters  in my state and called them a bunch of  karens   i honestly didn t even know what to say back to her  but the good news is she did her job and mailed the part to me that i needed and gave me the number to the technician who was supposed to install it  the only problem is i cannot reach the technician  i have been trying to get ahold of the technician for over   weeks now with no success  i ve literally called him at least    times   so i have called nordic track back twice to ask them to reach out to the technician for me and they write in their notes that they will reach out but it s becoming pretty clear that i m going to have to try and figure out how to install the lcd screen myself  the machine comes with   year warranty on labor and   year warranty on parts so to be clear  the parts warranty was honored but not the labor  it doesn t surprise me that the product failed seeing as how nordic track has weird people working for their company      
409,3.0,                       putting the treadmill together was difficult due to several screw holes not compatible   after fully assembling and inspecting the treadmill  we found that there were two large cracks   one on teh back of the display assembly and one at the bottom left rear  foot    we do not want to try to disassemble and return the beast but we are extremely disappointed to spend this much money to have a broken piece of machinery  and we hope the broken foot doesn t impact safety or stability    the treadmill works well and we are happy with it s function  but having it cracked is not acceptable      
410,5.0,                       i am extremely satisfied and proud of my decision to go ahead with the purchase of this treadmill  it s been close to   months since we bought this and my teenage kids are addicted to it and haven t missed a day running on the treadmill  they are glued to the challenging programs that i fit programs provide and in due course have become good long distance runners  it s just a perfect treadmill with a boatload of capabilities that can be tweaked for seniors  young adults  and teenage kids  i just love the engineering behind it and it doesn t make a squeak even when a heavy weight like me runs on it the assembling took a little effort and once done it was worth it  i would recommend this treadmill to anyone who is planning to have themselves or their kids have a good workout routine or start on a good habit of incorporating work out in to their daily life and i promise this wont disappoint you as it has done wonders to my family      
411,4.0,                       i had difficulties with assembling treadmill in couple of areas    with the ground wire having self drilling screw   the given screw was not a right fit for the hole in treadmill  i had to struggle a lot to identify the correct one    with the hydrallic bars   the bar had a small plastic to hold the lever inside the bar but the lever came out as soon as the plastic holder was taken off which made the alignment fall off and complicated the fixtures as for as the treadmill is concerned  the product is good and sturdy   i have had few walk jog in the last few days and all the time it was perfect  pretty good product  overall its good but little bit of difficulty with the assembly      
412,5.0,                       i love my nordictrack treadmill  i was very sceptical and searched all around the web to find a really good machine that would fit my budget after searching for quite some time i came across my new nordictrack treadmill and read nothing but great things about it first and foremost the money is worth it  of you go for anything less than      to      on a treadmill  most likely you are going to get a cheap device that will work for you but won t last  my nordictrack t series     has sensors for you to place your hands and see your heart rate like you do at the gym  the same is pretty neat  it is as if i was at the gym  not to mention i was concerned about the weight limit capacity and it is able to withstand up to     lbs  the width of the belt is wide enough for running  something you can t do on other treadmills that are around the      range  another thing i love is being able to fold the treadmill by raising the belt mechanism  i also have the option of connecting using a     mm jack any decive to play music to the integrated speakers the treadmill has  another thing to love is the two empty sections it has that will allow you to place your bottle of water or thermo  it s just great i wish it was able to connect the speakers via bluetooth  but things like that cost more money   i just needed a machine that would allow me to work out and get into the shape a need to stay healthy  this nordictrack t     does exactly that  i have presets for workouts and if you are willing to pay extra for a personal coach the treadmill has the capability to connect to your account and get ifit  there is a membership involved and i read you get great workouts by subscribing  at this point i won t do this but maybe in the future i will  i am happy with my treadmill  if i had to plan on buying a treadmill again i would definitely go with nordictrack without any regrets thank you nordictrack  i hope you guys keep up the good work with your equipment      
413,1.0,                       i didn t know that you could bypass registering the treadmill for        a month and even though i was incredibly frustrated   it took me   weeks to put it together all by myself and there was no way i was sending it back  if you don t register it will literally beep at you basically torturing you until you sign up  i have yet to try the bypass or cancelling my membership but i do feel incredibly frustrated with how nordictrack is marketing this product and forcing people to sign up  for a membership  also  don t be further scammed and make sure that if you purchase you only pay the      because they like to raise the price to over        in high demand  i had to order twice and they cancelled my first order in order to sell it to someone else for a higher price speaking to the actual treadmill  i think that it works very well and the shock absorption makes the running experience a lot smoother than the nordictrack that i got    years ago  i really enjoyed it once i got running on it but due to the bad business practices ad blatant deception  i cannot recommend that you get this product from this site      
414,5.0,                       we have had this treadmill a week now  i have done two ifit classes every night and have been so much more motivated to use my treadmill   this treadmill lowers and lofts very easy  the treadmill itself is very heavy when it is delivered  the treadmill is made of very durable material and is a great value if you don t care for all the tablet stuff they try selling you on these days  this one does have a spot you can place a tablet if you wish that being said   on another note don t expect amazon to follow their own delivery instructions  our delivery was supposed to be delivered inside and they blocked our garage trapping me inside all day until my husband was home  amazon basically stated they can t control what their own drivers do      
415,5.0,                       i got the    s with the   in display  in my initial research  i was very skeptical about getting a  smart  treadmill  i thought that all i need was just a mechanically sound machine and the ifit  or any other digital connectivity  online classes  doesn t worth the cost  after using the guided run workout sessions with ifit i m left very impressed  and i totally understand now the benefits of really large displays  like a   in screen on peloton thread    that immersive experience makes all the difference few small comments   bluetooth speakers work great  with plenty of sound volume   built in fan has good airflow   it doesn t look like it will be easy to disassemble the rails control panel from the thread part in case you decide to move your treadmill from one floor to another  there is a cable that runs from the control panel to the motor and once you connect it during assembly  it s in it for good      
416,5.0,                       i bought this for my wife to use but i will be using it also   the bottom line is  i was impressed with this treadmill it arrived on time and was moved in the house  this is a heavy unit around     lbs so if you are going to use it in a upstairs room i would pay the extra charge to have it delivered to a specific room  if the engineering on the treadmill is as good and the engineering  they used for the packaging it is going to be a great machine the assembly is straight forward and very simple  i started in the afternoon and finished it the next day but it could be done in   hrs or less  all the parts are labeled right of left and the hardware is plastic sealed on a card with each item labeled and and what step on the instructions to use them  the instructions call for a crescent wrench but it is better to use a     inch ratchet wrench  i m not sure it is a      or       but is give you more room to work to tighten the nuts this came with one year of ifit and you can add   other persons to the account  it is a nice add on to use trainers and different location to run of hike  when the free time is up i will be extending the account we have been using the treadmill for   weeks and the only thing that seems to be a negative it the touch screen unit is slow to boot up i don t see how you could go wrong buying this treadmill   good value for the price       
417,3.0,                       so far  this treadmill hasn t lived up to expectations  upon opening the box  i discovered it was missing parts  the packaging is a cardboard sheet  heat sealed  so this is an issue from the manufacturer  once i finally received the parts from the company  i realized how difficult of an assembly it truly is  don t try to assemble this by yourself  after i finally got the treadmill assembled  it was a hassle just getting the basic  manual  mode on  because nothing works until you set up the  ifit  program  and finally  after all that  the treadmill is up and running  but it wobbles  because one side of the unit has a rubber block on the bottom and one doesn t   not part of the assembly  from the manufacturer   does it belong there or not  still waiting on a response from the company  overall  not a good experience  i could ve gotten a lemon  but i will be very hesitant to buy a nordictrack again      
418,4.0,                       have had treadmill for over a month so far and can t complain  it does what a treadmill should do  speed goes plenty fast for my household and incline goes high enough to get a strong burn going  of course  they don t tell you in the manual that you don t have to sign up for ifit  but it can be bypassed by holding the ifit button for    seconds  all stickers and indicators say you have to sign up to active the treadmill  and if it s something you d like to try go for it  however  don t think you have to sign up to use the treadmill  the only negative i ve had so far is that every know and then it trips by arc flash breaker  i ve noticed that it usually does it if a person is standing on the belt when trying to start  if standing to the side until moving it doesn t seem to happen      
419,5.0,                       this is a great home treadmill   it took me about an hour to assemble   instructions are straight forward  you will need someone to assist when installing the locking bar  speakers are adequate  you will need an aux cord  you will find that there is a lot of literature indicating the treadmill is locked until the ifit app is activated  fear not  after you assemble it  just press the ifit button for about    seconds      
420,5.0,                       i love this treadmill   it is very comfortable to walk on because it has shock absorbers   i paid amazon to put it together  for        it was well worth it  i know that it has been adjusted properly and ready to go   very great treadmill for the money     
421,5.0,                       ordered the     after trying a less expensive treadmill from xterra  this is definitely worth the money if you are looking to make an investment in your health  it s first of all a great treadmill  the shock absorbers work well and it s great to be able to fold up if necessary  the     chp motor makes for a smooth run  the     incline adds a serious challenge  the ifit subscription is quite fun so far  though it remains to be seen if we will resubscribe after the free year  the fact that it can control the speed and incline is honestly really cool  i recommend the     esp because the slight increase in price over the     is worth it for the larger motor  five stars      
422,2.0,                       first of all  i am totally disappointed on my order because amazon used xpo delivery service where it took another week for me to get the order  i placed this item as prime order and waited for   weeks to get delivery which is the expected date  on july   th  nothing came and i have to call xpo and amazon to track where my delivery is  amazon s excuse is that it s not their fault  but in their tracking  they are being updated by xpo and nothing shows that there was a delay nor contacted me by both parties  i had an argument with xpo and same time with amazon customer support as they can t resolve the issue  xpo promised to deliver a week later and it came  but still late  as an amazon prime member  we shouldn t be treated this way as we are a paying member  i should get something back for the trouble amazon and you did nothing now for the treadmill  after assembly the treadmill is solid  i really didn t expect a big size of a threadmill  same size as in the gyms  and now i need to find a bigger place for it  it took me     hours to assemble as the manual is not details and crappy  i did figure out that there is a page at the back for parts with numbers to match the guide but still took me longer than expected  the holes are very tight and you need extra muscle to tighten them  when you install the left and right arm and about to install the sensor bar for the pulse  you ll see that there is a few inches gap so you need another person to squeeze the other end to screw that bar in place  you will also need another person to install the lift bar  hydraulic  as that person needs to hold it up until you screw everything in nordic could have made the assembly better  i wish they had a lower model that is lighter and slimmer  be careful moving it as it can scratch your wood floor  the weight is about      lbs so if you plan to move it upstairs  good luck   the wheels are too small and no wheels at front  hard to move it the speakers are garbage and pretty much useless  that s all about it   let s see after   months how this thing performs with   people using it  i recommend the product but not xpo to deliver this item      
423,4.0,                       my old treadmill go sick in the pandemic   probably wasn t covid but it was probably old age   i saw the nordictrack t series treadmill on amazon and it seemed to fit my  simple needs    package arrived damaged but the treadmill largely survived   i had some broken plastic pieces  console tray  but after minor rigamarole nordictrac  sent me replacement parts and the installation went relatively smoothly   for some reason one of the bolts for the arm was too short but i got another from home depot that sufficed   instructions were straightforward   my wife helped when i needed four hands and everything worked when we fired it up   i have used it for several weeks and have had no problems   it is a little noisy at low speed but not so much that it is a bother   folds up well and is just right for my basement room   the delivery manipulated it down smoothy and efficiently   i bought the third party  uts  maintenance service for three years   nordictrac offers their own and i am still debating whether that might be worthwhile   does anybody have any input    all in all i am satisfied and enjoying     the treadmill   i am no longer an athlete and just want to have a nice workout and i think this will do the trick      
424,1.0,                         of   screws for the cross bar do not fit making the treadmill un usable   see photos   even with the cross bar removed  these   screws do not fit   it really would be easy for nordictrack to figure out standard bolts or screws for the entire machine rather than unique screws and bolts for each section   be ready to find alternative screws that fit for the cross bar regarding the instructions  it is passable but nordictrack should hire a person from lego or even ikea that knows how to write instructions very disappointing      
425,5.0,                       this treadmill is professional quality but extremely heavy and difficult to maneuver  thank heavens i had the prudence of paying extra     for delivery to a room of choice  i ended up giving the delivery guys another     as a tip   and it was completely worth it  my husbsnd is extremely handy with tools  it still took him a solid   hours to assemble it  we did it over multiple days  the manual booklet is     pages long  i advise watching instructional videos in you tube  lastly the trick to bypass ifit as advised by several users came handy  put the emergency stop key in place and keep holding the ifit logo   it will work  it is a really good treadmill hopefully the effort we put in will be worth it      
426,5.0,                       i ordered this treadmill after the one i had for years broke   it arrived and i had no difficulty assembling it the same day  possibly because of covid  delivery was to the door or garage  so it took two of us to get it to the den  i used it once before i myself came down with covid and ended up in the hospital for    days   when i came out i didn t have strength or lung capacity to walk down the hall   after a couple of weeks back at home  i start using this treadmill for recovery   i started out slow  no incline for    minutes and increased   minute per day until i got to    minutes at the same time gradually increasing my max speed and incline   i have now used it for    days in a row the treadmill comes with a year family membership to ifit   both my daughters and i have started using it and love it   this treadmill has a large screen and doing an ifit walking program lets you follow the trainer and see all the scenery  currently working a costa rica walking on program    the program includes beach walks and mountain hikes   the treadmill automatically adjusts speed and incline as the program starts climbing hills mountains  max incline of    is higher than i want to go  but i ve done it on this treadmill as part of the costa rica program  i have not fully recovered and because of lung scaring i may never get back to where i was pre covid  but this treadmill is helping me get there faster than i expected      
427,5.0,                       purchased this treadmill a few months ago on amazon  arrived within the expected time frame and wasn t damaged  we decided on a lighter treadmill since we would be placing it in an upstairs bonus room  glad we did after we got it upstairs  assembly was easy  only needed an extra hand for a couple steps  had no issues with the instructions  treadmill started out working great  after about a week  we had some issues  the incline no longer worked and the unit would just stop running after approximately one quarter mile   i reached out to amazon for assistance and was only told it could be replaced after i disassembled  repackaged  re palletized  and shipped the old unit back  at least they offered to replace but this was out of the question  so i reached out to the manufacturer  i used the on line  chat option  was able to identify the issue and a replacement part was immediately shipped out to me  i replaced  i offered to replace the part  wasn t asked  the part and the treadmill works great  typically i would be upset  but after receiving such  prompt service as i did from the manufacturer with the issue  any purchase you make may have issues  but not every provider will stand behind their product  nt did and they ve earned my future business      
428,5.0,                       i received the treadmill with   broken parts and after a quick phone call to nordictrack  they quickly sent me the new parts  the parts took   days  business days  to arrive and the assembly began  the hardest part for me was getting my daughter to hold the rails correctly so i could put the   bolts into them  it was the hardest part due to her not wanting to put her cell phone down and pay attention to what she was doing  lol  it took me about   hours to assemble  but that included replacing a broken foot rail and several trips to the basement for more tools  overall we are very happy with the product and bypassed the ifit registration by pressing the ifit button for a few seconds and it turns on  just remember to put the  safety key  on the machine first  we forgot that part and it took a few tries to bypass it  until we had the  ah haa  moment and put the key on the treadmill  it then quickly turned on   i m very happy with the treadmill  i was going to buy a much cheaper one  but i am very happy and pleased that i decided to buy a brand that i ve heard of and one that offers more features      
429,5.0,                       this was very easy to assemble   instructions were straight forward   it folds very easy and fits well to take up as little space as possible   it s still a good size for running with lenght and width   if you re a hardcore runner running at  mph for    minutes or longer might want the next level up  but for any average running pace with sprints and walking intervals it s perfect  has a nice incline  but might not be as steep as some people want  but when you can t run outside or are short on time this is a great treadmill to cover you  controls are easy to use and see while running down side is it s a little loud like most treadmills and there isn t anything to really see on the small display screen  it ll show calorie counts and laps but isn t that accurate as you can t put in your weight   but for just a nice work out it works out well     
430,5.0,                       when the gym that i had been going for over    years closed due to covid    pandemic i did not know what i was going to do to continue exercising  a month went by and one day my friend said why don t you buy a treadmill  i thought about it and by the next day i had ordered a nordictrack treadmill   i received it within a week   my son assembled it  the same day it was delivered  i did my first workout that day  for two hours  and since then  i use the treadmill six days a week   the machine is very sturdy with a high end motor very similar to a treadmill at the gym  this machine though has added features such as a screen to watch the ifit videos  a built in fan  an extra long wide deck to put weights  bottles of water  towel  cell phone  ipad  etc  it also has a bluetooth feature to listen to music or plug in a device  it starts right away  the speed picks up very quick  incline and decline work excellent  the noise level is very low  i alternate workouts between manual and the ifit videos  the machine is very strong and i feel really safe whether i m running  inclining  jogging  or simply walking  it keeps track of my workouts and this helps to see my progress  purchasing a nordictrack treadmill is one of the best decisions i have made      
431,4.0,                       i just received and had my machine installed yesterday  haven t quite used it but can t wait to  when i tried it  it s everything i was hoping for  again  i haven t fully used it so nothing has gone wrong  one thing i will point out is that it s noisy  you will hear it from one room to another to another  unless you have a huge home  i am going to say thiat if you have it in the home  and you try to workout in the morning  whomever is sleeping will definately hear it other than that  so far so good      
432,4.0,                       i left a four for ease of assembly but to be clear  we had the expert installation done  it won t let me not select a rating first time treadmill owner and not much of a gym runner before this  so i don t have a ton to compare it to  it s easy to fold up if need be  and seems nice and padded when running  the ifit workouts are a nice distraction from the pain of running although i m not sure if we ll be renewing when it s time to pay my annoyances with this product are   no way to export treadmill audio to headphones  this was confirmed by a nordictrack live chat  yes  of course running on a treadmill is noisy in and of itself but it would be great to have the ifit audio in my ears   both so i can hear it better and so i m making less racket  short of loading the same workout on your phone and trying to play it at the same time  i don t have another solution  the sound is decent coming out of the treadmill but it s hard to not constantly fiddle with the volume if you re doing intervals  there s bluetooth connectivity  but only for streaming audio from that device through the treadmill  there s an aux jack  but again it s for playing your device s music through the treadmill which again seems really stupid  i m going to go ahead and say my headphones are better quality than these treadmill speakers   i don t know how to touch the speed incline buttons or anything on that horizontal bar without getting shocked  and it sucks lol  doesn t matter if i deaden myself on something else first all told  this definitely meets our needs and we re satisfied with the product  the headphone issue is a big disappointment though and given the fact this advertises bluetooth connectivity and an aux jack  i never would have guessed i couldn t use headphones      
433,4.0,                       this is a very nice machine  however  it s huge  it s definitely a size you would expect to see in a gym   i wanted a mid range treadmill that would have a good width and good weight limit   this definitely meets those expectations  but you need to have a big spot for it in your house   it s too big for a small bedroom or small office   it won t be inconspicuous in a living area  that being said  it s a good  sturdy machine with lots of features also  bonus info       you do not have to sign up for the fit app program they claim you need in order to activate   just hold the fit button that is right on the front of the machine face for    seconds and it will bypass the need to register and join   apparently this is a membership  but it s not necessary to run this treadmill      
434,3.0,                       i opened the box and could hear flying insects buzzing  trying to escape the plastic wrapper around the treadmill  i few began to escape and i had to step on them  it freaked my wife out  i closed it back up and contacted amazon  ordered a new one  the sad bad thing is that i was told that since it was a friday  the truck would not be able to pick up the bug infested treadmill until the following monday  that was a nightmare  the package is extremely heavy and i could not move it alone  a package full of insects had to lay in my garage for days before it could be retrieved  bad  finally  the package was picked up  a new treadmill was dropped off  and now it works great  we love it just wish we had not been subjected to a possible infestation or unknown origin the amazon associate who i spoke with to organize the return was very professional and helpful      
435,4.0,                       you will need to put in your patience pants to assemble  it s not hard  just need to pay attention and take your time  the directions are good and the nuts   bolts package are labeled by steps to make it super easy  i was very happy to figure out how to bypass the ifit sign up  activate  the treadmill comes with a big red sticker that says you won t be able to unlock the treadmill w out registering the treadmill   bs   that s so misleading and not necessary  to get around it all you need to do is put the key in place hold down the ifit bluetooth symbol for    seconds or so and it gets rid of the locked screen and you are ready to go  it s really very sneaky of nordic track  not everyone had      or more when they ve bought the product  you should be able to choose if you d like to sign up for ifit workouts or go on your own  i didn t rate the treadmill too high bc i want to try it for week or so  i did start it up and walked for a bit and it seemed good  overall i say it was easy to assemble   i did it alone    it s priced great   it looks nice and i like that the bed fold up for easy storage and the wheels at the end make it super easy to move around       
436,4.0,                       even though the screen says  your treadmill won t activate until you register at ifit com   this is not true  make sure the red stop key is on  then press the ifit button on the screen and hold down for       seconds  until the screen unlocks  just assembled mine  some screws wouldn t screw all the way  but i am too tired now  will try again later  first impression  looks very sturdy and well made      
437,4.0,                       i have a small ish apartment but i wanted a treadmill i could use to make cardio a bit more manageable instead of spending a huge chunk of time at the gym  it s sturdy and a decent size but not obtrusive  my boyfriend put it together in about    minutes  i did have to help a bit to hold up the top part  you can get around registering it on ifit  it goes to an incline of    and both the incline and speed increase smoothly  my only complaint about this product is the stopping function  there is no cool down button which is totally fine but the other problem is that when you push stop  it just stops  so do not stop when you are going fast and i can imagine if you accidentally pulled off the emergency shutdown button  you d literally faceplant into the console or fly backwards      
438,5.0,                       we embarked on purchasing a treadmill to keep relatively in shape during this time of covid   i was honestly skeptical of having such a large heavy item shipped and assembling it   it arrived right on time and the amazon delivery guys placed it exactly where needed   be careful  it is heavy  so assemble with care   it went together easily and i took their advice of plugging it into a surge protector since it is an expensive purchase   i enjoy how smooth it works  both the belt motor and the incline motor   the controls are intuitive and you can use this with or without the nordic track app   we use it almost daily and am glad we purchased it      
439,5.0,                       we d been searching for an affordable treadmill since the pandemic began  but things continued to be pretty much sold out everywhere  so happy we were able to finally land this one  assembly is very tricky  not gonna lie   it took my fianc  and i about   days to get it up and running  it comes in a very large  very heavy box  but the delivery guys were great  they were on time and brought the box inside for us  i like to do inclines and was skeptical about what this machine could handle  but let me tell you   i get just as good or better of a workout on this treadmill than i did on the machines at our local gym  thank you to all the reviewers who posted the cheat code on bypassing the ifit activation  once we got it assembled  we held the ifit button down for about    seconds and everything was good to go  highly recommend      
440,1.0,                       this review is not about working out with the machine  i bought this product with the professional installer option in late december  the installer came around the second week of january  put it together and the belt came off and broke two days later  i found a bunch of bolts and pieces that the installer just flat out didn t use  i called to get replacement part  that took two weeks to get here  the technician was supposed to call after the part came but did not  i called to get in touch with technician and was just told its going to be three weeks until they can come out  at that point i will have paid for this product two months prior and been able to use it once before it broke      
441,5.0,                       i have gone to the gym for the last six years and was use to the commercial grades there  covid    came around  and i stopped going to the gym for safety concerns  overall  really like this treadmill and the quality  with the ifit compatibility i didn t feel like i lost anything from leaving the gym  i did    miles on it in    days  and feel that it will last  i hadn t used the ifit before and like it i am          when i got this and feel it is sturdy and will hold up  the speakers are not the best  but i normally run with headphones anyways  i have used my aftershokz  the adjustment on incline going up is the loudest part  doesn t cause a problem for me  the emergency cord is a good length  but doesn t stay well on my workout shirts  again not the end of the world  i would recommend taking the emergency stop off when done  otherwise the screen will stay lit up you do not need to do the ifit  but i like it and will keep it as it reminds me of classes at the gym  i also like the scenic walking hiking paths  to bypass ifit just hold the button down for until it turns green  and you are in manual mode intervals can be done by the whole number and the plus or minus signs  or by hitting the numbers quickly  ie     by hitting   than   quickly i do not feel that it is noisy  nor does my roommate  single floor house  tile throughout and he is down the hallway and doesn t hear me running awake or when he is asleep  very light sleeper  if his door is shut  he can hear my tv for reference you will need two people to help you assemble  do not tighten too much when putting the console on  wait until its all together than tighten  either wise you will have trouble with it pulling to one side or the other and folding will be problematic the feet are able to be adjusted  which is great because floors are rarely even  do a couple of test miles to see if you have this right      
442,1.0,                       nordictrack t   s  treadmill did not work  icon fitness charged me         for work covered by both factory warranty and extended warranty   i called icon fitness for technical assistance and ms  brittney baker insisted that no on site technical assistance would be forth coming unless  i provided my credit card number   the treadmill was delivered on january          and was finally repaired on april            the extended warranty cost        and that should have covered necessary replacement of the  pulse bar       
443,4.0,                       like many reviews  the screw holes were not properly drilled  cross threading is easy to do with some holes  i do suggest paying a little extra to have the treadmill placed in the location you want it  it s very heavy  as far as the performance  i have been using it every day since i bought it  i did subscribe to ifit  and i am enjoying it so far  i like the various workouts they have available  i think this was a smart purchase since i don t feel comfortable going to the gym at this time  i would recommend the product  hopefully i will have it around for awhile      
444,4.0,                       first of all  the delivery guys were great   initially they were going to leave on the porch but i asked them to put in my garage   on the second floor   took a bit of persuasion but i would not have been able to move it up there myself so grateful for the assist   the box was beat up and had visible holes and tears   however  the packaging on the inside was really amazing   no damage at all to the treadmill   i did have several problems assembling   my lack of paying attention to the ground wire when i put the wire harness on caused the first issue   if you don t keep the ground wire on the outside of the hole  you will find out how sharp the holes are in the metal   it took me a good    minutes to fish out the wire and i also cut my fingers up pretty good   i did ultimately get the ground wire out and connected   however  the screw hole wasn t tapped completely so i had a hard time getting it tight enough to actually function as a grounding wire   i also had a lot of trouble getting the front bar to align properly   the left side was simple but the right side was difficult   the tab on the upper side did not fit neatly into the lower part   i was concerned that it would break if i put too much pressure on it so i went very slowly and worked the piece from the far left across and finally got it to go into place   the belt was misaligned out of the box but the website has clear instructions on how to adjust   i have used every day since i purchased and am very happy with the product itself   i read the reviews about problems with ifit   since i am just using it for walking i don t need the subscription   i  cancelled on line probably on the third day   no issues and very simple for me to cancel   i wouldn t let that stop you from purchasing and i thought a few of the programs would have worked well for me    years ago   just not my thing      
445,5.0,                       this saved my sanity during covid      the world stopped in march when gyms were closed and for a mama of   young kids  i don t have the time to schedule baby sitters to run and workout outside  i am also one that likes to workout in peace with no kids and i like to be distracted while running  so this treadmill is perfect and checks all my boxes for that  you can choose between hundreds of different kinds of workouts  beginner level all the way to advanced   i love the warm up and cool down features  i just got this treadmill at the first of august so i haven t had it long enough to give a thorough review  but so far i love it and it gets me excited to run every morning by choosing a different workout each day pros perfect size for a in home treadmill and folds up nice to save space  we have it in our bedroom and it doesn t bother me too badhas   nice sized cup holdersspeakers are loud and you can adjust the sound of the music  trainer and background noise    s of different workouts to choose fromi love that the trainers adjust the incline automatically so you get a better workoutconsno fans   i read reviews before buying and some were saying it had fans  this model does not if you want the feature with the fans with a little better motor spend the extra    and get the     s model with the      or     screen motor is a little louder than i thought it would be for the price  but not worth dropping stars overtouch screen is sometimes hard to use  the features just need to be updated a bit for a more modern better experience to find workouts  fitness level      
446,5.0,                       i am addicted  i love the bluetooth capability  i love that loud speaker it has and the fan that blows air in your face when you re sweating and the fancy touch screen with workouts  i opted not to do the ifit  the machine works great so far  i have no complaints      
447,4.0,                       i m loving my treadmill  i think it s the best for the price  i walk or light jog here and there at home  nothing crazy   it s a perfect size  not the huge machines from the gym but not the tiny      walmart tread i originally ordered that was so small i felt like a giant walking on it  i have had it for about a month now for me  it was extremely important to get something that would feel sturdy and support my weight  give me good range of speed and incline and not feel like i was heavier than the machine  i weight     and am      it was disheartening to see so many machines max out at    lbs  i didn t want to break the bank buying a tread  but i couldn t buy anything that wouldn t support me either  i don t think the assembly is easy  my husband did it and thankfully he is quite handy  but for me it wouldve taken me days  the only thing that really bothered me about this tread is that they want to force you to purchase a monthly service and you technically can t turn it on without providing your credit card info to even turn on the machine  i am so grateful to everyone in the comments who posted about how to avoid that   it s really unthinkable to me that i would have to purchase more to use a machine that i have already fully paid for  so shame on the company for that  definetly don t do that and just follow all the advise on herw on how to go around it  other than that  i really couldn t be happier  it s sturdy  great range of levels  good motor  i love it  especially during the pandemic  i ve been walking    minutes a day and it s been great      
448,2.0,                       i writing this as i m assembling the machine right now and i m borderline losing my mind  some of the screws don t fit and i actually had to find alternate screws to fit  thank god i actually had some screws lying around the house that actually fit  particularly steps   and    the ground screw wouldn t fit and the screws for the crossbar to the handles wouldn t fit   i ll update my review once i use it once assembled      
449,5.0,                       you do need to register first on ifit and download the app  but after the first month  you can cancel the membership and use it with any problems  the speed is from      and believe me  i had been to the gym and on their treadmill the speed   will be a     on this one  you can easily lower and increase the speed as you need it  the incline is amazing  this treadmill is very solid  no shaking or sturdy   the settings are very easy to use  the cup holders are wide and large enough  it has space for your phone   i had put my laptop on top of it and is perfectly fine   my kids used them too and is very easy for them as well  great product  you won t regret it after you understand you don t need the app after the first month      
450,1.0,                       this treadmill had only    minutes on it when the belt moved to one side and would not adjust with the instructions in the product manual   after almost   hours waiting on chat  i find out it is a known issue   they are sending me   screws to replace the failing ones  the problem is the placement of these   screws is behind a preassembled unit on the back of the unit   i have a   month warrantee  plus another   month warrantee for registering it online  plus i bought a   year extended warrantee   yet they want me to do the labor to replace   screws that i cannot possibly reach and that could affect the performance of the product   i had to fight with them to send out a repair tech to do the job   only when i threatened to dispute the charge on my credit card did they schedule a tech to do the repair   really      what s wrong with this picture   now i m in a waiting mode  unable to use the treadmill for what could be     weeks until the parts are received and the repair done   i have a nordictrack elliptical and a nordictrack recumbent bike and have been happy with both which is why i went with nordictrack treadmill      
451,5.0,                       you do need help to attach the safety bar on the bottom of the track but you don t need it for operation  but other than that  you can put it together yourself  i m a not so handy single mom and i did it  took me all morning lol  and be sure to put in the red magnet lock to turn on the treadmill and hold that ifit icon for like a minute  until it turns the machine on  dont fall for the  required  ifit subscription  just hold the button down and it works  heavy as all get out btw  put them little slider disks under it so you can drag it around the house and it will be fine though  even for a heavy  out of shape girl        
452,3.0,                       this dumb company makes you give them your credit card number and sign up for a free trial before telling you how to unlock the treadmill  hold the blue button for    seconds  there  now you can use your treadmill      
453,4.0,                       the treadmill is very heavy so try to get it delivered as close to where you want it as possible   after you destroy the box to open it you will find the instructions that state you need to save the packaging material in case there is a problem  the instructions are very well put together and the hardware is clearly marked the actual assembly is fairly easy except for the fact that the bolts that hold the uprights to the bottom frame are cheaply made   they are not tapered for easy thread engagement   on top of the problem with the bolts  some of the built in retaining nuts have coating on the threads making screwing in the bolts an unnecessary challenge  after struggling with the first four bolts  i found a spare bolt i had on hand and ran it into the threads clearing the coating before installing the other four   this may sound trivial  but the bolts are not high quality and i seriously thought i was going to break one off in the frame thankfully there are reviews the state how to bypass the built in lock by pressing the ifit button for    seconds we were up and running after about an hour of assembly   so far the treadmill works as it should   i will update if there are any changes      
454,3.0,                         stars because what they didn t tell you is that you are getting either a returned item  used item  or refurbished item  that s why they can sell it at such a mark down from retail  just look at the pictures i took when i got the machine out of the box  there were a few more scuff marks then just that  machine worked though and everything running okay til this day  kind of false advertisement that this is brand new  i waited a few months to put out this review for that reason  to make sure it was still functioning and it is      
455,5.0,                       i have had this for about   months now  which is long enough to know  that i really love it  it pretty much checks all the boxes  it works flawlessly  is built tough  and is good looking too  the only thing i would recommend is to pay a few extra bucks and get the in home assembly  it is a bit of a long and complicated assembly  so spare yourself the hassle  two of the holes in one of my brackets were not large enough to fit the screws through  so i had to go to lowe s and get a metal drill bit in order to make the holes slightly bigger  not an ideal scenario  but it all worked out  again  pay to get the in home assembly  otherwise  this is a really nice unit      
456,5.0,                       this thing has changed my covid life  i use it     hours a day  i am a female  i live in a climate that s freezing cold for many months out of the year and while i love to walk alone  i won t do it after dark  i walk fast   occasionally i run in bursts for a minute or   and i use the incline a lot  this treadmill is solid and quiet  my boyfriend is      pounds and also walks on it and feels supported  get the delivery option to have it left where you want it  the box is big and heavy and it doesn t have wheels to move it around from room to room  the lift feature for space saving works really well but don t get this if you need to move it around      
457,5.0,                       i waited to write a review until i had some time to get used to my new nordictrack   i had a treadmill previously but after two weeks of walking a dog in the hills of oakland  ca i decided i wanted a treadmill with an incline and greater speed  this has both  i am    years old and the treadmill gives me a great workout and the incline is great for losing weight and building nice glutes   it came with a free month of ifit  which you are required to sign up for to get the thing to work   i didn t like that but i did enjoy the free month   i was able to map the walk i had taken in oakland and walk it again   i could see the path and the treadmill would automatically incline where it should on the walk   i didn t continue the ifit due to the price but i do love the treadmill   i have it in front of my tv  put on a series and go for an hour with entertainment   this was a great investment for me      
458,5.0,                       disclaimer  i have never worked out at home or at gym for any meaningful period  i can t remember in my whole life if i had an occasion of outside jogging bought this while it s on sale at       great price  couldn t be more happier  mine has a small display with the monotone blue background color that i don t think has the capability to cast movies  but i don t care  the front panel has a small stand area where i can put a laptop before purchasing  i did my research and figured out that you can activate  or i should say unlock  and use the treadmill without buying the ifit subscription  as others said  i just pressed the blue ifit button for     seconds  some people say    seconds   and it unlocked itself installation  i had a little issue with running a wire during assembling  made a mistake to run a wire below a metal bar whereas i should have run the wire over the bar   so i had to disassemble almost everything after i completed assembling  i m pretty infirm  so having to disassemble all the way back felt like a total disaster  the manual could have been improved to stress how the wire should run  but once i ve done installation  that s it  i am very satisfied with the product      
459,4.0,                       i have been shopping for exercise equipment since covid so i can do some cardio from home  i was super excited to find an affordable nordictrack treadmill on amazon  i opted for the delivery option to have the driver bring the treadmill inside the doorway  they never knocked and just left it outside  this is the only complaint i had about the amazon service  one bolt was not able to thread during assembly of the arms that support the console but we continued without it  the ifit registration was a bit confusing but after looking up videos on youtube i was able to figure it out  total assembly time was about   hours with two people  it is very heavy so definitely bring a strong friend to help move assemble      
460,4.0,                       good treadmill  i really like the ifit training  assembly was difficult and i am a person that likes to assemble things  some of the predefined holes didn t line up perfectly so the plastic has uneven gaps from one side to the other and some of the plastic doesn t lay flat or fitted as i would think it would  sometimes there is weird noises when it is adjusting incline  incline numbers go to like    or    can t remember from my couch  but the incline doesn t seem that high  overall i really like it and use it daily  i am glad i bought it  it came with one year free trial of ifit for on the treadmill and i even downloaded it on my phone to do ifit workouts while traveling for work      
461,2.0,                       it started off bad due to the poor delivery     the delivery company wedges the giant heavy box on a little side porch i have and it was extremely hard to remove and take to my actual door  the box was ripped in many places and practically falling to pieces   then began the process of putting it together  i m a handy person and this still took me about  hrs to do  i had many problems due to poor instructions and design  but eventually got through it luckily i read prior reviews before use and knew to hold in the ifit button for   seconds to bypass that crap and just use the treadmill like normal i then noticed the belt was severely off track to the left  after some quick youtube videos i was able to adjust the bolts to fix this and align it to center    you think they would have had alignment and tightness set on a new treadmill but i guess not i also notice that the belt slows when you step on it to begin walking  i have tried adjusting tightness and the problem still persists after going through the initial hell of the shipping and getting everything set up  the treadmill seems decent and seems to work fine besides the belt slowing issue mentioned above  if i can solve that issue it will actually be a overall nice unit  i expected alittle more quality out of the box given the price  but oh well      
462,1.0,                       this was good while it lasted  which wasn t long at all   two months of   user     minutes of walking  x a week  the belt bent over and is now useless we purchased the warranty extended coverage and they told us they would fix the belt  we ve waited   months  no help  we ve called the company and they told us they d ship the belt and we can replace it ourselves after a      machine plus      on the warranty  we were compleltey ripped off  its been out of use since june and they have no plans on fixing it  or helping  so its just a huge  heavy  item that i need to dispose of do your research and get something that is more reliable and not built so cheaply and save your money   don t get the warranty      
463,1.0,                       i had a life one for    years worked forever sold it to buy this which stopped working  in   months   i called and they were unhelpful  the part is on back  order going on   months seems it s a problem for a lot of clients   i call i get out on an indefinite hold  and then it hangs up  i m frustrated why amazon would allow this vimos y yo do business with them   i bought extended warranty and nothing happens because there is no part there is no help  nothing  dont buy this seriously a waste of money        
464,1.0,                       we received our treadmill yesterday and built it from top to bottom  to our disappointment  when we turned on the treadmill  the belt would not move no matter what speed we put it on  the next day  we had a friend who is a technician look at the treadmill and he told us that the motor is defective  even though the incline on the device works and the screen turns on  the belt still does not seem to move  we spent    hours setting this treadmill up from top to bottom  we are certain we did not skip any steps or install it incorrectly as we used the instruction manual religiously throughout the entire process  it is downright egregious that we would drop over     dollars to receive a product that is defective  we are disappointed in nordic and would not recommend this product to any customers  there are many other customers including myself who are experiencing several failures with this product  listen to us and stay away  you should rather buy your treadmills from sole or proform as they have better products and way better customer service      
465,5.0,                       okay first of all i read the review about holding the ifit button down for    seconds so i was prepared to do that and thank you for your advice but surprisingly mine came with the screen already operational nevertheless thank you i love this treadmill it is perfect for me the capacity is     and it s one of the reasons i got it because i weigh     it doesn t squeak or make weird noises  it s super heavy  i would recommend when ordering you ask they bring it indoors for you that was a huge mistake i made because it was soooo heavy and they put it by my neighbors apartment not mine so you can imagine my struggle during the time putting it together there was only a few issues   was the bar the is holding the screen panel part was not lining up this alone took my husband and i almost    minutes because it would not line up nor would it screw in  we even broke a screwdriver that s how hard it was  i would have got an assembler to come out but he didn t want me to  anyways i used it for    mins this morning and it worked flawlessly  i will update if any problems i haven t noticed yet show up     
466,5.0,                       this treadmill is everything i wanted for the price   the layout of the controls is really nice with large  responsive buttons   the digital readout is clear and gives all of the information i was looking for   the build quality seems really quite nice and solid   it s generally pretty quiet for a treadmill  similar in noise level to what you d use as a gym   my wife and i got it   months ago and we ve put a lot of miles on it so far   it s been great for us as we don t like running outside in the winter rain snow   you could spend       more and get basically the same treadmill with a large  tablet like touchscreen display but we didn t need this   i d suggest saving the money and getting this model instead   we didn t see much value with the ifit app so we didn t keep it beyond the free trial period   overall a great treadmill for the price and i highly recommend it      
467,5.0,                       i ve been using this machine for a while now  and so far   no complaints  it does what it s supposed to do  and while it is relatively new  it seems to function as a reliable piece of equipment  i ve not owned any other treadmill before this one  but i ve used a few in the gym  the comfort level on this one is pretty similar to the gym ones  it has enough room for a tall person no to feel confined  the only comment that i d have for the manufacturer is that the heart rate monitor is located not on the side bars that you d use to put your hands on  but on the bar that s right under the control panel  and  at least  for a tall person they aren t located conveniently  but rather too low  i don t really use it for this reason  although i would if they were located on side bars  other than that   it seems like a very solid piece of exercising equipment  and i do enjoy using it so far      
468,5.0,                       serves it s purpose  easy enough to set up and adjust as needed  follow all the directions  they are there for a reason   despite it being delivered with the box beat up in parts  the contents were luckily protected well enough  if you re expected a gym quality beast with all the bells and whistles  this isn t it  but for a simple at home option that allows you to get a run walk in  it s great  to repeat what others seem to still be missing   if you hold the ifit button down  it allows you to bypass the subscription option   i m      and my hubby is      and neither of us have a problem using it  inclined or not  so please take those not picky  complaints  with a grain of salt  jury is out on the accuracy of the speed distance  it s constantly at odds with my garmin watch  but no biggie for me because i m not super serious about that  the fold feature works  but personally i don t trust it and it doesn t fold up enough to make any space saving difference  so i leave it down  there are no clear instructions on lubricating the track though  unless i missed it   other than pushing their extended warranty  so that was kind of irritating      
469,3.0,                       i purchased this to replace a    year old proform treadmill i paid  k for  that had a safety latch  and went all the way up  not just    rds of the way up   that finally bit the dust about two weeks ago   i ordered this treadmill the morning the old one died  it arrived on friday and we put it together saturday   it took a few hours because getting some of the screws in the holes  was difficult   it also doesn t have the wheels like the proform did so it made it a little hard to move once we got it together   unless you want to purchase the nordic track training  just hold down the blue button for    seconds and it will unlock regardless of what the manual says   i ve used it twice now   and while i wish i had spent a little more and got the one with the fan  like the ones at the gym have  it does get the job done   i have a gym membership so i have cardio training on the ap while the gym is closed and it worked well  smooth incline and decline   you can adjust the speed or just push the numbers and it will take you to that speed  and then you can go the       in that speed zone   i haven t tried to synch it with my iphone yet so not sure what the stereo sounds like  but for now that s not something i m going crazy about getting done   would i buy it again  probably not and i ve only used it sunday  and this morning   i don t like the fact that it doesn t go all the way up  and more importantly there is no safety latch   i have a disabled daughter who i am afraid would kick the mechanism by mistake and it would come down on her   she s like a toddler  and i could also see a toddler going over to the pump  kicking where the foot is  and while it does come down slowly maybe wouldn t move in time and get seriously hurt      
470,1.0,                       machine won t start unless you sign up for a free trial of ifit com  since i love dealing with a communist company  i did sign up to activate the machine  the is the reason for one star  i have yet to use the machine  you cannot exercise at home without giving your email address and name and weight and age to ifit com  i am loving it but i might return this machine because of these strings i downloaded the app but i can t figure out how to use the treadmill from the console without going through the app  i have to do some reading  so far  i have to use the app in order for the treadmill to function which means i have to consent to share my location i am sure i can cancel the trial after a month and use the machine without paying a monthly fee for ifit com  i am keeping my fingers crossed until i read or call      
471,1.0,                       this expensive piece of crap came with wrong screws for the front pillars  just impossible to assemble  had to call the atrocious customer care  which wasted a lot of my time to be able to talk to   and got the correct screws in about    days  for    days the junk was just taking space doing nothing     freaking days    then finally when the screws arrived and i finished the assembly  and gave it a try  at the very first attempt of trying the incline decline feature  inclining was ok  albeit painfully slow and noisy   but declining resulted in a loud clang when going down  i looked under the belt to see if something broke  no  everything looked ok  turned off and on and tried again  same result tried to reach customer care again but due to long hold times every single time  i just gave up and returned this nightmare  thanks to amazon for making the return smooth then   about a month after this return  i get an email from nordictrack  who apparently have no idea that i have returned their piece of crap   that i will get a free treadmill mat if i leave a positive review here nordictrack  here is your positive review which is what all you care about  now i know why this product is so highly reviewed  this company bribes the customers i now use horizon fitness t    treadmill and it took    mins to assemble and is amazing  please return sell your nordictrack pos devices and switch to horizon fitness  you will thank me      
472,2.0,                       i received my treadmill delivered yesterday  very heavy box  for lifting it requires at least   people  unfortunately due to covi   they are not offering home install service  user manual is very confusing  my husband usually is very good for assembling and building any type of thing but this equipment is a pain  specially setting up the side bar with the proper screws  after a few hours for figuring things out  we found out that the pulse crossbar and the console is not wider enough to be attached to both side of the machine     it needs at least   more inches  i checked the norditrack website and we had the right console which is a little smaller for the model    s but it was manufactured wrong   amazon customer service for heavy items was very helpful and they re picking up the machine in a few days      
473,4.0,                       first off  let me say that maybe the best thing about my experience with the nordictrack t     s treadmill was the amazon delivery   although i requested  any room delivery  i received a text from the shipping company saying they would deliver it to my front door   but  to my relief  the two young delivery men carried it to the second floor of my home   they were also extremely careful to not mar the walls   exceptional my wife and i proceeded to assemble the treadmill   this would have only been a moderately difficult task  except that one of the wheels that is supposed to bolt to the front of the frame for maneuverability  wouldn t go into place   this is because there was a protruding excess weld globule that extended about     inch from the frame   i called nordictrack and they said they would process a replacement  which is ridiculous   if i had purchased assembly  no doubt they would have attempted to fix it on the spot   nevertheless  i did not dissuade them for initiating this   it s been   weeks and i have as yet to be contacted by nordictrack  although they acknowledge that they need to correct the issue   in the meantime  i purchased a die grinder attachment for a drill and after a significant amount of grinding the very hard weld material  i was able to get the wheel to fit into place   this added a trip to the hardware plus an extra hour or so to the assembly process once the wheel could be attached  the entire assembly was pretty straightforward and took my wife and i about   hours   the fit of the plastic pieces is mediocre in several places   i ve included a photo of the worst offender where the control panel attaches to the base i was under the impression that it would be possible to connect an ipad via bluetooth to the treadmill for viewing the ifit videos on a larger screen   unfortunately  that is not the case   a significant disappointment   nevertheless  although the screen is small it is sufficient for viewing the videos   and i must say  i was not intending to subscribe to ifit after the   year subscription ran out  but the quality of the content is exceptional  including hiking around several different countries with entertaining and informative trainers   the treadmill speed and incline adjust along with the trainer and the terrain being traversed   those can be overridden if more or less effort is desired and then return to the ifit intended speed and incline when desired the     chp motor is barely sufficient when attempting a cool down walk at less than     mi h   i weigh     lb and the treadmill slows significantly with each step   it also seems to labor when changing the incline   although it isn t too loud to hear the ifit videos through the speakers  the treadmill isn t as quiet as i expected  especially when the incline is changing  which is fairly frequent when hiking through hills and mountains   but  it s tolerable when shopping for a treadmill nowadays  you will see the lifetime warranties of yore are rare   i have a suspicion that due to ifit commanding frequent incline and speed changes  the life of the motors isn t what they would otherwise be so  in all  i am generally happy with the purchase and function of the treadmill   it makes exercising on a daily basis easy and enjoyable      
474,5.0,                       item arrived on time  no problems with the delivery   so far  it exceeds expectations   the assembly definitely requires two people  it is very heavy  approx     lbs   we were able to assemble the treadmill in about   hours  using the instructions and youtube videos to clarify a few of the drawings in the instructions  overall no problems     step assembly process   the treadmill itself is fantastic  better in my opinion  than the ones at la fitness   i like the bluetooth  and the display  touchscreen is amazing  with the ability to participate in various courses via internet   subscription req    or manual mode   would definitely recommend this treadmill  will have to update my review once i have used it a little more update   purchased in may   now sept   product is still excellent   highly recommended       
475,5.0,                       i enjoy the ease of use of the treadmill  it is quiet and works extremely well  with the current health risks  this is a great option for exercise at home to maintain fitness at any time  no exposure to sick people  weather not an issue and i can get a good work out  the assembly is a little annoying at times but not particularly difficult  i am happy with my purchase and can easily recommend the product      
476,3.0,                       i was supposed to get a   year membership with my purchase   the card code must be invalid as the ifit app was not functioning until i provided my cc information and paid      for a one year membership  that is not free  i think it s false advertising    so i chatted with amazon rep and was informed my question was being pass along to nordictrack  it s been   days and not a word from anyone   very sad customer service on another note  the amazon assembly was difficult to schedule  had to reschedule   times  although the final assembly looks fine so  beware   the nordictrack seems ok  the membership is a cheat  and the assembly is frustrating      
477,2.0,                       amazon made a good delivery of      pounds treadmill  assemble was ok  i did it by myself most of it in   hours  at the end i found out that the belt wasn t moving  which turned out it was the motor controller board  i contacted amazon for return  but amazon said they will take some time to investigate  i contacted nordictrack for support  it wasn t easy  but i made it through  their customer service was good  they agreed to send the part to me  i m still sitting here and waiting for the part  amazon still hasn t gotten back to me  overall  it was bad experience with the product  also with amazon  i wouldn t recommend this treadmill to anyone      
478,5.0,                       first treadmill that was delivered was either damaged in shipping or it was a return that they tried pawning off on me  the bottom cover for the motor was cracked and the clips that hold the top of the cover on were all snapped   second one was perfect  if you receive a damaged one do not put up with that  you re paying over a grand for it  it should be in brand new condition assembly was easy enough but i can see the directions being confusing to some  in the pack of paperwork with the directions and bolts you ll find a gift card for your free one year of ifit  even though you get a free one year of ifit youll need a credit card to set up your account  that is if you wish to use it  you can bypass ifit all together if you want it but if you re getting a free year might as well use it  you can always remove card info after setup anyways after using it a couple of time i m very satisfied with my purchase  ifit seems cool but i don t know if the yearly renewal will be worth it  it s a little pricey  i have a year to figure it out though      
479,4.0,                       the treadmill itself is pretty nice  wide   long belt gives plenty of room to move quickly  the assembly was pretty straight forward and can mostly be done by one person  need a bit of help to hold things in place while screwing   and the larger screen on the     model i think was worth the additional expense  though i wish you could turn off the screen without having to power down the whole machine  the real standout is the combination of ifit with the interactive motor  classes are pretty engaging  taking you to international destinations    and it helps a lot that you don t have to adjust the motor along the way because it automatically follows along with the class you re taking  i m not really a class person but this system changed my mind  for half of my workouts  at least   my one gripe is that the android based system is really slow so you have to be patient with the machine when getting set up      
480,4.0,                       regarding the  easy to fold  evaluation  i am an    year old female recovering from severe anemia   if i were a decade younger and at full strength age wise   easy to fold  might be rated    my son in law assembled the treadmill readily  except for the need to adjust out a few squeaks  which he was able to do  other than its being noisier than anticipated  i have only positive things to say  i appreciate the range of selections for speed and incline  and i think i will like ifit  which i am now learning to use  it seems straightforward  i just had to acquire  a device  ipad  to use it  the screen of my iphone was too small to be helpful my strength and endurance goals that center around walking were set in collaboration with my pt   i now live where there are long  cold winters  so having the treadmill means that walking is no longer weather dependent   i can think of many incentives for meeting these goals  primarily the desire for better overall health  in and of itself  at the same time  who wants to miss a good trip whenever covid allows for it  have stamina  will travel  lord willing       
481,1.0,                       the treadmill came damaged and inoperable  doesn t operate  not like a surgeon  it just doesn t work  and when they came to return the product  i was told they could not take it back because it was partially assembled  which i paid for through the professional assembly option and now i have a treadmill that doesn t work that they won t take back and i seemingly can t get my money back  i guess it s going to be cat food for supper for a little while  not really update  i contacted amazon about the problem and they stated that i had to disassemble the product and put it in the box it came in so it can be returned  the problem is it took two people to take it out of the box and it was professionally assembled  i don t have neither the tools nor the ability to take it apart and place it in the box  i m going to have to pay to disassemble it and the place it in the box  i just spent over      on nothing if i go that route  a product that was delivered damaged  i do have a louisville slugger  that should disassemble it      
482,2.0,                       problem is with manufacturing  delivery and assembly personnel were great   once treadmill was assembled  there was a cut and dent on the motor hood  we tested the machine and discovered that the incline doesn t work  customer service was fairly easy to reach  contacted icon and arrangements were made to ship me a new hood and board part for the incline feature  i am waiting for a technician to replace the parts  it is sad that the brand new equipment already requires a repair visit in order for it to work properly  i was planning to purchase a stationary bike in the near future but will be looking at other brands      
483,3.0,                       never actually got to use it  i got it fairly quickly but it was delivered broken which was very disappointing  they said they couldn t get a new one delivered for another couple weeks  i m assuming since it was out of stock  so i just went out and bought one from the store  the amazon people i chatted with online we re very kind and helpful  well minus the first person  he told me i could keep the broken treadmill or throw it away and i would have my new one in     days which was not true   the whole process was rather annoying and it s inconvenient for me to move this thing around again so they can pick it up  it looked like it would ve been a nice treadmill but i never want to deal with this ever again      
484,5.0,                       for this price  i m not sure you could get something much better  has a good range of speed up to   mph which is plenty for my purposes  also  you do not need to subscribe to ifit to use this  once plugged in and turned on  simply press and hold the ifit button until the screen comes on and it s ready for use  maybe        seconds  feels very sturdy and the cup holders are large enough to put a   oz water bottle  overall a great purchase  especially with payment installment options      
485,3.0,                       i would have given this a   or   star review  however it s cheaply with lots of plastic parts and i m super annoyed with the fact that the cover above the motor was broken out of the box   see picture  the machine works fine and does the job well so far  however it s not pleasant seeing your brand new product having broken parts right out of the box  a treadmill is a big and heavy machine and so unless it stops working i do not want to go through the trouble of returning it over a broken cover which makes me more annoyed that now i have to see it all cricked to the side and know that if i want this fixed it ll be a pain in my     to pack it again  return it  wait for a new one  unpack  and reassemble again  plus it s super heavy   anyway  off to the actual review pros belt size   i m         and the size of the belt is perfect for my stride foldable   it s pretty easy and simple to fold and unfold  also has a very nice feature that it unfolds slowly and you don t have to use strength to pull it down and fear of slamming into the floor preset workouts   if you want to use the preset workouts provided or create your own it s as simple as click of a button cup holders and heart pulse monitor features included cons speakers   weak speakers and if you are running on anything over a speed of   you are better off using headphones or different speakers vs the built in ones ifit activation   seems like there s a lot of treadmill companies who have a contract with ifit or similar companies in order to force you to sign up for their bs plans  the treadmill cannot be used unless you go into ifit com and actually create an account and activate the machine and they try to make you sign up and pay for monthly plans in order to keep track of your workouts    first of all i don t want to give me information anywhere  second i already have a fitbit and ways to track myself no need to force me to go on ifit overall plastic feel   there s lots of plastic parts and feels cheaply made  however you get what you pay for      
486,4.0,                       put treadmill together and found that in order to start it  we were required to set up with ifit and were to give credit card info for monthly payments of      like what   i purchased the darn thing shouldn t have to pay monthly for it to run   thank god we looked at the reviews here and the help from another disgruntled buyer found that all you need to to is hold down on the ifit logo for    seconds  and it worked      
487,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill  i am really enjoying it  i have recommended this treadmill to many friends and family  with my recommendation i suggest paying for the installation  the packaging is extremely heavy  as other s said  the box was beat up upon arrival and it was not the shipper s fault  i thoroughly inspected each piece and found everything to be in good and safe condition  i am generally able to assemble big items together on my own and move heavy furniture on my own  getting this down into my basement and assembling it on my own really made me question my life choices  i should have had another adult around for safety reasons  if you have to guide it up or down stairs  or cannot lift items   lbs or heavier on your own you should really pay someone to help you put this together   even if it is friend  pay them some how because this thing is a job  very worth the hassle because it works great      
488,5.0,                       when researching portable treadmills  i decided to spend more and get one with a wider     tread belt than the less expensive     belt of the other popular model   i also splurged and paid for the installation  boy am i glad  this is a big  solid piece of equipment  not much smaller than what s in my condo  gym  even though it folds easily  it s not really portable and isn t going to fit in a close  but it s fantastic   as far was  the negative reviews about the ifit  scam  in which the machine won t start without an ifit subscription   yes   the machine comes with red warning signs saying  your treadmill is currently locked  it will not start until you go to ifit com actvate   but the wonderful amazon servicemen who delivered it just showed me to hold down the sync button for    seconds and it was good to go  it feels solid and roomy and is quieter than i thought      
489,5.0,                       i had bought a different treadmill and it wasn t quite what i wanted so i saw this nordictrack one and at the time was at a great price  it does everything i want and i love it  easy to use setting with the speed settings and automatic incline  i have not hooked up to the fitness programs yet but i wanted a treadmill since i am not entirely comfortable going to the gym  instillation does take a bit more time with this one but works great  it is heavy and big so you will need some help with this  there was a damaged piece with delivery but i submitted to them and they replaced it quickly  great service      
490,3.0,                       most certainly works  love the motor   generally smooth and quiet to run on  settings let you incline to    degrees and speed to    mph  no decrease in angle which would have been nice mostly concerned with the software platform  looks like it s based on android   which is hopelessly out of date and rife with security concerns  wifi only   no ethernet also the treadmill s instructions clearly state not to incline the treadmill when folded   twice now when i left the treadmill on it went through a full up down cycle and made some awful noises in the folded position  the bluetooth speakers also like to go a ghostly beep when a connected device is out of range or some other complaint   which essentially means you need to flip this treadmill completely off when you re not using it   and therefore the power button should not be on the bottom front of the treadmill assembly was not difficult but the parts did not fit well together  a couple of the plastic pieces came with broken tabs  the packaging was secure and nothing arrived damaged in shipping   took a huge dump run to get rid of the massive pallet and cardboard   every piece was individually wrapped in thin film plastic when you run on the treadmill just about everything in the trays bounces and rattles around   so i suppose they re good for a soft towel or two   but that s about that i m torn on ifit  compared with the competition it s a cheap alternative  the instructors and enthusiastic  the programs are well filmed and edited and it s great that the treadmill automatically adjusts to their program  the issue i have is the i am in no way in good shape and the programs are all ridiculously easy  which means i have to manually turn everything up   slightly annoying  i wish there was a plus            percent or some other setting to turn up all the programs globally  ifit shows my weekly stats   but they re my weekly stats from my first week and it s locked up and stuck on those stats  i probably need to factory reset it  it also continues to prompt to update even through you select it and it doesn t do anything      
491,5.0,                       i ve seen that this is a walking treadmill  but i use it to run on every day  i m not a world record holding sprinter or anything  but it does the job  it only goes up to   mph  but i definitely don t need it to really go any faster  i run      miles a day on it and it holds up  it folds super easily  its on hydraulics  there s a ledge to hold my phone ipad and lots of cupholder space      
492,1.0,                       treadmill was delivered           rd party assembler  ordered through amazon  put treadmill together monday         treadmill was loud from day one  i thought it needed time to quiet down  maybe like a breaking in period  by that saturday  my son said that the track was sliding off to the side  i called amazon on two different occasions for help on both occasions  they put me on hold and returned saying they were unable to get in touch with nordictrack  after the second failed attempt  i told them to come get the treadmill  now i am waiting for a refund that can take weeks and on top of that  i cannot get a refund for the assembly that i paid almost      for because they said that the assemblers job was complete so no refund is warranted      
493,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have had this for a little over   months now and have been using it   to   times a week  there was a software update done recently and it has free video  walks  and runs with trainers in hd that make this an awesome treadmill   i said  walk  in parenthesis because speeds of    are runs for me  lol  you don t have to subscribe to anything to use this or see the videos  i also love the graphs that show you the speed and incline path that is coming up      
494,5.0,                       honestly  with covid around and gyms closed  this has been my go to for indoor running  i love the programs  the style and size  the price is amazing  the only thing is you need to register to their program  i d you re looking to save money  this program will help you save more money than a la fitness membership i have recommended this machine to others and i recommend it to everyone  specially to those missing the treadmill and those who are in their weight loss journey another note if you re a outdoor runner  i recommend this for you  mainly because of the bad air quality from the wildfires      
495,5.0,                       it s been about almost    days since we received product and the first thing i need to state is that even though it says you have to have ifit you don t  just hold the ifit button down for a few seconds and tada ready to use putting it together was a bit of a challenge but i had read enough reviews to know this could happen but that i would be happy i did  it took about       to put it all together  we the quality of treadmill we are receiving it is well worth it  our did come with a broken cup holder but reached out to amazon and they took care of it we love that the incline works perfect and it s not so noisy  we felt it was like when you go to the gym and use those treadmills  just the same amount  we like the    in width belt and it was one of the things we were looking for so this was just right our ally  it was shorter than we wanted    inches  but still perfect for the price when it comes to the belt  you may have to adjust from time to time so it won t rub on the sides  it comes with a tool and it s super easy to do  we use the incline a lot and notice the difference of the belt and how it is very important to keep that tool so if it does need adjustment  we have only adjusted twice the first time using and haven t since  again we are very happy with the product excellent but for the price and great for a runner and walker  we do interval running but usually run about   and it is an awesome feel to our steps  it doesn t have long side rails but it just a matter of getting use to it  no big deal about that highly recommend you buy the product and as stated before you do not need ifit  if it s your kind of things well you can always get the subscription  oh and it doesn t have a fan but still worth the buy loving and enjoy the treadmill      
496,5.0,                       where i failed  don t tighten anything until you have the whole thing assembled  not just at the end of each step  i was able to get it together though it took some rather strong language and a call to customer service to figure out what had gone wrong  i still managed to get it together without help  but the difficulty i faced in assembly was of my own making that said  it s a great machine  it feels completely solid and the ease of moving it even once it s setup is thoroughly impressive  the menus are intuitive and easy to navigate  and the presence of the quick shutoff chain is minimal and easy to use when wanted  the only physical things i would like to see different would mostly be with the app functionality  eg the complete lack of integration for iphone s health stats app  the lack of a search function in the guided workouts  the inability  to my knowledge  to map out custom workouts ahead of time with sliders or some form of paragraphic interface  and that it can t turn the unit s display screen when the app is in use  the incline works beautifully and smoothly  plus is gradual enough to not risk a fall or injury if you aren t paying attention very satisfied with my purchase     
497,5.0,                       man  i love this machine  it s great because it s a common household name for treadmills  top notch  a friend came to visit and said  oh you got a nordictrack  a real treadmill   as they proceeded to test it out  they loved it  i love it  nice and sturdy machine and i like the fact that you can run on it and it goes to   mph  happy with product and with times like this it s nice to be able to walk if i don t want to go outside      
498,5.0,                       let me start off by saying that i used a treadmill from walmart for over   years before i purchased this  so i was ready for any improvement i am not a runner or an avid work out person  i wanted a nice treadmill for walking   light jogging  and incline training i have used this treadmill for a month now and i absolutely love it  i actually forward to working on it it s easy to use and comfortable to walk on  no issues at all i did choose the trial ifit membership and not sure why so many other reviewers have opted out  it s a fantastic feature  and it s free for a year  why would you pass it up yes  you have to give them your credit card information  that s typical of any trial product or membership you choose so far  i have hiked along the grand canyon  around niagara falls  and scotland   the ifit offers activities for all levels  all over the world  workouts go by quickly because you re so in to the scenery  and the trainers keep you motivated and offer great training tips what i really like is that i can manually adjust the speed and incline  if the trainers are going too fast and still follow along for example  i chose a run across the grand canyon   but the trainer was going at speed of      i can t go that fast   so i set it to a lower speed and was still able to enjoy the scenery and inclines i know there are other treadmills that offer fans and a nice sound system and such  but this fits my needs perfectly i would recommend this and the ifit wholeheartedly on a side note  it took my wife about three hours to put together i also paid a little extra for delivery person to carry it downstairs for me  worth every penny      
499,5.0,                       my husband   i use it daily   specially my husband  runing   reg and uphill  i use it for walking also flat   uphill was easy to assemble if you follow the directions a the video  how to   i recommend to have   persons for assembling even if one is there to help with the steps this was a god send especially during these times of covid      gym is not a healthy option      
500,4.0,                       pro  the treadmill is very substantial  heavy  and doesn t move at all on our cement floor  once we familiarized ourselves with all the steps to activate ifit and started working out  absolutely no problems  i enjoy using ifit  my husband prefers just walking on the oval track and listening to his own music with headphones  it s possible to use it without ifit  but worth trying it for the free trial period  i find it makes the exercise time pass quickly  walking in london  hawaii  new zealand  petra  etc cons   we are over     so maybe should have expected we couldn t assemble this without help   it took nearly an hour to unpack it  that said  we gamely tried  got as far as step    the bolts holding all this steel together just wouldn t go in  did we have the wrong tools  not enough muscle  who knows  we hired someone who got it up and running in   hours  the heart rate handles you hold onto with both hands weren t accurate     bpm  really    in no universe am i an elite athlete  lol bottom line   definitely a good purchase and is perfect for this epidemic lockdown when leaving the house to exercise is not an option for us      
501,3.0,                       i see all the commercials with the twenty year old athletes running on their treadmills with intense trainers engaged with them   i am too old for that and did not need that   what i needed was a good quality simple treadmill so i could walk at a good pace comfortably   i am recovering from triple bypass surgery and my old treadmill of    years gave out   the treadmill market is confusing and saturated  but i feel the nordictrack t    is exactly what i need   i have been using it almost daily for a month and am pleased with the quality  performance  comfort  ease of use and appearance   the one thing i absolutely did not like is the ifit situation   per the treadmill instructions  you have to setup a free    day membership trial in order to activate the treadmill   as i stated before  i am recovering from heart surgery and just needed a treadmill and subsequently forgot about the free trial   i was charged an annual membership of        i called ifit customer service and they cancelled my membership but will only refund      i paid      for one day of membership   i would rate the treadmill itself higher than i did  but since nordictrack wants to bundle ifit into the purchase  then my rating will reflect what i think of that scam      
502,1.0,                       bolts and screws an absolute nightmare to get in during assembly  won t line up properly and feels like you re stripping the threads    days running on it and the belt slides to the left and or right  followed instructions and it seems to hold for a while then slips again  then heard a squeaking noise coming from front end  called icon customer service and after a video call it was determined that i need a new roller  attached are pics of the old roller  this is obviously a refurbish  or they just beat the heck out of it during assembly  they offered to send me the roller  a pretty major part  and have me install it myself  i declined and asked to send a tech or i was returning  good customer service i ll say  but absolutely horrible quality  pretty unimpressed with nordic track and their       treadmill      
503,1.0,                       this treadmill was the biggest mistake ever  it arrived smash to pieces  with the screws and plastic pieces everywhere  assembly was a pain and definitely requires two people  instructions were unclear looked rushed  customer service is nonexistent and requires preregistration of product just to get  assistance   it was an ordeal just to get replacement parts for the damaged good that is this treadmill  which took     weeks to arrive  so i have this smashed hunk of junk just sitting there collecting dust  once the smashed parts were replaced  the product requires you to purchase an exercise plan just to operate  but that can be bypassed by pressing and holding the blue button on the panel  the treading feels loose and has too much slack  the display is awkwardly low especially when incline is changed  and worst of all  the buttons are not very responsive and slippery  its always a guess trying to change the speed or incline this product arrived defective as well  every time the incline is lowered  there s a horrendous snapping sound that rocks the machine  clearly not normal and the company refuses to fix or replace this defective part  do not buy this product or anything sold by nordic track  avoid like the plague      
504,5.0,                       amazon was great on this delivery  the first one was damaged before i got it  it was returned before it even made it to me and i was notified via email  i contacted amazon support  the lady was great  she had a new one on the way the same day the delivery company was great as well  the two delivery guys brought it in the house and down to my family room  please tip your delivery guys  this thing weighs a ton took about an hour to unbox  lay it out  build and cleanup  no need to use a professional setup person if you can read some basic instructions and use a screwdriver and turn a wrench once together  it works great  the big reason i went with this over a few of the others that were less expensive was to be able to adjust the incline while using it versus manually setting it  that was worth the extra      alone the only negative  the heart rate monitor seems to read my heart rate at about      of what it really is      of the time  i have a message out to nordic tracks customer service so we ll see if there is a fix  could be user error but i don t think so no need to join the ifit program that comes with it unless you want to pay the yearly fee for it  hold down the ifit  sync button  while powering it on the first time and it bypasses it  look below a few reviews  there s one that walks you through it  you only have to do this once  the speakers aren t very good  but i didn t expect much there overall  great purchase and i d recommend it highly  if you re on the fence buy it      
505,5.0,                       there s a reason why nordic track has a reputation for high quality   i wanted a decent treadmill but like most folks on a budget  i figured i d have to compromise as low price and decent quality is sometimes an impossible match   this treadmill is everything i was hoping for   it is sturdy  roomy and well built  the ifit membership is a nice feature if you re interested in special training programs but you can still use the treadmill if you are not  ignore the decals that state that you have to register the machine in order for it to work  simply hold down the ifit logo for    seconds and the treadmill will start right up   no credit card info or registration required   i love this machine   mega value for the price   has all the features i want   very happy with this purchase      
506,4.0,                       great tred for the money  amazon brought it in and we did the rest  set aside a couple of hours to get it done  does not hurt to search youtube for assembly vids  cause the included instructions to build are a bit hard to get  girlfriend is down on this guy cause she is ready to fly  luckily  no broken parts or missing bolts and  skip the ifit subscription if you want by holding the ifit button after powering it on  for        seconds  it is  yours without the bs  will give a more thorough review of the machine after using it for a few weeks      
507,5.0,                       i love it  it was pretty easy to assemble  only took me about an hour or so if you have the right tools  it says that you need to go to ifit com activate to use it but you really don t  you can bypass that requirement easy by holding down the fitbit icon for    secs and the treadmill will unlock  make sure you have the emergency key attached once you do it  overall  i am completely satisfied      
508,5.0,                       amazon prime delivery was on time and efficient  no shipping damage  all the bits and pieces that were supposed to be in the box were in the box  you do need a phillips head screwdriver and adjustable wrench for assembly i    f and the only one in the house who reads instructions and makes sure all the pieces are there first  decided to put it together myself  it didn t feel like     hours but that s how long it took  did i complain  a little  in step   i carefully loosened tightened four pre attached screws in the handrails to get the larger screws washers in place  turn the page for step   to read  if there are four screws pre attached inside     remove and discard them     grumble  it s recommended you have a person help you hold to attach the console assembly but it s doable by yourself if you re flexible  i did need the second person for steps        of     to hold the belt frame up while i attached the crossbar and storage latch yes  there are stickers and  warnings  stating that the treadmill is locked and will not start until activated at ifit com  you do not need to enter your credit card information  find the small font that says skip or no thank you   you will still get the one month free trial  i do not like that i cannot input individual stats  height  weight  etc   into the treadmill directly  those fancy features come with the ifit app subscription  i did poke around the ifit programs a bit   would have been nice for it to limit what i could see to this particular machine  in other words there were plenty of programs that incline to     or     automatically   useless for this machine as it only goes to      but  the walks runs that take you on tours of places are neat  would i buy into the subscription  not unless it synchs with my fitbit which it does not  speaking of which  the treadmill pulse bar monitor and my fitbit read are fairly close  i m not sure about distance steps because i keep forgetting to check   which is why synching would be nice the machine lifts out of the way and lowers easily  not a feature we use regularly but it s there if needed   as with every other piece of exercise equipment we ve ever owned  the built in speakers are not awesome  the lip at the bottom of the console holds phone tablet admirably  if i could design it myself i would have it at the top so that i didn t have to look down to see my phone  as the ifit trainer is telling me to keep my head up  note  none of the assembly steps in the manual indicate to attach the safety key  it s just pictured hanging off the pulse bar in the final step  it did not come attached  it s wrapped in a small bag with the screws etc    you do need to have the red safety key in place on the pulse bar to make the machine work  there s a small indented area with a key logo   the important emergency information on how the  safety  part of the key works  if the clip is attached to you  is highlighted in the manual under how to turn on the power  be safe so far  we ve had four family members of varying sizes use the machine on full workouts   walkers and runners  haven t wanted to adjust cushioning  there s been no belt slippage and there have been no weird noises  for the price  we recommend it update   months later  after browsing the ifit programs for a few days i found the functionality between the app and the treadmill to be what i needed in my life  i have an annual subscription  still don t need to leave your cc info with them permanently   because i m not just staring at the wall while using the machine i look forward to hopping on     days a week faithfully  traveling around the world   heck  i ve even done a few virtual  k races  machine is still solid   i use it the most  but my husband is on it    x week and a teenager too  no squeaks or issues thus far      
509,1.0,                       bought this   years ago along with a service agreement that had a free lube maintenance service call as part of the agreement   they call to renew my agreement which reminds me to ask for the free service   the service guy comes out does his thing and leaves   two days later i go to use it for the first time   it turns on and shuts off again   call nordik track and she says sounds like the circuit board went out since he was there and you still have    days to renew the agreement which runs out in   weeks   i said let s let the service guy come back since it worked before he came and now it doesn t   she says if he can t get back in   weeks you won t be covered   why would i renew an agreement with a company that doesn t do right by their customers   better to just put it against a new treadmill from a different company since the console was outdated when i got it three years ago   update  while the lady on the nordic track  help line  was only interested in selling me an extension to my warranty the  rd party service guy called me back and was able to help me trouble shoot the problem over the phone   you would think nordic track would offer technical support   further update  the machine still works well  looks like they jacked the price since covid hit tho   this was a good purchase but the warranty and the company support is worthless      
510,5.0,                       i started walking and using stepbet to challenge myself during covid quarantine   as we approached the cooler  wetter weather i was worried that i would have trouble keeping up with my step challenges  so i was happy to find this treadmill   reviews here and in other places are great and it is exactly what i needed to keep up with my challenges   i love that i can put my ipad on the ledge and watch something while i walk  or set my phone there while i listen to a podcast or audiobook  i can walk at a pretty fast pace with no major noise or vibration   my daughter runs on it and i can hardly tell she is running from the other room i ll admit it was a challenge to put together    definitely need   people  but soo worth it   i have not activated the ifit membership but i am considering it overall  this is a great treadmill to use at home when the weather makes it tough to get outside      
511,4.0,                       i received my treadmill on august      the delivery company was great and was willing to place it anywhere in the house that i wanted it   i opened the box and was able to put it together by myself   i wanted one that could fold up so that i didn t lose a lot of floor space when not using it   my only complaint is that the tiny wheels used to move it are located in the wrong place   i feel they should be on the front where most of the weight of the machine is so that when i fold it and try to roll it i do not have to use a lot of muscle to get it moved   with the wheels on the back i have to pull the weight of the machine towards me to roll it   my previous folding treadmill  different brand  had the wheels on the front      
512,5.0,                       if you watch the prices  you can get this on great sales at certain times of the year  particularly around holidays   the motor is plenty powerful for what i need it for  jogging and power walking   and the running surface is comfortable  i am pleased that i can continue my workouts in the colder weather months  you do not have to subscribe to ifit to use the machine  you can always click on manual workout  but connecting the treadmill to wifi is still worthwhile without the ifit subscription  as you do get access to some free  included workouts   also  i paid for the delivery to room of choice  but the carrier that delivers it will only deliver to doorstep or garage currently because of covid     but amazon refunded me the     that i paid for delivery to room of choice  can t speak to the ease of assembly  as i paid someone locally to do it  and they ended up taking it to the room of choice for me       
513,1.0,                       nordic trac shame on you      suffered for two days trying to figure out how to get this thing running   finally i read another customer s review   he she figured out how to bypass this whole rigamarole by holding ifit button down for    seconds   it bypasses all the ifit membership bs and starts the treadmill   i hope it works and is not the dud that other customers say it is   amazon s choice       really        
514,5.0,                       i am so not good at working out  that is before i got this great machine  it was soooo easy to assemble right out of the box and has made workouts a fun thing  even for someone who tries to avoid exercise   it has so many wonderful features that you would probably only find in a much more expensive machine  or at your local gym   if you re someone who needs a push to get started with any exercise  i highly recommend this product      
515,1.0,                       after lugging the     box to hour  nd floor then delaying the assembly for   months we finally opened it up and spent a couple of hours assembling it  one of the last steps was to mount the display control panel  we carefully opened the box that i was in  placed it  screwed it in and i was going online to activate the ser ice i pealed of the  wait  you must first activate      to begin using the machine  i was shocked at what i saw under the sticker  a smashed display screen  i know that we did not cause it and now i am almost    days past the return deadline  i hope amazon or nordic trak will make this right  and soon      
516,5.0,                       it was a long winter and if i was going to look decent in a bikini  i needed some extra help   due to this coronavirus  i should be working out after work  but alas here we are  for the money  this was a steal at      with tax  i m not going to be doing anything more than fast walking  won t be jogging or running because i don t want to die just yet  it folds up nicely and putting it together wasn t too horrible  this is why i have a boyfriend      
517,3.0,                       at the beginning of installation the manual says to register your device at a third party webpage  which requires the submission of payment information  if you skip this step and complete assembly installation you ll unfortunately find your unit is locked and you ll be prompted go back to the webpage and fork over tour credit card yet again  with your newly purchased machine as hostage  this is deceptive and i d even go as far as to call it an outright scam  nordic track should be ashamed of themselves  do not put payment info into ifit  you can circumvent this step by holding down the ifit button for    seconds  for free   the treadmill is actually ok otherwise but it really rubbed me the wrong way that nordic track tries to take advantage of new customers in such a dishonest way      
518,1.0,                       am i to understand that the only way to operate the machine is to buy into an additional piece of software that will bill me every month  why didn t the installers show me how to operate the machine  as in do more than say  read the pink sheet and log in to get the treadmill to work  isn t this an operating treadmill not only was the treadmill delivered   days late  but the installers were in a rush  they were polite and kept a social distance  but  they did not start the machine   this needs to be corrected without delay  the dispatcher for this crew is named  sharon   she called each time there was a postponement of the delivery date part    after one week  i must state that i did manage to start the machine  after seeking information on youtube  however  after one week  i wasn t prepared for the belt to begin to fold on one side  my request for customer assistance has gone unanswered really not what i expect from amazon  if it cannot be adjusted  just come get it      
519,4.0,                       really enjoying this treadmill  this is not a reflection of treadmill itself  but there was some not superior service with the delivery company in terms of miscommunication on delivery dates and finding the delivery location  that aside it did take me a few hours to assemble  by myself with hubby helping when i needed parts held   watching some youtube videos and googling spots i was stumbled at along the way  a few of the screws were hard to fit in the holes but were able to make it work  assembly was the thing i was most worried about  but once that was complete it s been a great tread  i ve used it so far for running classes on an app and enjoy the quick jump buttons for speed and incline  this model works perfect for what i need it for  will continue to see how the tread holds up as well an any maintenance needed  hopefully minimal to none       
520,4.0,                       this is a good  solid home treadmill  great value for the price  stable with plenty of power for walking and running pros  easy to assemble  simple to use   and easy to bypass the ifit  if  you don t want to subscribe   nordictrack customer support is fantastic  we had some issues and their response was superior  note  due to the pandemic  the phone wait  and wait for an online chat  was over an hour  so i just put the call on speaker and went about my business until they were able to answer cons  front motor hood accent sticks out too far onto the walking belt and is easy to get your feet caught on and trip  side handrails are only     long so they do not provide good support  since you have to walk pretty far back  due to the hood accent  the heart rate monitor is very inaccurate and does not work much of the time  additionally  because the hood accent sticks out so far  it is dangerous to hold onto that for stability  while walking or running  this is not a major issue as i have a pulse oximeter that i use  when i want  the  key clip   that you hook to your clothes to shut off power  in case you fall  is made of plastic and breaks easily we purchased the extended warranty  but have yet to use that  our current issues were all covered under the basic nordictrack warranty      
521,5.0,                       first of all the size of the box is     x     x     and weighs about     lbs   the delivery company was terrible and i had to work directly with amazon to resolve issues with them   it took two people to move the platform to the room where it was to stay   i m   years old and was able to put all of it together but the fold bar by myself although i will admit having another person to help with the console would have been nice   it would also have been helpful if it was noted in the order description that a surge protector was required so it could have been ordered at the same time   once i got it altogether i did get it connected to ifit easy enough with my phone but ended up getting an android tablet to use a bigger screen with it   i like how quiet the treadmill is  i like that the ifit program automatically adjusts speed and elevation   i wasn t planning to continue ifit after the free month but i ve decided that i like the program   i think it s a great treadmill that does everything i need and the price was great   i m glad i didn t pay extra for the bigger screen version because the tablet was a better buy to work with it and more versatile too  i would recommend this to anyone that is not into aggressive training  you d probably want a more expensive and powerful device      
522,5.0,                       i paid for the assembly  but it took   people approximately an hour to deliver  assemble and say their goodbyes  the equipment works wonderfully  i typically use it     times each week for up to an hour      
523,4.0,                       i like it  it s good  it works  my only negative is i really would like to know minutes per mile pace and apparently it does not do this although it is promised in the manual and at least one online description  here is the manual quote  the upper half of the display can also show the elapsed time  the distance you have walked or run  the speed of the walking belt  the approximate number of calories you have burned  your pace  and the incline of the treadmill  press the display button repeatedly until the desired workout information appears  did you see that  your pace  in the quote above  miles per hour is not a pace for a runner or walker  i need minutes per mile  i did press the display button repeatedly and the pace never appeared now if someone can show me where i missed it  i will happily change my review to   stars  maybe i can rig it somehow with a smart phone      
524,4.0,                       nice looking treadmill  folds down and up very easy with the tension rod  it carries the weight so that is nice   putting together was a little frustrating as some of the screws did not fit and had to use my own   i read this in some other reviews as well   especially the grounding screw provided was completely wrong size     
525,5.0,                       due to covid i was unable to workout comfortably in my mask  so i opted for a home treadmill   i am very happy with my purchase   it took my husband about two     hours to assemble  it s well made and sturdy i would also like to confirm that you do not need a membership  as stated previously   press and hold the ifit button for about    seconds and it will work enjoy      
526,4.0,                       well shipping went well got a tracker app  that showed map and   of stops before me and they texted     hour before getting here  i did not pay for it to be taken to room of choice or put together  it is      lbs but np with   floor carts and no steps   spent maybe   hrs putting it together with stopping now and then did it by myself with no problems but if your not mechanically inclined   people could make it better  thank god i seen all the post about the way to skip there ifit crap by holding the ifit tab for    sec   only bad things so far i see is the heart rate bar is in not the best place should be on the arms  i have a fit bits so that s no big deal and them things are never      as it is they say you can link your fit bits to it but its not picking mine up  wish it would have come with a lube kit as well or at min  lube  over all i would buy it over but time will tell if that changes will update if things go bad     
527,1.0,                       i am completely dissatisfied with my purchase   the treadmill is very heavy and the directions for assembly are unclear   i tried to have a service call for assembly and was told they are not providing this service due to covid   my husband and son finally got it assembled but i still can t get it to work   their customer service is very poor   at times i ve been on hold for up to   hours   their online support site is unavailable   i do not recommend purchasing nordic track   it s been a nightmare      
528,5.0,                       let s start by saying  this treadmill is b o m b    i got it delevered and had to pay extra     bucks to have it taken to a specific area which was the basement  the equipment was super heavy even for the two husky men that dropped it off  then the next day a guy came to put it together  it was brutal to watch him with all those screws  and i had to assist because you need two people  especially when putting the electrical frame together  anyways  it came with the one year i fit sub  and let me tell you how geeked i was after activation  o m g   you can run  walk anywhere in the world and it plays music as your coach is talkin which you can adjust  it has a create button that give you live gps routes to any place in the world  i create a walk through israel  like really    you mean i can walk anywhere in the world   you know how much money i can save   i walked down the streets and inclined pass shops  this is some real live  jetson livin   i love it  this is hands down the best investment  worth every penny      
529,4.0,                       i have assembled many products without issues  but this one was a pain   too many screw holes that weren t the right size  along with bolts and screws that were much too difficult to access with tools after figuring out how to bypass the ifit registration  hold the ifit button down for    seconds with the magnetic key in place   i m happy now      
530,5.0,                       i had reservations about buying a treadmill online without trying it first  i ve never owned one and only used commercial grade treads in gyms and hotels  i was thrilled that this one feels just as solid and no louder  assembled by one person  except for one step  it s really heavy but drug and slid down the stairs easily  ha  i love the ifit app and connecting it via bluetooth  the speed and incline is controlled via the app  even if i decide to change the speed manually the app still changes the incline and vice versa  i set my ipad in the console and run through newport beach  germany and montana  the bed is nice and long  i m     and     and run anywhere from an      to       mile depending on the day      
531,1.0,                       the product itself is nice  the problem is that once you purchase the treadmill you should just be able to assemble it and use it  the assembly is tricky at times  especially alone  but do able  when the setup is complete you then need to get on to a computer and register it with ifit  which will require a credit card  then you have to download an app  watch an introductory video  create a profile  connect your phone to your machine and activate it  i have seen some videos showing people how to unlock the machine by holding the ifit button  that must have been corrected on nordic track because that did not work for me  fortunately  the cancellation process is not very difficult  ifit com  hover over your name  settings  membership  end benefits and then end benefits through about   more  please stay  menus here s the reason for     i don t appreciate being held hostage in the use of the machine that i just shelled out nearly      for  who are you guys  the american government selling insurance  when this machine gets older and breaks down  i can assure nordic track and ifit that i will not be going through their circus again  i don t need to pay     a month to be told how to run on a treadmill the features are nice though  aux in  ipod compatible  speakers  a shelf for my ipad so i can watch basketball or whatever  nice machine  just feels like a scam when you can t turn it out and run      
532,1.0,                       i was very excited to get this  but when it arrived it was heavily damaged  one of the foot rails sitting next to the treadmill in the image  was completely broken off and the motor hood has a crack in it along with a very ugly scuff   strangely   the shock absorptions looked like they were in bad shape as well  but i think that was caused by whatever caused the rail to break off the treadmill  one of the foot covers seen sitting on top of the machine  was damaged so bad that i was finding  pieces of broken plastic throughout the box   there were also minor damaged areas throughout like the motor hood was warped due to the crack making so the hood no longer fit as it should onto the frame of the treadmill  the holes were certain bolts were screwed in were warped  the underside of the treadmill looked like it may have been damaged as well  i have no idea if it had any mechanical issues  so i really cant comment on that considering i did not even get past simply opening the box  this is going to be returned to amazon      
533,5.0,                       overall great buy  the machine functions well and was pretty simple for myself and my fiance to put together  took about an hour  instructions were clear and simple to follow i ve been using the machine on all levels  sometimes doing intervals at max speed and then decreasing it  sometimes longer moderate paced runs  sometimes just walking  never have had any issues at any specific speed or setting speakers work well  not gonna be of a surround sound quality but for music while running works good enough my only issue with the entire device is you have to sign up for ifit in order to turn the device on  this requires a credit card to start the free trial  at least mine required it   i immediately cancelled the plan so it wouldn t charge me but i hate being forced to do stuff like that  especially when it s to just turn on a treadmill device good  speakers good  overall i d buy again      
534,1.0,                       i ran   miles a day on my previous c    and if needed could pause at any time and resume a run  i just called customer service to see if i was missing something as i can t resume my runs when i pause them and i was informed you can only do this if you have ifit  having a feature like this intentionally disabled for an avid runner is abhorrent  i cannot stress how much i do not recommend this treadmill for this reason alone  especially if you do long distance runs      
535,5.0,                       my wife is a gym rat  and with the quarantine going to the gym is an impossibility  she decided she wanted a treadmill and wanted to cheap out with one of the really cheap treadmills on amazon  but i did some research and decided it d be better to not cheap out so much and get this nordictrack instead i m happy we did  i wasn t exercising at all prior to getting the nordictrack but now that we ve got one in the apartment we both use it every day to run a couple miles  so far so good  honestly i can t really tell the difference between this machine and ones i used to use at the gym  so i think it s pretty great i hear people talking about wanting more expensive treadmills that are quieter  and  sure  this one is a bit loud  but it s not really a big deal at all  if i m in the bedroom and she s running in the living room  i mostly just hear her foot falls and not the treadmill  if she s in the living room watching tv while i m running  she just turns up the tv a bit  my airpod pros also silence it  so if you re concerned about noise  i don t think you should be too worried about it  plus we haven t had any complaints from neighbors or similar this treadmill will be getting a lot of use from us  it definitely won t be turning into a coat hanger  i ll end up purchasing the extended warranty for sure  and we ll see how well it can keep up with two dedicated runners hammering away at it      
536,5.0,                       i purchased this treadmill just after all of the covid lock downs began almost a year ago   i figured going into this whole situation that i d either gain    pounds or lose    pounds   ha   i was about     lbs at that time and can confirm at this time i m about    lbs less due to alot of walking on this treadmill   when i purchased  i knew i d need a solid machine just because of my current weight at the time   while there have been plenty of cheat days between then and now    i can confirm this treadmill is solid and well powered for my needs   i m not a runner but maybe someday   so  i mainly use for very long walks at a faster pace   i will toss in a little incline from time to time   my main focus had been keeping myself in fat burning heart rate  you can look that up    easy to calculate    i started at just a few miles a day  usually       days a week    now  i m up to        miles a day   i did purchase the added   year extended warrantee because the price was good and i will take them up on their preventative maintenance once i hit the   year mark of ownership   having used extensively  i can very much confirm it s a solid machine and i feel very good about this purchase   good luck to you    just keep walking    or running      
537,1.0,                       first the product came with dents and some breakage   i called amazon and they offered me partial refund we thought the damage just looks cosmetic so product might not still works   so we moved the    lb trade mill to basement   after hours of assembly we have to know that treadmill just does not start amazon tried calling the manufacturer but did not get any response back  now we had to return the treadmill and the issue is its very heavy and taking it out from basement is just not possible for me amazon is saying you have to put it to front porch to get it picked up by carrier i would recommend not to buy this and buy one from somewhere else that offer free assembly   so it the treadmill does not work you can just ask them to take it back      
538,4.0,                       we like the treadmill  it works well and having it at home is very convenient  first of all  the product is heavy  if you are going to assemble it yourselves  make sure     people who can lift     lbs available to help  the assembly is hard if you don t get the angles right  it took us almost   hours to get everything right as the screws won t tighten and console won t fit between the bars unless you get the  angles right  folding is easy  it is worth buying the assembly for      or     if there is a deal   you don t need ifit but the instruction makes you think you need it  press on the ifit logo for       seconds and you can use the manual mode with no issues  overall except for assembly  we like this treadmill     
539,5.0,                       along with the nordictrack s  i bike  i purchased the t series     treadmill from nordictrack   just like the bike  i am super impressed with this treadmill   prior to purchase  i reviewed a lot of different types models of indoor equipment   i wanted to have an interactive experience that will keep me both entertained and focused on goals while i exercise   this treadmill does just that   the screen is large  but not massive in size   that is okay  though   it is plenty big to take in the scenery as you follow your trainer   there are hundreds of training sessions  with more added all the time   feel like walking   have a historian walk you around the pyramids of egypt   ready for a run   train for a marathon in utah   feeling challenged   hike up a mountainside trail   the trainers encourage you along the way  and when their terrain changes  so does the incline   decline resistance on this equipment   onboard stats are right at the top  so you know how you are performing   i especially like the addition of google maps   i can create my own trail and see the sights in places i have never been   the equipment has a solid frame  and the overall footprint is not so massive   great price for this equipment   highly recommend      
540,5.0,                       this treadmill was delivered promptly   i arranged for the assembly through amazon and i m glad i did   the technician knew exactly what to do and it was pretty complicated   i usually do my own assembly but was glad i didn t this time   the treadmill is a very solid and serious machine   nothing flimsy or cheap about it   it has basic functions  which was all i wanted   i just get on and walk for a while   the incline feature is a bonus   i have it placed in front of a tv in my office  so i watch  my shows  while i walk   the only negative is that it is quite loud   it makes a loud whining sound   enough that i couldn t hear my tv   i solved the problem by purchasing a set of bluetooth headphones for the tv   solution works great   i m very motivated to use this machine and am enjoying it a lot      
541,4.0,                       as we move into the winter months i wanted to have a treadmill that i could run on instead of running in the dark   i ve never been much of a treadmill runner  but with covid    i thought this would be a good addition to my  fitness room   aka my basement    it arrived a day later than scheduled and i was very worried that it wouldn t be placed in my basement   so worried that i called the company   thankfully they still provide this service in va and three guys carried it to my basement   the box was damaged and i took a bunch of pictures in case the treadmill was damaged as well   i was able to unpack and put together     of the treadmill by myself   i watched a youtube video to get an idea on what i needed to do   best advice was to lay out everything  watch the video  although it wasn t the exact same model  and then the written instructions made a lot of sense   i needed another set of hands for the console and the hydraulic lift   i received it on       finished putting it together by       that evening and have used it three times since  both running and walking   the right hand cup holder seems to be the only part that was damaged   otherwise it works great  for me    i have a portable fan set up and i can access online classes either through my phone or tv   it s basic  the tread is wide and long enough for me  i m        and it feels very sturdy   nothing fancy  but i m happy with the purchase   no buyers remorse      
542,1.0,                       update  icon fitness promised that i d get a free treadmill maintenance kit if i left a review for this treadmill  the treadmill itself is definitely   stars  but the company gets   star for lying  i never received what i was promised  it s been over   months and i haven t received the treadmill maintenance kit original review i rarely write reviews for products  but i made an exception for this treadmill  it s everything i could have ever wanted in a treadmill assembly   with the exception of one step  attaching the folding lever   i was able to assemble the treadmill on my own  the instructions were clear and easy to follow  no parts were missing and everything was labeled appropriately screen and touch keys   the    inch screen has a crisp and clear picture  excellent touch response  and is very easy to use  all controls on the treadmill are easy to use and well laid out mechanical   the treadmill is nice and smooth  i especially love the cushion adjustment which helps reduce or decrease treadmill firmness  it s great for me since i have knee issues  walking and running on the treadmill feels akin to commercial machines at a gym  my mom even said the quality and size reminded her of something at a gym ifit   the ifit software is awesome  i will definitely renew my membership after the free year concludes that was included in the treadmill order  two of my favorite workouts are the mt  fuji hike and easter island tour  ifit trainers are incredibly engaging and make working out fun and educational  there are tons of other workout options to choose from  including running   k training  strength workouts  etc  plus  new workouts are routinely added i m really glad i decided to make this purchase  you will too      
543,3.0,                       it s a nice treadmill and i like the ifit trainer options  but  serious screen program issuesif your internet is down it is terribly slow at starting up the screen     minutes no way to turn off the screen  other than to turn off the entire unit does not have a local sign in option  like it should  so if the internet is down you can still sign in does not store login names  this should at least of a drop down list of sign in names to pick from afteradding a user wifi  is not very good  seems like they could have put a better chip in it no bluetooth  this is an obvious add on that it should have   the    s does  but this    si  a more expensive model does not  my guess this is disable  the wifi chip probably supports wifi and bluetooth like most chipsets do these days  please enable via an update  if possible      
544,4.0,                       i have only used this once  but the product is great  i love the touch screen  it doesn t seem any louder than other treadmills  i like how you can select a speed      and include on the side without toggling up using the arrow  i don t like that you have to sign up for an ifit subscription in order to activate the machine   it gives    day trial free  but i didn t want to sign up because i ll just have to cancel before the free trial expires i also had an issue with amazon not initially shipping my item on time  i had scheduled assembly for the day after arrival  but i didn t get a notification that the item was delayed   then for some reason the extra shipping i paid to have the treadmill delivered to another room in my house got removed from the order  when the delivery people came  they told me i didn t pay for extra shipping but i told them i did without knowing it had been cancelled  they were super rude about it  and i went back and looked after ward and saw that it was removed  i wasn t looking to get something for free  but that shouldn t have been an issue in the first place when i had already paid i have   stars not because of the product  but because the process with amazon wasn t very smooth      
545,5.0,                       the treadmill is heavy  and i needed the help of a friend to assemble it  took about   hours to assemble  and the instructions were pretty easy to follow  when properly assembled  it s very sturdy  because of its weight  i don t often move it  the little wheels might work on a harder surface  but we have it on an treadmill mat on carpet   so i placed it in a location where it can stay there for a long time  it folds easily  and storing it folded does save some space  overall  i am extremely satisfied  the tread surface is wide and it s long enough to jog or run comfortably  the speed and incline controls work smoothly  i tend to use my own headphones rather than connecting to the unit s speakers  and i rarely use the pre programmed workouts  so can t really comment on those  but they are there if you want them  the tread does make some noise when in use  but i would say it s relatively quiet  the time speed miles calories readouts seem to be accurate  the  pulse heart rate  readout jumps around a bit  but it still gives me a fairly accurate idea of my maximum heart rate  bottom line is  this treadmill suits me just fine  it s a gym quality piece of exercise equipment at an affordable price  i ve owned treadmills that cost   or   times what this one cost         usd   and i would rate this one as good as or better than the more expensive ones i ve owned   i m a    ish female ex athlete who is trying to get back into shape  and this treadmill suits my needs as well as those of my ultra fit housemate  would recommend it for beginners as well as seasoned treadmill users       
546,4.0,                       this review is just for purchasing off amazon  i have bought nordic track products before directly from them  it would always take weeks for delivery they would only do curbside unless you pay a bunch extra and when i had issues with my machines they would always get looked at by a technician and they would say nothing was wrong  so i haven t purchased any nordic track items in a few years  that being said  i felt safer purchasing from amazon and   day delivery hell yeah i gotta get some of this quarantine thick off lol  paid     for a treadmill with auto incline up to    miles per hour and the higher weight capacity also meaning it s more sturdy the price can t be beaten  amazons delivery was impeccable they had this delivered to my doorstep up   flights of stairs in less then    hours without a dent crack or anything assembly  i am a single woman so i assembled this alone found a video on youtube that was super helpful  but even listening to all the tips the heart monitor support bar gave me grief did not align properly  even tho i had not tightened the bottom legs and could freely move them  other than that it was pretty easy to do alone expect the safety bar drop system but i managed to get it done the machine  so after set up i did the ifit bypass which worked fine  the machine started right up i did here a very faint bang sound during rotation but while on the machine it s none existent and i don t know if it s just this motor very faint  the incline worked great right out of box  i have already done   hour workouts on this treadmill and it s been great sturdy the belt isn t slipping quiet i can hear my ipad and it s not even plugged into the console speakers yet  i am      and the belt width and length is great i don t feel like i am hitting the sides or going off the back or the front of my feet hitting the motor cover nothing  if you are gonna buy a nordic track i suggest doing it thru amazon i took off one star just because like everyone else i do think it s pretty sleazy to put a red piece of paper saying your machine is locked and cannot be used until you register for if it overall very happy with my purchase already feel better working out  i hope this machine last a few years      
547,5.0,                       this is the perfect treadmill  it is exactly what i was looking for  i haven t set up ifit  but so far it s very smooth and it works well  the speed and incline levels are great with many options  assembling it wasn t too difficult  but of course  it takes patience  i did have a hard time with the console  but customer service was able to video chat with me  they found the problem and a solution for it right away   i really love how it folds up easily and unfolds on its own  if you re thinking of buying it  just do it  you won t regret it      
548,5.0,                       i really like this treadmill a lot   i d done my research so my expectations were high  but when i got this assembled it was even nicer than i d anticipated   it looks great  closer to a gym treadmill than a personal treadmill  and is very comfortable to walk on for long stretches   and i would definitely recommend getting ifit along with it as i m really enjoying those workouts   the only minor complaint i have is assembly   i m not technically inclined so after taking a quick look at all the parts and the instructions  i quickly made an appointment with someone from task rabbit to come assemble this for me   however if you are technically inclined  assembly probably won t be a problem for you      
549,5.0,                       so far i m enjoying the treadmill  it s louder than i expected but with headphones or the tv on it s not noticeable for me  this is my first in home treadmill  i think the noise is probably the same as you d expect in a gym but they re generally noisy so it s probably just me i m      and when i try to hold the hand rail heart monitors my feet graze the front cover on the track when walking  not an issue for me because i plan to use a chest heart rate monitor i do love the large monitor tablet and the ease of selecting speed and incline i did need assistance assembling when it came to the raise lower mechanism  otherwise i assembled the rest by myself      
550,5.0,                       this treadmill model is not a luxury model  but it works very well for its purpose  as i am not a professional runner i personally did not want to spend more than      for a treadmill  but i wanted a reliable treadmill  so after spending hours comparing different brands  i  decided to buy this model as it was on sale with good reviews and honestly i love it the fact it has ifit made a difference  even though at the beginning i was quite reluctant to subscribe  after i tried it  i really enjoy it  so i enrolled      
551,4.0,                       great treadmill  love it  love the incline  love the fold up feature  and love how sturdy it feels  it s a treadmill so it s not whisper quiet but it doesn t sound like a giant motor running either so win hated putting it together  wrong screws  bent parts  and horrible diagrams to follow  assembly took     hours with another person  if we were not strong people  idk if we could gave gotten the display bar installed  it had to be forced we used another screw for the ground  it has worked perfectly  don t spend an hour trying to figure out how to make the screw they provide fit  it doesn t  we found a youtube video finally that addressed the missing screw issue one thing i don t like is that the belt slides too easily from left to right  it hasnt caused any problems yet  i just worry the side to side movement may wear it down faster      
552,5.0,                       terrific treadmill for this price point  is it a       gym treadmill  no  can you run on it at      mph  no  does it give a great walking or jogging workout   absolutely  don t want prerecorded people on a screen yelling at you to go faster and push through it  don t want to pay         a month for that privilege  just need    preset programs or none  up to     incline and    mph with a nice sturdy machine  then this is for you  like it s for me  assembly took a while by myself  pay careful attention to the   different size volts used to attach the arms  very quiet treadmill  oh and if you don t want to pay for ifit  just depress the ifit logo for    seconds or so after you turn on the on switch at the front bottom of the machine  lastly  only thing i d like is a little more treadmill space at the front as sometime my foot catches the plastic in the front  enjoy      
553,2.0,                       the treadmill is good and i like it  but customer support is a nightmare to deal with  i contacted them on june   th for support as my treadmill is starting to break down and the belt has started to rip  i have gotten replies for more information shortly after but nothing came of it  its july   th over a month later and i didn t get any more replies or any other information about fixing my machine either in short if it starts to break down like mine then that s it your on your own  the machine is under full warranty but they simply wont reply so what s the point of buying warranty if they will ignore you  they don t have a customer support phone number so your only way is by email  my warranty ends in august and my fear is they will wait till after my warranty end date to say its not under warranty anymore beware if you plan on having this for a long time or a heavy user  might be a better idea to go with another brand if warranty and customer support matter to you      
554,2.0,                       i bought this on prime day with professional installation and   year warranty delivery delivered on time  i live on  rd floor of an apartment and two guys dragged the shipment on stairs to deliver us  looking at it i was afraid it had any damage and it turned out to be okay assembly amazon asked for   date time slots for assembly and they chose my  nd preference  i got an email of the assembly time and contact details  he came on time and the assembly took    hr  out time   in time   he also trashed the box  he didn t show me how to skip ifit and make it up   running  he told me to call customer service and they could help  i am glad that i read comment on amazon and was able to skip ifit by pressing it for    seconds with red safety button on treadmill i have used it for   days now and i am not liking it much  it makes lot of noise  i never had knee pain before  i am only    lb and i walk   miles everyday in downtown to and from work and i had used lot of other treadmills in gym and i never had this problem  after using this  i was feeling uncomfortable from day    i was only walking at           miles hour and didn t run at all  i wasn t sure if this is a faulty one or problem with all  i use manual workout and i didn t find any pause button  touching other buttons accidentally also stops the workout  it is frustrating pros wide belteasy to foldnot so difficult to move for its sizegood   big consolecons loud noisebad for your knees no pausetouching other buttons might stop the workout finally  i am at a point that i would never want to rely solely on amazon reviews to buy anything as it looks like some of the reviews might be paid  i am very much disappointed with this  i am wondering how these kind of products are approved  i will try for another week and see if there will be any change and update it      
555,5.0,                       assembly        this was a pita to put together   it s the only piece of workout equipment that we ve had that truly required two people for assembly  and it took about two hours to finish assembly machine   amazing  i searched and searched for a treadmill  which during covid is nearly impossible to come by one that s in stock and costs less than   k  i finally found this one and was so impressed with the ifit screen set up  i want an effortless walking routine where i don t have to pay attention to time  incline  speed  etc  i just want the machine to do it for me  sort of like a natural walk  i m happy that a one year ifit membership came with this  and plan to continue that membership after the first year  i am also incredibly happy with the quick responses of the buttons  the clarity of the screen and sound  and the size  it s also pretty quiet for a treadmill      
556,5.0,                       so for me it arrived on time and they broung it to my apartment which was awesome the instructions were slightly hard but not too much  i put the whole thing together practically myself besides tightening the bolts or screws then my husband did that part it took a couple of days for me to put it together given kids and working as well but also i did not have a regular screw driver i had a drill and i did not have a wrench  even though the instructions told me i needed this i thought i could get by without it but no you cant  the alignment of things is what also became frustrating at times and wouldnt fit so i would have to take a break and come back to it  however all of the parts were there and did fit but it just wasnt as quickly as most have mentioned the treadmill itself is awesome i use it every other day  i m      and    lbs and my son uses it as well he is         lbs  i have used it all the way to a speed of   and an incline of    but mostly speeds of     with inclines varying and my son have tried at a    speed but not a high incline  so it endures and it is steady  it is not that loud i thought it would fold all the way up but it cant due to the dash board and the cup holders so i just put it up against the wall  however it does fold up and stays up overall awesome equipment     
557,2.0,                       the treadmill is not that great  i broke my treadmill by accidently hitting the stop button in the middle of a run  i then hit the speed button before the belt came to a complete stop and now my treadmill doesn t work  the belt doesn t run but the display s distance readout counts up  the worst part about this is the support for this machine  i tried calling the support number but gave up after being on hold for over an hour  then i tried to use email with support and that took up a week with no results  support asked for all of my details like name  address  phone  email  machine serial number and i thought we were getting somewhere so i replied within minutes of getting the email  two days goes by and then they ask for a video of the problem  no worries i sent them a      second video link   two days later they tell me the requirements of the video and i have to send it again with      resolution and no longer than   seconds long  i send the video again as per their requirements  the next day they email back asking for my name  address  phone number  machine serial number and so  i decided to try calling support again  on hold for    minutes  finally talk to somebody and they send me to a the non warranty department which is where i am currently stuck on hold while i write this review i m about to throw this treadmill out and buy one that doesn t use icon for their support the issue with the treadmill press start on the display and the belt jerks then stops  display says the belt is running and increments the distance display  i don t think the treadmill should have let me stop and start the treadmill the way that i did   the software should have protected the machine from the user  me       
558,1.0,                       wow   it s impossible for me to write a full review because i ve been trying to assemble this product for the past five hours   i m a reasonably smart guy   i have an advanced degree and i spent more then a decade turning wrenches as an enlisted soldier in the army so i thought this would be no problem to assemble   couldn t have been more wrong   this device has the worst assembly instructions i ve ever seen   absolutely incomprehensible diagrams   do not buy this if you plan on assembling it yourself      
559,4.0,                       my wife and i love this treadmill even after having to put it together ourselves  the instructions were easy to follow  just make sure you do not tighten the bolts where stated in the instructions or you ll have problems lining things up later  thanks to another reviewer we activated it without having to register with ifit and giving them our credit card info  just hold down the ifit button for    seconds then everything works took off one star due to the useless ahs assembly that was included in the purchase price  it took    days to get an appointment  then no call no show after waiting all day at home for them  i called ahs and after an apology was assured they would get back to us with an appointment date  after another    days with no appointment date  we put it together ourselves ahs states  handpicked pros  upfront prices  happiness guarantee  hmmm  how does this guarantee work  we re not happy anyways         we do really like this treadmill and all the features it has      
560,2.0,                       the product is fine but a part will break after a few months    then it is on back order for   plus weeks   i can not stress this enough this company does not care about existing customers  the customer service is nonexistent  also you will continue to pay for ifit while you wait for this part i asked if this sensor issue is common and the customer service person replied  yeah it happens all the time what       please do not buy this       dollar paperweight  get yourself a treadmill with an actual customer service team    please take my warning  i haven t been able to use this in   weeks and still haven t gotten an answer when this part will arrive do not buy         
561,4.0,                       ordered this to replace an old  dead treadmill  the first unit arrived damaged in shipping  the replacement process was easier than i expected  but the shipping companies  pilot and expo  seemed to not have any idea what they were doing  on the first  damaged  delivery by pilot  the delivery was late  and when i called she said it wasn t even on the truck  then  it showed up an hour later  on the replacement  expo was a bit better but showed up way early  and caused some trouble however  as far as the product  we really like it  a bit of a chore to assemble  as expected  but it went together with no fitment problems  it s very sturdily built  decent sound capabilities for a treadmill  we use an aux cord from the tv   buttons respond well when pressed  so speed incline changes are quick  two manual settings for flex  we use the softest  feels good  folds up easily for cleaning underneath  and releases with the press of a foot to float back down my only complaint is that when you  stop  to answer a phone call  hit the bathroom  etc   in the middle of a workout  the timer will reset to zero in about   minutes  so if you are meticulous about keeping track of workout times  you need to remember or make note of your time  i find this annoying an completely unnecessary  and  there is no way i can find to fix that  my last treadmill had an option in  settings  to allow you to pause indefinitely  except for that  i recommend this unit      
562,1.0,                       first off    assembly was such a nightmare  some of the screw placements are in so deep places that you will need a head torch to ensure they are going straight  some of the screws are in places where it s so difficult to tighten it  i can t believe engineers designed it so poorly  on the flip side  there were not too many parts to put together  once screw was broken so we ended up putting back a screw which was a throwaway one      let s talk performance   in lower speed  you always feel jerk  in higher speed  it moves so much  it says it has capacity of     lbs  but i guess it s actual weight capacity is only     lbs    i don t know if there s a way you can set weight to get actual calories burn  if there is  then i couldn t find it and it s not intuitive  again  if it s there      cheap material  i paid      for this and i don t even think it s half of it  even after tightening the screws  the handle is not firm      
563,1.0,                       the treadmill arrived bent and cut  the replacement was sent and that was electrically faulty  both were returned via their method xpo  with all pics proof receipts by the deadlines  amazon keeps trying to charge my card  which is in dispute now  despite having an email from them saying they received treadmills and won t bill it  advice  don t buy always keep all proof pics return receipts  their scam is that when they receive items back in their facility  they don t scan them in upon arrival  and then try to say you didn t send in time  and try to keep your money  i plan on holding them accountable for their fraud  so much wasted time on calls to them to address  with no credit to account as they promised  not to mention the amex points i used on some of this that they are trying to steal which           
564,5.0,                       first i am so so impressed with this treadmill  i love everything about it  it is quiet  easy on the joint  inclines nicely  and   year of ifit is a sweet deal the assembly was a bit hard and it takes about   hours for one person with the help of another for the steps that requires lifting and adjusting i had a delivery issue since i live in small city  so it took forever to get a delivery schedule and it was not flexible because the delivery company only comes once a week in our area and they had an issue the first time and  they left me waiting and they did not call or show up   it was disappointing but i was able to get hold of them next day and reschedule for a week later and this time they were on time  other than that the machine works great and i am very impressed with it so far  love ifit and it is worth every penny for me      
565,5.0,                       easy to assemble  but you may need two people   it s the quality you would expect from nordic track   one point on the ifit activation that was not mentioned   you must engage the key  turn on machine  hold the ifit logo down for    seconds and you can easily by pass registering for the ifit training program   you can always sign up later   we want to use it first to have a better understanding of our needs      
566,5.0,                       i usually run about       miles per week and needed a treadmill since going to a public gym isn t an option for me right now  assembly took a couple of hours but it has held up well during my runs  it bangs a little bit when i hit speeds   mph and i weigh less than    lbs so i can see where it might make noise if you run faster or are heavier than that  that being said  i don t have a mat underneath it and that might make a difference  overall  it s absolutely been worth the cost   also  you do not need to activate the trial to start it up  just hold the bluetooth button down until it starts       
567,5.0,                       love this treadmill  had some issues with the belt when i first used the treadmill but after a couple annoying phone calls they sent someone out   i will say they have a great video app so you can show them exactly what s going on instead of trying to explain it   belt is great now  very comfortable walk jog  decent incline  smeven with the belt issue i still give it   stars  the ifit is awesome  it came with a free year and it was very simple to set up  i read in another review it was difficult  but that is not my experience  they send a gift card with a promo code that you enter when setting it up  also read in a review the treadmill doesn t work without an ifit membership  this is not true  i feel this is a great treadmill for the price  i would definitely buy this treadmill again and will probably only buy nordictrack because of the ifit  it just changes the whole treadmill experience  love it        
568,5.0,                       bought this after comparing quite a few different models   it s got a few ato workouts programmed into it  and the part which i am enjoying most   no having to stop every hour   i usually walk   hours after work since i sit and drive all day  and was getting annoyed with the machines at the gym forcing you to cool down and stop every hour ifit bypass   held the blue ifit button for around    seconds  and it unlocks to use   no submitting the credit card to sign up for anything treadmill was easy enough to set up  only had to borrow a second set of hands for assembling the folding mechanism  and the control panel the control panel has   item bins with flat bases which can hold a decent sized water bottle  amongst other things   there is also a ledge for a cellphone or mp  player to be placed for music   ledge can also hold an e reader too since i saw that bit on the questions asked noise level is pretty equivalent to one at the gym  so it s not excessive and shouldn t bother anyone around      
569,4.0,                       this was easy to assemble and it is easy to fold as well  i like that this has pre set programs to use however it is annoying that if you don t purchase the optional package that comes with it you won t have access to everything and it is not cheap to buy the extra package as it is a monthly fee  it will also ask you every time you try to use it to buy the extra package so that s kinda annoying  the updates are long and serve me no use as i don t plan to buy that package as stated  i am also not a fan of the scenery it offers as i was under the impression it would be better quality than what it is  the buttons are easy to use and you can change the speed and incline easily if i could go back and purchase it again i probably would have bought a cheaper version as the functions i was excited for are what costs extra  sometimes spending more isn t the smarter route but if you intend to buy the extra monthly fee to use it then you will love it     
570,5.0,                       i am lucky to have a husband who is very handy and savvy about putting things together   in reviews we read  someone mentioned putting the treadmill together in half an hour   i would say that was pretty optimistic   we spent the better part of the day on assembly once the nordic track was working  it was squeaking very loudly   we contacted the service number and received timely help from a representative   within a few days we had received a replacement roller and silicon lubricant   the annoying squeaking has all but disappeared i use the the treadmill for a walking program and it is perfect for the days when outside weather is inclement  all winter in idaho    no excuses for not keeping on track   i enjoy being able to raise the incline to increase the benefit of the walk   i use the nordic track for an hour and twenty minutes every day to accomplish four miles of walking as a supplement to the nordic track  i joined prime unlimited music and have dowloaded my favorites into an awesome workout playlist   i am very pleased with amazon prime unlimited and recommend it highly i am also very pleased that i can lift the treadmill into the storage position to open up the space where it sits   for anyone like me who has to deal with weather problems that keep you indoors  i highly recommend the nordic track treadmill      
571,1.0,                       okay  here s the deal  we re in a global pandemic  our y opens and shuts according to whatever the county says is prudent at any given moment  my wife decides she wants a treadmill  i order this thing  i assemble the thing  i register the thing  i don t give my credit card info  i still can t use the thing there is no reason whatsoever that we should be hamstrung by the fact that we can t just plug this stupid thing in and use it  instead  i m forced to register  okay  fair enough   asked to shell out     month for some bozo to coach me  i know how to walk  thank you very much   and after all is said and done  the thing doesn t work here s the deal  when i shell out this much money for anything  there s no reason for me to have to think about using it  other than to plug it in  press the program i want  and proceed to use the product  i don t want to think  i just want to use the thing  but now  instead of working out  i m typing this review  because  i m not able to just turn the thing on and use it i m sure this will be  resolved  within a day or so  and my wife will be happily strolling along but there shouldn t be an issue like this in the first place  i buy an apple computer  and it works out of the box buy a nordictrack  and you have to jump through hoops  completely unacceptable nordictrack  you ve gained and lost a customer in one fell swoop      
572,5.0,                       solid quality treadmill at a reasonable price  setup was easy  no harder than assembling a tricky piece of ikea furniture  having two people helps   it s been easy to use  has a variety of speeds  speakers aren t bad  heart rate monitor seems accurate  and has overall been a quality treadmill that has been a lifesaver right now      
573,3.0,                       i m          lbs  i bought the nordictrack t     s treadmill  it says it has a     pound user capacity  so i m pushing the upper end  i tried walking at   miles per hour and it didn t feel great  belt had a little stutter  as i went up to  mph it was smoother  i didn t go above  mph with me on the belt yet  i felt okay walking at  mph  slightly fast walk for me   good enough  for sure  i was surprised by how fast the belt stopped when i pressed  stop   like  it immediately stopped the overall feel of the base is fine  but the console is a bit wobbly  just a bit   i suspect it feels more sturdy for anyone under    lbs  i got the   inch screen and the display is super rudimentary  like     s sci fi rudimentary i followed the ifit workaround and just held the ifit button for about    seconds and it started  you do not need to activate the ifit membership fyi  i had it professionally assembled  note  i first scheduled through amazon  those guys never showed  left garbled messages from different phone numbers  super sketchy  so i cancelled and chose a local handyman service   assembly took almost exactly one hour noise  i used a sound meter app on my phone to record noise level  without me standing on it  phone at hand rail height    mph     dbs   mph     dbs   mph     dbs  it was never that loud  in my opinion  for context  my microwave was   dbs and my blender on ice crush mode was   dbs      
574,2.0,                       we really wanted to love this treadmill  it is small enough to fit in many areas  it looks like it will withstand for quite some time and it isn t too noisy when it works properly  however  it started to make a weird sound when we started to use it inclined on the first level and the sound gets worse when you put it down to ground level  also  the motor hood came broken  we contacted the company several times and received an email asking us about the exact part of the machine that was broken  we replied   times and no answer  as you can see in the picture  very bad customer service and we even bought the extended warranty for it  really wanted to love this machine since it was affordable and we believed nordictrack was an amazing company    this is our honest review and hopefully the company listen more to its customers      
575,1.0,                       do not buy this item  terrible treadmill  the heart monitor does not work  when i called customer service  they said the heart monitors are never accurate  mine is off by         i said if it was off     i can live with it  the rep told me they are not even that accurate  if the heart monitor does not function well  why does nordictract  advertise the unit having heart monitor  everytime i have called nordictract customer service  i am on hold for at least    minutes  finally they said they will send me a new heart monitor grip  when the package arrived  it was the handle but not the heart monitor grip  i am        and when i incline the treadmill     my hands will not reach the hand grip unless i bend down  not a proper posture for walking  i suggest buying another brand besides nordictract      
576,4.0,                       been using the this treadmill for about a month and do enjoy it   we have had no issues with it so far   still trying to use the track  dampeners  to make your step softer when you step down  but to me it feels about the same when they are in use and not in use   gave it four out of five stars due to the display seeming a bit out of date  big blue screen with big square dots for the characters    also  the grab handles seem a bit short for us   you have to stand a bit close to the front of the machine in order to utilize these handles   if you wish to stand back a bit  so you do not step off the tread and onto the front cover on the machine   the grab handles are a bit in front of you assembly was not a problem for me   it does take about an hour or so to complete and there are a few steps to go through   there are a couple steps where you will need two people for the price  the above  issues  are minor and would not hesitate to purchase this treadmill      
577,2.0,                         edit  so i would like to update the product to a   star  and that is due to the wonderful support that i received from the chat support and will receive a new upright at part of the    day warranty within     days   i will update further once i can actually use the device   well  i want to be excited about working out  and would like to make this treadmill not become the dreaded close hanging device  but it looks like i am well on my way to that day    putting the item together and i get to the grounding screw hole  not large enough for the screw they want you to use  but you know what  who cares i will use the original screw they said to replace   couple steps later and it has me try to screw the hand rails to the uprights   the left side worked  but the holes on the right side were not large enough for the bolts to screw in  so here i am  with a treadmill that cannot even be screwed together   day    what do you know  still no treadmill because i cannot make the hole larger           
578,4.0,                       you can lose about    lbs just assembling this  machine  it s no easy tasks but well worth it once it s done  the advertising of faraway places you see where the pretty blonde is running on the beach or through cobblestone flower lined streets is bunk  so far the only areas on the workouts are  rd world slums     if you want to see some of the poorest populations on the globe while you run then this has the app for you  as for me it s depressing  there is also a gimmick to sell you a fitness coach for either     monthly or about      annually  the treadmill itself works fine but you ll be extremely disappointed in the app that takes you to exotic places as you run  take your own  tablet and tune into some good music and cover the nordic track screen      
579,5.0,                       absolutely love  only gave it   stars because assembly was a bit difficult but with patience doable  so don t let that scare you  the size isn t huge so it fits well in my space and folds and unfolds very easily   the wheels also make it easier to move to another location to hide away  it s very smooth to walk on and cushioned for less stress on the knees  i prefer to watch tv during my work out so i dont use the ifit  to get your treadmill going you don t need to subscribe   hold the little blue ifit square for a few seconds   you ll hear it beep and your display will light up  this way you can by pass signing up for ifit  i did register my treadmill      
580,4.0,                       i would have given this treadmill   stars except the install process was highly frustrating  i am fairly handy so i figured i d do the install myself  it s certainly easy to do  except for the fact that one little screw that probably cost about     th of a penny arrived broken  unfortunately it was an essential screw  connected to a ground wire  so i couldn t go without  i looked it up online and it sounds like a fairly common issue  i had to hunt thru my assorted box of loose screws to find something that would fit   there were other areas of the install where the pre drilled screw holes weren t big enough and i had to get my drill to loosen up the holes a bit and power the screws in  trying to do by hand would be next to impossible   despite these annoyances  i was able to setup the treadmill by myself in about     hours the treadmill itself is high quality  it s sturdy  the belt is quiet ish  and when in use  it feels comparable to a commercial gym caliber treadmill   i was also pleasantly surprised how easy the lift storage feature operated  i was expecting it to be really heavy and cumbersome to lift the base deck up for storage  but with the pneumatic lift arm  it s surprisingly light the whole ifit thing is misleading and annoying  the trick to hold down the ifit button for    sec didn t work at first for me  i had to power off the treadmill and try it again for it to work aside from all that  it s a good sturdy treadmill for an affordable price      
581,4.0,                       what a pain to put together  took   hours with two people to get the thing assembled  some holes were the size of pinholes which required light drilling to open just enough for the corresponding screws  however it s a great treadmill  just hold the ifit button for   s and you can bypass all that junk and get to the good stuff  and by good stuff i mean running  or i m my case  walking for a couple hours while playing dungeons and dragons over my tablet i can conveniently set on the treadmill and plug in via aux for some surround sound   happy it s finally here      
582,1.0,                       i bought this treadmill at the end of september and it arrived in early october  after almost exactly   months the screen console does not work  seriously      days in and it doesn t work at all  of course if the console doesn t work that means the treadmill doesn t move so i can t even manually use it all in all this has been a very painful purchase that i regret  after some issues with the amazon  rd party delivery and installation it has worked as expected until last night  after having not used the treadmill for the past week and a half  it was sunny out so i went outside instead  the console does not work  after trying to re set it per the instructions in the manual it did nothing  after googling other suggestions on how to re set the console failed i called customer service  they were very nice but oddly enough she immediately said she was submitting for a new console and would expedite shipping  of course shipping is delayed due to covid so the piece won t be here for two weeks and then i have to schedule the technician  so for a brand new   k treadmill the technology broke after    days  this now requires a month of downtime  during winter months which was the main reason for the purchase      minutes with customer service and then the actual technician appointment i am very disappointed given i had a nordic track for    years before this and never had a single issue  i regret not spending more and going with pelton      
583,1.0,                       there is nothing wrong with the equipment  it works well so far but i made the mistake of buying a   year service plan   don t do that  when i registered the treadmill with nordictrac i couldn t find the way on their website to associate the service plan with the treadmill i registered  so i wrote a customer service request to please help take care of that  the service representative who responded didn t even read my request  just sent a template mail requesting that i make a video of the problem with the equipment  i responded that there is no problem  just update the database please  i got back another email from him demanding a video of the problem  they don t even read what you write them  just send back template responses wasting their customers  time  i can t imagine how bad it d be to deal with them if i had an actual problem        
584,5.0,                       so  we were looking at treadmills and various other exercise equipment options to get us back on track to getting into shape  given the non stop nature of our jobs right now  going to the gym really isn t an option  it was decided to give a treadmill a shot  it is the perfect addition to the home gym i put together  assembly wasn t to difficult  and i was able to do most of it myself  i would suggest not fully tightening the uprights until after you get the arms and the screen on and adjusted properly  it needs that little bit of flex  also  unlike all of the warning labels you do not need an ifit membership  all you have to do is put the emergency stop key in  turn it on  and press and hold the ifit button on the screen for up to    seconds  it will beep and the screen will come up and you are ready to go  the incline is awesome  and the speed controls are right there  right now we are averaging    minutes each a day  and it is a joy to use      
585,4.0,                       a handy person with good tools assembled it for me   he worked non stop for three hours following the directions and not wasting any time   i couldn t have done it   too complicated and required too much physical strength   it had three red signs that said  stop call if you are having problems rather than to send it back   once assembled  it requires connecting to the internet to unlock it   that makes no sense   on the positive side  it functions well and is a good size for a home treadmill and while not quiet  it was quieter operating than other home treadmills i have used      
586,1.0,                       threads are the wrong type for the bolts  i m seeing metal shavings from them when i tighten the bolts  haven t had a chance to actually use the machine yet disappointed in this poor quality i bought a name brand to avoid this cheap chinese made crap  but i feel like i d have been better off buying the cheap chinese made crap  at least it wouldn t have costed as much      
587,2.0,                       taking it to   stars because the company emails the buyers and tries to  bribe  them to write a good review with promises of free floor mats of maintenance kits overall  i like this treadmill a lot it s very sturdy  seems like it will take a beating and keep on ticking packaging was very good  no way was it being damaged in transit  worked first time out of the box  there was no pressure to buy an extended fitness program membership which i liked changes speed and incline very quickly when i need it to  and good selection of preset programs couple of minor issue    not sure calorie count is correct  seems to be higher  maybe the health app i use on phone when walking outside is lower  not sure who to blame but not a big deal    it is very heavy  so make sure the room you assemble it in is the room in which you want it to stay   also  you will need   people to put it together      
588,4.0,                       i tried to wait at least    days before reviewing this but i didnt want to forget so here goes  i strongly suggest getting the workout mat for exercise equipment whether you have carpet or not  or at lease put those foam sliders on the bottom to protect your floor  assembling this thing wasnt hard but i dont recommend anyone try to do it alone  also  most electronic equipment recommends that power tools not be used  if you want the machine assembly to be tight  use the power tools but with caution bc that lil tool they include will start to hurt your hand after a while  once its assembled things run pretty smoothly  the fold up is a great feature  works well  the ifit membership is hit and miss  if you already have workout goals  its not necessary to sign up for it  its just nice to have something on the screen      
589,1.0,                       this unit came with a half dozen bonus screws that you re supposed to remove and throw away  that s odd  but not a deal breaker  or it wasn t until i found that   of them were in there so tightly that i couldn t remove them  i can t budge them by hand  with an electric screwdriver  or with a cordless drill  wd    makes no difference the bonus screws are all in critically important connections  so the unit can t be assembled without removing all of them  so if even one is stuck like three of mine are  the unit is useless  i wouldn t gamble with this treadmill      
590,5.0,                       living in midwest means at least   months snow and icy road  this is a very basic treadmill  which i m looking for  i don t want pay a lot more for added big touch screen and etc  my basic economy is that i can do workout  if i want fancy feature  i can just pay separately to buy a tablet  as a matter of fact  you can control this piece of equipment through ifit some part of installation do need two persons  the instruction is reasonably accurate  one suggestion is that  don t tight all nuts until you assemble the screen and so on  or you may need to redo it the speed is quite accurate when i compare to my garmin folding is very smooth  though i don t really need it  for those living in small apartments  it could be a nice feature one suggestion is that you may need to pay additional     let amazon guys to put it where you want in your house  the box is about    long  over    lb      
591,5.0,                       best dust collector and clothes holder i ve ever seen  dust and clothes are literally attracted to it like a moth to a flame  i bought  it for my wife who claimed she d use it all the time  i knew better but still bought it  it has been used exactly   times in   months   it does seem durable if it ever were to be used      
592,5.0,                       delivery was scheduled prior because it s such a big and heavy delivery  amazon driver delivered it to our garage  assembly was the hardest part  we are not a handy household   lol  we tried at first by watching youtube videos and following directions  we quit after   hours  we ended up using a handy man app  and paid someone to do it  that was the best      i ever spent lol  treadmill runs great  bypassed the fit by holding down the ifit button for    secs   as described in other amazon reviews  so far we re satisfied   hopefully i ll lose some of this quarantine weight lol     
593,3.0,                       like the treadmill so far  the super easy lowering and folding are great  however  although i was aware i would need an ifit subscription to use the ifit feature  i was surprised and disappointed that the ifit feature also requires an ifit module  which is sold separately for an additional       i definitely recommend the amazon assembly  the guy that came out was quick  personable and knowledgeable as he had assembled several before      
594,5.0,                       took about    mins to set up and was easy   it does have the blue ifit button   just push down in the button for    seconds or so and you can use it without registering   it feels solid and well made   it s not quiet and not noisy   sounds like a treadmill should i guess   the speakers are not very useful   can barely hear music when maxed out but i didn t plan on using them anyways   belt adjustment is easy   folds up with little effort and easy to move around   overall i m very pleased with my purchase      
595,2.0,                       i have been doing the same workout for over    years on many different machines at different gyms  etc   so i have a pretty good idea of treadmill speed   my new t     s felt like it was going too fast and i was having a hard time keeping up   most nordictracks had an  advanced calibration  mode to determine speed calibration  but no longer with the new models   so i determined how many rotations per minute a properly calibrated machine would have at   and    mph        rotations at  mph  and       rotations at   mph    sure enough my brand new t     s was running more than     mph faster than the readout   it s possible to adjust the belt speed  search youtube   so it s fixed now   but otherwise i m not impressed with the apparent lack of qc out of the factory  or elimination of the advanced calibration mode    a proper belt speed is important   otherwise  decent machine      
596,5.0,                       it s actually very nice product and the ifit is totally worth the money our first order got lost and it was such a nightmare to track  at the end we cancelled the order and bought a new one that came the next day needs two people to assemble we will update the review after using the machine for some time but so far we just tried it and it was a wonderful experience      
597,2.0,                       the treadmill looks nice  feels solid  as much of the support is constructed of steel  however  it seems like they just disassembled one and wrote up a partially complete assembly guide  and decided that was adequate for the average consumer to put this thing together   it s not   the parts aren t always consistently labeled in the text and diagrams  some of the bolts are extremely difficult to attach unless you lift each side of treadmill  and other screws need to be removed in order for some bolts to go in  but that s not mentioned until two steps later   when you should already have put those bolts in  and even though the assembly process doesn t mention adding the safety key to the console  it won t work unless that key is in place   the single most frustrating experience i ve had in the past year       
598,5.0,                       we reviewed features prices   and decided to go with this model as a solid model from a known brand   we didn t care about a large screen   basically just wanted it to  go  and provide some basic incline   this model does that well this unit is heavy    plan to have a delivery service take it upstairs  if that s your plan    assembly is not terribly difficult  depending on how handy you are   took us about   hours with a proper tool set if you are not handy  i would pay for delivery and assembly unit is surprisingly large  a good thing  and very sturdy nordictrack s  activation  is ridiculously complex   instructions are not good   you have to activate through  ifit    but we are not planning to use ifit   you have to connect to a mobile device to  activate  the treadmill  which is probably just a ploy to get you enrolled in ifit  even if you don t plan to use it  after  activating   which the instructions don t adequately explain   your mobile device is connected  via bluetooth  and the treadmill won t work independently until you disconnect from your mobile device once we figured that out  which was very frustrating for about an hour or so   the treadmill works perfectly as a basic  on off  faster slower  increase grade decrease grade treadmill      
599,4.0,                       i ordered this treadmill because of the weight capacity  don t judge  you re looking at treadmills too  and name brand for the price   originally i was worried that we would be locked into an ifit membership but holding down the ifit button for    seconds unlocked it and we ve been able to use it with no issues  this wouldn t be my first choice for an ifit treadmill unless you re planning to use your own screen anyway  the assembly wasn t bad  i feared it would be worse based on other reviews i ve read  all of the parts feel substantial and it certainly weighs enough that it shouldn t fall apart easily  my wife has used it several times and i tried it last night for the first time  although it would benefit from a fan  i found a pedestal fan for     that works well enough  it s fine for home use      
600,5.0,                       my wife and i purchased the nordictrack t series treadmill to get a little exercise at home given the covid pandemic  the delivery through amazon worked great  i set up a time and two delivery guys dropped off the package  assembly took a little longer than expected  about    minutes  but i will note that i have never assembled one before so i had nothing to really base my expectations on  i am now at the   month mark of using the treadmill  the speed and incline functions have worked well  the unit is also pretty quiet which is nice since me and my wife are both working at home  there is nothing more that i really need in a treadmill  i would purchase again      
601,5.0,                       product was really easy to put together   instructions call for   people to put together but it is doable with just   person  but much more difficult and time consuming especially attaching the console and the drop bar underneath  it is also very heavy all together   once it is all assembled   you do need to activate it online at ifit com and create an account before you can start using it  however  unlike some other reviews i ve read  you do not have to provide a credit card in order to use it  it does have a spot to enter your credit card as you are setting up the account but right next to  credit card  it specifically says that entering that is optional  i simply skipped that part and finished registering without it  once my account was created   i was able to sync my treadmill with the app via bluetooth and was then able to start using it  as some reviewers have commented   the belt is slightly noisy as you walk on it  however   i wear headphones on the treadmill so that is not an issue for me at all  i also only walk on the treadmill  not run  so it may be more less noisy at higher speeds       
602,5.0,                       i have had this treadmill for two years and i adore it   i assembled it myself   fold it and roll it away with ease and enjoy all the ifit features   i highly recommend it   the negative reviews that i have seen seem to be about the person who came to assemble the unit for people  and customer service   i personally cannot relate i also have had   back surgeries    foot  one knee  three hand   so working out and staying fit is important to me and this treadmill has been a great option for me   i have to be careful about high impact workouts but the suspension of this treadmill has been great as long as i build up my workouts and listen to my body i really enjoy it and the ifit features oh   and there is an emergency stop feature for those who are worried about a few negative reviews   so if you follow all the user suggestions you ll be safe and sound      
603,5.0,                       it s a great machine and the ensemble was fairly easy  the only process i found unlikable was the ifit that s incorporated with it  before you can use the treadmill they try to get you to subscribe to ifit  it is not needed  seems like a little trickery on nordictrack and ifit      
604,4.0,                       i just got this treadmill and love it already  this treadmill is pretty solid  i was worried that it might be wobbly but it felt totally balanced  it folds up nicely too  it s definitely not commercial grade but it s the next best thing  especially for the price  it took my husband and a friend about    minutes to put it together amazon does not make it easy to activate your free   year membership and still have not gotten that figured out yet  also  you do not need to get ifit to activate  just hold the ifit bluetooth button for about    seconds and that unlocks your tread      
605,3.0,                       the cons are  the frame is poorly made  a bolt on each side of the arms did not thread at all  luckily there is   bolts and   of them hold well on each side  not impressed about parts not threading  also  they place screws into parts that need to be removed before putting it together  this was an issue as one of the screws was so locked inside that even a power tool wouldnt remove it  i had to use wd   along with different pliers to remove it  took   hours to put together start to finish the pros  it works really well  i had no issue with the motor  no skips  and i ran for an hour straight  i read reviews prior to purchasing  and i was able to avoid the ifit sign up nonsense by holding the ifit button for a few seconds in order to turn on the machine   i will say though  they had about   warning labels to sign up or you cant turn it on  however i ignored them all and held the button to avoid it and had no issue  the motor worked great  the elevation worked perfect as well as speeding up and slowing down  as long as the arms hold  i dont care that   bolt isnt seating correctly  however it s pretty sad that this expensive machine isnt built correctly  pretty sad coming from a name brand like nortic  so i wont be giving a great review  not impressed      
606,4.0,                       we got our treadmill and prior to purchasing it were skeptical about the     length of t   si   i can tell you that it is not an issue at all  i am       and don t ever feel like i will go off the back edge while running or walking  the treadmill is very sturdy  comfortable to run on  and we love the ifit  it makes a treadmill fun and keeps workouts fresh each and every time that we get on it for a run or a trail hike  the ifit trainers on screen are informative and offer tips while the workout plays on screen we really enjoy the treadmill automatically making incline and speed changes to match the on screen workout  as you go along  this treadmill makes the old  boring  mundane workouts fun as time passes quickly with the interactive on screen trainer guiding you through the workouts i did a lot of research  and if you want a solid treadmill with some nice technology features you can t go wrong with this one  it doesn t have a     peloton screen  but in my opinion the     screen is plenty big for what you need to follow along with the trainers      
607,1.0,                       do not buy this   it took four hours to build and the belt was off center from day one  tried to adjust it and the holes for the allen wrench don t line up with opening  i suspect this is part of the problem   not happy about feeling like i am running on ice with a new treadmill and then it won t fix itself  following the directions both in the manual and on numerous websites      
608,3.0,                       the treadmill itself is okay now that its assembled    it isn t too noisy  the bottom feels solid  and i like the fan in the front  that said  it was super confusing and frustrating to assemble    and i usually like assembling things  to be specific  the box treadmill itself is very heavy and the screws flimsy plastic pieces are hard to align  the instructions say not to use power tools but there were some screws we just couldn t turn without them  we finally forced it together after    hours if you do purchase this  make sure you have a big space to assemble  at least two people  and a ton of patience      
609,5.0,                       i been thinking about purchasing a treadmill for a longtime   finally i decided to get one now cause the coronavirus  we have to stay at home all day  it take us  two people  about two hours to set up during the time four screws can not match the holes so we have to use electric drill to make one   last thing to activate the treadmill the website ask your credit card  name  billing information then tell you how to activate i don t suggest you do so cause they gonna charge the fee from your credit card very month until you cancel the ifit service  just hold the blue ifit button for    seconds then you can use your treadmill      
610,2.0,                       i was very excited for this product  i can t rate the ease of assembly since i used the amazon service  the package arrived fine but when i was watching the guy put it together some of the parts appeared to already have been used  i m wondering if i received one that someone sent back  the quality of the parts are the same of a treadmill half the price  i bought one in college for      and the only upgrade from that one to this one is the screen  it does that job but isn t worth the mark up      
611,1.0,                       it was great the first   months  the last month the belt slowly began scooting to one side making a weird noise  the belt is now running on the side plastic on top of the treadmill and under the treadmill it is on top of the bar that is supposed to hold it in place  disappointed  at this point i m afraid to keep using it  not sure how safe it is with the belt rubbing on the machine side      
612,5.0,                       i did research many treadmills and ended up purchasing this one among others here are reasons   width and length are wider and longer than others  within my budget   auto incline feature  i did not want any fitness subscription service  foldable treadmill  at least speed up to    and more and more incline feature than other treadmillsi am an avid runner and run outside most of the time  living in seattle area  during winter season  it is hard to run outside during rainy days  so i decided to purchase a treadmill  some people commented this treadmill is for entry level or mid level runners or walkers  it really depends on what people need i normally set the speed for   or    and incline level from   to     alternate  during my running for    mins to an hour  that is more than good enough exercise for me  this treadmill responses quickly when i want to incline and speed up  number blinks until the desire set incline level or   and speed level is met which is a nice feature to let me know ifit  i got the help from many people s comment  pushing ifit button for    second to bypass  one thing  i ve noticed is the inaccurate number for calories that i burn during running or walking  it is quite off from my smart watch  probably  it is a mix of unable to factor into my weight  height and age plus more also some people mentioned about the treadmill s noise level  i don t think it is noisy putting this treadmill into a room or even in a garage  yes it does make some noise comparing to treadmills in a spacious healthclub  it is rather a room size making sound louder in my opinon  my health club treadmills might be equally noisier if you put one in a small room  knowing health culb treadmills are being used many hours per day and nearly   days a week  assembling this treadmill will take a while  about   to   hours depending on your skill   it is a heavy equipment here are tips unless you place the treadmill box on the exact spot where you want to work out  even then you will have to take it out and assemble   you will have to move it after taking it out from the box and assembling it assembling a folding up rod first will help you because now you can fold up the treadmill and moving the treadmill with pre attached two rollers on the bottom of the frame  i was able to roll the treadmill to the location where i want it to be without lifting it up   this method does not work if your treadmill is deliver to one area and you will have to move it to a different floor i purchased a cheap bluetooth receiver  which connected to my treadmills aux   now my treadmill is a bluetooth enabled device  listening sound from the treadmill s speakers is better than from my phone one thing that i commonly saw from the reviews  not limited to amazon   there might be some broken pieces during shipping and handling  or even during packing   mine also came with a broken cup holder screw housing which i had to modify  it was so minor and i did not want to call either amazon or nordictrack  in short  this treadmill is for anyone unless you compete for professional level of running  noise level is similar to my health club commercial ones  and assembly is not hard but time consuming with a well written instruction      
613,3.0,                       nice treadmill my first  i was able to put it together mostly  i could not install the spring loaded stop under the treadmill which is needed to fold it up  the reason being the treadmill is too heavy for me to lift up and install that part build quality is a meh  there are frayed cables under the treadmill which is worrisome  but i have not had any issues so far  i will update this as i have more input  but this is something i will use pretty much only during the winter months here in new england and oh  ifit app i don t care about and it is quite annoying to go through that step      
614,5.0,                       we ordered this treadmill at the beginning of the covid shut down and i m so glad we did  assembly took the better part of an afternoon  though it was not difficult  we followed the steps carefully and found the instructions easy to follow after several months of near daily use by myself and my husband  who is      it shows no signs on wear and still performs like new  it is smooth and doesn t jerk like some other treadmills  folding the running platform up and down is super easy  too the only thing to note  and this isn t really a bad thing  is that once you pair your phone with it  it automatically pairs when the machine turns on  this is obviously a great feature for convenience  however  if two people are going to use it  be aware that if the other person s phone is paired and the paired phone is out of range  it will beep loudly until it is unpaired  now when my husband wants to use it  i have to unpair my phone  it s not a big deal at all  just something to be aware of      
615,4.0,                       this treadmill does everything you want  sturdy  fairly quiet  good size  runs smooth  fun to assemble  arrived on time  all great when you turn it on  however  it wants you to  activate  and subscribe  to some jokers at ifit com  ummm  no  in fact hells to the no  if it had actually made me subscribe just to make it run  i would have returned it  but  some clever person on a review found out that if you just hold the ifit button for    seconds on the consol  it skips over the activation nonsense   if the app schmozzle from iowa teaches us anything it is that machines and systems do not need to be connected to apps to work or work better  take a lesson out of commander adama and dont network devices  be they voting apps of even treadmills      
616,2.0,                       the treadmill itself is mediocre at best  but for the price what can one expect  even with that being said i would have given the treadmill a   star alone  but  if you have to deal with nordictrack customer service for any reason    you will wait on hold forever   be transferred from one person to another   only to think your question was answered and find out it was not and have to repeat the process over and over again for nearly a month     worst experience ever      
617,3.0,                       first i got this product a year back    i was working using very very lite few days in week max for    min  with minimum use    i have used it in     times in an year    it broke down   turn on and off automatically issues i have   the tech guy came   paid         dont have clue whats wrong with device  he recommend almost all the main parts except motor    parts costs me        additional     for tech revisit costs    close to             already paid    on top  i cannot get additional warranty to buy    once buy parts  not sure my system works or not   or how long it will work as such system is ok till   year   if broken down  not worth repair    am very upset and angry on this support   system       
618,3.0,                       i bought this nordic track model  i spent       with takes on it  the specifications says it would support someone weighing     lbs  i weight     lbs and in the first year of use the treadmill broke i bought amazon extended warranty for this  i called nordic track service department a week ago  i called again today to find out the status of the repair order and they said the walking board is not in stock   they said it may take another   or   weeks for them to receive it i am frustrated with the treadmill         
619,4.0,                       it took me about   hours to take the treadmill out of the shipping carton  read the assembly  instructions  and put it together   it requires a   mm socket wrench  an   mm box wrench  a number   phillips screwdriver  and an included hex wrench   the provided hex wrench was inadequate given the number of bolts requiring it then once it was together  one of the wiring connectors hadn t seated properly and the inclination controls didn t work   after speaking with their customer service department  i disassembled the control panel again  reseated all of the wiring connectors  and then everything worked properly if i were to repeat this  i would make certain i had a hex head socket so that i could use a ratchet to install the bolts   just that simple tool might have saved one hour once it was assembled and working it proved to be a very nice product   we use it daily  it is quiet and works well in our home      
620,5.0,                       i did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before purchasing this treadmill and i was not disappointed  i love it  i love that there are programs to choose from  as i m not motivated to push myself on my own  and the automatic incline is very smooth  the option to use ifit is nice too  although i personally don t use it  the buttons are very simple and straightforward  i do wish that it had a speaker to play my music through  but overall i m happy  the running track is very large and it feels smooth when in use  the display is a little simplistic  but  again  the track and the programs were more what i was looking for and i m very happy with them  and the warranty is great too  would definitely recommend      
621,3.0,                       ok  well    my wife took like     hours to put together and it was driving us crazy  that s mainly because the manual doesn t mention anything about the use of tools  and  the installation video we saw on youtube recommended hand tightening the screws  do not attempt this  having a socket wrench or power tools will make the installation much easier some people mentioned something about not being able to log on without activating the ifit free trial  that is true  it is not true that if you hold down the ifit button for    seconds that it will bypass this  it asks for a cc for autobilling afterwards  but that s optional the treadmill seems to be working fine  it has a wide belt and feels sturdy  doesn t shake at all  i had to request a replacement part for the rod that lets you fold up the treadmill  it s been a bit of a nightmare putting this thing together in entirety  but hopefully it s worth it  because it feels like a good quality machine otherwise      
622,5.0,                       keeping in mind that this is not a  pro  level or gym caliber model  this unit has no trouble keeping up in terms of speed   incline motor has some difficulty keeping up with some of the workout programs and requires some manual re setting to work   the quality of the programming on ifit is superb  and it comes as a great surprise given the affordability   the training is top notch and covers all types of fitness  combining weight training with treadmill exercises and an excellent logging system   live workouts are excellent and allow interaction with the trainers   the programming is so effective you will find yourself staying on the treadmill for double or triple the time you would normally exercise   unlike trendy workouts and fitness trends in the  insanity  or the  crossfit  mindset  trainers push you hard but also utlize ample rest and recovery techniques   this results in greater long term improvement and prevents injury      
623,5.0,                       received this today and i love it      it took me and my husband about an hour and a half to put it together   i tried using the bilt app it suggests however  i understood the printed instructions easier   i did receive the   year ifit   a gift card came with the machine   i used it tonight and the ifit is awesome   the machine is not too loud  it is smooth to use and  the incline is smooth   i would highly recommend this treadmill      
624,5.0,                       i ve had my treadmill since the end of march without any issues   it was a covid quarantine purchase and i use it almost daily   assembly was not difficult  but i did require my wife s assistance at the end to install the rods so the treadmill can fold up   i ended up purchasing another nt studio cycle that came with a year of ifit  so i use my treadmill with the ifit program too   the t     s does not have a built in tablet  so i connect my ipad via bluetooth and screen mirror to a tv   although  i did not think i would enjoy the automated  resistance and speed changes with the ifit programming  i have found those features enhance my workouts   the treadmill is very responsive to the automated changes   the treadmill is quiet and folds easily for space saving capabilities as well   the incline       and speed    mph  are adequate for me  but i know my wife would prefer a higher incline for the ifit hiking programs   overall  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  and will likely purchase more equipment from nt in the future      
625,2.0,                       android os is slow and laggy  often freezes up during workout  treadmill will come to a complete stop after starting workout almost making me fall   the thing is just junk  if it wasn t    lbs i would have sent it back but stuck with it now   garbage  avoid      
626,1.0,                       after using it for around   year before my warranty expired  i had problem with my treadmill belt  console and side bars  i contacted the customer support  they took the photos of the damages  they put me on hold and checked with the support technicians and informed me that they would be sending me the treadmill walking mat alone  the rusted side bars and the console won t be replaced  they claimed it is because of misuse like placing the treadmill in open or water   also when i asked about a technician to be sent for the treadmill walking mat  they informed that they cannot send a technician because of the  gross  condition of the treadmill and i have to pay for the technician i could not understand what would one expect the condition of the treadmill when it is used for an year  i doubt the quality of the components used in the product  it could not withstand the usage not even   year  but the support claims that the equipment used for    years is still in a good condition i am totally dissatisfied with the quality of the product and the support

628,5.0,                       i owned a schwinn     p treadmill for the last    years  but it got old and kind of wore out  so i decide to purchase a new treadmill and decided on the nordictrack ntl     t     s  as soon as the treadmill was set up i tried it out and it s a beautiful piece of equipment  i feel i ll get my moneys worth out of it many times more than what i paid for it  beautiful piece of equipment  the delivery of the treadmill was fantastic  it was delivered exactly the hour they said it would be and delivered right to my front door wonderful job amazon  and the  technician came out two days later exactly on time very wonderful person and put my treadmill together like a pro  i could ve done it myself but having him do it was well worth the money  very nice guy  amazon your company is getting better every day and thank you  fred       
629,2.0,                       it took me   hour to unlock this machine    kind of felt like a scam      assembly instruction graphics are difficult to make out see unless you have perfect vision this machine that i already paid several hundred dollars for  can only be activated by not going to nordictrack s website  but instead to ifit com which requires you to sign up for their     mo membership   what the heck   ok  yes there is a    day free trial but you still want my credit card and remember to cancel it after a month   it all feels shady   seriously   tell me its an option not a requirement to just use what i already paid for   nordictrack should be the one to unlock my machine as part of the warranty registration process   let me use it first before you start asking for more money   i was so annoyed after putting it together  that all i wanted to do was run off some steam   it took me   hour to get this machine to start working   two different phone numbers  both of which are ifit  and all recordings insist you must register with ifit com before anyone can talk to you   finally i pressed the correct button combo that told me to hold down on a  bluetooth  button until it turned green and it would unlock   first off the button was not the bluetooth icon or even that name   it was the ifit button   oh and i tried that several times  and once it turned green  i let go just as the recorded message instructed   nope that didn t do it either   holding the button down for almost a minute did the trick  surprise   and i was able to use the treadmill   so easy and simple once you figure that out on your own      
630,5.0,                       for it s price  it s really great  i have it on my  nd floor on my house  and the noise and shaking is very minimal  it runs pretty smooth  i typically do     mph for    minutes and haven t run into many problems  it s very easy to change speeds  has strong supports  and a great display  you can even open a browser and use it like any other device when connected to internet  assembly was super easy  all materials were delivered on time and instructions were super clear and easy to understand  definitely recommend as a reasonably priced treadmill      
631,5.0,                       we love this treadmill  my husband and i have had this for close to   months now  i researched different brands  models  sizes  and technologies and this one is really blowing us out of the water  the deck itself is very sturdy  we have also been very impressed with the options coming from ifit across different programs  the only wish we have is that the screen was a little more mobile  it only has the ability to shift up and down a small amount  but not a huge issue  if you have been overwhelmed with all of the options out there  just give this one a shot  it isn t a commercial grade treadmill  but it has all the little bells and whistles that make you feel like you are on one      
632,3.0,                       this is a very basic treadmill that will get to a steep incline  and speed up to a pace that gets you to a moderate job  i and my wife are of average height and it s good enough for us  it is not for people are in good shape and want to do hiit trainings  or want to get to sprints also  i have to say this is a terribly designed product for assembly  when delivered it has four basic parts   running base  console  two  sturdy  metal legs to connect the base to the console   this should not require    hours to assemble  however the treadmill is plagued with bad design which makes assembly a real pain  i assembled it  it wouldn t turn on and i had to partially disassemble to fix a disconnected power supply cable  joining the base to the console requires used   different screws   washers for the same joining part with the metal legs  and the holes are in the most awkward places   all of which makes the assembly process unnecessarily frustrating and could have been avoided if designers had taken more care also  as others have pointed out   you do not need ifit activation to use the treadmill  it s all false advertising to force you into a trial ifit subscription  terrible customer centric design  please stop nordictrack    god help me if i have to call in for support      
633,2.0,                          update found some more broken spots and a missing crossbar that makes the treadmill fold for storage  this was definitely damaged while product packaging or it was a return  hopefully  it works found the damage after unpacking the treadmill to start assembling  everything works so far but haven t done a session on it and praying i don t have to send it back fyi  i have worked in quality control and the damage to the treadmill had to happen during the product packaging stage      
634,5.0,                    estoy muy contento con esta nueva adquisici n para mi entrenamiento personal en casa  es bastante c moda y silenciosa al momento de hacer los ejercicios  me encanta el sistema ifit cardi q viene incluido con la maquina porque tienen diferentes rutinas de ejercicio que te ayudan a ejercitarte de m ltiples maneras  actualmente estoy disfrutando del mes gratis de este programa y comienzo a pagarlo a partir del segundo mes  por lo que estoy aprovechandolo al m ximo para decidir en ese per odo de prueba si realmente quiero quedarme con esta aplicaci n  lo cual si me gustar a porque es realmente impresionante  al momento en que lleg  el t cnico a hacer la instalaci n de la m quina en mi casa  luego de desempacar el producto de la caja pudimos notar que la tapa que va encima del motor estaba da ada  pero esto pudo haber sucedido en el momento del env o  inmediatamente tome foto de esa parte e hice el reclamo directamente a la fabrica y ellos atendieron de inmediato mi reclamo y en tan solo dos dias me dieron respuesta de que ya la pieza hab a sido enviada a mi domicilio  por lo que me da una gran satisfacci n de poder contar con la garant a del producto de manera exitosa con esa gran atenci n al cliente de parte del personal profesional de nordic track  me gusta la forma autom tica de inclinaci n que tiene  al momento de hacer los ejercicios si el programa escogido en la app tiene subidas y bajadas  as  como incremento o disminuci n en la velocidad  todo se hace de forma autom tica  puedo medir mi ritmo card aco colocando mis manos en la barra  pude ubicarla sin problema en mi sala de estudio de frente al tv  recomiendo este producto con la mayor satisfacci n que tengo por haberlo adquirido         
635,5.0,                       i love love my treadmill its very comfortable to walk on its easy to operate manually i enjoy the music while i am walking i love the ifit i choose the intensity of my workout accordung to my ability or mood that day i love the trainers  they explain everything as they walk i have virtually visited many countries it helped me plan my trip to turkey lol i love how to can control the sound of the trainers the only thing i wish it had was a pause button so i can goo back later to finish the workout i love how the y control the incline and the speed i need that control love it love it and love it      
636,1.0,                       i bought this treadmill eleven months ago and have experienced nonstop issues with it  the belt came out of the box uncentered which a professional had to fix after it caused a tear within two months  then a few months later  the belt folded over while i was using it  i contacted customer support since it s under warranty for twelve months  well  they outsource that to a third party and they re very hard to get a hold of  i wonder why   after a month of not being able to use it  i got the new belt installed and it still has issues  i know this is a  cheaper  treadmill relative to the multi thousand dollar ones out there  but for        it should be a serviceable product  this is not  avoid nordic altogether      
637,5.0,                       it took a little while  almost   hours  to get it set up but it was worth the effort  the feature i like most about it is  i can see the trainers walking ahead of me and if they go too fast  i can adjust the speed to my convenience  what i also like is the volume  i can turn the sound off or on  while off  i can watch tv without getting distracted  the areas which the trainers show around the world are very exciting and interesting to view  they show me places where i have never been but would like to visit  the free ifit membership does wonders for me because they have training programs that suit every need  even live  especially for me to lose weight while walking  jogging or running which is much healthier than going outside to do the same      
638,5.0,                       writing this    days after having this unit   there are so many units to choose today all with plenty of features and capabilities   to put this review in context  i have a gym membership and go four times a week and use their commercial equipment    by far i am not a health nut or exercise fanatic    i mostly go to stay in basic shape   what i realized is i was spending the majority my time at the gym  and driving back and forth  just to hit the treadmill and bicycles for cardio   so i opted to purchase this unit and a schwinn cardio bike for home  both for less than      happy with my choice  saves me time in the morning  kids use it  can just hop on it anytime   that said if you re looking for a solid treadmill that does most everything you need that feels very close to the weight and stature of a gym model this unit has really impressed me   it s heavy duty  belt is lighter than a gym model but still solid  cushions are just right for aggressive runs  deck it a good thickness  i weigh    lbs  and it feels much like a commercial unit without the   k and north price   i would suggest that you not overspend and buy a unit tauting a bunch of bells and whistle s that you ultimately will not use   the t   s has all of the core features every treadmill offers   it has ifit  don t use it  and solid program options to vary the work out   what it lacks is a lot of hi tech features that i personally think are what most of us really don t use because we have better alternatives at home   example is bluetooth   no bt on this unit   it has an    th jack and speakers in the console   to be honest no treadmill can out perform my little      bose sounddock mobile speaker or bt headphones connected to my phone   so why pay for subpar audio equipment   no cooling fan   i use a far more functional vornado fan when it gets warm that circulates air throughout the room   i would have liked to have it polar compatible so my pulse chest strap would feed the console   i have to wear the watch   btw  the console is great  simple  easy to read and has several modes and rotations to monitor different aspects of your run   ok  so no complaints on this unit at all and i am pleased that it was extremely inexpensive   highly recommend for a near commercial home unit      
639,5.0,                       we had a very very old sears treadmill that didn t have any bells and whistles  we wanted something with programs and ability to incline   i love that it does this automatically  i went with this unit after doing a lot of research on different models and ultimately the warranty and brand name had something to do with our decision the unit arrived by carrier and we paid for the extra so they would put it in our basement  delivery service was very nice and professional  the unit arrived well packed and in great condition  it took about   hours to put together  having a second person helped a lot   especially when attaching the bar to support for folding  i would suggest having a socket wrench to make the installation of bolts quicker and easier  i loved how the screws  bolts  washers and nuts came on a card with the step numbers  so when your looking in the manual to put together you look at what step your on  say step    and you look at the card for step   and there are the screws or bolts you need  i think we will be very pleased      
640,5.0,                       my husband and i gifted this to each other for our new years resolution of getting healthy  i am in love with it  i searched high and low and did so much research to end up back here  it is affordable and does not feel cheap at all  assembly takes   people no doubt about that  it is heavy so having the delivery people place it in the home and assemble is probably the best bet if you dont have any extra hands  i read all the negative reviews about ifit  first of all you can bypass it by holding the button down for    seconds  second of all i would not use this without my ifit app  i love it  i do not work out i hate running so having an app that can control my workout keeps me motivated  plus on days i dont want to run or climb i can do yoga or weight training with it  it s     month  cheaper than the gym member ship i wasted for   years and never went  the box was damaged upon delivery however the product inside was not  if you re actually serious about using it  this is an amazing option  if not you ll have an expensive place to hang your laundry      
641,5.0,                       this treadmill is great  folds easily and it has a slow release when you let it down  really like that  the belt is wide enough you don t feel closed in and it is a smooth ride  the incline is amazing and the speed seems to be right on track to what i was doing outside  i love it as for the ifit subscription  you do get a    free trial  but all you have to do is hold down the ifit button until it beeps and your on manual with    preset workouts or you can manually go from there as you prefer don t hesitate  buy it   it s wonderful      
642,1.0,                       the first treadmill was delivered  everything was going smoothly tech showed up next day to assemble and took notice the motor housing tabs were cracked i decided to do an exchange and a week later the men came picked up the broken dropped off the new the next day the tech came in and assembled let us know the ins and outs then left never actually starting the machine for me  i was having a crazy day and didn t think of it  but he should have offered to do that the machine is not working and will have to send it back      again what a horrible and stressful experience i mean c mon   machines in a row  i d say the manufacturer better look into quality control a little more closer wow i am still in disbelief what a worthless piece of junk this treadmill is now i m going to have to take time off work to meet someone between a certain window of time to have them come and pick this already assembled machine up  and get it the heck out of my house lovely just what i wanted to do      
643,3.0,                       fairly easy to assemble  onboard workouts don t function the way i was expecting  if you re planning on signing up for ifit i would not recommend this machine  first of all  it is really not accessible on the machine as you have to use either your phone or ipad to select your workouts and then download them to the machine  i couldn t get this process to complete even after being on the phone with ifit for over   hours  i have had machines with ifit before and an ifit membership so i know what it is and what i expected from this machine  i wish i had waited and got a better treadmill from costco for the same price that did have ifit actually on it as well as a free full year of ifit membership  which became available after i already had this one  the treadmill is more basic but works for just getting my daily steps in during this pandemic  just disappointing      
644,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  nordictrack    s  i jog about   times per week and walk very fast the other days about   miles per day  after my first attempt in getting this treadmill with very poor delivery people  i paid extra to have it delivered to my exercise room and the delivery people were in no way prepared to even get it out of the truck  and a broken treadmill  our second attempt produced great  strong delivery people with an intact treadmill  yay  my husband and i put it together in about an hour  it went together pretty smoothly and then i adjusted the track to center before getting on it  it works great  like other reviews  i bypassed the ifit by pressing the ifit button for    seconds  the    programs are more than enough for me  i am able to plug in my ipad to the accessory cable and watch whatever tv show or listen to whatever podcast i want through the treadmill stereo which is great  overall  i m very happy and will continue to love the usa made nordictrack      
645,3.0,                       quality is fine  nothing fabulous but good for home use  a little noisy but nothing that isn t easily drowned out by headphones or a tv with the volume slightly turned up  my biggest issue was with the instructions  there were definitely a few steps missing but with a little common sense you can figure it out  however the one step that s missing something that could result in a bigger issue is around the hydraulic stand  there s a small metal piece holding the hydraulic pole down in place and if you remove it at the wrong time you can t install the pole  which is what happened to me  the treadmill still runs fine but i m not able to fold it which really sucks because it takes up half of my workout room  also just to echo what most other reviews say you don t have to sign up for ifit to use it  that s just an illegal marketing tactic that amazon should honestly make the company remove      
646,4.0,                       for those of you who get to step    putting the cross bar on  and think huh   yes the bar does fit and screws do fit but you do need a power tool to get them in  even though the instructions tell you not to use one   the cross bar also looks as though it fits awkwardly  but it all comes together once screwed in  after that  its plain sailing    but it is for sure a two person job   and yes  if you press and hold the button it will turn on without  activation   but you do need the red magnet on first i havent used it much yet so i will update if something goes wrong  overall seems very sturdy and not noisy bottom line   if you generally hate assembling things or are not a  handy  person  this one is tricky  so pay to have it done      
647,5.0,                       great quality treadmill once you get it up and running  but that s the rub  assembly is difficult with bolts in difficult to reach places and takes quite a bit of fiddling to line up bolts with thread holes   and don t even talk to me about activating the treadmill   the website is very user unfriendly and you can t talk to an actual person until you register online which is constantly interrupted by solicitations for protection plans   the final insult is after you get through all the registration stuff you are told to  press the bluetooth button until a green light comes on    they don t mention that you have to hold until the screen changes to the treadmill menu   prefer the old days when you just plugged the treadmill in and worked out       
648,3.0,                       i ve used this treadmill almost every day for   months   it s a decent machine  but very basic   the set up was not easy  but no treadmill set up is easy  it was on par with other treadmill assembly procedures   i didn t want the ifit so i bypassed that by putting the key on and then pushing the ifit button and holding until it disabled it this treadmill works fine for how i use it  which is to get on manual mode and walk with incline for    minutes   i wish it had a better  calories burned  calculator  it doesn t ask for body weight  so it s not accurate    i also wish that the incline went higher than      also there is no fan on this model  which i didn t think i would mind  but occasionally i wish it was there   all in all  its a fine treadmill  but i do wish i had spent another     to get the features i am missing      
649,4.0,                       it is impossible to plug this treadmill in an just start working out  you must wait for the ifit stuff to load before you can choose manual workout  that sometimes takes multiple touches of the  convenient  touch screen  then you have to cancel the warm up  it is only after all this hassle that you can select a speed and incline  i would think very carefully before purchasing this treadmill because of this  it s very inconvenient this treadmill is a really great piece of equipment  heavy duty and works great  however  think long and hard about where you will place it in your home  i expected amazon to provide inside delivery and assembly  but because of covid     they did not provide that service  and amazon didnt tell me this   it was the delivery driver  to say i was disappointed and a bit irritated  is an understatement i planned to install this upstairs in my home and the deck  or base if you will  to this treadmill is extremely heavy  as you might expect   it took two of us to haul it up the stairs and that was just the beginning  the design is good  but assembly is not easy for one person  some of the crevices that you have to get a socket wrench into are pretty small and the control panel is very tricky for one person to install  in retrospect  you really need a two person team to put this together  unfortunately  i was on my own the ifit guided workouts are pretty much overly talkative people on videos   really not worth the money or time  you ll need a    amp dedicated circuit with this beast or you will trip the breaker      
650,4.0,                       we purchased our nordictrack t series    si treadmill to stay healthy during covid      it was the best decision we could have made   i love the ifit membership and all the programs it has for the treadmill   since i cannot travel to other countries right now i use the programs to visit many different locations   the treadmill follows the program in speed and incline   and is a great work out   the only issue i had was that the belt kept shifting to the right past the guide markers   after contacting nordictrack support and following their instruction the adjustment was made and all is good i would recommend this treadmill hands down      
651,1.0,                       got the machine on time  put it together with patience  if you follow directions no big issues  ready to turn on and      is asking me to register at ifit com  its sunday night and after adding all my info  ifit com wants  to force me into adding my credit card for a  free     day trial or it won t let me try my new threadmill because i have to enter some code to start it  and since it s sunday night no one is available to talk at ifit com i am livid that i cannot use this machine review will continue once i resolve this dust collector as of now        
652,5.0,                       the nordictrack t series treadmill is a high quality treadmill  reasonably priced  and the delivery was coordinated very well with amazon s delivery subcontractor  it is a challenge to assemble  but the directions and easy to follow  my wife and daughter use the treadmill a fair amount  and expect when winter of      sets in  the usage will increase  i would highly recommend the nordictrack t series treadmill      
653,4.0,                       i can t quite give this treadmill a   star rating simply because it represents a basic design element that seems to be typical of most  if not all nordictrack treadmills   the front edge of the tread is far too close to the edge of the frame platform structure  such that it is virtually impossible to hold the bar to check the heart rate without kicking or stepping onto the frame platform forward of the actual moving tread while walking in a normal upright manner   other brands have designed the tread to travel at least   additional inches forward of the bar so that it does not require one to lean forward in an unnatural position to reach the bar   it has taken a while to adjust to this awkward stance  so i check my heart rate less frequently   otherwise  this model has a smooth tread run and supports a comfortable impact   since i purchased this model as heavily discounted on cyber monday       i feel it is still not a bad buy      
654,2.0,                       when you get the treadmill all put together and go to use it for the first time  the screen lights up and it makes you input a credit card or it will not work they will tell you to activate the monthly workout scam for    or     a month and you must do this to use the tredmill    its b s  if you turn on the treadmill and hold down the little square fit button for    seconds it will bypass the monthly activation charge and you can run without the monthly bill  why they don t tell you this as well but nowhere in the instructions or the screen promps do the say you can bypass this monthly scam function  but besides that lil preditory scam the unit worked for about   weeks   then it started making a   humming or loud buzzing straining noise  from the motor then eventually started to get slower to the point it won t turn or move the belt  now after   week when you turn it on to jog it won t move the belt at all  the motor it just buzzes and humms  i assumed i was getting a deal with the decent price and the company name plate   also if you run at your gym there will be a big difference between   on that gym machine compaired to   on this machine  this tredmill seems to be off a bit with the speed   how hard is it to get the speed right     mph is   mph no matter what state your in  this machine is off compaired to other machines        
655,2.0,                       we bought a nordic track because of their quality reputation  we had major issues during assembly  at least a half dozen screw holes were not drilled to the proper size  we either had to get our own screws or force the provided screws in  what should have taken    minutes took   hours  then once its setup you are forced to sign up for ifit  you get a    day free trial but are required to provide credit card info and cancel later  your treadmill will not turn on until you sign up for ifit  the treadmill itself runs well but we are very disappointed in nordic track      
656,4.0,                       i am very happy so far with this treadmill  i was looking for a few months before finally pulling trigger on this one  its super quiet and has automatic incline which for this price is hard to find  i trust the brand nordictrack and am really liking using this treadmill people said you have to pay a monthly fee in the app but you don t unless you use their workout plans  you only need to sign up for the account once and don t need to have the app open while using my only qualm is the completely inaccurate heartbeat pulse reader  its awful      
657,4.0,                       i love how easy it is to use the simple features such as the speed and incline  i m a little confused how to use all the buttons on the center of the console  but i m content with navigating the simpler features of the machine  this takes two people to set it up  do not do this on your own unless you are a very strong person  it is an incredibly heavy unit and needs to be kept in a certain orientation when you move it to wherever you want it  it also requires careful reading of instructions  a few of your own tools  and about   hours to assemble  but it s not impossible to figure out and i have assembled much more frustrating things in my life  and it definitely was nowhere near that  getting the ifit to sync with the treadmill was frustrating  it was not straight forward and took several attempts  after   hours of assembly i was so excited to turn this thing on aaaand i couldn t for another   hours trying to get the dang ifit to sync  i almost gave up at about   pm  my partner was miffed  i was disappointed  and if you don t get ifit for at least a try  which is a separate purchase and not cheap   your machine is locked and will not turn on  which was not clear when i made my purchase but luckily i decided i wanted to try it when i purchased it    other people may have found this a particularly unpleasant surprise  i mostly blame the seller for not making this detail clear about this unit  just please  please for your own sanity and time  do your homework before you get it on your front door step  you ll have plenty of time  it took almost   months to get here  that was the other frustration  when i checked out  i was asked to schedule a time for it to get here  i said some day in june  when i went back to my orders  it said it was delayed a whole extra month  you do have the option with amazon to cancel an order before it is delivered if you don t want to wait that long  but there really is nothing they can do to speed things up due to covid delays  however  i don t understand why you have to schedule a drop off when they are going to just leave it outside your door like they do with all of my other deliveries that i don t have to schedule  i was almost expecting someone to come in and set it up  no such luck  now for the positive side  because ending on a high note is good  and ido actually love my treadmill after the rocky start     i am            lbs and my partner is           lbs  and we both use it all the time  i got this one because of how sturdily built it was and how well backed it is by nordick track  i wanted something that could be used regularly by multiple people of varying heights and weights  it does this job very well and with all things considered  i would make the purchase again      
658,5.0,                       so i waited a whole month to see how it feels before i post a review  i love this treadmill together with the ifit plan it comes with  i respect the decision for some users who don t want use ifit but for me it is just what i needed  i love the way the incline automatically adjusts with ifit  something i never used to touch in the gym treadmills  i love the different challenges that come with ifit  the delivery of the treadmill was great and so far i have not had any problem with the treadmill      
659,1.0,                       absolute garbage  had i known that some random trash company called ifit would hold this hostage i never would have spent      on it  knew it was going to be a nightmare once i opened the box and saw   different things saying  product locked visit trash website to active   went to the website where you have to give your credit card info for a monthly subscription to continue  i don t want a monthly subscription  i just want my treadmill to work  there s a phone number listed on one of the warnings which going through call tree options states  hold the bluetooth button to activate   small problem with that  there s no bluetooth on my treadmill  just a an ifit button that does nothing no matter how long you hold it      
660,5.0,                       i love running and walking  but i never wanted to invest in a treadmill because if the weather is crappy  i would just go to the gym and run or walk there  well  thanks to covid     i can no longer rely on that option because it s really hard to run with a cotton mask draped across your face  so  one rainy morning this summer  i bit the bullet and bought one  i found this model on amazon because it was the highest rated for the price range  and i can see why  this is an excellent machine  it is sturdy and reliable  it has great features  like one touch speed and incline buttons  i m sure there are a bunch of features i don t even know about because i haven t really explored yet  but it definitely serves my purposes  and it doesn t make that much noise  either  my only regret is not buying this sooner  i would recommend this treadmill to anyone in the market for an exceptional piece of workout equipment the only thing that wasn t so good is i was not able to secure the kickstand thingy to the bottom so it can fold and absorb shock when it unfolds  but that s not a big deal to me  i just leave it unfolded all the time  and i m guessing it s user error more than anything  i ve never assembled something like this before      
661,5.0,                       my bf and i moved into our dtla studio last year and had researched treadmills for   months before finally pulling the trigger on this one  we decided on this one because it s compact  and it truly is   has all the basic buttons we need  no big screens  no fans  no extra nothing   and the price point could not be beat  amazon delivered it in no more than    days after purchase and it was delivered inside our home  we don t fold the treadmill up as we don t have much furniture but i would definitely see someone with need of more space or people with children to find this option useful and easy  the treadmill is a bit on the heavy side so rolling this treadmill around from one room to another would be quite difficult  we have ours stationary  so definitely imagine where you d place this baby before your purchase and read the dimensions  the screen is definitely one touch and buttons are nice and big so very legible  we knew we wouldn t need the ifit program since there are hundreds of yt videos to help with your workout routine at home  but the membership gave us a scope of what great workouts they offer  if you re into one on one trainers  this might be a great option for you  this treadmill does have bluetooth capacity  however it does not connect to your phone tablet for music on say spotify or yt  it only connects to the ifit app and you can only use this app if you re paying for it after the   month trial  this treadmill also has an aux input with built in speakers for your ipod  you may also use this input with your phone if you buy a separate adapter  the flex select feature on this treadmill is by far my favorite  when running on this treadmill  you can choose to exercise as if you were running outdoors  on concrete  or run indoors  sorta gliding  as you would at an indoor gym so intensity is an option and you can change it by turning the orange silicone knobs at the bottom of the treadmill  the belt is sturdy and if properly maintained this treadmill will not disappoint you  lastly  you have options of up to     incline with intervals of    and up to    mph  if you need assistance with assembly  usage  or just workouts don t be afraid to use yt      
662,1.0,                       customer service is horrible    machine is very difficult to set up     you have to jump through hoops after it is assembled   you cant just get on it and go   it wont even turn on until you  activate it  so they can up sell you more programs apps etc    worst purchase i nave ever made        
663,4.0,                       the treadmill is great  it s sturdy  runs pretty quiet and doesn t have a large footprint   great shock absorber system  i m very happy with it  highly recommended   notice that there is no assembly service in norman oklahoma  as well as other places i assume   however the most frustrating thing is that they tell you that in order to use the treadmill for the first time you must unlock it by logging in to the ifit website and activate it   this requires creating a user name and putting in your credit card info which they say they will not use     you then have to cancel your membership before    days so they won t charge you   i don t want the ifit service   i am a certified trainer  i just want to run and i certainly don t want to give you my credit card info   after some time trying to find how to bypass this  i contacted nordictrack customer service and they told me that you don t need to activate it online if you don t want the ifit service  just hold the ifit button for    sec and it will unlock your machine  it worked like a charm  i wish this info would have appeared on amazon  maybe included in the product info      
664,3.0,                       there are some warranty issues  electrical  at times trips circuit breaker  and belt won t stay centered also there sending me a repair kit for the roller adjuster and they expect me to install it  they had me install a apc plug in unit in the outlet plug and this did nothing to help the breaker tripping issue  so after   weeks i am still at square one  their hesitant to send a technician to the house  i had a electrician on my own come to check out the house outlets and he found no problem and he won t touch the tread mill machined  i expect to receive the roller adjuster this week and will call them back and request  serviceman came to the house to address both problems  other wise it s a good machine as i am able to use it     
665,4.0,                       great treadmill for the price  one thing i want to point out is that  compared to my apple watch  i would absolutely not recommend going by the heart rate or calories burned  it claims my heart rate was    when my apple watch had me at      the calories could be off anywhere from        calories off on any given workout  as in it tells you that you burned more than you actually did   also  listen to top review  hold the ifut button to bipass the sign in junk        
666,4.0,  overall   i had bought a nordictrack treadmill similar to this years ago and got a lot of great use out of it  the only reason i sold it is because we were moving and the rental we were moving in to didn t have space for it  we bought a new home recently and i have a big workout space now and tracked down a similar model from amazon and got it in january when they were running some discounts  overall it s been a great machine and i ve already put    hours and about     miles on it     assembly   i bought the package deal where an installer comes to assemble it  so all i can say is that he didn t have any issues and it took him less than an hour  been solid since     general use   it s a mid range treadmill but it gives me most of what i need  i do run some of the ifit programs that vary speed and elevation and every once in a while it would be nice to have more than a     incline  but not very often  when it comes to speed  i m rarely sprinting even at the max speed of   mph  so it s plenty fast  speed and incline controls are decently responsive but there are times you have to hit the button more than once to get it to react  transitions to a higher or lower speed or incline are just fine  wouldn t want them any faster or slower   the width and length of the treadmill are great and i m       and never feel crowded   i have some suggestions for improvement  but i ll write those below     ifit   i ve used some of the ifit programs and enjoyed them  probably a lot more to get out of them  but the screen on the treadmill isn t huge so not as engaging as i d like  it s more about the automatic program control of the speed and incline that s valuable to me   the buttons on the touchscreen are kind of small and not super responsive  they work and i get around fine on it  but it can be sluggish and often requires multiple attempts to get a button to respond  kind of like a smartphone ten years ago  not perfect   the other big issue is that i have not found a way to sync the ifit program to a computer screen or tv in any way  my old nordictrack with ifit allowed you to use the ifit website and sync what was going on with the treadmill on the computer screen  i think that feature has been removed as far as i can tell and there s no way to use an appletv  roku  computer  or anything else to see a larger picture of the screen so you re left with a small screen only  i called support multiple times on this  but it seems this isn t available and only high end models have an hdmi out  probably a    part  that would work perfectly   oh well  i m living with it  but it was a surprise to find out that this treadmill couldn t do what a similar nordictrack treadmill    years ago could do     suggestions   don t want these suggestions for improvement imply that i m not happy with the treadmill  i am   it can just get better in a few key ways     see my ifit comments above  it s really been crippled in order to convince you to buy a much more expensive version just for the bigger screen  that s too bad     there no great place to put a water bottle  there are spots on the side  but they don t work like a drink holder at all and are kind of awkwardly placed  there s a shelf down below the controls  but i m not quite sure why it s there except to store stuff like a hrm or other gear  not a good spot for a water bottle while you re walking running     noises  overall i m happy with the noise level of the machine  but it makes a strange noise ever time as the incline goes down around    my other treadmill did the same thing  so i guess it s normal  but still kind of strange     like i mentioned above  buttons could be more responsive  when you re sprinting above  mph and you re ready to end your interval you reach for a slower speed and it would be great if it responded the first time every time   again  overall i m very pleased with the machine and it gets me through idaho winters without gaining     lbs  don t know what i d do without it 
667,5.0,                       this is a fantastic treadmill  especially given the price  complaining about this treadmill is truly a first world problem  for starters  it is very reasonably priced considering most treadmills start around        additionally  some have mentioned that it s loud  we ll yes it s a treadmill   it s literally supporting your full bouncing weight as you run on it  so of course it makes noise  the machine itself isn t really all that noisy even when the belt is at full speed  lastly and most importantly  you do not have to register for ifit    to bypass  simply hold down the ifit button for    seconds and the treadmill will work  if you re looking for a basic treadmill with multiple speeds  inclines  and the option for ifit  this is for you      
668,4.0,                       i started with an el  cheapo   this one works you harder   don t know how  but it does   manual says do not add silicone   that seems weird to me  i will find out as time goes on the leg uprights didnt like to fit on the cowling very well   seemed like a lot of stress on the plastic to get metal legs lined up but it did line up   i do have a wobble   a shim fixed that   could be from my garage floor unlevel   i did get it together by myself   some rope helped in the spots where you did need two people you do not need to sign up for ifit then cancel    unless you want ifit   just press the ifit button for      seconds and machine will bypass the online enrollment    you only need to do it once love the auto incline   i am tallish  the length and width is good for my stride   distance and time seem accurate  fairly identical to my last treadmill   the onboard display has a track graphic  wish that was bigger      
669,5.0,                       great treadmill  but the other things first i would definitely recommend having a professional set it up  if i didn t have my husband helping me  i wouldn t have been able to do it alone because it s very heavy and awkward luckily  i read the other reviews saying you don t have to subscribe  which would have been a dealbreaker  but it s true  you don t have to subscribe this treadmill is great  i love it  it s exactly what i was looking for  it folds up nicely  but heavy duty enough to actually run  not just walk  on      
670,5.0,                       this treadmill was perfect for us  the size fits just right in the room and we are completely satisfied with the quality of the product  i would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for home fitness      
671,5.0,                       i had amazon assemble  less stress  i did a lot of research and bought this model  it does what it s intended to do and i love it  i knew how to bypass the ifit so i wasn t concerned with most of the negative reviews  after using ifit for a month i actually love it and will continue to pay the    a month  i ve always gotten bored quickly and don t consistently exercise because of that  the ifit keeps me engaged and controls the treadmill settings  i can always cancel if it gets old  hopefully they ll keep up to date on the workouts and keep it interesting  bottom line great treadmill for the price and ifit is a great accompaniment      
672,5.0,                        months in and it seems to be working ok  while i appreciate the use of the ifit app i couldn t find workouts that fit exactly what i was looking for  the treadmill on it s own is great  side note for anyone who purchases one the comment that a two person assembly team is needed is not a suggestion  i am very capable of putting together anything that comes with instructions but due to the weight of the pieces you should definitely have help  also with the instruction not to used power tools when assembling the treadmill i had to use my drill on the hand rails to make them sufficiently tight  i simply did it little by little but without it there was no way i could get the screws tight enough to not wobble or seem loose      
673,4.0,                       i have been using this for the past few months  its really nice to use and very useful exercise equipment for home  the quality of the product is really nice  no noticeable noise and smooth running  has that professions feel to the product  wish i did buy the one with the bigger display but the tablet mobile stand was useful had a bit of difficulty to assemble  could have designed it better for assembling  but worth the effort to get it assembled      
674,5.0,                       easy to assemble   even though instructions call for two people i was able to assemble it myself   the treadmill is very stable and well built   the main thing i dislike is the mobility   to move the instructions tell you to grab the handles and use your foot to secure the leg and then tilt the treadmill back on the wheels   i feel this is dangerous   my old proform had the wheels in front so that all you had to do was lift the handles and move it into position   hopefully they will improve follow on models   there is no fan so i purchased a clip on from amazon   bypassed ifit   if they had offered it free for     months i would have signed up and tried it out   could not find data in ifit and how it would help me on the treadmill    maybe later they will offer it free for   months to see if it works for you before since you have to give them a credit card   one assembly problem   the silver ground screw would not work per instructions so i had to use a substitute   i have a case number but response is very slow   consider this a minor problem   bottom line is i love the treadmill and happy with my purchase      
675,5.0,                       this treadmill truly surprised me with the size and how well it works  i ve been able to run pretty fast on it and the incline is pretty legit  it s like a knock off treadmill from orange theory  it s not too big  and not too loud  i have it in my room in my tiny nyc apartment and my roommates can t ever hear me using it  i m very happy with this purchase  i was skeptical because of how cheap it was  but soo worth it  also  to skip the ifit subscription when turning on  just hold down the ifit button until the subscription screen goes away also  semi easy to assemble  i had my boyfriend help me put it together  and it took us maybe an hour because he was making me actually help him       
676,4.0,                       for the love of god pay to have it assembled  unpacking alone took me    min then two hours to assemble  and it s heavy   and don t fall for the ifit scam  if i wanted to pay        per month i would have joined a gym  one other reviewer said to hold down the ifit button for    seconds and you can start the treadmill without going to ifit com at all and signing up for something you may not want   worked for me and so far i m happy with the treadmill      
677,1.0,                         weeks after purchase i still have one broken treadmill  incredibly difficult to assemble and then you discover the unit is broken  have spent hours on the phone and weeks waiting for parts  i just received my second repair part yet again the wrong one      
678,5.0,                       i hate the fact that the treadmill is locked and it forces you to get this subscription  like the treadmill isn t enough to pay for geez  but other than that the treadmill is amazing  after skipping the subscription and testing the machine out it really works good      
679,4.0,                       we ordered this treadmill when gyms closed in       it took quite some time to be delivered  but that s what happens these days   now that it s here  we really love the quality   it s stable  quiet  and can be used both in simple form or with  bells and whistles    two key things keeping it from   stars    it s an effort to get it put together   takes two people and some patience    the ifit requirement is a pain as other reviewers have mentioned   ifit is required to activate your machine  i could not find a way around it   i now have to go through and cancel the membership to ensure we are not charged after the   month trial  we have no interest in the ifit features  but if the live classes  etc  are of interest to you they do look good  and have quite a bit of variety      
680,1.0,                       first off this treadmill is not easy to assemble  i am an engineer so i can put things together but the manufacturing of this is poor  two bolt holes were not threaded well and i could never get the bolts to thread in  one bolt hole was so far off i couldn t install that bolt  every bolt felt like it was going to strip if i tried to install it after i finally got it installed i was very disappointed  it claims that it can be used without the subscription  well  yes  but only in manual mode  the product description says it has    built in workouts but you still have to have a subscription to use them    this is very deceiving and in my opinion wrong  if they are built in then they should work without a subscription  very disappointed in this but how are you supposed to return a treadmill after it is assembled and the box was destroyed trying to get the pieces out  this is wrong      
681,1.0,                       first tio   you do want to get a ratchet set if you don t have one  recommend the dewalt one from costco  the bottom bolt nearer to the middle is particularly difficult that s not the reason for my   star review though  sure  it s not the easiest to assemble and it s kinda weird to adjust it so that it s completely stable  it s the amazon pricing and price matching policy    days after i bought this item  amazon sold the t   s for      less  i called and they won t price match  take your business elsewhere if you re expecting good customer service   i m now going to activate wilibuy which i get from capital one to get alerted when amazon is not the best option if you do end up getting this  there is one thing i liked   the     delivery to any room  the fellas were easy to work with      
682,5.0,                       when i saw the treadmill on line and realized it had to be assembled  i wondered   can an    year old put together        parts and make a whole machine   when the package arrived and i convinced the strong delivery men to lug it inside  i opened it and sure enough          parts   or so it seemed   but i set to work and  over two days  labored for about   hours   voila   my very own treadmill   it works just as well as the one i remember from that expensive gym i no longer belong to   my wife and i use it daily   it s a gem   already paid for itself in saved gym fees      
683,5.0,                       you don t have to go to ifit com to activate the treadmill  the treadmill is not locked  this is very deceiving and nordic trac should not allow the wording  as a previous reviewer said  you can activate the machine by simply push and hold for    seconds or so the blue ifit button on the control board  make sure you put the key into the proper slot first  safe yourself the fee because they want your credit card  if you pay extra for installation when ordering  the mechanic should know this  but they don t  i am    years old and i don t need to fold it  but folding works if you need to      
684,5.0,                       we enjoy our long walks outside along lake michigan when weather permits  but chicago weather doesn t always allow for that  especially during the cold months  so  we decided to get a treadmill so we could continue walking running indoors when needed  build quality is good and sturdy  and it doesn t feel like my      lbs is going to make it fall apart like most cheaper products  i did have to replace a part that was broken when i unpacked it  it s really heavy and bulky and the delivery guys really struggled to get it up to our second floor walkup apartment  so i was surprised not more was damaged  the part was replaced very quickly once i supplied the necessary info assembly took a while but the directions are clear and easy to follow  this model has a huge screen and came with a   year subscription of ifit included  both features are awesome  following behind a hot trainer on screen as they guide you through all sorts of workouts all over the world is like dangling a carrot in front of a donkey  it s motivating and you get to  visit  some really cool places  plus  you don t have to change any of the speed incline settings because it happens automatically while you re following the trainer  it s like being right there with them   very happy overall with our purchase      
685,4.0,                       i got this treadmill for casual running and walking on my path to losing weight and not having to go to the gym every single time i wanted to hop on a treadmill  i didn t need bells and whistles or a fan so this treadmill was what i needed  this treadmill is great but after about   miles  it starts to squeak a bit  also  the belt is not completely lined up in the middle and we ve tried to move it over but to no avail  we even asked our installer to see if he could move it over so it didn t rub on the right side of the platform but he couldn t move it over i m still very happy with my purchase though      
686,1.0,                       upon assembling this treadmill  the ground screw  not the throw away screw  did not fit into the frame as the hole was too small   i was able to simply use a smaller screw   unfortunately  when i was attaching the crossbar on the top by the console  the four screw holes were again too small for the frame and would not be able to screw completely in   i quadruple checked that i was using the correct screws   i am having this treadmill returned which is a huge hassle to me in terms of time wasted   this is a poorly built product in terms of the machining   i could not say if the treadmill is good in terms of the motor display etc  as i could not get past the problems   sure i could have drilled out the holes but who would want to have to do that for a      item   the parts fit imprecisely and overall this treadmill is a joke   perhaps it was manufactured during the pandemic peak in china   truly this is one of the worst product experiences i ve had in some time   i actually give it zero stars      
687,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is my screen after    mins  reboot or amazon won t help  i have to contact manufacturer myself  the phone can never get through  requested on their super difficult website support  no response either shipping was a disaster too  i rescheduled   times  took an additional month for my  room of choice  service due to this item is too heavy  they need arrange   persons to carry it upstairs btw the belt has a patch too  i am not sure if that s normal     
688,4.0,                       i ve only has this for a day  so i ll focus on assembly and can update the user experience after using it for awhile longer unpacking  this thing is heavy af  required two adults and a dolly to get into the house  nothing was missing or damaged  be careful when removing the base from the box as the console  including the touchscreen monitor  is stored under the base during shipment  the base is by far the heaviest component in the box  i suspect that most of the complaints on here about broken consoles are a result of crushing the console while removing the base from the box  so be careful there assembly  this thing is harder to assemble than your standard ikea shelf  but no so hard that you need to hire a professional  you will  however  need a second adult to help you out as some steps require a second set of hands  you will also need a phillips head screwdriver and a socket wrench  everything else is included  as far as instructions  i would have preferred better illustrations  there are youtube videos with folks assembling these and i strongly recommend watching those along with reading nordictrack s instructions  it would have been extremely frustrating trying to assemble this thing on those instructions alone without those helpful youtubers ifit  i ll update once i ve had a chance to really explore the software  signing up for my free year was super easy  i read another review indicating that you need to pay for a year upfront with the free trial and then get reimbursed later  that is not my experience  there was a card in the box with an activation code  that code set me up for a year free  i paid nothing on activation  zero  however  it did require credit card info because  after a year  if i do not cancel  it will automatically charge my account for the next year  this auto renew feature sucks and they are clearly banking on people forgetting to cancel before the year is up  i will be taping a reminder to my machine to cancel before the year is up so i am not charged audio  there is audio input  but not audio output  so you can plug your phone in and listen to music through the treadmill s speakers  but the reverse is not true  you cannot plug in headphones to the treadmill to listen to workouts through headphones  there is also no bluetooth on this    si  that s a total bummer as my machine is in my living room and everyone in the room now has to hear my ifit videos because there is no way to listen through headphones touchscreen  the screen is not as sensitive as i would have liked  i find that i have to press buttons several times to have it recognized  that s a bit annoying fan  because it was brought up in other reviews   no  there is not fan on the    si  i was able able to get a cheap clip on fan off amazon for ten bucks  so the lack of fan is definately not a deal breaker for me overall  i m giving this one   stars  so far  i feel like i got what i paid for  but will update again when i ve had a chance to wear it in      
689,5.0,                       after doing my research i chose the    s nortic track treadmill to purchase for my home   it is easy to assemble and one of the better treadmills for the price   i ultimately purchased a nordic track treadmill because of their reputation and reliability   very happy with my decision and happy with my daily workouts   it has been especially useful during this trying time we are going through and having to give up my gym workouts  i use it everyday and highly recommend this product        
690,1.0,                       for the price  i would think that they would include all the tools needed to assemble this machine  assembling it requires a wrench  i had my own by i would have preferred the rounded ones that usually comes with the tools when you are required to tighten bolts  especially in such tight places  the included l screw driver was oddly shaped as well  making it hard to use after assembly  if you try to start it  it will start beeping and wont stop until you sign up for ifit  where you have to submit our personal information including credit card info  then after all that  you still have to download the ifit app and give them all kinds of permissions  i bought this machine to work out  not have to install an app and let it track me  it gave me a      big brother watching you kinda vibe  again i bought this     piece of equipment to exercise  what i got was an app on my phone that wants to track everything i do  no thank  no where on this listing for this piece of equipment did it mention that you need to download the app onto your phone to activate this machine inorder to use it  if you do not agree to the terms of use to let ifit monitor you through your phone then you cant use it  why does a treadmill need my location data  i am returning this and keeping big brother out of my house      
691,5.0,                       i couldn t be happier with my purchase of the nordic track t     s treadmill  i upgraded from a   year old horizon t    that i had some major problems with over the years that included an expensive control board replacement and ultimately the motor quit huge pluses for the nordic track are the quality of construction  the options for various programs and the    year motor warranty  another design feature i noticed is the tread is trimmed less wide so it won t fray along the edges  this was a problem with my old treadmill that caused dust and lint balls  so  very happy about the nordic track quality and design  and  assembly was easy  highly recommend      
692,5.0,                       i didn t want to write a review before i had enough time to properly use this treadmill  going on three months now   and so here s what i think i usually run  walk  and jog    to    miles a week  so far  i haven t had any problems  the treadmill has performed flawlessly  and for the price  you can t beat it  it s less than      on amazon  and it does everything you would want a treadmill to do  it has a onetouch incline control  up to      and the speed tops out at    mph  really  how long can someone run at    mph  you can set the incline and speed manually  or you can choose from different pre programmed training options  these options are a nice change if you get into the same old routine   i would recommend this treadmill to anyone who is looking for commercial grade quality for a reasonable price pros   superior options  great warranty  reasonable price cons  none     
693,1.0,                       my treadmill broke earlier this month  since then i have been trapped in an endless exchange of emails with their customer  support   each of their emails requires me to do something else  reset the machine  check the wire harness  recalibrate the unit  etc   etc   etc    all in a very deliberate effort on their part to avoid having to honor the warranty and send out a technician  the latest demand is for a video of the malfunction  which i have emailed in five      separate times  each time a get a reply saying they don t see the link  or they can t open the file  etc   etc   etc  i am done      
694,5.0,                       it s a little bulky but that s to be expected   make sure you have a socket wrench   it will make life so much easier and you won t get carpel tunnel syndrome   it features videos of virtual walking paths in different countries   you can t walk under water or on mars but i m sure any techie could create and upload a video along those lines   if so  let me know      
695,5.0,                       i really like this treadmill and use it often   but after    months the unit has had the same problem of a bad incline motor  although it seems to me to be a controls issue  but  the screen goes blank while your treadmill keeps trying to go higher than it s max of a ten percent grade   the uts contract service people are great to deal with and fortunately the first failure occurred with only a short time left on the initial warranty  and also they had a sale price of full coverage for   years for        now i m glad i got that because the same failure just occurred again   that s twice in the first    months the same failure has occurred    not a good statistic      
696,1.0,                       a complete and utter disaster of a purchase this     thing    arrived with bolts that don t thread  untapped screw holes  and was a complete nightmare to assemble  save yourself the trouble and buy something else  i shouldn t have to hand tap a screw through steel because some factory hand couldnt do their job right and tap it properly  let alone the bolts and dont thread in without arm breaking force  i am furious don t get me started on the four hundred scam fliers all over the instructions telling you to register this hunk of garbage online for a monthly fee      
697,5.0,                       me and my wife use the treadmill almost everyday since we bought it and we absolutely love it  the assembly was simple however the base of the treadmill is super heavy  we are happy of getting it delivered in the room of choice  if you are ordering it  i strongly encourage you ordering it with option of delivering to the place where you ll be assembling it  the keys are bit plasticky but it doesn t really bother the functionality  i am     tall and we placed it in the basement that is   feet high  even with incline  i find it very comfortable  most of the other treadmills had a high deck  so we didn t buy that  this one has been amazing       
698,5.0,                       i was disappointed that my treadmill was broken when it arrived  but the return process through amazon worked beautifully   the new treadmill was delivered  and the broken one hauled away   i found an online video showing me how to override the expensive workout programs because i want to manually control my workouts   my husband and i put it together  he was the brains  i was the extra pair of hands  in about   hours   i m really enjoying it      
699,5.0,                       i loved everything about this   the  room of choice  delivery was great   i put the treadmill together by myself in about   hours   there was one point where i had to ask my    year old to hold something for me for about    seconds  but that was about it   i use the treadmill for walking   i don t have lungs for running   it came with a   year subscription to ifit which i really like  but it s a little pricey so i may not renew it   we ll see   the manual feature is easy to use as well   the bluetooth option is great when i want to walk and listen to the trainer early in the morning   great investment in my own health and well being      
700,4.0,                       this machine is a great value  and very full featured  i assumed it would be perfect for me as someone just getting started exercising regularly  but after about a month of use i am starting to wish it had purchased one of the higher end models  i am starting to find the maximum incline of     to be limiting  since i only have room for a single exercise machine  having one capable of a     incline  like some of the higher end nordic tracks  would be very useful i have also rigged up a fan to help keep cool while working out  many of the higher end machines have a built in fan  so i regret not going up one level to the     si  which would have provided a fan as well as a     max incline      
701,5.0,                       a couple of things   youll need a phillips head screwdriver and an adjustable wrench   do not pinch the wires  two strong people to move into place  get a fitness equipment mat to go under the treadmill  skip the three red warnings that say  activate on ifit com  by just pressing the ifit button for    seconds      
702,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  i am      and weigh     pounds and this treadmill is fantastic in quality  initially  i was nervous to purchase a treadmill online but this was the best decision i made  i like to use the incline for walking with weights and running at high speed  so i was nervous this treadmill would shake but it doesn t at all  i m cancelling my gym membership and sticking with this guy      
703,5.0,                       we are really glad we bought this treadmill  we bought the     model  it is well built and good looking  we really enjoy the ifit membership and use it almost daily  the workouts and trainers make the whole experience more interesting  we didn t have any issues being billed for the yearly membership like others complained about   maybe that used to be an issue but not for us  fold up and take up very little space when not in use  had ours for over a month and very happy with it      
704,4.0,                       the treadmill assembly was pretty involved but it s worth it for such a steady  and i hope  durable  unit   only drawback is the ifit membership required to activate the machine the first time   ifit software is buggy and unreliable and their customer service is weak   i just quit it but i m happy to be left with a very good treadmill update   treadmill stopped working all of a sudden   the machine would power up and make a grinding noise but the console controls wouldn t do anything   frustrating getting service due to long waits on the phone and needing to be near the machine with the motor cover removed   finally had everything lined up and the technician could see nothing mechanically wrong with the unit   told me to hold the ifit button down for    seconds   i counted down and told the tech that it wasn t doing anything after    seconds but kept my finger on the button when all of a sudden the console reset and all was well   moral   if your machine stops working  try holding the ifit button down for a long time before calling support      
705,4.0,                       this is a great treadmill  however the hardware included does not include everything needed to actually assemble  if purchasing save yourself a headache and keep the original grounding screw to reuse as the one provided is too large  you will also need to purchase four rounded     x       screws for attaching the pulse sensor bar to the upright posts  the screws included to do this are     and do not fit  you may be able to get them to fit if you drill the holes out but i didn t want to risk that  even with all these issues it s a great machine and i would buy it again      
706,1.0,                       this was the biggest waste of time and money in the entire world  we have spent hours assembling  disassembling  and on the phone with nordictrack trying to receive parts to make the treadmill work  after owning for   months and never even having the chance to use it  we finally decided to return  we called nordictrack   separate times to tell them the tread did not work  and each time they sent us a part  and each time the part was incorrect  at one point the sent us an entirely new control panel  which wasn t even for our model of treadmill  we finally gave up and contacted amazon for our money back   thankfully they were able to help      
707,5.0,                       in comparing all the options that the different products had with what was important to me  this was my best choice  and i ve been very happy with it  my compromise in getting this one was that the display area has more buttons and functions and is bulkier than i was looking for  but i m sure that helps with it s stability  other things i was looking for that it does have is that it is solid  sturdy  wide  the weight capacity that i wanted  is quieter than my last machine  a price within my budget and speed  which the walking machines i was looking at didn t have the feature i love is ifit  which i didn t buy it for and didn t think i d use  but i m hooked but for the machine  i gave it all   in ratings  because it is true to it s description  what you read and see is what you get  it was easy to assemble  i m a   yr women and did it myself  i had a brace to use to hold it up  but after realizing this was only for the hydraulic lift  which i don t plan on using  you wouldn t need the brace or second person if you re just leaving it in place  but i m impressed  it s easy to lift  feels safe after using the machine  the only suggestions for improvement is if you are using the ifit option  the machine doesn t have a decline  so when they are going downhill  i just increase the speed to try and offset that and get a better workout  to use ifit  you need a tablet or phone  it s not on the screen  it has a ledge at the bottom of the display area to hold it but i bought an flexible phone attachment to hook it to the top so it s more eye level and then sometimes when doing a crossfit where you hop off the machine i can just flip the direction of the phone and continue following along      
708,1.0,                       this machine is full of problems  it s super heavy  loud  the footboard comes out so far you hit it while jogging if trying to stay close to the screen area  it s loud  and just old school  you might as well spend a bit more and get something of quality  it gave me the worst shin splints of my life after just light jogging  the best use we ve gotten out of it is my cat sleeping on it   also  it was     bcuks when i bought it  it dropped to       and amazon wont refund me the difference  but will let me return and re buy  might as well buy from a more trusted  experienced seller  like a wholesaler or gym equipment company       
709,4.0,                       got the treadmill really quick  took me about    minutes to put it together  but i took my time  i couldn t start it without setting up an ifit account and downloading the app on my phone to sync it    however  it didn t force me to put in my credit card information  it asked but i just left it blank  so i m guessing after my    day trial ill be getting an email asking me to renew it  which i won t  ifit is sort of a rip off   it works well  a bit noisier than the treadmills at my gym  the belt seems to make a lot of noise  but it works fine  i will update if anything goes haywire      
710,1.0,                       this is undoubtedly the loudest treadmill i ve ever set foot on to exercise   it s in my finished basement  where there s a pool table  ping pong table  and television   i installed a sonos beam on the tv and still can t hear the programs due to the loud creaking that s heard on every footstep i take   i do not recommend purchasing this product      
711,2.0,                       i bought this on oct       i realized the noise problem   report to norditrack on         each phone call takes    min hold time  why not provide a call back    so far i have called them   times   email back and forth of    emails  problems still not resolved my requests were    repair my noise problem  something to do with the belt     need annual maintenance   tune up    verify with me that i have   years of additional maintenance contract they know how to do them  but just delay   delay sorry for bad review david l  seedavid    gmail com                
712,3.0,                         update  part took   weeks to arrive  installation was quick and now treadmill works flawlessly  i had numerous interactions with customer service  i finally found someone who went above and beyond to track down my part order ordering was easy  delivery was fast  the delivery people even brought the treadmill inside  which i was thankful for because it s heavy   it took a few hours to put together but wasn t difficult   my wife and i used it for walking       minutes at a time and with incline  treadmill worked great for     months and then the motor controller malfunctioned  nordictrack customer service was quick to diagnose the problem and quoted      days for the part to arrive  i checked their website and the part is listed as out of stock   it has been   weeks and no part and customer service is giving me the run around  i do not recommend this treadmill and customer service is terrible   i will be returning      
713,5.0,                       i had a peloton before this and hated it  i ve had my treadmill since august and i use it everyday  it s super sturdy and dones t feel cheap at all  i would buy this again  it was exactly what i was looking for and i m so happy          
714,5.0,                       i have been using this for a couple months and it has been great  i get to work out whenever i want and don t have to think about driving to the gym or getting someone to watch the kids so i could go to the gym it is quite heavy so you would want it delivered to an entrance close to where you want ut installed  due to covid  the delivery guys only dropped it off in the living room door way  i and my husband had to take it down to the basement  as an afterthought  it would had been best if we had told them to drop it off at the back porch close to the basement assembly is best for   the purchase came with   month free ifit  subscription and signing up on with ifit was required but credit card details was optional  i had read a lot of reviews regarding this and since it was optional  i didn t enter any credit card details so i don t need to call anyone to cancel the manual is quite handy and don t forget to put the key on the treadmill also  when done with workout  take the incline down to   and speed down to    otherwise  the treadmill would take a while to start up during your next work out its truly been an awesome experience      
715,5.0,                       i ve been trying to get more exercise and have been upping my daily steps  since we re all working from home  sitting has become the norm  when the weather was nice  i d walk around the neighborhood  but now that it s winter    i m back to sitting  thus  the treadmill set up wasn t too bad  it was just my wife and i  and it took us more than an hour  in retrospect  i wish i had sprung for the set up service  once assembled  it seems to be a nice machine  sturdy and comfortable  it has a lot of features   most that i don t use  i basically use the speed and the incline  but it can do so much more if that s your thing it folds up and down very easily  you don t have to be exceptionally strong or coordinated to do it  it moves with ease  too  but i d recommend   people the deck is pretty comfortable  even though i m on tile  i bought a padded mat to keep it from scooching  and it seems to help with the shock absorption  too all in all  i m very happy with this purchase  and expect many years of use from this treadmill      
716,5.0,                       i contemplated to buy this treadmill and its newer sibling  t     but i eventually reasoned that i wouldn t need a screen or  ifit software   i need a basic treadmill that is well built  quiet  and just easy to use maintain   also  i thought about a trade off of signing up for a gym  or buying a treadmill   at this price point  i think this treadmill was a great deal that checked all the boxes that i cared for   it came in a big and hefty   x   box that you would need another person to carry   assembly wasn t so difficult  but i recommend building this with another person to help you hold the treadmill handles  front console  etc   a cross bar that connects two handles and a front console was challenging to install   you would have to push hard two vertical arms and handles inwardly to place the cross bar and screw it down   you may even think that the cross bar would be too short and it took two people to install this   besides this part  the assembly was easy if you faithfully follow the instruction manual included   there are other reviews here about bypassing ifit  but i didn t bother to look for that   i just quickly signed up on my phone  then cancelled the membership right away   i do agree that this is a nuisance and i don t approve nordic track is making people to sign up for ifit just to activate this treadmill   if ifit is as awesome and effective as they advertised it to be  then i don t think that they have to force consumers to sign up  i think this rather displayed ifit s insecurity and failure in marketing   of course this is my opinion    using this treadmill was as easy as using a treadmill at a gym   once you can look past this ifit annoyance  i think this treadmill is a great buy   it is sturdy  slick looking  quiet enough to hear your wife  or too quiet   and super easy to use   you simply hit start  set speed incline  then run   i think if you are average joe like me who just want to run without thinking much about advanced features  though it still comes with several presets and workout options    then i think this treadmill would be a great option for you      
717,1.0,                       i bought this treadmill four months age and i have used it less than five times and it broke i called nordictrack tech service several times and they had me on the phone for over an hour and they had me do the troubleshoot for them  send the picture  video of the issue and they agree to send me parts  but i received nothing no parts  had to call them every week until i got the parts in the third week  now i am on the call with their customer service to schedule a tech appointment to replace the bad parts this is been going for too long and no results do not buy this product it is cheap and not worth it  with horrible customer service  it is not worth the time and the stress you will go thought if you have any issue with this treadmill  be smart and invest your money wisely  this is the second month  my treadmill is still sitting in the garage waiting for their tech to get fixed      
718,5.0,                       wife and daughter love it  hold the ifit button for    seconds to bypass signing up on line for the monthly payments     
719,5.0,                       i ve had this treadmill for a couple of weeks now  and have used it regularly for walking and running assembly took two people  but wasn t too bad at all  no issues the treadmill is sturdy and sound  great for running  the controls are easy to use  easy to access  easy to read and very responsive  i bypassed the ifit boondoggle and use it in manual mode so far  i am very happy with it  my last treadmill was a much more expensive sole treadmill  and i am just as happy with this treadmill as i was with the sole if you re on the fence  i recommend this treadmill      
720,5.0,                       great price and super assembly service   this treadmill is so modern to me  my last treadmill i bought was over    years ago   i love the fit feature   syncs with phone app and keeps track of how far you walk  calories and heart rate   i find that some of the walking running features on the app are too much for a senior like me  so i put it on manual work out and it shows walking laps on an oval track   like that a lot   belt is wide enough to be comfortable and i don t have to worry about stepping off either side while walking      
721,1.0,                       i m sure the product was fine but delivery was garbage the product came damaged and dented and when i opened it you can see the giant cracks on the base  when i first called amazons customer service they wanted to know if it was still usable even though it was cracked  or if i wanted to keep it even though it was cracked  what they were not able to come and pick it up until three days later wasting more time or window that i needed to be around for  this will make a total of seven hours i will need to make myself available for a piece of damaged equipment they were also not able to issue me a new one right away and that i would have to wait for my refund to be processed in four days not waiting around to order a new one  garbage customer service amazon   update  a new one could not be reissued because they didn t have any more at what i paid  everything is now          more  not ever ordering something of this size from amazon ever again     
722,1.0,                       i bought my first nordictrack in        it s been a great machine but it was time for a new one because the display panel was failing   i did a lot of research and decided to stick with nordictrack   i purchased delivery  setup  and an extended warranty with my purchase   i was so excited when it came   the machine doesn t seem as well built as the previous one but the display and ifit are amazing   after a few uses  the machine started making a clunking sound   i went onto the web and submitted an online form for service   i received a confirmation email but never heard from anyone   i called about    days later and was trapped in their ivr   it kept wanting me to go to their website to find helpful videos on fixing my treadmill   i spent a lot of money  i have a mfg warranty  and an extended warranty so i don t want to fix the machine myself   i called back a  nd time and got to a customer service rep   they seemed nice enough but couldn t help me because i needed to be at home with the treadmill so they could help me isolate the sound and then  fix it myself     a few days later i removed the hood and found a loose screw that was causing the clunking sound   i tightened it and it was fixed        until i walked on the treadmill again and there was some other sound   i don t really use the treadmill now because the sound drives me nuts and i haven t had time to call customer service again   nordictrack   just come and fix the damn thing since i paid for that service   i am very disappointed      
723,1.0,                       i really hope people are reading these reviews  the product itself is okay  delivery was quick and i was able to assemble it by myself with no issue and it does what it needs to do  it s a well built treadmill and looks sleek my issue is with this ifit subscription they are pushing  all over the packaging  instructions  and the product itself are these little warning labels saying the product won t turn on until you ve activated your ifit subscription which of course costs money  what they don t tell you  anywhere  is that you can activate your product by holding down the  ifit sync  button for    seconds without having to sign up for ifit  the only reason i knew about the bypass is because i read the reviews of all the people who figured that out after the fact  completely deceptive business practice  would buy again  the product is very nice  but the company does not deserve a positive review      
724,5.0,                       been using it for   days  so far  an excellent treadmill   quieter than my old pro form treadmill  though volume has to be turned up  i d say it s better than normal   changing speeds is smooth  and elevation is smooth  too   you need   people for assembly   it takes about   hours   shame on noric trac for pushing the ifit connection   thanks to other reviewers  by pressing the ifit button for     seconds you avoid the hassle of  you must sign up with ifit to unlock the treadmill       
725,4.0,                       i received the treadmill today and took about   hrs to put together   if you can  please the extra     to have the box delivered in the room of your choice since the box is very heavy   there were two large cracks on the bottom of the machine and after i called customer service   they gave me a discount   one thing i don t like is that each time you start the treadmill you have to go through the ifit screen and select start manual   you can start the membership and cancel it but you have to do it from your computer   tablet or phone  not from the treadmill  it s a pretty good exercise machine but i wish there were no scatches cracks considering the  price you pay for it      
726,2.0,                       we used an amazon installation service along with the purchase of this treadmill  the gentleman that came to install the treadmill was great and gave me some information during the set up  once the treadmill was put together he said it looks re furbished and not new  he showed me a few parts are loose and when folding  the treadmill isn t closing the same way a new one does  this is very disappointing  at this point  i don t know if they sent me a refurbished one but i paid for a new one  i am a true amazon prime member and have ordered tons of items through out the year varying in prices  i would expect that when buying an expensive new treadmill i would receive just that  at this point what can i do  i have it  it works just fine   its been a week or so oh and also  you can bypass the ifit subscription     my service technician was able to do it  i appreciated it a lot      
727,4.0,                       received in december so it has been more than   months delivery and installation  the package was much bigger than i thought  i have asked the customer service  the entire package is about    lbs with the heaviest piece a little over      so yes  if you really want to  you could move the box yourself but strongly recommend buying service to deliver to the room of choice  similar applies to installation  we are reasonably handy and assembled the machine by ourselves in a little over   hours  it does require   people as somewhere in the middle it asks one person to hold the console while another person screws  i would do professional installation if i buy it again  assembly manual is somewhat hard to read but after the fact i do think they are doing the best to be accurate  the tools hardward kit is very neat and easy to find pieces now onto the machine pros  works exactly how it s supposed to  good amount of area to run and ifit helped me to start running again after   years  i like to follow the trainers and it makes workout easier and more fun  given it s covid time  it also gives me a mood boost to  travel  in europe or south africa  the incline is pretty steep and i definitely think i worked on different muscle with the hiking session  i used to work out in the gym and other than this might be a tad shorter and narrower than commercial treadmills  it satisfies my needs to run     mins around say    mph without me feeling any different than running on commercial treadmill cons  i gave up on the heart rate monitor  which showed    sth when i was huffing and puffing  ifit takes a couple minutes to boot every time but i have learned to turn on the machine before i start changing into my running outfit  the clip on the safety key snapped in a couple days but we sort of macgyver ed it and still serves purpose  i also wished that i can mirror ipad onto the treadmill screen or can maybe just put the ipad on the console but it doesn t really work as then the ipad will block the fan in summary  there are a bunch of places that i wish it could be better but i think it already does what i am looking for really well  happy that i got the machine      
728,5.0,                       i was hesitant buying this treadmill due to the negative reviews but took a chance anyway  as for the ifit the only way to contact them is thru email they don t answer the phone  when i purchased the treadmill it came with a one year membership and when signing up it gave me only one month  i had to threaten to file a complaint with amazon and the govt for false advertising to get what i was promised  they quickly responded with correct   yr membership  ifit doesn t ask for a cc for signing up as for the treadmill it does everything i needed it s reliable and i ve had no problems  for the price it s a great buy  not noisy  size a little smaller then some  i recommend this item     
729,1.0,                       we have had this treadmill less than one week  the first time my husband used it it worked perfectly fine  the very next day he started using it it completely shut off after   minutes of running the treadmill completely shut off and wouldn t turn back on  this is possible the biggest waste of money  we did purchase the protection plan and are currently trying to get a refund  replacement and it is definitely a huge hassle for a product that is brand new      
730,5.0,                       you do need two people to put this together  that being said  i am very happy with this treadmill  i was looking for a basic treadmill  did not need all the bells and whistles  this fits my needs      
731,4.0,                         star but really a     star because the machine will cause your circuit breaker to trip  you will have to get a good surge protector because it is definitely needed  i do see it as a fire hazard but the only way you can return it is keeping the huge box after it s set up  which i didn t because theres not enough space in my condo for it  i see as as a way to keep people from returning it  the box shouldnt matter and if the freight company is providong you with the return sticker then they should also provide you with the box even if it cost  it was installed a month ago but didnt use it right away which is my choice  no one keep boxes that big just sitting around especially since so many reviews say that the warranty department is no help  i can see a class action in the near future if this continues  sometimes it will override me and incline when i turn it on  il have to wait till it goes all the way up and back down before i can do anything   not sure if it s some kind of mechanical glitch or not  works fine when i m walking and jogging but it does make a sound  the sound isnt too loud but it s not quiet so playing music will help override that problem      
732,5.0,                       i did quite a bit of research on treadmills before christmas with the features i wanted  but not too expensive  if i end up not using it as planned  and i wanted it delivered asap  this has not disappointed  i have used it almost everyday since it arrived  it did take two of us to put it together because of the size of it  but wasn t too complicated  i did to the   month trial of ifit and i really liked the walking tours and various other walking workouts  i really like that the ifit workouts vary the speed and incline for you  i have not renewed the ifit subscription since it expired and the treadmill has also worked perfectly fine starting it manually  i m very happy with this purchase     
733,5.0,                       so far  it s amazing  i was able to assemble by myself in about   hours  the coolest part  it comes with a year of family ifit  i had a few questions getting all set up  and activated  and was able to use the tablet built into it to chat with nordictrack support  right from the treadmill    love it  love it  love it  one piece of advice  skip the amazon offered maintenance package  and buy from the nordictrack website when you registered  you get better choices  for a better price my only complaint  the delivery crew brought the box to me upside down  even thought the box clearly said   this side op   nothing was damaged  but it still left a bit of unease for such a heavy  expensive item      
734,5.0,                       i ve read some not so good reviews  but i m very happy with this treadmill  first let me say  you do not have to sign up for ifit to get it to work  just hold down the ifit button for    seconds to unlock it my husband   i were able to put it together ourselves in about    minutes  directions were easy to follow  i didn t need anything fancy as i mostly walk but i wanted an incline   this works great  lots of speed   incline settings  has   very large cup holders  a ledge to put my ipad on if i want to watch something  walking on it feels great  doesn t hurt my knees like some treadmills can      
735,5.0,                       this machine was much sturdier than i thought it would be for the price  it did take my husband a bit of time to put it together  but he said the shrink wrapped package with the screws in it was the best packaging job he has ever seen  it was really organized and easy to see which part went where  this treadmill is way more powerful than i will ever need  i am    with some health issues  i love to be able to use the nordic track at my pace  the one  con  i will mention has nothing to do with the machine but with the ifit personal training  they need to make programs for seniors  all in all  this is a great treadmill      
736,5.0,                       good treadmill for the price  not top of the line but very good for the home  many people crying about the ifit thing  i agree that it is shady to try to get someone to think that they must sign up for a service to use their physical product  but it s even stated somewhere on this product listing that it is not required  maybe if people read things through a little better they would not be so surprised when they think they ve hit a dead end  it is quiet enough for a treadmill  haven t used the speakers so can t comment on that but i just set up a tv in front of it so didn t matter to me    stars from me      
737,4.0,                       delivery people left it on a pallet in my front yard not an awesome start   heavy as sin took two of us strong men to get it inside   parts i received were not drilled properly at the factory so i had to get replacement parts which was pretty simple from nordic track they came fast and free   once you are up and running like other reviews say you have to sign up for this bs monthly package to even start using the treadmill  you can cancel right after but its a sneaky shady tactic   the tread mill as far as use is ok it s a treadmill with incline  speed and etc   it squeaks a little but after awhile you learn to ignore it   once it was all put together and i used it i ve not had issues since then   it s my only treadmill purchase so i don t know how to compare it to others but for the money i paid i would not say i m overly satisfied with the experience      
738,4.0,                       we just received this today   it definitely take two people to handle   the delivery driver was supposed to deliver this to our entrance way  instead he dropped it off in front of our garage and took off before i could even get out the door   my husband and i had to unbox it and carry it in in pieces   thank goodness it wasn t raining the assembly was relatively simple   it took two people to strong arm some of the pieces into place   it runs   it s quiet   i am super impressed with how easily and softly it folds up and down   i m not sure how i feel about the ifit app yet   i am a walker  not  runner  but we ll see     i ll add to my review once i ve had time to put the treadmill and app through its paces      
739,1.0,                       i assembled the machine and when i went to the ifit com  they required that you subscribe to a monthly membership of       per month   you can not even use the machine  when you call the number for customer service they won t even let you talk to customer support until you register your account   you can not register your account unless you provide a credit card number and they charge you a subscription fee   there is no way to use this machine at all until you pay then  and if you cancel subscription they will lock your machine out   amazon should ban this company from doing business      
740,5.0,                       my favorite part of this treadmill is the large screen that has thousands of ifit workouts that make time on the treadmill fly by  there are walks  hikes  runs  hiit workouts  strength training  and yoga  beginner to advanced and easy to difficult intensity  all four members of my family have profiles and can do whatever type of workout they want  with their own unique stats stored in their profile  the treadmill itself is sturdy and i love the feature of being able to fold it up for more floor space  i had to hire a professional to put it together for me        because it takes two people to assemble and i didn t have a second person to help me  i highly recommend this treadmill      
741,5.0,                       i am so very glad that i bought this nordic track treadmill   it is of high quality and is solidly made   it was pretty easy to assemble  i even did most of it by myself   the very last part of the installation i needed a second set of hands but that was it   i love the way the ifit works with it and i even purchased the   yr plan   it is awesome how you can work along with the trainers and see all of the beautiful locales  that i ll probably never be able to afford to go to    lol  in the world like hawaii  miami  and st  lucia etc   it has been a fantastic experience so far   i haven t had it   months but so far i am thrilled with this purchase   thanks amazon nordic track                 
742,5.0,                       this has been a lifesaver during the covid quarantine living in the desert during the summer  shipping was not great but that doesn t apply to the treadmill  assembly was easy  use is intuitive  push and hold the ifit button to bypass the membership portion  i did not have to enter a credit card number at all  i mostly walk on it but i have run a few times and i have had no knee pain  which usually happens with treadmills      
743,1.0,                       when this product first arrived it wouldn t turn on  after     months of going back and forth with tech support  the treadmill would turn on and function at a snails pace  at the time  i didn t care  as i felt it was a good price to deal with its  slow response  as time went on  less and less functions would work  i am now   months out from buying this treadmill and     of the time it won t turn on  when it does turn on  the buttons don t work  needless to say  this is not a good buy  for your sanity  and the health of your body  don t buy this tredmill      
744,5.0,                       i bought the original nordictrack walkfit in      and have regretted selling it for years  well  nordictrack has come a long way  baby  this treadmill has saved us this dreary and cold winter and helped us cope during quarantine  no one had to walk on treacherous  ice covered sidewalks or wade through knee high snow that tom on the next block over didn t shovel yet  instead  we were able to hop on the nordictrack and work off the stress of the workday  the monotony of being inside for a whole fricking year  and  oh  work on our fitness too    i don t use all the bells and whistles that come with the nordictrack  and i don t use ifit  i did a trial run of ifit without giving cc info as some reviewers have mentioned is required  just hold down the ifit logo for    seconds and manual mode is activated   i m happy to manually adjust my speed and incline rather than using any of the pre programmed workouts built into the machine too  i m short and have asthma  so what most people consider a leisurely walk has me huffing and puffing  i m able to hop on for ten minutes for a quick metal break from editing all day  or i can do a full workout  it s my choice  which i love delivery was smooth  setting the thing up took us a few hours  so plan for that  it s a large machine  so make sure you measure your space before you order the t series  it works great for us in our family room  overall  i m really glad we took the plunge and invited nordictrack back into our home      
745,5.0,                       this was a great purchase  it was assembled quickly and easily  everyone in our family of   uses it  including our   year old  with a spotter   we really like the easy fold stand underneath for storage  the ifit app that pairs via bluetooth is really great and well worth the fee after the free month  i love how it seamlessly changes the settings on the treadmill without having to touch it  because i would have no clue how to build a  proper  work out  it takes the guessing out  it runs very smoothly and is easy on my bad knees  would highly recommend      
746,5.0,                       besides the assembly  let s face it   anything this large is difficult to put together  this has been an amazing experience  deliver showed up on time  box was well put together to be able to find parts  i wish putting the tread to it s up position was more assisted  meaning that i wished it wasn t so heavy the ifit is absolutely awesome  trainer talk to you all the way through your workout  there are also    day programs as well  much different than my last machine that would only turn on and off  great product and customer service as well      
747,1.0,                       highly highly overpriced garbage first of all it says it s portable that is absolutely false but that s not the issue the issue is that i hired someone to assemble it it took him four hours and still the hydraulics or whatever bs we re not going to please so it s too dangerous for me to run on so after spending       it s shakes violently the warranty team upon which i have purchased the   warranty has not helped at all and amazon will not help at all basically i got robbed of all the money i spent on the treadmill which was       plus the four hours of labor to get it up to my sixth floor apartment  i m so very glad that i can work out safely in my own home after working long hours as a researcher is on vaccine trials  thanks nordic track      
748,3.0,                       the treadmill overall seems decent for at home moderate use   i would not buy this if i was a serious runner the numbers of the screws on the instructions were different than what the screws were labeled  so trying to figure it out added at least    minutes to the assembly  which you need   people for lastly  the reviews about ifit are correct   there is a label that says that your treadmill is locked and you need to activate it at ifit com  but that is not true   all you need to do is press and hold the ifit button and the treadmill starts up  i read that you can do this in another review so i purchased this item  but  i find this labeling to be misleading hopefully the treadmill lasts      
749,3.0,                       updateicon updated the software to allow manual use of the treadmill so i have increased the stars from one to three while i am still concerned by the actions noted below  i have increased the stars since that issue was resolved   i had a previous nordictrack treadmill for almost ten years  it felt sturdy and while it did need a couple of repairs over the years i would give that previous model     stars   our new t     s works  but feels less sturdy and less well made    a number of the pieces do not cleanly fit together  we had to have the belt replaced a couple of months after we received the treadmill  and there is a squeak from the deck when we run even after the service to replace the belt    we paid for setup with the treadmill  so these are not due to us improperly setting up the treadmill    overall the t     s is ok  but does not feel like the same quality as our previous nordictrack       original submission      i purchased the treadmill in september      after confirming that i was not required to sign up for the ifit service  as we prefer to just use the manual settings   for the past nine months we have been able to use the treadmill in manual mode  skipping the ifit logon  it took a few extra steps and some delays to get out of the ifit sign on screens each time  but it could be done    this morning the screen looked different and would not let us use the treadmill   i submitted a support request on their website and eventually received an email informing me that i am required to create and ifit account to use the treadmill that the company can simply prevent us from using our treadmill until we provide them with additional personal information is very concerning since it has been nine months since i purchased the treadmill i cannot even return it to amazon for a refund   i am following up with the company and hope they will fit the issue  but given this deceptive and unethical behavior i recommend looking for a different brand      
750,5.0,                       okay    this is a solid treadmill  i love it so far    it has an auto incline and loud speakers     you can totally override the ifit activation and use the treadmill without it  the build part was a little tough      people are suggested  this machine is heavy  i think it weighs around    lbs but it is still compact compared to other treads  when building the tread  the grounding screw provided was the wrong width and screwing in the console bar was a little tough without the use of a drill  even though it suggests not to use one   the bluetooth function only works through the ifit app but you can still connect your phone and listen to music via the aux connection  it is pretty quiet and no squeaking like other reviews   so far so good    i am very pleased and the delivery via prime was super smooth and fast      
751,5.0,                       i was a bit nervous buying what seems  by price  to be a lower end treadmill   i m    lbs and between my wife and i  we like to run  but running outdoors can be challenging in va so we decided to enter at the lower price point   we couldn t be happier with our purchase and are easily putting       miles a week on our nordictrack t    s   the thing was delivered on time  actually a day early  i believe  and was pretty simple to put together   the box and base are heavy and awkward   definitely a   person job   directions were easy to follow an everything was in perfect shape coming out of the packages really enjoyed the ifit trial we recieved with our purchase  but we haven t renewed   there are enough workouts built into this treadmill that i can simply use them while watching a show on my     tablet that fits nicely on the control  shelf    i ve even set my open laptop on it  but it covers the controls completely regarding the  ride  of the treadmill   very impressed   it s really smooth with no jerky motions like i ve experienced on some older gym systems   it s not a quiet machine  but probably similar to any other   when done  the treadmill folds up very easily to give you a bit more room and keep cats and dogs from walking over it overall  very happy with nordictrack  recommend that they provide some basic maintenance tips with assembly instructions  but found them easily enough online      
752,5.0,                       i ve owned this for a little bit now   it s done it s purpose thus far   it took a bit to put it together by myself but it is not something you need two people even though it s recommended   directions are pretty straight forward and easy to read using the treadmill i opted to use ifit just because i think it s a fantastic program with oodles of resources and trainers i recommend tommy rivs puzey  iberian portugal  to start running   i only wish i would have gotten the bigger screen instead of the    because some of the runs i have been on are just beautiful in location and a bigger screen would immerse you more   it s still suits and i m ok with the smaller screen   the cushion adjustments are fantastic and you can tell the difference while running from soft or hard   it s super quiet and out of the last   treadmills i have owned  i am very pleased with this product and highly recommend      
753,3.0,                       this was a pandemic purchase  overall satisfied with the operation of the treadmill  beware that installation can be tricky and you will need a  nd person to help you assemble it  i was able to select my delivery time for the treadmill  they came on time and place it in the room where i would be assembling the treadmill  the treadmill is huge    it takes up     of a small office  once assembled operation was easy  i skipped the ifit membership setup  you don t need it to enjoy the treadmill  the treadmill is very quiet compared to other models i ve purchased in the past  it s also very stable if you decide to run at top speed  my only gripe is with the sheer size of the treadmill and installation      
754,5.0,                       i have had this t series treadmill for about   weeks   i am really enjoying that i can workout when my   year old is playing or after all the kids go to bed  i signed up for the ifit website online only to find out that it s a scam and cancel it  the treadmill doesn t have a screen that works for ifit  overall after some belt tweaks this is exactly what were looking for   we live in michigan and with the winter fastly approaching i wanted to keep active without spending alot of   but still getting a quality product that didn t have an itty bitty belt since im     tall i have a long stride  it also has a     pound limit which is helpful if my father wanted to use this machine   its not as great as what you get at the gym but i wasn t looking for that  overall i would recommend this product      
755,5.0,                       my first treadmill  trying not to fall into the well known track of using the treadmill as a coatrack  and having some success so far  it has the right size for my house  runs quite smoothly  the noise level is low  a must for us with a toddler in the house and sleeps a lot   and the library of the guided runs have plenty to work through  we will see how i feel in another year  but so far so good      
756,4.0,                       this treadmill is a great value for the price   it states that it won t start unless you activate and subscribe to the ifit app but that is false   all you have to do is make sure it s plugged in  the emergency pull plug is attached and hold the ifit button down for a few seconds and it turns right on be mindful that the treadmill comes in a huge box it s heavy and lots of pieces to remove out of the box  make sure you move the box to the room you want it assembled in  it definitely takes two people to put together  it took about   hours for me and a friend to put together over all i m happy with it  runs great and it s a great size      
757,5.0,                       have been using this for about a month and it works well   i use it for running   even though some professional reviews say that the horsepower is not sufficient for running  there is no problem with running if you dont want the ifit subscription just follow the advice of some other reviews  just hold the ifit button down for    seconds  and make sure the key is installed when you do this   after you do that once  you don t have to do it ever again the box it comes in is very large and very heavy   assembly is a royal pain  even if you are handy   some steps require   people   so either pay to have it assembled or be prepared to spend   to   hours on assembly   i assembled it and am happy with the finished product but it was a lot of work to assemble      
758,4.0,                       the treadmill works just fine   it has a large number of settings   both speed and incline that makes it easier to challenge myself   however  there were two problems   you must sign up for ifit in order to initially start the electronic on the machine  and you get one month of ifit free  but it is very very very difficult to get in touch with anyone to stop the ifit monthly charge   the only way we were able to get in touch with them was from the telephone number listed with the ifit charge on our credit card  and when we called  they were extremely rude   i will not buy anything else that has to go through ifit   this pairing is with nordic track  so they are at fault also      
759,3.0,                       the ifit setup is a mess  can t seem to register to activate the code  can t add secondary users on the family membership  and then get an email congratulation me on the first workout  on the plan that i couldn t register    no technical support from ifit to speak of if you want a solid treadmill with some basic workouts  this one will do the job  if you want the enhanced features of ifit  plan to pay for them      
760,4.0,                       it was slightly more complicated assembly than anticipated    needed a helping hand to hold vertical parts in place  and one of the lag screws don t engage treadmill works as intended mostly  but i find that it misses achieving the set incline  half the time e g  ifit or manually set to    and the treadmill attempts to raise incline for a few seconds and stops   it reads as    but i can tell it s clearly not there  almost      this is usually fixed if i brings down the incline manually to   and manually  using   button  to the right setting   kind of annoying  but not a show stopper      
761,4.0,                       i m a fan of norditrack  first time owning one   i will and have recommended buying a treadmill to others who are looking to lose weight or maintain weight loss if unable to go back to the gym  i was so pleased with my    day trial ifit app that i purchased a membership to keep my goal if losing weight going i would give it   stars but   the only advice i will offer  is to get a surge protector  several times it tripped my circuit when connecting to wifi  no sure if others have experienced this issue      
762,5.0,                       this has been a great investment  i have been able to get the exercise i need and walk run though new zealand  scotland and more thanks to the ifit program  would definitely recommend to anyone  i put this together myself   did need someone holding a couple of pieces so it isn t a completely one person job but had no issues figuring it out  may look at other norditrack products in the future      
763,5.0,                       original review very nicely packaged to protect the components during shipping  expect to spend ten minutes or more just unpacking and laying out the components  assembly was straightforward and easy enough though the supplied allen wrench was a bit short handled to make torquing down the bolts easy   you will need a good grip or a small cheater bar to get them tight without a struggle   all of the bolts had locktite applied to them so they aren t going to wiggle loose any time soon  the assembly instructions were very clear   it took me two hours to assemble it  there are a couple of points in the process that will be made easier and safer with two people and that might cut your assembly time the unit powered up easily enough but popped the ground fault outlet in the circuit immediately when the motor started   if you are going to plug this unit into an outlet on a gfi protected circuit you are going to either need to remove the gfi outlet from the circuit or buy an arc filter  the instructions state that the treadmill will perform on a   a circuit  which is a typical lighting circuit  but a   a circuit might prove to be better in the long run so that you aren t popping the circuit breaker every time something else on the circuit turns on while the treadmill is running    like a vacuum cleaner or space heater the motor is relatively quiet and definitely smooth and strong enough to handle a    lb load   the goal being to drop the load down from there  i ve only tried walking on it so far   i m going to have to work my way back up to jogging as i haven t done much of that in years and i ve had surgery on both knees   walking at speeds   or    even without upping the incline  provides a great workout   the incline controls are easy to reach and operate smoothly  the unit is rock solid on our floor   the tread is long enough for jogging  no doubt  the controls are ergonomic and clearly labeled  the screen isn t huge but it is clear and provides all the data i need   the heart rate monitor matches my apple watch exactly so far  so good  couldn t be happier with the quality of this machine for the price that i paid update my wife noticed that the left hand pulse sensor didn t work when she tried it for the very first time    the same day we completed the first review set up the treadmill   the product is registered and i followed a link to customer support on nordictrack s site  i reported that the left pulse sensor didn t work  and that the track was squeaking with every step when my wife sped up the track to jog on it   i received an email reply with a case number and was told that i would be contacted by email or phone with next steps  shortly  bottom line  works fine for me as i m just walking fast  track lube cured the squeaking problem  amazon s customer service did respond and took care of us  thank you amazon      
764,2.0,                       the treadmill itself runs great  smooth  long belt with lots of cushion and i never get shin splints  aches in my feet  or any other pains i ve gotten previously from running but the operating system is horrific  it s some ancient form of android used by neanderthals  everything is slow  even with bluetooth and location services turned off  it saves my workouts half the time  rarely can connect to ifit  and most of the programs run only with an ifit subscription  so you have to pay to use most of the built in programs  and then get to watch them not work at the end of the day  i don t really care about the touch screen and programming  the treadmill itself runs great  and if that s all that matters to you like it does to me  then maybe get it  but if you care at all about your programs  recording your stats  or having a fully functional product that doesn t aggravate you  don t get it      
765,5.0,                       i ll admit  i was very skeptical of this treadmill because of the price and issues i d heard with nordictrack in general  so i ll start from the beginning  i initially ordered this treadmill and the technician assistance in october  the technician discovered damage as he was putting it together  amazon refunded me for everything because they did not have it in stock to replace  days later  the treadmill was in stock again so they sent the replacement  the replacement arrived in the morning and technician in the afternoon  it took maybe    mins for him to complete the set up  he tested it out for me and showed me the workaround for ifit my skepticism was the price compared to quality  i thought me being    lbs would have me feel like i was going to break the equipment  that is not the case  i ve run at the highest speed     mph  and highest incline       and it felt safe and stable  now if you re jumping up and down at     grade you should expect to break the hydraulics  i love this treadmill  it is used at least every other day with no issues      
766,3.0,                       the treadmill is good  the work outs are nice the yearly cost after your   yr membership to ifit is up is         a year l and you have to put in credit card to even begin your workouts  it isnt worth that a year  there are some nice work outs but it is nothing like the virtual reality one  easy set up  very smooth running quiet machine  just expected more from ifit      
767,4.0,                       my teenage kids begged for a treadmill at the start of lockdown and my daughter selected this nordictrack model because she wanted the ifit classes and large screen to watch them on  i was skeptical   i like to run outdoors   but i agreed and a couple of weeks later a truck dropped it off at our house  assembly was a a pain point for sure  but after a trip to the hardware store i managed it  the good part is that the whole household has been using it  even as the weather has warmed up and we can exercise outdoors again  i actually like the steep incline hikes and runs a lot as we live in a fairly flat area  and it s fun to go up mt kilimanjaro or mt baldy with a guide  good buy      
768,5.0,                       i ve never liked treadmills with massive screens that i m forced to stare at  so this one was perfect  my husband and i assembled it together  however it is very heavy and definitely a little difficult to assemble  if you can afford to have a professional do it  i would recommend that  and wish that we had hired someone to do it for us  i say this because the heart rate sensor bar doesn t work very well  and at times it was difficult to figure out which screws to use  it was extremely time consuming and just difficult  aside from assembly  the treadmill works great  we ve both used it for running and walking  if you re ok with not having super fancy tech on a treadmill  then this is a good one to choose  it does a good job of measuring distance  my fitbit is usually recording the same distance or something within a tenth of a mile      
769,5.0,                       i ve only had it for   months but so far so good  it seems like a quality treadmill for the price  larger than i had expected it to be too  which is a good thing  normally a treadmill in this price range would be much smaller  this isn t much smaller than the treadmills at my gym  it did take my husband quite a while to put it together by himself  around   hours but overall it was still a great buy update  it s been    months since i purchased this   it s now making a weird noise  possibly the motor or belt  i m not sure yet  it s still working perfectly fine but i m a little nervous now that it s making a noise  i have put a lot of use into it with quarantine last year but i had hoped it would last much long than this so hopefully it s nothing major      
770,4.0,                       first  it s heavy  it took me  my wife and college student son to lift the belt section upstairs  consider paying extra to have it delivered to the room where it ll be used  second  follow the assembly instructions carefully  you ll need someone to help for a few parts  third  you do need to activate ifit but no credit card is required  however  you can bypass the activation if you look it up online  i did have a problem with the treadmill tripping my gfci circuit breaker  i bought a heavy duty appliance     extension cord to plug into another non gfci outlet  it also holds your clothes nicely over the console when you re too lazy to hang them in the closet          
771,1.0,                       i wish i could tell you about how the product performs however i can t even get passed the assembly process due to the screws that were provided being damaged and unable to fit appropriately in the base  contacted customer service as i purchased the   year warranty and they provided new screws however the screw that was sent was the incorrect one  didn t even match any of the screws that come with the hardware kit provided    contacted customer service again which this time around i encountered very rude sales reps who didn t seem to know about the product or bring up my account info  i finally was transferred for the  th time and was told they will send me a new hardware kit replacing all the screws and tools needed  when i asked for a technician to help service i was told it would depend on their discretion if they can make house services  still waiting for a tech to call    it s been a little over a month and now i cant even return this product        
772,4.0,                       i purchased this treadmill  my family s first  to overcome our over sedentary lifestyle during the corona virus work from home times and in anticipation of reducing outdoor walking during the winter months  the treadmill was particularly attractive vs  the  no name  competition when offered at       off and finding online videos to explain the trivial was to bypass the ifit subscription service  the treadmill is very solid  but amazingly easy to fold up  the control console is basic and cheap components  but so far    weeks of constant use  reliable and functional  the assembly was more complicated than it needed to be because the instructions in the first few steps contained several errors and some improvisation was required   quite frustrating  if not for the assembly issues i would have given this a   star rating      
773,4.0,                       bought the treadmill so that we wouldn t be dependent on the weather and to save our joints  been using it for a little over a month  there are multiple settings on the treadmill to workout without using the ifit app  but they re not very customizable or give you the option to create profiles  which is why i m putting a lower rating than   stars  the only way to personalize it is through the app  which requires a pricey subscription  the other issue is the treadmill is really large even folded up  the pictures make it look really slim but the handles and legs stick out a lot so just be mindful it won t be neatly tucked away  the performance  however is great and i love having this piece of workout equipment at home  especially now that gyms are really not all that safe with covid      
774,4.0,                       i personally am thankful for the people who left reviews saying that you do not need an ifit membership  they re right  but you do need to know how to  google and read help forums  if you are not comfortable doing this  then you will not be able to even use the treadmill unless you provide a credit card to nordictrack the treadmill works fine for me  i do walking  it does what i want from it assembly was mostly easy and clear instructions  you can tell they had to do a lot of re work on the product after it left the assembly line  because there are a lot of instructions that say something like  remove and discard these screws  and use these other ones we supplied   i did about     of the assembly by myself  i needed help when it came to the headboard  i just didn t have a way to balance the headboard while working to attach it  if you can move it on your own  and yes  it is heavy  i mean really heavy  if you don t lift and move    lbs  regularly  don t expect to be able to move it on your own   you should be able to assemble most of it on your own      
775,5.0,                       my nordic t series treadmill was a great investment  especially since the gyms are currently closed in my area because of the pandemic  i use it   days a week  more features than alot of treadmills in some gyms  it is built to last the auto incline is a great feature  just like treadmills at the gym      
776,5.0,                       just got it delivered today  it takes a bit to assemble  but it s not as difficult as i expected  very sturdy  solid treadmill from the first time using  ifit seems to include a ton of different options with all level  and although you have to acclimate to the placement and navigation of the system  it s set up fairly intuitively  the speakers are louder than i expected with pretty good sound via bluetooth  i am     the wife is       and it s large enough for my stride without being too large for her to reach the controls  it is also much more quiet than i expected  if i m going to be super picky  the fan is not very strong  again  that s being picky and not a complaint  off to a great start so far      
777,5.0,                       i am so happy i bought this treadmill  nordictrack has a great reputation and they did not disappoint  assembling the treadmill was not too difficult   directions were easy to follow  the weight is what was difficult to deal with  lifting it out of the box was not easy  but other than that  i had it together fairly fast  the bottom of the treadmill comes intact  all you have to attach is the front legs  arms and console  i was able to do a workout once it was all together  i love the way the treadmill speed and incline will go up or down with the trainer   but you can also choose to do your own pace  i had a blast  not only does ifit offer treadmill workouts  but it does a ton of other workouts  i m looking forward to getting fit      
778,5.0,                       the treadmill was exactly what i was looking for   works with ifit app which allows the speed and incline settings to automatically adjust with the trainer in the app   i use the app on my phone and screen share to a separate tv screen while running treadmill was delivered on time   there was a little assembly but nothing difficult   my wife and i use it almost every day      
779,5.0,                       we paid the extra to have  room delivery   and i m glad we did it is very heavy  my husband and i assembled the treadmill  i can t remember how long it took i d guess     hrs  i was so worried it wouldn t work    assembling the electric panel stuff was intimidating but actually pretty easy  best part   it works    this is the perfect mid grade treadmill  definitely not flimsy  my husband runs     miles     times a week on it and i walk or jog on it     days per week  my husband is about     lbs and i m      so it s proving durable  we have not tried to fold it so i can t speak to that  i would recommend this treadmill to others      
780,5.0,                       you can t find a better treadmill for the price  the assembly is very complicated  it took my husband four hours to put it together  ifit is used to activate it but you do not have to purchase it  you don t even need to enter your credit card on the app  i m not crazy over the ifit app for a few reasons  it s far too focused on the trainer and workout and not on the location  feel and experience  you are really paying to workout with the trainer  which means you would be following his pace  incline and time  thus  should you want to slow down  you have to manually do so the machine itself is great  i m addicted to it  the folding mechanism isn t great but it works well enough  it s not huge  so it s not in the way really anyway  there are ten incline levels to the left and ten speeds to the right  despite it s size  it is very sturdy  me and my husband are pretty stout individuals and it stays put as you run  i ve tested it up to the   speed and it holds together well  for some reason  i do feel like it is a bit faster than the time speed marks  for example  in the gym i can typically do   miles in    minutes if i start at     and increase in two minute increments  on this machine i had to start off at      with the same increase increments and i barely finish   miles in    minutes  either way  it s a really good workout this treadmill is a very worthy investment during covid    and i suggest it for anyone      
781,5.0,                       i love my nordictrack    si  it has great screen quality for my ifit workouts  its smooth and i love the impact reduction  i used to walk    min miles and now i do    min in just   months  i love the ifit and it makes a huge difference  it seems really good quality and i use it everyday  with covid i needed a workout from home  this is my first treadmill and i am very happy  the    incline is high enough and i ve only made it up to  mph but i m sure it can handle         
782,4.0,                       i m           pounds and this treadmill works very well for me  it has basic functions but i use the manual mode mostly anyway  no fan     which is a bummer  the reason i gave it   stars is because it s difficult to move the treadmill when i want to store it upright   it has   small wheels on the distal part of the rear support that frankly do nothing  to get the treadmill to move it leaves marks from the front end all over my flooring  i ve tried those mover cups underneath the front but to no avail  anyway  i di like the treadmill so far for what i need it for      
783,5.0,                       this treadmill has proven perfect for the entire family  mom  dad  and   teens  it came quickly from amazon and was delivered on time via amazon freight   assembly was straight forward and took approx   mins from start the treadmill is sturdy for walking  hiking and running  and has plenty of incline    deg  and speed for everyone the best part  however  is the ifit   i was a little dubious at first  but these workouts have proven a favorite not only for our family  but for out of town guests and family as well   it is simply amazing that you can hike the scottish highlands or run the boston marathon in the comfort of your home   additionally  the machine keeps track of all your workouts so you can compare past performance in sum   we are all very pleased with the nordictrack   highly recommended      
784,5.0,                       day to day use is perfect   fantastic treadmill   the only negative is the assembly   it is not too bad but some bolts feel too tight after starting them   they almost felt cross threaded but were not   it took my wife  daughter  and me about   hrs   you must carefully read the directions because there are screw numbers and step numbers on the screw package   the deck is completely assembled which is great   be sure to adjust the tracking per instructions   to unlock from ifit without signing up  hold in the ifit button    seconds   worked for me   some say to press ifit on the screen  but this treadmill is not a touch screen   well worth the price      
785,5.0,                       bought this treadmill for casual running and exercising  my kids love it as well  my oldest    yo  runs on it to keep in shape for soccer season  if you are handy you can assemble it alone but i would recommend two people for a much easier assembly  after much research i found this one to be the best value for the money spent  there are a lot of options but i didn t want to spend     for a treadmill but i also didn t want to get something very cheap that may break easily  so far so good         
786,4.0,                       this has nothing to do with the product    if you want this product be sure you want it    it will take weeks for you to get your money back    we are in our  rd week and   calls to amazon telling us to wait a few more weeks   a few more weeks foe what   while the charge sits on your card and you get charged interest fees   yes   that is what is happening  again make sure you really want this product     
787,5.0,                       i received this a few days ago   my  husband set it up for me and only took about an hour in a half   after using it for the first time i loved it   i work out   days a week but when it s raining i can t go out  this is exactly what i needed to not miss a work out day    easy  on my knees  incline is great  speed is perfect   if you are thinking about getting this you won t regret it   it s a great investment if you are committed i don t need or will i be using the ifit  get free videos on you tube  so this doesn t affect my purchase   and yes you can bypass the set up   press and hold the ifit button until the machine starts right up  enjoy  i know i am        
788,2.0,                       this is my first big purchase on amazon and was a little hesitant after reading some reviews  however  i gave it a chance  the treadmill was delivered timely  kuddos  assembly was included and the technician did a fine job  upon assembly  it was discovered that the digital display is damaged from within  the treadmill motor and everything works so it s still usable  my low rating is for    being delivered a damaged product and    amazon customer service  i ve been bounced around and spoken to several different departments and representatives  each telling me different information about how to resolve my broken digital display  initially  i chose a full refund which would require another technician to come out and disassemble the treadmill and pack it up  then i would need to schedule a pick up time  all before receiving a refund and interest keeps on accruing on my credit card  yes i m aware i could pay cash but i like my amazon points  after much thought  i decided to have the broken display swapped out since everything else seems fine  simple process right  ha  i asked the amazon rep what the process was three different times and he brushed me off stating  please hold while i call the manufacturer  and finally i pointed out to him that i ve asked the same question three times and he s not answering it  i m fine if someone doesn t know the answer   it really is okay but find someone who does  don t just steamroll the customer who is trying to understand the process in hopes that they will give up asking  really      i m told that i will receive a call to talk about my options tomorrow  when i asked about the options  they were different than the other three amazon reps told me prior  how frustrating for the customer and i ve been super patient thru this process  if you only knew all the different things i ve been told in such a short period of time  you would be super confused too  do i think i m really getting a call tomorrow to talk options  nope  i m pretty sure i ll need to call amazon customer service again and go over everything again especially since the  notes  they are reading are selectively including only bits and pieces of the conversation  would i order a large item from amazon again  nope  i should ve gone with my instinct but i ll try anything once  my suggestion to amazon  in situations such as this  do not put the burden on your customer to fix the problem  as i stated to the amazon reps  i paid for a fully functioning treadmill  not a damaged one so the burden should not fall on the customer to fix it  cross train the different departments so they are educated and empowered to respond to customer issues  rather than bounce your customer to multiple departments  there is a breakdown in knowledge  skills  and communication within amazon s customer service department   easily fixed  for now  i guess i m waiting for a call        
789,5.0,                       with gyms closed due to the pandemic  and the weather less hospitable to outdoor activities  our family decided to bite the bullet and get a treadmill for our basement  so glad we went with this model  its sturdy frame  pared down screen and incline features are exactly the experience we were looking for  and at a very reasonable price  not a day goes by without one of us on the machine  note  and this is impoirtant    you do not have to register with ifit    luckily i followed the instructions of a previous purchaser  push the ifit button for    seconds to skip the ifit registration process and start using the treadmill immediately   the ifit registration is a feature that will lock you into a membership  and it s not clear anywhere in the paperwork you get that you can bypass this registration  they ask for a credit card and you are locked into a several month contract   other than that irritating ifit scam  the treadmill is a dream       
790,5.0,                       i ve been frustrated during covid because i don t trust the gym and the temperature  here in southern nevada  has been over     every day since june  now i can walk all over the world with a trainer and the time passes quickly  easy software setup  plenty of places to store thing  water  towel  ipad  used service to assemble  i don t usually fold it as i have room in my garage to leave it open  but the one time i tried  it was not easy      
791,5.0,                       i live in the boondocks and when the treadmill arrived the packaging was in rough shape  after assembly  the treadmill would not run  i called the service number and the technician helped me troubleshoot the problem over the phone  she had the necessary parts fedex d to me and also offered an extended warranty at reduced cost  once the new parts were installed it runs like a champ  i waited a few months to write a review to verify all was well   it is a smooth running machine and i enjoy it much more than my previous not nordictrack treadmill      
792,4.0,                         the carton is very heavy so have the delivery folks place the carton in the room where it will be located  assembly is easy but really is a two person job  no need to subscribe to ifit to activate the treadmill  hold the ifit button down until the screen clears  bluetooth works with ifit only  fit  finish and controls are excellent  relatively quiet and easy to operate in manual of one of    routines  heart monitor not always accurate  while gripping the monitor handles  great walking running tread     speeds and inclines  will need a phillips screwdriver and            inch wrenches or sockets for assemblyvery happy with the machine      
793,5.0,                       my local gym has been closed since february due to the covid    pandemic and i ve been working from home since mid march  assembly was done by my brother since amazon is not currently offering the service  he said it wasn t hard to do  he s a carpenter so putting things together comes easy for him  this machine is helping me to keep moving especially in the daytime  the speed is ok   actually faster than the treadmills at my local gym  was not too keen on ifit at first after reading the reviews from people who felt pressured into using it to start up the treadmill  i m starting to like it and may sign for the subscription after the   month trial ends      
794,5.0,                       i absolutely love the treadmill  easy to operate  has so many programs  is bluetooth compatible  even is able to be adjusted so the walk or run is soft or hard   who would have thought    and to be honest  i am still learning about it   it has a lip for my tablet   it works with programs or manually   i have not had any issues and was surprised to read some of the poor reviews because the things they said were incongrous with how any treadmill works i love it i didn t rate assembly because the seller offered a terrific price on having someone to come out and assemble the machine   he was professional  on time and it took less than an hour   i also purchased the maintenance agreement from nordictrack      
795,1.0,                       buggy android software and underpowered chipset defies the purpose of buying this otherwise decent treadmill  hire experienced programmers engineers and develop a system that works  or just invest in your datacenter that can handle traffic requests from treadmills instead of blaming people s wi fi routers      
796,4.0,                       so as you see in this photo is the sign that was on my treadmill  this is a total scam  simply hold in the ifit button for    seconds and it will work  great treadmill mechanically and has no issues  i just question nordictrack s ethics      
797,5.0,                       so far so good  my husband is great with putting things together so this wasn t too hard for him to do alone  the box was very heavy so the both of us had to bring it inside once it was set up i registered the warranty and i saw i had to use ifit to start the machine  thankfully after all the review reading i realizes another helpful review mentioned how to bypass that  so if you don t want ifit and don t even want to be bothered with the    day free trial  hold down the bluetooth button until the machine beeps and basically it ll bring you to the start of using the treadmill i ve only used it twice and i like it so far  can t complain about anything      
798,3.0,                       i was disappointed in the quality of this treadmill  i bought this one to replace an older more expensive norditrack treadmill that was very old  i can definitely tell this difference in the cheaper model not just in features  but in the smoothness of how it runs when you walk  if you can afford the next series up  i would definitely suggest purchasing that      
799,3.0,                       treadmill works  but the settings are all off  in english mode  the speeds act as though they are in metric mode and vice versa  i spent over an hour on the phone with customer support and they told me that there is nothing wrong with the treadmill and the issue is that i just  feel  like the speeds are off  i have used a lot of treadmills  i still belong to a gym  for now  and use the treadmills there  and i know my running speed  i run  a lot    the issue is that support s tests only test the display on the screen  but the issue i am experiencing is a disconnect between the displayed speed on the screen and the actual speed of the belt  i am quite irritated that they are not trying to fix the issue and basically blaming it on me   i mean  i  can  use on the treadmill and get to a running speed  but the displayed mph is so off that i have to guess what my speed needs to be on this machine  i have never had this  guessing  issue on any other treadmill      
800,5.0,                       this has done everything i wanted   prior to purchasing this  i was going to the gym  but with covid  and the cold weather decided to get this for my personal use at home and it has not disappointed   the belt does tend to slip to the left after a bit  but my husband has been able to center it without problem   have recommended this to others and a friend has also purchase it   if you get it when it s sold and shipped through amazon  the price is really good      
801,5.0,                       i like this product because is it very comfortable to run and it is up to date with technology  it uses wifi and it has touch screen  something i dislike is very minimum  but it is the fact that i have to create an account with ifit in order to use all the beautiful scenery on the screen  i use this product to run and work out at home every single day  it is one of the best investments i have done so far      
802,5.0,                       love this treadmill  works great for speed and elevation  has tons of pre set workouts but i generally just manually adjust to custom fit my runs  the ifit subscription can be bypassed by holding the ifit icon for       seconds immediately after the first power on  otherwise they ll con you into a subscription  this is shady and underhanded but from what i ve learned most all exercise equipment like this is in cahoots with ifit  come at me  illuminati   construction took a little while so be patient and follow the plans exactly  especially the part where it tells you not to torque down the bolts until later  and you ll be happy with the outcome  haven t gone through every mode or all the functions but i love this thing      
803,5.0,                       great value  great unit  we ve been using this treadmill everyday since it arrived two months ago  not a single issue to report  unit is well built  it s sturdy  good materials quality and rather easy to assemble  the  folding  feature should actually be called  partial folding   the track belt conveyor lifts up approx  four feet from the floor at a     angle both my wife and i were a bit reluctant to subscribe to ifit at first   not a requirement  however after the first few days we both realized that it s actually a great tool  makes boring work outs vastly more interesting and also serves as a great motivator  we mounted an ipad air   to the treadmill use that to interface with the ifit training app features  worth the        monthly fee great machine and great value      
804,5.0,                       bought this in january and so far so good  me and my daughter getting good use of it  i wouldn t say it s hard to assemble  but it did take my husband with some help from me at times at least     hours to assemble it  lots of parts and it s quite heavy too      
805,1.0,                       after    months of moderate use  our treadmill belt developed a tear  expecting to be out of warranty for covering labor  i contacted nordictrack to have them send me a replacement belt under the   year parts warranty terms  they refuse to honor the terms listed on amazon from their last reply  we honor the warranty information that is in the manual not on the amazon website  if you wish to have someone come for maintenance on your machine  the cost of the first visit would be       if additional parts are needed after this visit you will need to pay for them  then pay an additional     for the technician to come back and install the parts  if the information presented at the point of sale is wrong  correct it  by not correcting it  you are intentionally misleading customers  with lots of options in the exercise equipment market  i will not be purchasing nordictrack or related products in the future  fine machine  shameful customer service and support      
806,4.0,                       there are several huge signs in the box  stating that you must register with ifit in order for the treadmill to work  and they want your credit card info but thanks to a few helpful reviews  i was able to bypass the ifit section and use treadmill as normal otherwise it is an amazing treadmill  feels as sturdy as the gym treadmills      
807,5.0,                       this treadmill is awesome  i was going to buy the assembly service but then decided to try it myself first  i was able to assemble the treadmill in about   min  i was pleasantly surprised by the size of the running surface as it s full size like what i have at my local gym  also the hydraulic lift drop is super cool as it is very easy to lift and even more easy when it lowers my treadmill for me  also  the amazon delivery was great and then brought the treadmill into my house for me  all in all  very happy with my treadmill and the service provided      
808,4.0,                       the treadmill is exactly what we were looking for   love that the incline goes to    as well as the speed  works seamlessly with the ifit app  and you also don t have to use the program  it took two people to assemble and a few hours  but we anticipated that  it arrived with damage to the hood  but nordictrack was easy to work with and sent us a replacement hood within a few days   our only constructive feedback is  my husband is   foot two and wished the handles were longer so his feet don t hit the front   we are very satisfied with our purchase and use it daily      
809,4.0,                       we were looking for a basic treadmill and this one is perfect  i was able to assemble it without any issues  even without all the added features of other models  the t series does the job  the shelf provides ample room for an ipad  we love the extra large beverage holders on each side and the control buttons are big enough to easily use during a workout      
810,1.0,                       i received the treadmill on august   and after i assembled it i realize that the incline motor wasn t working and there was a plastic cover damaged  after many e mails and phone calls with icon fitness and almost a month later i received the incline motor replacement with one sheet instructions  i had to install the motor by myself and wasn t easy to do it because of the poor instructions  but i did it  the inclination is working good now but there is a loud sound when goes up and down  i sent a new email to iconfitness com reporting this issue and requesting a technician to solve the problem  and i  didn t have any answer  finally i did a claim to amazon     
811,4.0,                       firstly  this seems like a good  solid  smooth working machine   i was able to put it together by myself  although having a helper would have been nice at a few points  in an hour or so   love the pneumatic track lift the annoyances started upon opening the box to find an attached sheet  picture shown  that says the treadmill is locked and will not start until you activate at ifit com  which of course requires you subscribe to their services   they offer a free month  but of course you have to give them your credit card anyway   in my opinion  that s really bad after i spent      to purchase it   that s my main beef  but there are a few minor things that i think they could have and should have done   a usb power outlet to keep your cell phone charged  allowing your cell phone to output audio through the treadmill speakers via bluetooth  it connects to it with bluetooth anyway  why not allow audio as well    a separate volume control for the beeps and the audio  if connected via cable    if you have your music playing pretty loudly the beeps are just ear piercing   also  i used to have an older nordictrack treadmill that allowed you to select a pre programmed track  but then also use the up and down keys to adjust the overall speed of that track  it was great because you could dial it in to exactly the workout you wanted   that feature no longer exists  you re just stuck with the pre programmed tracks period    and none of them are geared towards a nice relaxing stroll  they are all aimed at people who are already in reasonably good shape and want a good brisk workout   if you are an elderly person who decided he she better get back in shape or someone who s doctor told him her to lose some pounds and get in shape or else  you will have to stick with the manual mode  at least for a while      
812,5.0,                       i am so happy i bought this  i have a smartphone  so i didn t really need the treadmill with the built in screen  though i can see how that would be nice   the ifit membership i thought would be superfluous is probably one of my favorite things about this treadmill  i love being able to select the workouts and the interactive platform   app   will prob continue to use once my free trial is up lol   my husband likes using the preprogrammed setups and is very happy with them too so if your deadset on not using ifit  it s got you covered  sound system is decent  treadmill is quiet ish   i mean   your running indoors      half the time we can t even hear it from the other room  setup was intimidating  but once i started it was pretty easy and i was able to finish it within a couple of hours  used   kids to hold pieces in place at times  but other then that did it solo   yes  would happily buy it again  absolutely  very happy  it is making quarantine bearable        
813,1.0,                       don t get this system  they have horrible customer service  my treadmill stopped working after a year  light use   this product is supposed to have a   yr warranty  but beware  nothing will be replaced unless you spend      to call out a technician  now  the technician arrived  gave a wrong diagnosis  i had to shell out another s   load of money to get a control board  which was bad according to the tech   the new board arrived after three weeks  i swapped it out with the  faulty one  and guess what  the same issue persists  the system does not work  so  all that money is down the drain  i ll be reaching out to my credit card company to challenge all these charges  please stay away         
814,5.0,                       the reviews on this treadmill really made it hard to buy  it was a little difficult to put together but now i have had it a week and absolutely love it  it does not make any noises that it shouldn t and works perfectly  my husband and and i work out on it daily and are completely satisfied with our purchase  don t be afraid to take a chance on a good deal      
815,3.0,                       loved the huge variety of runs  walks  hikes etc   always different   sometimes they talk to much  however     for example  during a  k run  the trainer was constantly talking and as a result the camera was always on her   never saw much of the halloween race   would have loved to see the costumes     another example    sometimes  in a run  the trainer again never stops talking and is always in front   no one wants to continually watch someones behind while running   customer service is atrocious   emails  calls    never seem to work   machine was bent and they sent a part to fix but that was it   no instructions  no follow up   if if comes to you wrong  i shouldn t have the responsibility to fix it   they should send a repair person   always nice on the phone  but never any followup     terrible customer service   finally gave up   machine works but is unstable when cranked up and at high speeds but works for an old man like me at my lower speeds      
816,5.0,                          great price   check   amazon  choose your room  delivery   check   in home assembly   check  the pro they sent was very knowledgeable  and said he is setting up a lot of treadmills of this model  and never seen a damaged package  sometimes not all parts are there  but typically he hadn t experienced any problems    ifit bypass   check  just press    seconds on ifit button and the treadmill is ready to go    noise level   check  as any treadmill there is a motor noise  but i can t say the treadmill is noisy   the noise level is very reasonable it s been just several days  so if anything changes i ll update this review      
817,3.0,                       everything was fine for the first couple of weeks  it took about   hours to assemble and its very heavy  but it worked great up until the  rd week  it stopped working  i called nordic and they sent replacement wires and contol board  they didnt help with replacing these  i had to do it on my own  they said it was eash and there are youtube videos i could watch for it  it was not as easy as they said and one of the screws was stripped  not my doing  i dont use power tools and this screw was already screwed in upon arrival  so i had to buy other tools just to get this screw out  it was a very frustrating process  i wish they could have fixed the issue for me especially because i only had it for   weeks      
818,5.0,                       when assembling  be very attentive to where the wiring cable should be located  it must not run on top of the half round bracket that holds the console hand rail assembly because that sits on top of the bracket and will squish the wiring cable  once connected the wiring cable is very difficult do disconnect  especially when the console has to be held aloft by a  nd person while you re disconnecting and re positioning the wiring cable  otherwise  assembly was straightforward  i did need to move the treadmill belt a bit to the left because it was rubbing along one edge  it s a solid  well functioning unit  although it has several pre programmed routines  i prefer the manual option  i recommend this item      
819,5.0,                       the screen size     in  is perfect and the picture is crystal clear   i worried about both of these before buying  but i was blown away by the screen s clarity  also  ifit has been great and a few updates have made it even better   you re able to choose a ton of workouts  walking  running  hiking  hiit  etc   from various trainers  choosing to run without an ifit trainer is also a great option   the bluetooth speakers are decent quality and pretty loud and i usually either listen to music  which you can also play in the background of your ifit workout  or put my tablet on the console and watch something using the machine s speakers the treadmill itself is pretty quiet compared to an old nordictrack i had and it feels a lot sturdier   no shaking or rattling around  the only complaint is perhaps my own fault as i opted to assemble it myself   there were only a few really difficult steps but the right side of the console is not as seamless as the left side  which is only slightly ascetically annoying overall  this treadmill has made early morning runs a lot easier and a lot more fun      
820,5.0,                       this is an affordable treadmill that works great to workout at home  i use it in my garage  i am     lb and i have no issues sprinting in it  it is very sturdy and stylish  the only thing that i would change to make it perfect is to place the on off button in the actual display area  however  everything else is great  the display is very nice and it even has speakers built in  overall  this is probably one of the best treadmills that you are going to find at this price range   great value for the money  as far as the assembly goes  it wasn t too bad  i do recommend having a second person to help out with it  it makes it a lot easier and faster than if you do it on your own      
821,5.0,                       it is a great treadmill  very sturdy  the assembly part is a fun part  it took my husband   hours to assemble and get ready to use  but it is worth  i saw some comments about ifit activation  if you want to skip activation part  just put the red button to the middle of handle first  and then tear off the ifit sticker from the screen and hit and hold the ifit button a few seconds  it is ready to use without activation through ifit      
822,5.0,                       this treadmill is great for walking and jogging  my  race pace  is   to    minute miles  so this is really all the treadmill i need assembly was a little finicky  i had to contact nordic trac service about a faulty screw  i received a replacement in about    days  total assembly took me maybe an hour  i watched a youtube video which helped i ve been using the treadmill about     times weekly since january and it is still performing well  it was noisy for a couple days and suddenly quieter back down  i assume this was the belt rubbing a bit overall i m happy with my purchase  for less than a year s gym membership i can run at home to my heart s content      
823,4.0,                       i previously had the lifespan treadmill which i loved and ran on until it literally died under my feet after    years  thought i would try something new  as nordictrak has such a good rep  i really like this treadmill  works well  quick speed up and down and same with incline  something my prior one was a bit slow about my biggest problem is with the preset programs  my lifespan had in the manual what each preset looked like including speeds and heights based on level  none of these have a way to view the whole rundown  if you go to a preset and wait  after a few seconds the bottom of the screen will list a speed and incline but is that for the first interval  the hardest interval or what   and how come none are speed only or incline only  they all seem to be a combination of both  something i don t always want  i also can t make a customized program as i could with my own treadmill  this is my main complaint but otherwise i am happy with the quality of this treadmill      
824,1.0,                        update  needed to order a new control board  free through the warranty but i have to install it myself  customer service was easy to work with and helpful in running tests to see exactly what the issue was  i used the chat option through the website  whole thing took maybe    minutes  will update again after i get the new part control panel turned on for about    seconds and now won t turn on at all  currently waiting for nordictrack support to call me assembly was easy enough  took me about  hour to assemble by myself requested specific time frame for    pm   weeks in advance based on my availability  received an email the night before that my time frame was changed to    am  woke up at     am to ensure i didn t miss them  they showed up at       i did not get a    minute heads up call as stated i would  i received a text   minutes before they showed up  delivery guys were amazing and very nice though so that helped  just be prepared for time frames to change last minute      
825,4.0,                       background  avg runner that recently finished my first marathon  probably running       miles per week now with the majority of them being outside  i use the treadmill to sneak in a few miles while being somewhat accessible to family  i have not really tested the full functionality of this treadmill as i am currently doing low heart rate training so  not going faster than speed   first impression  good  i paid for someone to assemble it so no comment on that part  i actually have it in my garage  it looks nice  doesn t take up a ton of space  ok screen size  stop button doesn t work   that is really the only issue for me  i end up just pulling out the safety stop every time    a bit annoying for a        treadmill  everything else seem to work well so i m just rolling with it rather than dealing with customer service  part swapping  delays  and no treadmill pros  gets the job done  space saving  nice button lay outcons  small screen size   screen is vertically low meaning if you practice good running form who will not be able to look at the screen unless you are under  ft  stop button doesn t work  speakers could be louder     
826,3.0,                       solid hardware  cushioning keeps noise level down and motor runs smooth  online registration with ifit to activate the treadmill is actually not required  the treadmill is not an internet connected device  so it cannot check some database to see if you it has been registered online  you can easily bypass the initial activation required screen  when first turning on the treadmill  just hold down ifit button on console until the normal user interface appears  the treadmill is should then be completely usable assembly was straightforward enough  but it definitely goes smoother with at least   people  required screws  washers and hex keys were provided and were sealed and labeled nicely  be careful not to lose or strip any as no extras are provided  the only other tools you ll need that are not included are a larger bit size phillips head screw driver and an adjustable wrench  some screws  particularly those that secure the arm handles  will require a good amount of force to drive all the way in  just be careful to not strip the screws in the process my unit s incline functionality seems to be dead or malfunctioning out of the box  setting the incline value on the console does not do anything  incline motor does not even make a noise to indicate a jam or broken motor  no matter what value is set  the console just sets it to max value     but the incline motor does not do anything  incline is just stuck at minimum value  parallel to ground   i suspect this may be an issue with the onboard computer or internal wiring not communicating with the incline motor not a big deal for me since i prefer training without incline  but this kind of issue would be a serious headache for someone who makes heavy use of incline  this issue and the scammy ifit software is the only reason why i would not give this treadmill a   or        
827,5.0,                       bought this in may  it s now december and it has already stopped working      
828,4.0,                       so far so good  the box is of course extremely heavy  i have upstairs in exercise room  i assembled myself took my time and watched assembly video on youtube  pressed down if it button to get around the subscription   other features are minimal without ifit  but you can run manual  so far   days use every day    min walk run no problems haven t tried the incline feature yet   big unit suggest in a room all by itself       
829,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  i played softball for    years and have two bad knees  i needed a treadmill that has endless support and did not break the bank   i am a teacher   i avidly workout every day  with quarantine starting   months ago  this has been my favorite purchase  my knees cannot handle everyday pavement running so this treadmill has saved my life  and knees   i have already recommended it to numerous people  great investment  also  the ifit free trial is amazing  i love it and how it motivates me to run such great distances  i love traveling via this treadmill  it took me a few hours and one other person to assemble but was worth every penny      
830,5.0,                       my treadmill came today   the box was beat up but my treadmill inside was not  i easily put it together   was running within   hour  holding down the ifit bluetooth button bypassed that whole mess   i was able to use my treadmill without joining that required idiotic membership that i have no use for  overall i am happy   just had a decent run  if anything changes i ll change my review but today i am happy      
831,5.0,                       i am always very hesitent about ordering such large items from amazon   the product was shipped very well and was packaged very well   everything was in tip top shape   i was able to put almost the entire thing together by myself until one of the last steps for the piece that holds the treadmill up for storage   this treadmill is very sturdy and comfortable to run on   i am currently using the    day free trial of ifit live   being able to run a long with trainers at foreign destinations is pretty cool   i was also able to make a google maps trail close to home that showed street view l images as you ran around the neighborhood   i am very happy with this product and would recommend it to a friend      
832,5.0,                       when i received this treadmill it was really heavy  it did have damage on the box like others have mentioned but it s packaged so well there was nothing wrong with anything inside  one person was trying to lug this box out of his van so i feel like the outside of it getting damaged is a given  my husband and myself put it together  simple precise directions  easy to understand  i have used this treadmill twice a day since i purchased it  i am so glad i bought it because of the mixed reviews i was nervous to spend the money  it s not any louder then a treadmill at the gym  sturdy  well built  it s not a scam when you go to active your treadmill you just decline to put your credit card on file for the ifit  you still get the    day trial  which i think is kind of cool   money well spent  i never write reviews but i read so many to make this choice on this specific treadmill i thought it was only fair  well worth the money since the next listed treadmill is           
833,5.0,                       good  sturdy treadmill  and great value for the money  but the manual is useless  spends more time telling you how to put it together than using it  and there is almost nothing in it about all the features this unit has   one other thing  the display constantly cycles between time on the treadmill and distance   i really don t give a flip about how long i m on it  and i m sure there are other people who just want the time   since i change elevations at specific distances or quit with the same parameters  it find this irritating motor went to boot hill about two years after i bought it  started making a loud rattling noise which became progressively worse   no way to lubricate it  sealed unit   called nordictrack for replacement and was told that they would send out a tech for about      to replace it for me   told the girl on the phone  she was nice  that an idiot could replace the motor  it s only four wires and two bolts  and in fact i had already removed the motor to verify that it was the part making the noise   so they sent me the part  i installed it  and now i m able to work out each morning without ear protection and a fire extinguisher handy      
834,1.0,                       we purchased this treadmill and loved everything about except for a strange issue that has made it unusable and dangerous  it randomly speeds up from a lower speed to a much higher speed without warning  we contacted the manufacturer and they sent a replacement controller board which took a month and a half to get and still did not solve the problem  working on a return    will update with results      
835,4.0,                       bought this while stuck in the house thanks covid   and have used it nearly everyday for a few months   i love it and it does the trick   i had the ifit app  which is pretty cool as it automatically will adjust your treadmill to the speed and incline without having to stop and do it manually   i cancelled that subscription though because i didn t use it like i thought i would   my husband hated putting it together and things didn t go together smoothly but now it s together and will come as part of the house when we sell someday haha   i love it and like i said  use to at least  x a week   and i also love that it s not a tiny treadmill but a decent size      
836,5.0,                       i was able to put this together in very little time with just a little help at the end   very simple instructions   i use it every morning and so far after       months it s been great   just fast paced walking for now but will get up to running soon   the cup holders are nice and big and hold a big water bottle  phone  channel changer    just a little noise from belt running but not loud like some reviews i had read   over all i m completely satisfied with this product      
837,4.0,                       the delivery process was a fiasco   i don t know if the problem came from amazon or ups   after waiting three weeks  the product came with damage   it looked like it had lost a battle with a forklift   the carton had     punctures  the walking belt was slightly torn  and three of four screw receptacles for the motor hood were broken   i discussed the situation with an amazon representative  who wanted me to repack it and ship it back and wait another three weeks for a replacement   finally he offered a substantial discount  so i decided to keep the machine  contingent upon proper performance    my son and i got it assembled  which took a couple of hours   and it worked after i discovered i could activate it simply by pressing the ifit button on the console   after three weeks of use  the incline sensor failed  but a replacement was shipped within a few days   installation was very easy   the treadmill has been working well since then      
838,4.0,                       this is a really great treadmill  it s easy to use  as far as buttons and what they do  and i love that it is so easy to fold  my dad put the treadmill together  so i don t know first hand how easy it was putting together but he said it wasn t too bad  the only thing i don t like is that the arm rails are really low for me  as a woman who is      i have to sort of hunch over to hold on  but  i m sure it s perfect for people off average height  and hopefully eventually  i went need to hold on  after i get over my fear of flying off the back  lol     
839,5.0,                       a life saver during pandemic times  literally pretty straight forward use  the belt slips on occasionally   presumably do to my heavier weight  though i m already down     screen has plenty of videos  the free year of ifit is nice to track but i mostly watch on my ipad screen is essentially an android tab but it is limited and wo t let you install apps  it would be cool if i cooked just watch net flux or stream spotify      
840,5.0,                       so far the treadmill works as advertised   the base is the heaviest part and you will need help moving it into the house   but it can be assembled by one person if needed   i like that it automatically syncs with my polar oh  heart rate sensor   i had to jump through a few hoops to get it to pair with my wireless headset but that is also working now   that should be made easier  i am not sure why pairing to a headset is hidden from the user   not everyone in the house needs to listen to the coaches instructions after a few months things are still working ok   i like the ifit training better then expected   so far i lost a few more pounds   i was stuck at my current weight for a year or more  so the extra push was needed update   with the last firmware update they added a headphone connect option to the warm up screen   so you no longer need to get into admin mode to connect a bluetooth headset      
841,1.0,                       i am disappointed with this purchase  i am going to list several problems of this machine  first  the machine does not support     pounds  second  the machine makes noises  third  you have to pay a subscription it does not matter if you bought the machine  fourth  the machine weighs a lot and it is very big  to put it inside the house you need   people  fifth  the engine of the machine does not have much power  good luck if you want to buy this machine     
842,4.0,                       pain in the a   to assemble but i did it pretty much by myself  the screen is really lovely  speaker is good  fan is good  easy to fold up and down  wheels are good enough  mine is in the garage on a mat so i don t move it around   wherever you assemble it  that s where it s gonna be b c it s not gonna fit through the door okay    it came with the trial ifit subscription but i haven t activated it yet  i just do manual mode  there are some free guided runs but they re not in english haha  i like that it has a warm up and cool down  buttons are responsive  i do run outdoors but it s way too hot in cali right now so i use this to do sprints before after i lift weights  could run for awhile on it though  most i ve done is    min      
843,1.0,                       delivered four days after ordering  but it has been inoperable since day one  they were helpful over the phone and tried troubleshooting  sent a new motor and reed switch  installed motor and waited couple of weeks for switch  installed  with no luck  the next call they said it must be the controller  waited couple of weeks for that  installed with no luck  next call they finally agreed to send a tech with the next controller since the new one had gone up in smoke when powered on  waited couple more weeks for controller  than another week of phone tag to get the tech  he installed controller and had no more luck than i did  another controller was ordered and another tech came out  installed another controller  swapped motors and nothing  then he wiggled some wires coming down from the console and this caused the controller to go up in smoke again  when checking the wires he found three of them burned out  so now i have been waiting another    days for a console and controller with no information than in process  almost three months and this thing has n to moved yet      
844,5.0,                       i prefer running outdoors and needed a little push to be  happy  using a treadmill as i find them all incredibly boring  the ifit technology is so totally worth paying for if you re like me who needs incentive to get on this thing  although i still prefer running outdoors  this treadmill has been a godsend as i log in miles in between meetings and run  ks all over the world with some of their awesome coaches  if you re going to cheap out and not pay for ifit  that s fine as long as you don t mind running on treadmills in general  they do give you a year of free ifit to try out  i certainly plan on continuing that membership as i feel it is totally worth it  i believe there are workouts within the system itself without ifit  but i ve yet to try those  the treadmill itself is awesome too  i just dust it often to make sure it s clean and that s it  i ve had it for over three months and love it  i only wish that i bought one that had a decline too  and not just an incline  still  go for it      
845,5.0,                       i m a daily runner training for   marathons a year and run roughly     miles per month  needed to find a good enough treadmill that could accommodate speed work at      paces  box came late which created a problem with the installation group  opted to build it myself which was fairly easy to do  solid treadmill and as good as anything i ve used in the gym  folding action is smooth and easy  not crazy about the ifit software and how long the machine takes to boot because of it  but this is still a   star because of the solid running ui and excellent quality of the machine  had been worried that i should have gone with the pro level  but this was excellent  at      the smaller width is actually preferred  highly recommend      
846,5.0,                       very satisfied with this purchase  i was honestly overwhelmed with all of the choices when searching for treadmills but i knew i wanted a quality brand and i didn t want to spend a lot of money  this fulfilled those requirements it is a well built sturdy machine that does it s job  i was impressed with the purchase once it arrived based off of how much  little  i spent  i was able to put it together almost completely by myself  just needed a second hand at the end i usually hate using treadmills because i am an outdoor runner but weather limits me in the winter  have had this around a month now and use it daily  i can easily mount my tablet and watch my shows while running      
847,5.0,                       awesome treadmill  looks  features  functionality  foe the price pros  interactive or manual mode  has bluetooth and folds to save space cons  assembly  heavyi did not see the option to pay for assembly so i  very  not handy   was tasked to put this together  all of the necessary tools were included with the product  but for some steps      people are required and you will need a ratchet set to make things go faster  not supplied  i would suggest to be absolutely certain on where you choose to install this because moving it  although it does have rollers  will not be easy all in all  i am pleased with the treadmill and very happy with the purchase      
848,5.0,                       first of all let me warn you anyone who buys this  do not fall for the ifit warning that you have to get in order for your machine to run  this is not true  once you have your machine built and ready to plug in go ahead and plug it in turn the switch on in the back  and be sure to add on the safety button to the front of the machine  after that press on the blue  or it s blue on my machine anyway   ifit logo holding it down for    seconds  your machine is ready to use  it takes two people to put together  although my husband did it by himself in   hours  he said it would ve been faster with help i ve not used it much since it s only been an hour when i walked in and found he d assembled the treadmill  good luck  it s a beautiful machine      
849,1.0,                       i purchased the nordictrack brand for its reputation as a great quality company and product   i also paid for the assembly of the item and installation as i wanted to start using it asap   we received the item a few days after purchase which was great   when the folks assembling it tried to put it together  the wrong parts were included   we called nordictrack and after a long wait  we were able to order the replacement parts that were due in   weeks   that was   weeks ago   called again today  waited another long time only to hear it is another     weeks out   i have a half assembled treadmill and a large box sitting in the middle of my basement for close to a month now and it looks like it will be another month   horrible quality  wrong parts  and service   i can t comment on the experience with the machine yet for likely another month at least   super frustrating      
850,5.0,                       excellent product for the price  top value for the money the shipment with my nordictrack t     s arrived as scheduled on january          assembly took approximately    minutes  did it myself and took my time  the instructions are very easy to understand operation and set up is easy and he noise level relatively low i decided to sign up for the optional ifit subscription and it is well worth it  so far  i haven t tried the guided and coached training sessions   it is on my to do list i really like the detailed tracking of the workouts via the ifit app  already reached     miles  approaching      miles due to the covid    restrictions  i am more than glad and happy to have my own gym  being independent from the weather conditions  very helpful  especially since my employer has allowed working from home    my overall summary  highly recommended      
851,4.0,                       the assembly is complex but instructions are clear  thank goodness my husband is handy i m so grateful to have read about the workaround to ifit   i did as instructed and the treadmill works great  i have back and foot issues so i wanted one that would be easy on joints  this seems to fit the bill  good shock absorption system  it doesn t have a lot of bells and whistles but i didn t need those and didn t want to pay for them one little issue  sometimes when i turn it on  the incline starts rising on its own  i have to unplug it then plug it back in to reset  no biggie  just a little annoyance      
852,1.0,                       when it works the ifit is a great add to this treadmill  however we ve had it for   months and the screen no longer works  it began to fail and tech support said  unplug it and plug it back in  which worked a few times now it takes on average    times before we can get past the settings screen  this is now just a basic treadmill and not worth the extra money     
853,1.0,                       speed is completely incorrect  the actual speed was     and it was displaying     on the screen  the incline was also incorrect actual vs what it displayed on the screen  heart rate as well  i was walking at a pretty fast pace and it displayed     hahaha    what a joke it was a pain to even get it started  trying to avoid all of the useless ifit app nonsense  overall  i have to research how to fix all these issues  you would expect it all to be calibrated from the start  its also not very easy to move  and once you lift the bottom of the treadmill it sits at an odd angle  lastly  you can t even use the bluetooth speakers with your music from your phone  the bluetooth speakers are only for use with the ifit app  lame     the box arrived completely destroyed  luckily the treadmill itself was not damaged      
854,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it doesn t have wheels to move it   but even worse  i can t make it run  it has a subscription program that turns it on  reading the ways to bypass  back yo duper heavy had time scoot it across my floor for permanent scratches  the fold up looks so unsafe  mostly i should be able to start a treadmill without all this reading      
855,5.0,                       i went back and forth on buying this  after having it for about a week now i am so glad i did  i can t believe how quiet and stable it is  i ve ran a few times on it and it s been amazing  had a friend put it together and it took about two hours  i bypassed the ifit program just because i don t like to give out my personal info by holding down the ifit button to get it started and it worked right away  super simple  my only regret is that i didn t purchase it sooner  i also used to work out at equinox so i m surprised how happy i am with this purchase at this price point  i thought for sure it was going to be wobbly and loud but it s perfect      
856,1.0,                       the unit arrived and was assemmbled  which we paid for  it was fine until    minutes in when the display fried and the unit stopped  we thought it was the motherboard  a call to nordic track with a video of what was happening resulted in nordic track sending a new display and saying it was  easy to assemble   it wasn t that easy  so after figuring it out and assembling it  voila   same deal  yep  motherboard  nordic track had not offered to do anything to assemble the display and clearly diagnosed the problem incorrectly anyway  they were only interested in ending the phone call  so this all resulted in a return and a really negative experience  amazon was more or less ok   nordic track was a complete and utter joke      
857,5.0,                       we just got this treadmill yesterday  amazon delivered it with no problems  there was a big dent in the box  but everything was packaged so good  there was no damage to the actual treadmill   beware  it is heavy  you will definitely need two people to move it  it took a couple hours  with a pizza break  to put together  while tedious  we didn t have any problems   going off advise from another review  you can hold down the ifit button for about    seconds and it will  unlock  the machine so you don t have to go through the register process   so far  we are very pleased  for the price  you can t go wrong  i would definitely recommend this treadmill      
858,4.0,                       the good   ifit  which is the main selling point  pretty easy to assemble  fairly quiet  great interfacethe bad   will not connect to external device via ifit s bluetooth sync instructions  you can screen cast with compatible tv s but only in privileged mode  the smart tv we purchased  tcl roku  is not compatible the manufacturer was very short sighted to think that just because the app is built into the console tablet  that their customers would not want to screen share to other devices   this was a major disappointment for us and something we will take into consideration for future purchases of this type      
859,5.0,                       my nutritionist recommended a nordic track  i found this one and was so excited  it had everything i needed  i was able to get it  a   year warranty  and have it delivered assembled for almost a       less than their lowest model on their website  it doesn t have a tv screen but it has a ledge for my ipad  the guys that assembled it were fantastic  they set it up completely and i did not have to sign up for the ifit trial  i ended up signing up for the ifit trial just to see  it was easy to sync with the treadmill from my iphone  my whole family is using it      
860,1.0,                       my girlfriend is certain nordictrack purposefully made it so hard to assemble so that you will give up and pay the extra hundred to have a professional come and do it  her reasoning is that it s so bad that it can not be attributed to mere laziness on nordictrack s part  but must be a product of conscious effort here are some of the highlights if you re foolish enough to attempt it  you will need at least two people and six hours to complete  you will need power tools as some of the screws are too big for their sockets and must be forced in  there will be screws in corners that no screwdriver can get at  you will need a specialty tool for them  you will on several occasions have to undo the work you just did and reassemble it a different way i m not kidding about that last one  see on step   it will say something like attach a to b  but what it won t say is that you need to first move a as far to the left as possible   much further than a should reasonably go  if you do it wrong  you won t notice anything until you get to step   at which point you will realize your mistake and begin to curse yourself  anyone standing nearby  and maybe a deity or two for good measure once you finally get it built it runs pretty fine  the only problem is the tread keeps slowly creeping to one side and rubbing against the edge  surprisingly they actually predicted this problem  and there s a good youtube video online that tells you how to adjust it back to the center  still it s annoying to have to spend    minutes of doing this once or twice a week  which is what i ve been doing one last thing  before i bought this treadmill i bought a      treadmill that was  i soon realized  too small for a person of my weight  the only reason i bring this up is because that assembled perfectly as you would expect most things you purchase online would do  so it is perfectly possible to create this thing better  nordictrack simply didn t want to  i would definitely not buy again  and suggest you don t either      
861,5.0,                       treadmill is great  it goes up to    mph  which is well above what i need  and does an incline up to      i think it s      my wife and i usually just use it for brisk walks with a high incline  we only use the manual controls and  never the pre programmed workouts   note that they try to get you to pay for an ifit subscription but it is not required folding up is fairly heavy  but not hard  same with folding down setup was a bit time consuming and one of the screws wouldn t  go in until i used a drill  which the directions expressway said not to do       
862,5.0,                       i do not recommend trying to assemble this alone  which is what i did  yes  i did it  but it took nearly   hours and every ounce of energy i had  it was easy to assemble for the most part  the pieces are just really heavy  i had to adjust the belt but it works perfectly  i did not have to instal or download the software that it says is needed  it was a great purchase overall      
863,5.0,                       it s been almost   months since we purchased this treadmill  we are so happy as we made the decision to go with this  no issues so far and i would say  this is best quality treadmill we could get in market for this price  only bottleneck we faced was with installation  it s little difficult to do it and will require help of an additional person or two to get it completed properly  also  one of the parts received was not in perfect fit but i would say received a great support to get the replacement part and that too so fast  i would recommend buying this to anyone      
864,4.0,                       i m in my   s and decided to improve my cardio during this pandemic  this treadmill has been just what the doctor ordered now that i m working out at home  treadmill assembly was pretty straightforward  it s sturdy and pretty quiet at higher speeds  only a few minor concerns      the plastic motor cover sits pretty low on the belt causing the user to step on it now and again so you must train yourself to run further back on the belt      ez to fold up but sticks a little when trying to lower it      heart rate monitor is not very accurate but to be fair i ve yet to find any fitness equipment of any kind to have an accurate hrm  imo  a very good purchase      
865,1.0,                       ridiculous that you have to jump through hoops with their stupid ifit program just to start the treadmill   zero customer service available as well   would not recommend   would not buy again      
866,4.0,                       received treadmill in a timely manner  not any damage besides a small plastic piece when it arrived was insignificant    set up took like   hours but everything did fit  when you turn it on  nordic tells you that you that you have to register the treadmill before it will unlock  this is a scam to try and get you to pay their monthly ifit fee  you dont have to do it  if you press the manual button on the treadmill  it should unlock the treadmill  you may have to hold it for a while  holding ifit button didnt do it for me   holding the manual button did it for me  it is crappy thought that they dont tell you this but rather they tell you that  product registration required   thats bs and misleading and a low thing done by the company for unsuspecting people  otherwise  the treadmill works great so far day   and have gotten good workout from it  will update if it becomes faulty and does not work or malfunctions      
867,5.0,                       i have been using the nordictrack t series    s treadmill since day one  this is my first treadmill from this brand  i had two provioulsy from other brands i could feel and see the difference in quality at first glance  the material is high quality  the pieces fit together perfectly when assembling the machine and the screws fit perfectly with minimum effort  the machine is quiet and easy to operate  the band area is wide and deep  you feel really safe when using the treadmill  i really love this treadmill      
868,5.0,                       we purchased this treadmill a few months ago  and waited a bit before writing this review  after using it for several months quite often we think it was a great purchase  i think this is nordictrack s cheapest treadmill  we got it for a great price and it performs very well  feels very sturdy and has the ability to connect to ifit via bluetooth bottom line  if you are on a budget don t hesitate to buy this treadmill      
869,1.0,                       i ve never experienced such a disregard for a customer care process and focus  let me be clear  the people i finally got through too about multiple parts missing were nice and very helpful in one case  two phone calls where i waited in excess of    minutes each  one for missing handrails which arrived separately by a few weeks apart and the second for the rubber handrail covers that took    minutes each to heat and stretch to fit  unable to get them on fully  no surprise as they are no doubt added by machinery to the handles  i ended up cutting them short by   inches  the icing on the cake was when i completed the installation some   weeks after receiving it and proudly removed the clear plastic protective sheet on the console only to have it remove with it  chunks of the  satin finish  on the console  i realized i made a huge mistake buying my second and last nordictrack product from icon fitness      
870,4.0,                       like many of us  the pandemic has caused some restraints with our normal life patterns such as going to the gym and enjoying the equipment that is readily available to us   with that being said  we decided to purchase the nordic track t series   it was easy to assemble  my husband assembled it by himself   the incline and speed features are easy to maneuver   i read many reviews that indicated you must sign up for ifit to operate the unit  however this is not true the bluetooth feature is easy to activate   we are able to jog and exercise while watching our favorite television shows in our home gym   the only reason why i didn t give the purchase a rating of   stars has more to do with our initial customer service experience   the unit blew a fuse and stopped working   we have a newer home so the surge protector was doing its job  the manual indicated that an arc adapter would help with this issue but it didn t give any other details regarding the same we chatted on the vendor s website and the agent kept asking if we wanted to return the item after being on hold for over    minutes   we explained that we didn t want to return  we simply needed information on the type of adapter needed to use the treadmill   we were the told that we would have to be transferred to another department   after being transferred and placed on another long hold  we received a message that they were closed frustrated  we called the toll free number and reached an agent who ran a diagnostic test over our phone and shipped the arc adapter within a week   this representative was patient and resolved our complaint so far  we love it      
871,3.0,                       from delivery through assembly this is not for the faint of heart  the delivery schedule kept us on the hook for   days  waiting for the scheduled appointment to yield results  when the item finally arrived  the assembly process began  first  we received a screw that was deformed  we replaced it  we contacted the company about ways to attach the ground wire correctly  it took a week to get a response  and that did not include an answer nor any assistance  only an inquiry for more information  we proceeded on  it takes a socket set to tighten the screws  which is not in the instructions  and we also took the advice of others about avoiding the scam of ifit membership  however  note that you need to use the key before pressing the ifit button  ours squeaks but functions  so that s the good news  looking forward to using it now      
872,5.0,                       i love the nordictrack treadmill so much i could spend hours on it  it makes it easy for me to accomplish my fitness goals without gym membership which i probably won t follow through with  assembly was easy with the instruction that came with it and it took my husband about an hour and a half to unbox and assemble  i have to give a big thumbs up to the seller because they exceeded my expectations with delivery  my treadmill came in a day earlier and the delivery guys called me when i was not home and even waited a few minutes for me to reroute and get back home  they were very polite and courteous  i am impressed with theirr service and the treadmill has been serving my entire family  i got the free month of ifit but like other reviewers said  you can use the treadmill without ifit  i just chose to use ifit for the extra challenge      
873,5.0,                       i have had the treadmill for   days now and am very pleased with operation and features available   unpacking  took about an hour  assembly  took   hours  worked alone even thought it said takes   people  was not difficult working alone  start up  a previous review indicated how to start without signing up for ifit  which i did not want  pressing and holding the ifit icon on the main screen for    seconds allowed me to start my treadmill without signing up  operation  in manual mode   simple   which is what my wife and i were looking for  for the advanced user the features offered would provide that as well     
874,5.0,                       this treadmill is amazing i am         lbs and i have no issues running on this treadmill i was a little concerned because i am tall and have long legs and was worried about this treadmill not being long enough  but it is more than long enough for me to run  i typically run at    mph with the incline i bought this treadmill because of covid    and having to stay at home  i was nervous because i run and walk  frequently changing the speed and incline during my workout  this treadmill is amazing  truly good quality  very comperable to the commerical grade at the gym i was used to  from the shipping to the assembley to the quality of the product a  also  you do not need the ifit app for the treadmill to work      
875,4.0,                       very pleased with this treadmill  i have it in my basement for working out  it s fairly quiet and has a wide range of speeds and inclines  my one complaint is you cannot input your weight to customize your calories  otherwise it s a great treadmill for the price  i definitely recommend the amazon installation service to set it up      
876,4.0,                       pros  sturdy machine and good motor that seems built to handle weight and demands of a person trying to get in shape at home  display is easy to understand and use and has a lot of features that i hope to become better acquainted with  but i am perfectly happy running in manual mode at desired speed for time being cons  this was difficult to assemble  instructions are fine but there are screws bolts in awkward to reach places which adds significant time in assembly  there is really no details on parts that should have recommendations for ensuring are in proper order out of the box  rear belt roller and adjustments to make sure the belt is centered   at appropriate tightness   my machine makes noises when i first start running and i am completely unable to diagnose the issue  would have been good to include diagrams   illustrations of how to make sure your machine is finely tuned     
877,5.0,                       this treadmill is great  but it does not have memory   i do not use the fit you have to sign up with just to unlock your treadmill when it is brand new   not a fan of that   but  the treadill is great      
878,1.0,                       the thing that nobody else mentioned was that you must have the safety key in place before you hold down the ifit button to bypass ifit activation  it won t bypass ifit w o the safety key  super shady business tactic to try and force us to hand over our credit card info simply to use a machine we already gave you money for        
879,1.0,                       received treadmill brand new and still broken  never worked getting it to start  the belt doesn t even move  very disappointed  piece of garbage  a waste of money           
880,4.0,                       the delivered was great the carrier left it inside the house  i needed  help from other person for the assamble  some instructions are a liitle confuse but you can doit with out technical support   the treadmills look fantastic  the warranty registration was a little confuse too  they ask for the version   you can find it in the model  the las   digit after the point  they ask for the serial number it is on the button  but maybe you can find it the box  i hope works ok first the machine was lock  we had to made a free trial suscription with ifit in order to unlocked  can be cancell any time  everything work great  the automatic inclination  the speeds really easy pull down and pull up  for now my wife is happy with this gift      
881,1.0,                       the treadmill was damaged cosmetically in shipping  i contacted nordictrack and they ignored me  the product may or may not be good   time will tell  but their customer service is non existant     
882,5.0,                       i find it little difficult to assemble by just following the instructions  particularly the upper console  but once i remove the frame from upper console it was easy you have to register your machine to ifit to get started and then have to disable it in time if you don t want that membership  else they will deduct money  but it just a simple call to ifit i used many gym treadmill and find it s up to that level  best for price in fact i never thought that i can get this quality treadmill at this price due to price and performance i am giving them full mark and hope they will do something for the hassle i face      
883,5.0,                       i bought this because i wanted to exercise at home due to covid   i wanted something that will last because it is quite big investment  then i found this by nordictrack  national brand with long history the tread is very wide and long that it is very comfortable running long time on it  it has reclining and    different speed settings  i tried up to    i don t think i can keep with    even though i play tennis regularly the best thing is i can run anytime i want  rain or shine  even after midnight  it is so easy to operate  and folds unfolds very easily      
884,1.0,                       the tread slipped to the left and the adjusting mechanism doesn t work  i am an idiot for not paying attention to the other post that said the same thing      
885,1.0,                       edit  this saga gets worse as time progresses  i contacted the manufacturer to get the replacement part for the storage latch  i exchanged multiple emails and the manufacturer s request grow and grow as i continue to provide them more information  after providing them a page of information  they want to know the part number of the item i need  i go to the user manual and give the part number per the manual  well that s not sufficient   now they need a photo of the faulty part that is located under this     lb treadmill  that s where i pushed back  i m not lifting this treadmill  i m not  proving  myself to a company that should have provided me with a working product to begin with  if this nonsense continues i will gladly load this treadmill up  all     lbs of it  place it in its original box and return it to amazon  i absolutely do not need this level of nonsense in my life over a stupid treadmill  all i wanted was a product that worked correctly  i ve now gotten myself into an interrogation over a storage latch and the demand to provide the manufacturer evidence of the defect  zero stars is an appropriate review for this item due to being defective and having horrid customer service what a mess  i felt like i received half correct parts and half incorrect parts because this was such a pain to put together  screw holes didn t line up  the left handle was so odd that i can t even describe it it was so screwed up that we had to trim about an inch of the rubber coating off just to get the pieces to fit together right  and when we were almost finished we had only the storage bar and clip to install and realized the part we received was broken  so it can t be folded until we get the correct  unbroken parts  this is one of those items where it s apparent that each part is manufactured at a different location and without regard to whether it fits together as a whole  i was so exhausted after we were finished fighting with assembly that i didn t even have the energy to try it  luckily it does work  but getting it haphazardly put together was a nightmare  save your sanity and avoid this product or pay someone else to put it together      
886,3.0,                       we have the peloton bike and are huge fans of peloton  hardware  exercise content and experience   i am using my nordic track while watching peloton classes on my ipad   we considered and tested out the   more expensive peloton treadmill options   and chose nordic track because it was immediately available and slightly more reasonable price wise   peloton had a     month wait at the time my family use the treadmill weekly and get good exercise on it   it s well made   sturdy the heart rate monitor doesn t work well  so we don t use it   the controls to adjust speed incline are tough to see in dim lit room  but usable   nothing as well designed or user friendly as the peloton   cheap plastic buttons  not dials and toggles   the led is nothing like the peloton monitor the treadmill works fine   works well   but compared to other purchases in this price range  it s not even close quality or design wise      
887,1.0,                       the first time i purchased a nordic track treadmill  it lasted    years  used   days a week  every week  without any issues   i purchased this nordic track in       and i m on my second repair   the first time i had it repaired it was maybe   months old and it needed a new belt   now the console has broken and needs to be replaced   keep in mind that i use it   days a week  walk at a speed of     and an incline of       save your money and don t buy this version  it s a dud   nordictrackstinks     
888,3.0,                       it took a long time to put it together and you will need a second person  it s great for inside walking and the incline gives an amazing workout  i like the ifit programs  there are several that offer strength training during the walk which was a nice twist to treadmill training  my only complaint is that is does squeak a lot when i jog  i ve contacted customer service and like the others posted  they are slow to respond  if at all   it started squeaking a month after purchase  i followed suggestions on youtube and the company s website and it s still squeaking  guess i will just have to live with it  overall it s a good treadmill  i just wish customer service was more responsive in providing a solution for the squeaking which clearly affects a lot of their machines      
889,4.0,                       it s a great value for getting a treadmill that has motorized incline  ifit capabilities  and came in     days   assembly was pretty straightforward and for even the novice person comes together easily   hold the ifit button down for    sec and you get around the requirement to use ifit   seems like decent quality but i removed a star because the belt doesn t seem tight enough and during assembly some of the plastic seemed thin and brittle and made me think it s not going to last   we shall see   otherwise this treadmill has features that you  cannot find at this price and that s  why i think the value is so high  free prime shipping and delivered  it inside my garage just where i wanted it  that alone beats saving a few bucks at the store and having to bring it home myself      
890,1.0,                       yet another defective treadmill to add to the   star reviews  i figured i d be lucky  but i wasn t  screen doesn t work  have unplugged and restarted  after reading all the negative reviews i m just inclined to return it  not looking forward to dealing with their customer service it was actually pretty easy to assemble  i m female            and i assembled      solo  it took some maneuvering  but it can be done   screen worked for about   minutes  so now it s just a summertime coat rack  it s also not as easy to move from room to room as they make it look  it actually won t fit through any of my doorways      
891,4.0,                       i ve been using it for about   months  my husband and i run at least    min a day and we like it so far  the treadmill is big but not too big to take up a lot of space  we bought it during the quarantine and we couldn t get an expert to assemble it so we had to do it ourselves  it is fairly easy to assemble it as long as you have the right tools and you read the manual very carefully  i gave   starts for   reasons  first  they ask you to sign up for ifit in order to activate your machine  it s a trial so just make sure you cancel the trial  sencond  sometimes when you turn on the treadmill  it starts to lift the belt all the way to the highest incline setting and then goes down itself  so you have to wait until it goes back to its original position  my husband and i don t mind it but it does happen and it shouldn t the treadmill works well so far  i will make an updated review in a few months from now      
892,1.0,                       just put together nordictrack treadmill  after removing plastic cover from console  noticed grooved cosmetic blemish abrasion on plastic at lower part of console down lower half of  incline  and over to  start  buttons  this will aggravate me daily  as is  in my face   because grooved blemish seems to have been smoothed over and has no jagged edges  appears product left nordictrack with knowledge of the cosmetic defect  causing me to think it s a normal business practice to send products that have  cosmetic defects  out the door to customers who are expecting an unblemished  new product s he paid for  disappointing  have requested nordictrack send out new  unblemished  console  about to lodge formal complaint to amazon  too  calls into question the actual operation of the unit  which i m about to try out now  will keep you posted      
893,5.0,                       i am on the treadmill daily  no excuse  because it s in my home   total convenience   i just turn on my music which i enjoy playing loudly  can t do that at the gym   i hate wearing ear buds   it is very user friendly  easy to switch up speed and adjust the grade of steepness   my husband put it together himself without  too much difficulty   i would recommend this treadmill  well made at a good price   set small goals  be realistic   try to be consistent so it doesn t turn into an expensive clothing rack       
894,1.0,                       cannot activate the treadmill unless you go to their website and sign up with all your personal and credit card information for a membership  unbelievable  absolutely terrible anti consumer business practice and i hope they go out of business  will be returning this junk asap imagine buying a car and the dealer telling saying you can t drive the car unless you sign up for a membership i paid for this product      
895,5.0,                       it is a great treadmill with wide running surface and very quiet motor and soft impact   easy on the legs and joints   operation is very straightforward   auto incline works perfectly while you are running   has a little loud click when you initially set the incline but works smoothly after   the pulse rate fluctuates inaccurately  and highly sensitive to where you place your hands   it is a very heavy treadmill and not easy to move   assembly requires   people and has many moving parts to connect   after starting  i hired pros from amazon s resources to finish the job   they were great  and completed the assembly in about    minutes      
896,5.0,                       you get the nordictrack quality at a relative bargain compared to lesser known and established competitors  on top of that  amazon offers delivery to any room of your choice  a welcome option especially during these days  this is a no frills  no nonsense treadmill that gets the job done with minimum distractions  a pragmatic purchase p s    assembly was a challenge  but this will vary from person to person depending on experience  it can be done individually  but a second hand is recommended  be safe      
897,5.0,                       ordered it at the beginning of july during the pandemic  shipping was canceled and rescheduled a couple of times but finally it arrived at the end of july  i hired a tech to assemble it and he was done in    minutes with me only holding the track one time  i probably could assemble it myself after watching him but i went the safe route  didn t do the subscription so no set programs but that doesn t bother me too much  easy to change speed and incline  was a little loud at first but got quieter with use  i m pleased with it  pic is during assembly in case you want to hire them      
898,5.0,                       this is a nice treadmill  i m really impressed with the treadmill and actually the ifit software  i was totally set on cancwling the program  but now that i ve used it  it makes the treadmill soooo entertaining    you can do courses from all over the world in the comfort of your home  don t stress about the software til you try it  it looks like you can cancel the membership at any time and still have access to a couple ifit things and the normal manual mode at that time      
899,5.0,                       i talked the delivery men into putting it in the room i designated for the treadmill  they were very accommodating  the treadmill was difficult to assemble with only myself and my husband because of the heavy lifting involved  it would have been easier with two strong men  it came with a free month of ifit and i was told i would have to join ifit to be able to use my new machine  not true  i simply set it on manual and it works fine  we both enjoy the treadmill  even my   dogs and   cats enjoy it  the sun shines on it and all the animals take turns laying on it      
900,5.0,                       even though the belt is technically smaller than commercial it still allows really stable  high intensity runassembly was technically not complicated but lots of screwing into threaded sheet metal    needed some experience to do perfectlysuper convenient to have this in the house   have it plugged into a ups to even out power and prevent surges  so far no slipping  no uneven power deliverybypassed ifit by holding down button   never a need to register  rest of the monitor has all the info you need plus no finicky touchscreen  pretty great      
901,1.0,                       this treadmill is a joke  for spending over      you would think it would be a better machine  not only did it take me two days to put together  the bolts were sent with burrs on them  making them impossible to get it  plus the one side didn t align properly  after finally getting this pos assembled  the belt completely folded over within the first    minutes of use  and i was walking  walking  i called nordictrack and they said they could send someone to put a new one on in    days  so literally zero urgency there  don t buy this  it s not worth your time      
902,5.0,                       easy to fold and it serves the purpose of indoor running  this model doesn t have timed run option  you will have to physically press the stop button at the end of the workout  it s not as loud as i thought and i recommend you get a mat if you are going to place it on hardwood floor  i ve had it since december and i love having the convenience of running at home     
903,4.0,                       living in a rural city it was a little difficult finding someone who could assemble the treadmill  my husband suggested calling a mover  they came and not only moved it to where i wanted it but also assembled it   i use it every morning to work out  it s a lot better than the stair stepper i was using for a couple of years  higher heart rate  better workout in less time   what can i say  i love it after i finally found the programed workouts  i wanted to add to this review   the workouts are great a different place every morning  however  they only run for around    minutes and i like to workout for an hour  so after    minutes i have to restart it to finish my workout and get the full hour i need   if i could figure out how to program them so they would last a minimum of   hour i would put this back to a   star  for now i m only rating it   stars   love it though      
904,3.0,                       the treadmill arrived today   i am about an hour and a half into assembling trying to figure out the directions   i am finding parts that don t fit and a non existent customer service for assembly help   i am a mechanical person but find the instructions  yes i did read the instructions  difficult   based on the part fit and customer service being lacking i would buy from somewhere else   this nordic trac isn t what they used to be well  it s together and works fine   i followed the other comments to not subscribe to ifit and it runs with no problem      
905,4.0,                       assembly was not hard  though having experience putting a treadmill together prior was helpful   the shipper was great  i had paid for in house delivery   just arrived yesterday   the only issue i am having thus far is when i purchased it   it was suppose to include one year of ifit and also i purchased a two year warranty   i finished registering with nordictrack and when i went to activate the ifit it doesn t seem to recognize the one year membership   though this may be my lack of knowledge with how these things work   plan on contacting today and do more research   i am sure i can get this resolved      
906,1.0,                       it s built well but don t make me sign up and pay monthly to use my treadmill  if anyone has this problem hold ifit button for    sec  on treadmill to bypass activation   one solid star for scamming and forcing people to pay more after we paid   you are lucky i am not sending it back      
907,1.0,                       i decided to leave only one star as this treadmill was not easy to put together  one of the tools it calls for you to use is an adjustable wrench and we had a hard time getting the specific bolts tightened as the holes didn t line up great  also  it recommends two people when putting this item together  i would say it s not recommended but a necessity for two people to assemble this item  i would recommend if available paying the extra and having onsite assembly and save yourself the headache of putting this thing together  you will be glad you saved at least     hours of your time      
908,4.0,                       great treadmill so far  we ve had it a little over a month  we were weary of buying a nordic track because they make it seem like you have to purchase a monthly ifit plan  but you don t  the treadmill will still work without purchasing a monthly plan  just bypass this by holding down the ifit button for thirty seconds when you turn it on for the first time  it was easy to assembly but it does require   people      
909,5.0,                       it is a bit tricky to assemble and definitely requires two persons working together  the instruction manual is ok for the assembling part as indicated in other people s review  you can hold  ifit  button for    seconds to bypass ifit registration  i think the selling company should inform the customers of it once everything is put up  this treadmill works wonderfully      
910,1.0,                       the treadmill worked ok a bit over    months  look  right before warranty expires   then the front puller started to produce some metal abrasive noise  submitted a maintenance ticket to them  apparently nordictrack outsourced all their customer maintenance services to icon fitness and  well  the icon service is terrible   it s so terrible that i am willing to repeat it another   times  terrible  terrible  terrible   the maintenance ticket was completely ignored for about   weeks  then i finally had to follow up since my warranty was about to expire  their phone call never worked  you get different phone numbers from different places  nordictrack website  icon website  maintenance ticket email   and none of them work  the automatic phone system just hold you for    minutes and hangs up  i had to contact them with online chat  thanks god at least that worked after a    minutes wait  and there was one good  and the only time they were good  representative who helped me troubleshoot and ordered the replacement part  then it was another   weeks of wait and i still don t have my part delivered  no correspondence at all in the mean time  i went to their website and entered my order number for tracking  the response was empty      not found   i had to go for online chat again to check the order status  with another    minutes wait   and after hearing my question the representative just said  your warranty expired so talk to another department with phone nuwber xxx xxx xxxx  and immediately cut my chat session  of course it expired thanks to the long wait    i had to reconnect and said the order was made when i was covered under warranty  so he checked the order number and told me it s  in process   i asked about the problem on the website for order status checking  and he said  i don t know why it does not work for you  and cut the chat session again  very awful experience chatting with this guy my take  the product is probably worth the price if you can get it fixed to make up for its unreliability  but with the terrible service  i would strongly recommend against buying it because the likelihood of you either end up with an unusable treadmill or have to go through a terrible customer service is quite non trivial      
911,4.0,                       great treadmill thus far  glad i was able to bypass ifit      
912,5.0,                       this treadmill is amazing  it s easy to fold  and so easy to use  i love how i can save space in my garage by just folding it up  ifit is easy to use   i love that i have two profiles on ifit so my husband and i can both keep track of our own progress   the instructions can be a little tough to follow at some points  but i put it together alone as a small woman   it was pretty easy but a bit heavy  as to be expected   the screen is clear  the belt doesn t skip while i run  and it feels more expensive than it was   it s a great treadmill which seems more expensive than it was      
913,4.0,                       we had someone come assemble it pros   we love this treadmill  does the job for us and like the screen  ifit is nice and we enjoy it even though the app needs a lot of work  cons  after a  weeks we started hearing big clacking  cracking noise when we incline the treadmill  we called support at least  times  they  sent us  a piece to replace that we haven t received    it s been at least  months since we had the issue and it s not fixed support is not great it s expensive and having issues after  weeks using the treadmill is really aggravating      
914,5.0,                       ok  i read reviews before the put together they helped     it s really heavy     don t tighten the bolts on the legs until you have the top piece attached     don t let your building buddy drop the panel on your head     if you can t find the ground wire attachment  they pushed it up inside the panel area  fish it out     if you hold down the ifit button for    seconds  you can bypass it  i love ifit  i love the treadmill until the trainer makes you run at     for sprints         
915,1.0,                       i bought professional amazon technician for assembling and after assembling he figured out that belt is not in the center and keeps moving towards right  it s been so painful to follow up with amazon customer care  i have to speak to    agents literally and finally i was told to speak to nordic track  i will not purchase large items like threadmill on amazon because first of all their customer care for bulk products is awful  second return is very difficult if the item is damaged  instead purchase on the product site so you cam speak to their agents  they sold a defective item on discount  this is totally a scam by amazon and seller      
916,4.0,                       buying the treadmill is a godsend  since our gym the y shut down  i tried running in my neighborhood on pavement and i hurt some major joints but doing nothing was worse so i bought the treadmill  it is noisy  perhaps the pad will help i just haven t figured out which one to buy  while i miss the gym at least i can get my daily exercise and not hurt myself      
917,4.0,                       i ve had this treadmill for about a year and i can t really say much bad about it  it s fairly quiet and ifit has been fun  happy i got the larger screen  i use it about   days week for jogging running and walking  i ended up having to put it together myself which was actually pretty easy for me to do alone  except there is one part that absolutely requires   people  so make sure you have another person around when putting it together two complaints     never figured out how to use the heart rate handles  but i wear a separate monitor so doesn t bother me    the built in fan is useless for short people  i m     and can t feel it the way it is angled  which you can t adjust  also  where i put my tablet covers it anyway  so no big loss for me  i just use other  more powerful fans around the treadmill      
918,1.0,                       piece of junk after a month the treadmill won t even turn on  they are happy to sell you a new one after an hour hold time on the phone  if you request a call back it rings once and they hang up on you  after two hours of my life wasted i finally got to talk to a live person who said you need to call back on monday during certain hours  wtf     when i got a message back stating to call back anytime  i tried on friday afternoon at  pm when i was hung up on  then today  saturday  at     pm  what a piece of junk product and horrible customer service  save yourself a headache and buy a different treadmill      
919,3.0,                       wow   my husband bought this specific one because it was supposed to be easy to put together   it wasn t   it was a two person all day job   the directions were not clear and diagrams not very helpful   it was a lot of guesswork   but it got done then let s talk about ifit if i knew my husband bought something that locked down because they want money every month i would have put more research into this thing   we found a bypass to it but not without having to google and yoitune things because there is no work around in the directions it seems ok to walk on and that is what he wanted so let s hope for the best      
920,3.0,                       surprisingly loud   but sturdy and a good machine  very loud though and the engine whines when changing elevation  the console is massive and bulky  good for the price   i don t know  so far i can t get over how loud the darn thing is      
921,2.0,                       when i first got my treadmill i was pumped   i assembled it and began running  first inclination this was a big mistake was the incline went out about a month after i bought it  so i thought no big deal i can call customer support and troubleshoot  no  they ended up sending me a part in the mail and expected me to fix it  then about a month later i was running and it just stopped working  so i called nordic track again and after disassembling it while on the phone they said ok we will send you another part and i asked if i would have to fix it again by myself and they said no we can send a tech out  imagine if i never asked  which i didn t the first time  so now i have to wait      business days for a tech to call me then we will set an appointment  i m less than thrilled about my purchase      
922,4.0,                       i have thoroughly enjoyed my treadmill but it does have some set backs  i am glad with the range of speed  i however do not like that the arms do not move with the treadmill for the incline  when i am at the highest incline i have to slouch if i want to hold on  also  it was not that easy to put together and the pads on the arms of mine were not even so we had to force some pieces in place  overall i love it but the design could have been better      
923,5.0,                       i love my nordictrack treadmill   i did a lot of research before making this purchase   treadmills are pricey   i found the nordicktrack t     si and was thrilled with the price range and features   the treadmill shipped quickly through amazon and was easy to schedule delivery online when i read reviews before selecting this model  i saw that others complained about the size of the display screen and the range of the incline   i cannot disagree more   the screen size is perfect   the quality of the image is amazingly crisp and clear   also  for a novice walker jogger  the incline is perfect for me i also want to say that the ifit membership that is included with this product is amazing   i can take a walk through the tulip fields of holland or travel to the great wall of china   the work outs are challenging and fun   as you workout  the trainers share facts about the surroundings this was a great purchase and i would recommend the nordictrack t     si to any novice walker runner      
924,5.0,                       we bought this after having a baby and because we don t go to the gym anymore since the pandemic  we both jog about four miles per day  this treadmill holds up to our jogging and inclines great  it fold us nice and is a very sturdy machine  we are very pleased with the cost versus what we got  the company is responsive and offers a lot of good things in terms of service and workouts      
925,5.0,                       if the treadmill is as good as the packaging i will be very happy   this item was packed very well with lots of rigid blocking to protect the unit inside the box   really only a few components needed installed  side support rails  console and base support for when storing    i was able to do everything by myself except install the base support underneath the treadmill   took about an hour and a half   haven t used it yet but seems pretty solid   we only walk on it so it should be more than adequate for our use      
926,2.0,                       there wasn t information on the assembly that told you ahead of time that you would need two people to put this together   as a single woman in the pandemic  this created an immediate problem   after a week i found someone who could help me  though it was difficult with double masks worn to keep us both safe   many of the screws are difficult to get in because of the location and the angles   it took the two of us  my friend is a handyman  so it should have been easy  over two hours after i had spent at least an hour getting the initial steps out of the way   the location of the serial number is obscure before you have the entire unit assembled and can raise the treadmill easily   i have just gotten to this point   tomorrow i ll start using it and add more       
927,4.0,                       i had to wait a while for it to be delivered since the virus happened about a month  but that is the entire reason why i did purchase it  i no longer can go to the gym with   kids at home  we have the treadmill in our basement that we are remodeling  i choose the treadmill over the elliptical because of height to the basement  ceiling  i in particularly choose this model for the speed and incline options   and of course the price was decent   also wear the emergency clip for shut off  my dog was in the way one day and i fell while running  good thing the clip help to shut it off before zi caused some real damage to my legs      
928,4.0,                       i m very pleased with this treadmill as it meets my needs  the reason for only   stars was that it was a beast to put together  i would recommend paying the price to have a technician come to your house to put it together  the treadmill is very well made and heavy so it took two of us to put it together  it took close to three hours from start to finish  the price was excellent too  i was thrilled that it was delivered within    hours from placing the order onamazon  most retailers couldn t deliver their product from       days out      
929,1.0,                       ordered this a month ago  incline has not worked since i bought it  nordic track sent me replacement parts which i had to install  for incline motor and the main electronic control board  as this review shows i spent my time replacing both and surprise didnt make a bit of difference and now i have to wait until monday to get any help from nordictrack      
930,1.0,                       beware    do not purchase this product  especially through amazon    i purchased and the belt quit working in less than a month  i tried to contact amazon to resolve the issue and was only guided to nordic trac who never offered a live person   they kept me on hold and the automated messaging only referred me to troubleshoot which wanted me to remove parts to inspect the machine myself   i didn t spend over      to play mechanic   i ve tried to resolve this with amazon and they just say that i m basically out of my      restocking fee because i went beyond    days   i tried to contact them to no avail   so  they have great system going of screwing consumers out of hard earned    keep them on hold till    days is up and we keep all the money    so sorry for the inconvenience ma am   i don t want their pity  i want my   back for a faulty product             
931,3.0,                       all is good now    but bypassing the icon fitness online bs was a pain turns out it is easy when you know how    but they hide this and don t make it clear    had to spend time on the phone and finally getting tech that said     oh just hold the button down      sleazy marketing technique to get you to  subscribe  and pay more money      this kind of dishonesty soured my taste for nordic flex       wise up and be honest      
932,1.0,                       zero stars  the worst ever  it has been a nightmare  the treadmill powers on  but can t get to the start or welcome screen because a screen with a message  uh oh your treadmill stopped working because the safety was removed  this is frustrating because the safety key is perfectly placed  i did all the ifit process  paired the machine to my cellphone  the wifi is working perfectly  i m so mad i want my money back      
933,5.0,                       great treadmill   pretty much gym quality  quiet  wide track  good display  you can join the ifit thing first but then not pay for it  i like the manual programs ok  but it would be better if they had more  simple     minute ones   like  mins walk   mins run type of thing     
934,5.0,                       just received yesterday  took   people     hours to put together  we followed the instructions step by step and the directions were easy and accurate  screws are labeled well  had my first work out this am  felt good  enough cushion  i run everyday for about     hour i think it will be suitable for what i m doing and the price was great  when you have it set up you have to register warrenty online  takes about    minutes  it also has  ifit  and says you can t turn on until you go to ifit activate  you dont have to do that it costs    month  just hold down blue tooth or ifit button x    seconds and you will be able to turn on without registering for ifit      
935,1.0,                       owned for less than   month  got on the treadmill and noticed that the touchscreen was scrambled  would not recommend  amazon delivery and return service was great to work with      
936,1.0,                       based solely on the assembly experience  i would recommend no one expect to assemble this themselves   we encountered every possible problem   some screws the wrong size for the holes   openings were misaligned   several bolt sites were inaccessible  making it impossible to use ratchet sets or even conventional channel locks   we had to leave out two screws altogether in the plastic holders alongside the display panel because there were no pilot holes in the receiving surface   worst of all  one of the bolt holes was blocked by a metal spur so that we had to ream out the hole using a homemade tool   all of this took more than three hours and required us to devise makeshift tools to accomplish the assembly   this item might prove to be functionally excellent  but it was extremely poorly engineered and shoddily manufactured   we would never buy it again   so why did we keep it   because there was no feasible way to return a      pound item      
937,1.0,                       i am very upset at this product  not only did it took nearly   hours to assemble  the parts wouldn t fit well and it was very confusing   but the machine doesn t work  so mad  i did the ifit membership  entered my login  connected to wifi  then the screen just kept loading without going anywhere  also  the conveyor belt isn t working  we tried to start the machine but nothing worked  only the incline worked we are so pissed we spent a fortune on this  hours assembling it  and it s still not working  it s such a hassle getting everything fixed    i m chatting with a support tech right now with no end in sight  i would avoid buying this     nordictrack needs to rethink their product strategy and how so many customers have been complaining  they are probably wasting tons of   and resources trying to fix customers issues      
938,5.0,                       i like the integration treadmill has with ifit  this is so helpful for me since i am new using this sort of equipment  i think this integration makes this treadmill a smart treadmill if you don t want to continue using ifit after the trial you can still using the treadmill also there are ways to skip the trial and be able to activate the machine instructions to assemple this are clear i recommend having someone with you at the moment of assemble it      
939,3.0,                       the treadmill itself seems like it should work fine  though i ve yet to put it together   the box was pretty heavily damaged when i received it  i opened it to find that the plastic rail down one side of the track was completely broken  the end piece on the same side was broken as well   these look to be decorative and shouldn t affect the usability of the treadmill  i will be attempting to contact nordictrack to see if i can get replacement parts   i might ve caught it at delivery if the delivery company hadn t dropped it off on a different day than was scheduled      
940,4.0,                       machine works as expected  i ve only had it for       months  hopefully it will last a long time without problems  because if you read the negative reviews for this product you will find that nordictrack has extremely poor customer service  i almost didn t buy for that reason but fortunately so far i have had no problems  so far i ve been one of the lucky ones      
941,5.0,                       the entire unit is very heavy so we opened the box where it was delivered and took the pieces into the house individually   i read through the instructions which were fairly well written   my husband and i had very little trouble putting it together   the assembling of the wires from the control panel to the rest of the unit was a challenge not to pinch the wires but we took our time and it finally came together   we have only use the treadmill for walking  no running  and it works great   the speed and incline buttons are easy to use and very responsive   i am very pleased with this treadmill and very glad we purchased it      
942,4.0,                       i really like that the incline is very smooth as it goes up and down during your workout  i really love the ifit option  and use with with every workout  the trainer is able to control your treadmill during the workout to match what they do  but you can always change it manually  overall  i think it was a good choice for me and i recommend it   i do wish it would be able to fold a little smaller  but no idea how they would do that  also  the heartbeat monitor doesn t seem to work too well  but this was not a big deal to me as i use a wrist heartbeat tracker      
943,5.0,                       with so much options for treadmill in amazon  me and dad took a lot of time before we finally made the decision to purchase a treadmill  we stumble upon this product and we read the product description and it is the one we were looking for fast forward now  my family loves using it  we don t have to walk outside anymore  especially during these times  the treadmill itself was very sturdy and my partner was around     lbs and we was able to comfortable run  my dad loves the incline with just a push of a button overall i highly recommend this product and you should buy and try it      
944,4.0,                       i would give this   stars if they didn t try to trick you into signing up for an ifit account  all the documentation says in huge letters that you have to sign up to unlock your new treadmill  not true    after assembly just hold ifit button down for    seconds to bypass this scam  make sure treadmill safety key is in place or it won t work  also  there are lots of tutorials on youtube that show you how this works  otherwise a good machine  but lose the scam and let people sign up if they want   don t try and trick the into it      
945,1.0,                       so far  i spent half the day setting it up  then  they want you to  join ifit and become some social media influencer  the machine is locked and doesn t work at all  and i m going around in circles with nordic trak and their stupid  rd party app  whatever happened to just getting some damn exercise    do i have to share and data gather everything  next time i install a toilet will i have to buy a membership to ishit      
946,4.0,                       i got this last year in october and am using this very frequently since  this is a great treadmill for the price and absolutely worth the money for home workouts  the only thing i don t really like is the speaker output  it s very crappy and i can barely hear music when the treadmill is in use  treadmill itself isn t too noisy  just the speaker output is bad  if you are listening to movie dialogues you won t hear anything  other than that i really love this treadmill  it is also very sturdy compared to the others i saw in the same price range      
947,4.0,                       haven t had it long  but it seems solidly built  not a fan of them trying to force you to sign up for some exercise pay by the month app before you can turn it on but we found a work around so we didn t have to do that  not too bad to put together but some of the bolts were awkward to screw in  all in all seems like a solid piece of equipment so far      
948,4.0,                       overall i do like this equipment  it s smooth and easy to use  the incline is comfortable and the front and side rails are nicely located  i ve used treadmills that are difficult to comfortably hold onto   it s louder than i hoped and doesn t fold like i thought so it takes more space than i wanted  i didn t like that i had to register with the app  side note i didn t have to enter a cc for the  after the free trial   but i don t plan on using the videos available  i do recommend as long as you have the space and can deal with the noise      
949,3.0,                       my wife and i had the t    s delivered today  from start to finish parts were not lining up  the worst and ugliest is all the misaligned plastic pieces around the hand rails and controls  as the instructions state we started all screws bolts loosely and waited until instructed to fully tighten   one plastic screw hole was improperly sized  this screw was meant to lay flush and hold two pieces together  instead there s an ugly flappy plastic piece  overall very frustrating for a piece of equipment that cost              
950,5.0,                       the treadmill took some time to assemble but it s not ridiculously hard  toward the end of assembling  it does help if you have one person to help you with attaching the monitor controls and the folding mechanism  the free year of ifit is a great benefit and really is a       value for a family membership  it makes exercising a lot more fun and interesting  i also like the larger screen size on this model  my friend has the previous model and the screen size on this model really makes a difference especially when using ifit      
951,5.0,                       we have had this treadmill for   months now and we really like it  the box came pretty banged up but there wasn t anything wrong with any of the parts  a few days after we set it up and started using it  we noticed a loud squeak whenever it was stepped on  we contacted nordic track and their support team walked us through what could possibly be wrong  turned out it was just a loose screw by the motor   an easy fix  but they were very nice and helpful as we tried to troubleshoot the problem my wife uses this treadmill about every other day during our kids  nap time  she really likes it  it s pretty quiet for a treadmill and the ledge under the display screen is perfect for holding a phone or an ipad overall  if you re looking for something to run on during the winter months and don t want to spend an arm and a leg  this is a great purchase      
952,4.0,                       this is the best pandemic purchase ever      i am so happy with my treadmill and love ifit   it s amazing   the only thing i don t like  why i didn t give it   stars  was the screen takes several minutes to turn on and get to the workouts   it s very slow   although  i still need to register the machine and could probably call the manufacturer to see if it needs a new one or if i m doing something wrong   pretty minor overall ps   if you re debating over the   inch or    inch screen  like i did  go with the    inch     i can t imagine how tiny the ifit training workouts would look like on a little screen   you want big      
953,4.0,                       arrived broken  large plastic piece on the bottom front has a crack in it nearly its entire length  one cup holder was broken  side speaker piece broken  wires broken and not attached so it wouldn t turn on  instead of sending it back my husband rewired it  luckily he s great at that stuff  and it works perfectly fine now  i realize this probably voided the warranty  if everything wasn t broken i d give it   stars  it s actually a great treadmill for the price  maybe it d be better to buy directly from the company instead of amazon      
954,2.0,                       i purchased this treadmill about a year ago and have been fairly happy with it  aside from two major issues nordictrack ships this unit in an unusable  locked  state   they will not unlock it until you sign up for a trial of their     mo ifit service   if you forget to cancel within    days  they will bill the next year in full        to your credit card the treadmill worked properly for   months then stopped running   still under warranty  nordictrack replaced the control board  but they took approximately   months to do so given the forced sale of their ifit product and the failure of the unit within the first year  i can t give this product more than two stars      
955,4.0,                       the delivery was horrible    truck took out both our drive way poles that indicate with a light to stay on driveway   then they did not ask me as i was downstairs and did not hear them so my    yr mother told them to leave it inside so we had to get it downstairs   they should always ask for whom the delivery is for   then it says we had to activate it and sign up for the ifit  which is a credit card charge of     a month unless you can figure out how to cancel   we were able to bypass this scam by reading previous reviews   the machine fantastic but nordic track has some issues      
956,1.0,                       just purchased from nordictrack directly via amazon  received treadmill and has a defective roller  treadmill doesn t work    hours no exaggeration  on hold and told there is no guarantee because i bought it through amazon even though the seller was nordictrack  horrible company  told me i can t return it and get a replacement  so i bought a   ft paperweight  don t make my mistake      
957,4.0,                       pain to assemble  but the instructions are actually quite good and all the bits and bobs you need are nicely packaged and labeled with the number of the step to use them at  i liked the organization  follow the instructions exactly i e  don t tighten bolts until the instructions tell you to  for example  if you tighten the bolts at the bottom of the right and left uprights   which are the first things you put on    it becomes impossible to attach the pulse crossbar later  so you have to go back and loosen the bolts so the upright poles are loose enough to wiggle back and forth and attach the crossbar to all the complaints about the ifit  scam  are valid   it is quite misleading  but if you call the customer service number  a recorded message tells you to hold down the ifit key for    secs  if you go to ifit com activate  you can enter a garbage name and email  skip the credit card  then on the next screen they tell you to download an app   ignore that   just scroll down to the small print where they give you an option to activate without an app   click that  then they finally tell you how to hold down the ifit button for    secs  sheesh however the most important thing   don t forget to attach the red magnetic key before trying to activate the treadmill  otherwise it simply doesn t start  the activation instructions on the secret web page do mention the key  but the printed assembly instructions don t  it is obvious  but oops  i didn t attach in the key and the darn thing simply wouldn t activate  glad i finally realized it before losing my mind it s a decent treadmill overall  my kids love it too  it s fun to run on   i feel like i m at the gym      
958,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill  it has the best features  bluetooth  connects to ifit  foldable  not too complicated to assemble  and great price  the only con is it was a bit larger than i thought  my fault   we have a large ipad so a giant screen was not necessary  really  buy this  you will not regret it and do yourself a favor and get the ifit membership  the family membership allows my three teens and i to walk  jog  exercise in beautiful locales  my daughter has explored castles in france  another has run around ancient forts in portugal and i ve walked the beaches in hawaii then sat and meditated as the sun went down  we are all loving it      
959,1.0,                       in multiple places when you open the box this treadmill tells you that you need to register the product online to use it  initially i was okay with this thinking that it was a warranty thing or something  however  this means giving your credit card information to a secondary site and agreeing to a subscription service which you will then have to cancel  or not as they surely hope  after further research this is apparently not true even though packaging throughout the machine tells you this multiple times  had i known that the machine came with such predatory practices built in i would have not bought it it is rather overly complicated to assemble and that s coming from someone that is mechanically inclined  the packaging is frustrating and there s more tape than you can imagine  bolts are odd sizes that don t snugly fit quality wrenches and that s not confidence inspiring it does not stand straight up when folded and the mechanism that holds it up feels flimsy again i cannot overstate my disappointment with the machine in the sense that it demands that you register for a paid subscription service to even be able to use the machine at all  the machine that you ve spent a lot of money on  and although this is apparently a lie and there s a workaround that seems to make it worse considering the instructions demand you to register  this coupled with a rather complicated assembly and so so operation gives you a disappointing product i am very unhappy with this purchase and i will not consider a nordictrack in the future      
960,5.0,                       great treadmill  we purchased during quarantine and have been very happy with it   the only think i recommend is not paying the extra money to have it brought into the home  they dropped it in my garage and i have yet to get my refund we paid for the extra service   we just took piece by piece to location   but over all exactly what we needed     
961,5.0,                       this treadmill far exceeds my expectations  especially for this price range  the flexing frame significantly reduces stress on my knees and shins  the programming flexibility is awesome and allows me to customize my runs just the way i want them  quiet and smooth   we hsvexrhisxon our second story and i do not hear it running on our first floor when family members use it      
962,4.0,                       so ive waited about  months to review  to give you all a good idea  for the money this treadmill is awesome it has held  up well and that says alot being that i am     and    lbs the deck could be a little bigger but for easy of storage its great  my only  gripe  is you have to set it up and the  stupid fitness app it trys to make you download is a pain     
963,4.0,                       i purchased this treadmill after reading reviews and seeing most of the infrequent complaints were about registering for ifit  i had it assembled and was happy with service  read about holding ifit logo button for    seconds to avoid registering for ifit and worked like a charm no problems  i ve used it   times now and have been happy with operation  treadmill is solid and quiet works smoothly and folds easily  beware that as far as i can tell if you want to use bluetooth with speakers you need to go thru ifit  purchase a     mm male to male audio cable to get around this  easy fix  didn t give   stars because time always determines how happy i am with any product  will update later      
964,5.0,                       i read all the reviews and   getting past those about the fitness membership   i decided it sounded good enough to give a try  unpacking it  my heart sank a little   it seemed kind of cheap and flimsy  we set it up per the instructions  which were a tiny bit more complicated than maybe they could have been   disabled the fitness membership  as the other reviewers recommended   and i hopped on  i couldn t believe that i was on a treadmill in my own home because it felt just like the ones i m accustomed to at the gym  i got the less expensive model  so it doesn t have the fancy display  or a fan   but the deck is solid and flexible just like those treadmills that are  x the price  to combat the lack of fancy display i mounted an extra tv on the wall in front of it and plugged in a firestick so i could access virtual running videos on youtube  many mornings i now run on waikiki beach or the golden gate bridge  oh  and i set up a small fan in front of the treadmill to simulate those ocean breezes  this thing has been a lifesaver this winter helping me keep up the mileage when temps have been lower than ideal  just for reference  i m a slightly better than average runner    ish minute miles  about    miles a week    and this treadmill has been perfect  trust and believe  there are still good deals out there          
965,5.0,                       all in all  this is a great treadmill  i have zero complaints  i did a lot of research prior to the purchase and i get that there are better treadmills out there  quieter  stronger motor  etc  but for the price and what you get  it s a great buy  unless you re specifically looking for something that this treadmill doesn t have  this treadmill is more than enough for most people the year of free ifit is great  i thought it would be an afterthought  videos and whatnot seemed like they wouldn t be for me  but when you re actually doing a guided run hike  it s pretty great  the treadmill automatically adjusting speed and incline based on the video is so awesome my wife and i are probably      miles in  and the treadmill is working great  zero complaints  definitely recommend      
966,5.0,                       we purchased this product as a result of covid    and being stuck at home with minimal activity  it is the perfect size  not too bulky and quality made  what i liked most about this model is the    inch screen for the lower price  one thing i wish i knew prior to setting it up though  is that you need a strong internet connection for it to work  when first assembled and turned on  the screen was stuck on the ifit triangle logo  to fix the issue  perform a factory reset according to the manual  this is done by inserting a paperclip into the tiny hole at the top of the machine while another person flips the switch from off to reset  once we did that and connected to a stronger wifi  the product worked like gold   i love the ifit feature  it keeps me entertained and inspired during my workout  awesome treadmill      
967,3.0,                       the good  great treadmill  easy assembly  solid  works great  great treadmill for the price  if not for the ifit membership  i d happily give   stars the bad  you have to create an ifit account to turn it on  i then had to call to figure out how to run the treadmill without the ifit membership    push and hold down the ifit button for    seconds the ugly  nordic track called me a few days later and offered me an extended warranty if i create a positive review  they also offered to cancel my ifit membership and at the end of the call  they confirmed my membership was canceled  a few weeks later  my credit card was billed for the ifit membership   now i have to call them again and try to get the charge reversed      
968,4.0,                       most frustrating part of the purchase is having to deal with nordictrack to get this device initialized and up and running if i had known about having to give them personal information including a credit card just to make this machine active i certainly would have looked else where   you have to sign up for their ifit program in order to get your treadmill to work then you you have to cancel ifit prior to your    day free trial     they make it easy to sign up but much much more difficult to cancel your subscription      
969,5.0,                       i was surprised at how easy the assembly was  i am     and put the entire machine together by myself  i recommend putting the standing bar at the bottom on first instead of waiting until the end  the machine can easily be flipped to the side to put it on  this process is just easier before putting on the arms of the machine  especially if you are doing it alone overall the machine is sturdy and the free membership to ifit adds value  the screen is big and crystal clear      
970,5.0,                       i purchased this treadmill in july      and have been using it regularly for three years   i am a consistent runner and use this treadmill two   three times per week for most of the year  i prefer to be outside  but when i can t run outside  this treadmill does the trick  it is a sturdy  strong work horse  i run between         miles per hour for endurance  interval training and speed work  up to an hour ish per session  and have found no issues with the machine  changing speed and inclines is simple and quick  set up was fairly easy but it did take two people  my husband and i assembled it ourselves  with a minimum number of bad words  no  this treadmill is not as  soft  as commercial versions  but it is very serviceable   if you are looking for a well built  workable treadmill  this one will be perfect      
971,5.0,                       after finally getting it professionally assembled  i love it   it s user friendly  ease to walk on and definitely beats walking outside in the cold and or rainy weather   it also does an excellent job keeping track of your workout   i have not tried the ifit program or other features as i only wanted it for indoor walking      
972,5.0,                       i purchased this treadmill because i m not comfortable going to the gym anymore due to the pandemic  as a type   diabetic with other health conditions that place me in the  high risk  category  i just can t risk it  so  i turned my third bedroom into an in home gym with an elliptical  treadmill  and weights  this particular nordiktrack model  around       was steeply discounted as the newer version  around         recently came out  this is a substantial machine  not the least bit flimsy or cheap feeling  i can t speak to the ease or difficulty of assembly as i hired someone to put it together for me  but the treadmill arrived in perfect condition  no cracks  dents  or scratches  and functions like a dream  thanks to the reviews i read before making my purchase  i was able to bypass the ifit registration frustration others warned about  it s true  if you hold the ifit button for    seconds  you can bypass the ifit registration trap and immediately begin using your treadmill  overall  i am very pleased with this purchase  this treadmill is well worth the money      
973,5.0,                       my husband told me i was crazy to buy a treadmill  he said i would never use it  he was wrong  it gets used almost every day   even on nice weather days  we run outside and inside   this treadmill came with the ifit membership for a year in which   people can be on the account and create their own file  selecting their own workouts  training with an ifit trainer is so fun  my    year old is using it as well training to get his time shorter on his next real live  k  the treadmill works well following the trainers in speed and incline  it has a     incline  it is easy to assemble as my    year old and i  a    year old woman  put it together ourselves  easy to fold  but we don t really fold it because we use it so often  getting it when i did at     off  free financing with amazon credit card  and prime delivery it was an overall win for us      
974,5.0,                       we ve had this tread for a few months now and are really happy our purchase  the machine itself is quite compact for storage purposes and very easy to fold and unfold  i prefer running outside but between really hot summers and snow in the winter  having a place to run indoors during those times is great  very much looking forward to using this winter   i particularly like the incline speed buttons  i think as far as home compact treads go  this is one of the best options out there      
975,5.0,                       i wasn t really sure that we would use a treadmill  but knew with the weather turning hot and humid it would be better than walking outside   but  we use it almost every day   especially with the covid virus closing down our recreation centers   now we can walk and get our exercise while listening to music piped through the speakers or listening to the radio   this machine seems to be holding up very well   i had one slight problem  which will occur eventually   the belt eventually moved slightly   one quick email and i got a prompt response with instructions on a simple fix   i would definitely purchase a nordic track again if ever the need occurs   but  this one will probably last a long time      
976,5.0,                       we had our treadmill for over a month now and we can honestly say it s a good machine  it was a little hard to assemble by yourself and needed two people to help lift the machine out of the box and hold up the control panel the machine runs smoothly from slow to fast  the only issue we had is a clicking sound when you just sped up and activate the incline  but as long as we don t do both back to back  it s fine i use it for speed walking  hubby uses it for full on running  the delivery was simple and they came and delivered it into my room of choice for free      
977,4.0,                       i really like the treadmill as it has multiple different features you can use to exercise  i mainly use it to run and i like how it keeps track of my stats so that i know what i ve accomplished  my wife likes to use it to walk whenever we aren t able to go outside due to the weather  she enjoys the incline feature as it is realistic for us living in arizona  overall the treadmill was a great buy especially with the covid pandemic and working at home      
978,4.0,                       delivery was by third party with only   person when it s huge so wasn t handled properly and box was tore up  good thing packing insulation kept from most damage  couple scratches on bottom  frame  nothing major also  nordick try s to make you think that your treadmill  is locked with a big red sticker of warning saying it will not start until you go to  com activate where it s just to make you pay for a subscription for a bunch  of programs through them  which  is fine if you  want them  but  if not just  press and hold the  ifit button for    seconds and it will unlock and be ready  to go without  having to pay anything      
979,4.0,                       i was looking for a treadmill to run on as gyms were closed and to avoid people outside during these unusual times  i was expecting a decent treadmill  but my expectations have been exceeded with this treadmill the treadmill was delivered into my garage and i assembled it in about three hours  i only needed help from my son to hold it in the folded up position as i installed the pole that keeps it up   i did take some time making sure it was level  as my floor is not  the rear legs adjust out to adjust the rear height of the deck  the running mat did not need adjustment as it ran centered and does not slip i m a fairly experienced runner  and was in the middle of training for a marathon which of course is now cancelled  i m now running about    miles a week on this treadmill  and about    outside in the course of a week  what has surprised me is how much i love ifit  there are an endless variety of instructor lead workouts as well as the ability to create your own maps anywhere in the world  it really does take the boredom out of treadmill running and by creating a schedule for the week  makes you accountable to finish them  i just completed the boston marathon series which was broken down into five runs  each of     miles  really enjoyable and i let ifit do the pacing and incline as it seemed just right to me     challenging without being impossible  i also like the onboard fan   really works  well  speakers are not great  but quite sufficient because of that  i wish i had spent      more and got the     screen instead of the     it would be totally worth it with the incredible ifit content negatives other than screen size   the hr sensors on the grip handles are woefully inaccurate  but not a big deal for me since i have my own hr monitors that sync with the treadmill  no downhill incline on this model  not something i ever thought i would have wanted  but lots of ifit workouts have downhill sections in summary  i m very happy with the       price for this  but now wish had bought the next model up for a larger screen      
980,4.0,                       in full transparency  i have been offered a treadmill accessory by icon fitness to write a positive review  however everything i am writing below is      authentic and accurate the positives this treadmill is high tech and works beautifully for everything i want to use it for  we use it in our home and it is amazing for walking and running both inclined and flat  it comes with a year of ifit membership which includes video workouts for both running and walking  and while i haven t used them yet  they are easy to access and the treadmill tracks my weight  workouts  and calories burned for all past workouts  i have even sprinted on the treadmill and it works flawlessly  and i am over     pounds  the   drawbacks to my experience with the treadmill are    when i first used the treadmill the belt would  stick  a little when i walked  after over an hour of troubleshooting on the phone i was told that the belt wasn t properly lubricated at the factory and that i would have to pay to buy their specific lubricant from nordictrack  you are not allowed to use silicon based lubricants  which is every single lubricant on the market   this seemed wrong to me  if the factory didn t properly lubricate the belt  i don t understand why i am now obligated to fix that problem by spending more money with the manufacturer  i was assured over the phone that there was no way around this and it was now my problem to fix    as cool as the digital screen is  there have been a small handful of times when i have turned on the treadmill and the software failed to load and i could not start the treadmill  even by pushing the manual start buttons  i was forced to shut it down and power it up again in order to get it to start  i worry about what happens if eventually the screen doesn t load and there is no way to start the treadmill  i would have been just as happy without the screen and the software  like the treadmills at the gym where you just press  start  and the belt starts  there is an upside to the bells and whistles  but i worry that some day there will also be a downside that being said  the machine works beautifully and i am happy with my purchase      
981,2.0,                       when i received this product  after assembly  i could not use  my  machine  for it was locked by the manufacturer  to unlock  i was instructed to go to a web site  once on the web site  i was given no choice to unlock or register  instead i was forced to enroll in an exercise program  which was advertised to be free for a month   but alas like all fly by night businesses they demanded my credit card number  which i refused to do  i did not want such a valueless service  so i tried the numbers provided in the manual  and assembly instructions  also went to the internet under  nordictrack  for more numbers  in one of the numbers  they told me the process to unlock the machine with out having to establish an ifit account  that worked  all was well  until my console component had a defective finish  it worked well but looked bad  so i tried to contact nordictrack and not ifit for resolution of my defective product  at the end of days of fruitless attempts they all ended that in order to receive any service one has to have an ifit account  i went back to amazon for assistance  i can tell you that amazon has an exceptional customer service staff  unlike the non existent nordictrack  amazon had difficulty getting them to contact me and wound up giving me a rebate on the machine  from here on  i will never buy another nordictrack product  especially that now i know there is no support unless you pay for a valueless service  sure the first month free  but by the second wham you get hit because  you forgot to cancel it      
982,1.0,                       do not buy a nordictrack   they forced us to sign up for  ifit  at     a month just to use the damn treadmill we paid    for   we are furious   there is supposed to be a way to override it but after   hours on the phone with  customer service  getting no answer on how to use the machine without paying extra  we gave up and just paid the      this is a rip off don t buy it   horrible      
983,5.0,                       we bought this treadmill during quarantine to help us keep active  very easy to use and we haven t had any issues  it s a pretty quiet machine  i only wish you could turn up to volume when connecting your phone for music or tv shows  heads up  you will need   people to assemble to treadmill      
984,5.0,                       super quiet  easy on the feet and nice wide belt  i am so happy with this purchase  i debated on going cheaper but after using it for a few weeks i have zero regrets  easy to assemble as well  thank you to the person who tipped me off about the ifit bypass  i never had any intention of using it and as they stated there was no mention of using it without that app  they tried to make it seem like you must use the app to use the treadmill  you do not need it       
985,1.0,                       first treadmill we ordered came with a faulty motor  replacing it was an ordeal  amazon s fault   and the second treadmill also had issues  screen not working  unresponsive buttons   activation code doesn t work and i have spent combined hours on the phone trying to reach nordictrack costumer service to activate guarantee because i would rather avoid anything having to do with amazon s bulky items processes  but i am just wasting my life listening to waiting music     and the machine isn t that smooth or functional for the price  maybe this won t happen to you  but do you want to risk it      
986,1.0,                       the treadmill is an adequate and affordable replacement for my last one that was lost in a flood   what bothered me most was the required activation and subscription to an ifit service plan that i did not want   i came very close to returning the treadmill  but i decided to go through the process   i think this should have been disclosed and should be illegal      
987,5.0,                       great treadmill  i like the ifit option   not sure i am going pass the trial period though  folks one thing to nore here  even though its requesting that you sign up and activate your ifit account  entering the credit card details is optional  i just read and selected the option to enter it after the trial month haa ended      
988,5.0,                       we purchased this treadmill so we could stay in shape while we were stuck at home due to the pandemic   this treadmill is a great value and the touchscreen is just big enough to provide for a great workout   it was easy to assemble with the instructions provided and is holding up very well for the past   months using it daily for a few hours a day   the combination of the ifit subscription is perfect for providing awesome workouts that keep you interested and gives you the opportunity to see very cool places all over the world      
989,5.0,                       we had technician robert set this up  which was a super experience i love the features of creating your own walk run using google maps on the ifit app   didn t take long to get the hang of how to design the walk of your dreams and i have been visiting various neighborhoods in paris each day   the treadmill itself works perfectly and i feel       better getting in some exercise contrary to a few negative reviews you don t have to enroll in  ifit  if you just want to do your own workouts  but the first year was free anyhow   you need to register the equipment for the warranty but that is thru nordic track who then offers to switch you to ifit      
990,5.0,                       saved up for this product after reviewing numerous video and comments from other consumers  like my elliptical machine i had a professional come and assemble it  trust me it s worth the extra cost  used the treadmill shortly after the tech left was very satisfied with the product right away  the only issue i had was the belt was rubbing which created a irritating noise  the tech came back the next day and  adjusted the belt and now it runs smoothly  i love love the ifit option and will continue to use it after the   year subscription is up  overall it adds to my home gym and i couldn t be more satisifed        
991,4.0,                       i purchased this and scheduled a specific delivery date because i could be home  it was delivered early when no one was home leaving an expensive piece of equipment unattended for hours  fortunately it wasn t stolen  but when i arrived home the packaging was in tatters  it was clear that the moving company utilized to ship it had literally thrown it around  boards inserted for support were completely broken  and sticking out the bottom of the package  fortunately upon inspection of the item the only damage the treadmill itself had incurred was a small crack on the bottom casing that seems to be purely cosmetic in nature assembling was another monster  this is a two person job  and while the instructions all call for a    ths ratchet every bolt included is actually a     ths so make sure to have that unusual size handy then you have to activate your own property through an app you ll have to download and it will keep trying to get you to sign up for their monthly service rather than actually activating the treadmill so that is a problem in and of itself once you get it up and running though it does work very well  and you can fold it single handed to reduce the area it s taking up while not in use      
992,5.0,                       i haven t used it much but the few times it s been in use  it has functioned fine   so  i am grateful  pressing the foot pedal to lay down or raise up  is really easy  even with aching body parts  incline goes to      with only point is that there s a crackling sound like there s something inside in it way   but i ve notice the conveyor belt is slightly off to the side   i wasn t here during install and it never bothered me until i tried to put it on    incline without loud music in my ear  when not in use  i ve stored it upright and it s collected dust  lol   if when it wasn t covered by the treadmill cover      
993,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this nordictrack treadmill t   s and it was very easy to assemble   but when we started using it makes a squeaky noise  this noise is very irritating  i emailed and reported the issue  till this time nobody resolves it  i never expect this kind of services from such a reputed company like nordictrack        
994,5.0,                       i bought this because everything is currently closed and the wet washington winter is coming soon  i like that it has an elevation option so i can simulate a bit of a hike  i opted to not use the ifit app  other reviews say how to bypass that option   both myself and my spouse use it almost every day  i like that it has a feature that causes it to come back down slowly from being folded up so you dont have to fold it all the way down yourself  it is a bit heavy so get some help with assembly and moving it  its nice that it has built in speakers  although i wish they were louder       
995,3.0,                       i realize this is not top of the line but be aware it s a big piece of plastic  one big complaint is the belt keeps going to the left  there is a way to center it but the screw was stripped  i discovered you can walk on the far side and force the belt to move  we had an amazon contractor put it together  i would expect everything to line up  it doesn t i m happy i read the about the ifit program  nowhere does it mention you don t need to sign up  in fact  the opposite  to activate go to       buyer beware   however  i am using it  it works      
996,5.0,                       after reading the reviews  i was a little hesitant that i wouldn t be able to assemble this treadmill and figure out how to activate it  i am so glad i decided to get it  i built the majority of it on my own     f  in about an hour but there was a few steps at the end where it s impossible to do alone  i downloaded the ifit app which did not require i input credit card information unless i wanted to sign up for a subscription   i did not purchase a subscription  i am used to running on high end treadmills in a group fitness class and i was very impressed at the flexibility of the deck  it was soft in my knees and allowed me to run for a long period of time with no shin knee pain  i ve only used it a few times and will update comment in future if needed      
997,1.0,                       one star because i was missing parts and still havent been able to use it     i call norditrack for my parts and i m still waiting over a week for my parts  one part gets here today and i m still missing the rest of my parts  still havent even used the treadmill  norditrack told me rest of parts are on back order till feb     so irritated and wouldn t recommend  canceled order and amazon is picking up this junk this week         
998,4.0,                       fast shipping is a plus  the thing is huge and heavy so make sure if you have it delivered outside you have someone to help you bring it in  it took my husband several hours and a trip to the hardware store  one of the screws was the wrong type and wouldn t go in  to get it assembled  it runs well and has a good amount of space on the belt and seems pretty quite and very smooth  the second photo of our dog  he s short and long about   lbs  just put it together last night here s hoping we don t have anymore issues      
999,5.0,                       we paid to have an expert assemble the treadmill for us  but it did not take them that long to put it together  the only problem we had was our treadmill was including the ifit membership but there was no information on our membership and we had to contact nordictrack for support  they were excellent and hooked up our subscription by answering simple questions regarding our purchase through amazon  we are loving our machine  works well  is efficient and the classes on the machine are great  i like that we can have multiple accounts so i can track my workouts separately from my husband s  excellent treadmill that is not loud and works well      
1000,5.0,                       covid    and the temporary closures of gyms  i was motivated to buy a treadmill   i selected nordic track because of its high quality equipment  selection of treadmills and long standing reputation   i was not disappointed   i choose thet series     si because the space saver feature is perfect for me   now that i have my personal treadmill  i workout   to   times a week   whereas before i had to push myself to go to the gym   times a week  maybe   when i use the nordic track it s running smoothly and it s reasonably quiet   i m happy with my purchase      
1001,4.0,                       does what i expect it to do         make me run only   stars because the machine console shakes while running   i ve tightened and retightened several times to see if that s the issue  could be an uneven garage floor   i ve used a level  treadmill mat  increased decreased the leg height to ensure things are even  not sure  still shakes   if using the console panel to hold phone  it makes it tough to watch a movie due to the shaking   to overcome  i hang my phone from a shelf above treadmill to avoid the shake other than that  the machine is solid  feels good running on it   you can t feel the shake while running  only the console shakes   been using it   min a day at       no signs of wear and tear so far      
1002,4.0,                       this product works very well for daily exercise and has a variety of functions that lend themselves to that   was upset when i had to find a way to defeat the automatic sign up for extra services   you shouldn t have to find a way around it   delivery service  which i rated separately and received a refund for  was terrible and unprepared to do what they were paid to do      
1003,5.0,                       i absolutely love this treadmill  combined with the ifit program  i now enjoy everyday i get on the treadmill and  explore  a new part of the world with a trainer leading me on a hike in australia overlooking the ocean  or running through paris  or hiking in an amazing nature park in the states  the options of the programs are endless  so many options of workouts that i can t image getting bored with it would recommend to anyone  feels sturdy and runs smooth and quiet i opted to have it put together  for me so can t say how difficult it is to build  but the installer was very nice and got it done in less than an hour      
1004,5.0,                       i enjoying walking and exploring but had to curtail my activities due to the pandemic   however  once i received my nordictrack  this solved my dilemma   my first walk was through manhattan  in new york  which i loved   it was a brisk walk  with lots of site seeing   i took a similar walk when i visited new york  and this walk on the nordictrack felt totally realistic   i now look forward to more exploring the world walking on my nordictrack      
1005,1.0,                       my sister has had her nordictrack for years  so i thought this would be a great investment  the delivery company wouldn t bring it into the house  so don t believe the  one threshold  claim   the box looked a bit rough  but i thought it would be packed pretty good  the installer arrived and unpacked everything  first  the motor hood was broken and keeps sliding off  he said that happens in shipping sometimes  but it shouldn t affect functionality   the second issue would cause a problem  the upright wire was shredded  i m notifying the company so i ll keep you posted update  it s been two weeks since i was told new parts would be sent  i ve heard absolutely nothing  i d like to use this at some point        
1006,4.0,                       i purchased this treadmill during quarantine  so i wouldn t gain the quarantine     a big dislike  was that i did not have the option to have someone come in my home to assemble  but i understood since we were in the middle of covid   be aware that in the box this weighs roughly     lbs    there is zero way   women could lift   put in the house unless they re bodybuilders i had to have my brother   his friends lift   put in the house    it took   hours to assemble the treadmill itself is really great quality    i use it almost daily  but if you purchase this  opt for delivery   assembly  it was a nightmare to put it together also  the ifit membership is amazing  i honestly wouldn t use the treadmill without it  it s definitely worth the cost of membership  although the membership is complimentary the first year         
1007,5.0,                       i shopped for some time and finally landed on this treadmill   i was a bit nervous given the great price   concerned it might be constructed cheaply   that s not the case  it s built well and super sound   i run on it almost daily with no squeeks  wobbles or issues whatsoever   it also comes with a   month ifit membership  which i expected to disregard   however  after using a couple of times i actually signed up for a   year subscription   it s a terrific value and has helped me work out more effectively and ultimately ensure results   in short  this is one of the great values for a reliable  easy to assemble treadmill that you ll find anywhere   further  for a few extra bucks they delivered it to my workout room in my basement   best investment i ever made   it s heavy      
1008,5.0,                       delivery went smoothly  my husband and i assembled it in about an hour  it feels sturdy and the incline moves up and down smoothly  the speakers sound fine but i ve been just proping my phone up on the ledge to watch tv with headphones  it seems like that this machine was at the perfect price point   nice enough where it feels solid and comfortable but not so expensive that it has all these features i don t really need  this price also got us a machine that is a bit longer and wider so my      husband feels comfortable walking without feeling like he s going to fall off the end  would definitely recommend      
1009,5.0,                       this treadmill has saved me throughout the pandemic  i grew up with the treadmill in my house but my parents used to hang laundry on not work out on but then again that was a different generation and they weren t trapped inside their house during a covid meltdown  my wife and i have use this both every day since we purchased it and it has saved my sanity and well exceeded its value of what i paid for it are used to work out at orange theory four times a week and haven t been back to a studio since i bought this treadmill and i ve actually lost weight easy to assemble hardly any maintenance very quiet and a solid investment      
1010,5.0,                       i waited to write a review a few months after purchase to make sure i had some time to try things out  the treadmill is great   it did take a little time to set up  but wasn t overly difficult  i m not the most handy person in the world  i did run into an issue with some cosmetic damage during transit  customer service was great to deal with and i had replacement parts in a couple of weeks   i m by no means an avid runner but i m overall very happy with the purchase      
1011,5.0,                       i have been using this everyday since we assembled the treadmill   i recently had hip replacement surgery and with covid and temps over     i have not been able to get the workout therapy needed to build up strength in my hips   since using the treadmill  i have noticed my muscle tone gradually building up and i am able to get a good workout in at home without the hassle of a gym  or being outdoors with over     degrees      
1012,5.0,                       purchased this a month ago and love it i used to go to the gym daily  but due to covid  i haven t been back since february  i started to run and walk outside  but the concrete was starting to do a number on me  i m still not ready to venture back to the gym to use their treadmills  so i decided to get something for home i did a lot of research on treadmills and finally decided that this was the one nordictrack is a name you can trust and they make a very sound and quality product  this unit also has a very impressive manufactures warranty  this treadmill is great for the price  especially if you compare the features to other treadmills in this price range and below lower price treadmills had two features that turned me off  first  was the width of the belt  seems that lower priced treadmills had a     wide belt or less  that made me concernned that my arms were going to hit the support bars  this treadmill has a     wide belt with plenty of room to feel comfortable with either running or walking  the other issue that cheaper treadmills had were that their incline levels were manual  so before you ran  you had to physically lift the treadmill up and adjust the incline  which were usually   levels  and those levels did not provide an adequate incline  this treadmill has an electric generated incline with    levels and that is a far better option  it also has    speeds  which at this price level  is pretty impressive assembly took over three hours  there are videos on youtube that help walk you through the process and are very helpful  some of the screws did not fit  but eventually got them to fit  i assembled this by myself  having two people helps  but you can do it with one person  worst part was the very last part installing the hydraulic arm  just use a chair to hold up the belt and rollers and you should be fine make sure you maintenance the belt and rollers with silicon  which can be found for purchase on amazon  the more you use it  the more friction is going to affect the belt  needs to be lubricated every few months  not expensive only complaint is the display is a bit bright and bare bones  and like most people havd said the subscrition to ifit seems fishy  but that can easily be bipassed by holding the ifit button for    seconds are the treadmills at the gym better  yes  but they also cost thousands of dollars  and this treadmill does not feel cheap or inferior to those you would find at a gym  while running  its almost impossible to tell the difference  if you miss the feeling of running or walking on treadmills at the gym  this is what you need i would definitely recommend buying this  no regrets  except wish i would have purchased it sooner      
1013,1.0,                       the set up drives me insane  i just want to get on the flipping treadmill and run  you have to wait forever for the screen to load and then it doesn t pick up the internet and then you have to continue without wifi  the actual treadmill  once you finally get it to where you can keep track of the laps and the time  isn t so terrible physically   i think i ve discovered i would rather have something simple  i ve caught myself wanting to punch the screen a couple of times because i can t believe i ve made this purchase  i would not suggest buying this if you just want to hop on and go because believe me you will get tired of it quickly  the loading process is just terrible  if you have to have the fancy screen which sucks and you want to attempt for the wifi to pick up then sure      
1014,5.0,                       i bought the treadmill shortly after the covid    caused my gym to close  it arrived in the time stated  i had help with assembly and should have incorporated cocktails in the process and then maybe i d hagiven   stars for assembly  i curse it every time i walk by it but i get up at   a m  every damn day to do my walking  it has performed flawlessly and changes speed  incline etc  without a hitch  buyer beware  you do not need to subscribe to the ifit bs  read reviews to find the work around to that crap  all in all  very  very pleased with the treadmill even though i curse it regularly      
1015,5.0,                       i m very happy with this purchase  i m a larger guy  over   ft and     lbs  and this machine does a good job to not get  hung up  on my heavier footfall  it s been great to be able to roll out of bed and get right on the treadmill for a quick    minutes before i start my workday  i use the incline function quite a bit and really appreciate the quality of this unit versus other  home  treadmills i ve seen  i m not into all the extra stuff it comes with for digitally linking accounts to a phone app etc   so i can t provide feedback on that interface  but i can attest that the unit itself is structurally sound and of high quality      
1016,5.0,                       assemble   it was a little difficult to align the holes with the screws and to tighten it up folding   it is easy to fold up but tricky to unfold because of the area where you need to  step  on to release we have this treadmill in front of our sliding door looking outdoors  being it atlanta  the weather can get too hot and pollen count high  the incline and speed is like your  normal  treadmill at the gym we decided to do the ifit subscription and the synchronization from the app to the treadmill is great  i would recommend this subscription along with the product to enhance your workout      
1017,4.0,                       i did a lot of research before i selected this treadmill  i didn t want to spend a lot  but wanted a treadmill with at least a     x     walking running surface  this one works well for me with a     x     surface the treadmill arrived quickly but had several broken plastic pieces  side rail and associated parts  parts of the motor hood  and the base under the motor belt drive   this is a very heavy item  but i think the packaging could be improved to help prevent damage on the sides and corners  which is where most of the damage to my treadmill occurred i was able to order the broken parts within and hour and a half of delivery  it took       minutes to get the icon fitness customer service rep on the phone but once i did she was courteous and very helpful  the parts were delivered free i assembled as much of the treadmill as i could while waiting on the replacement parts  the assembly instructions were very good and i only needed assistance with another person when installing the lift assist cylinder  it took me no more than an hour and a half to assemble  i like that the parts screws hardware was packaged with their part numbers and corresponded to the assembly steps in the instructions my replacement parts arrived in three separate shipments which ultimately took a month to get all of them  i was able to begin using the treadmill after the second shipment of parts arrived startup was easy with the hints given by others to bypass ifit i have the   inch screen and it is perfectly fine  there are    workouts    each for calorie  intensity  incline  and speed   the speed and incline are controlled by the treadmill during the workout but you can override them to suit you or just make all settings in a manual mode  the incline is working well and can really make you work harder during your workout i wish the warranty were a bit better on the motor which is why i did not give the treadmill   stars  there are other similarly priced treadmills with better motor warranties but overall i think this is a very nice treadmill  i was able to get it at a very good price  if you ae considering it i suggest checking the price on amazon each day and waiting for a sale      
1018,4.0,                       the treadmill is amazing  but one thing you should know is that if you plan on using it with bluetooth headphones completely wireless  you won t be able to  i have the jabra elite   t active and i bought them just to use them while i workout  but when i use them on this treadmill  it interferes with my headphones and i just hear static the whole time  i found out it does it with almost all types of bluetooth headphones that are completely wireless  so that s something to keep in mind  wired headphones work fine  but completely wireless will mess your ears up and won t be able to hear your music comfortably  also  keep the pulse reader clean  it seems to be some cheap metal that gets rusty fast  the speakers on the treadmill are bad  don t even think about using them for music  lol  other than that the machine is amazing though  highly recommend it      
1019,1.0,                       this treadmill is by far the worst thing i ve ever bought on amazon  the treadmill never functioned properly and was even scuffed up  plastic motor cover  like it was a refurbished product though i bought brand new  the belt skipped so bad my husband almost hurt himself attempting to run on it  icon fitness refused to send a replacement machine and only offered fixes like  let s try having you lube it   they finally agreed to replace a part after my second or third call on hold for hours  the part never arrived  when i talked with a rep i was told the past was in  quality control  thankfully  amazon customer service was awesome and agreed to take the treadmill back despite being past their return policy i don t know why this piece of junk is amazons top pick  but i d imagine it has more to do with a contract then people actually rating this treadmill   stars do not buy this treadmill  i repeat do not buy this treadmill      
1020,5.0,                       overall the treadmill was easy to assemble   i did it by myself after we got the pieces moved to the  basement   the platform part is quite heavy and i had to have help with that  i m a    y o  woman    once i got it     assembled i quit   i cannot move it anywhere else and folding it up is unnecessary so i did not do that part   it works very well and is very enjoyable to use   i have never used any other treadmills  so i can t compare it   it came with the ifit membership which i didn t like and won t use  but it isn t required just to use the unit      
1021,5.0,                       this treadmill is everything i was expecting it to be and more not only it runs smooth and it s very quiet  it also has an enormous variety of workouts pre loaded and great videos of runs in different locations that will make time pass fast even when you re working out at home and we all know how boring that can get it also comes with a free   year membership to ifit which for a fitness committed person is a great perk i was reluctant at the idea of buying a tm because i hate not running outside but i ve had a lot of fun on this machine and i think we ll be friends for many years to come         
1022,4.0,                       this is a nice treadmill   it is basic with no bells and whistles   it is not blue tooth compatible unless you buy the ifit plan  but that is not a big deal for us   there is no fan  which is also not a big deal for us   we chose to pay to have it assembled and the assembly team arrived timely and were very nice   they didn t try to sell us on the ifit plan  they simply told us to hold the ifit button down for    seconds and the treadmill would work   we have used it a lot and we like the     belt as opposed to a smaller one   very satisfied with the treadmill      
1023,2.0,                       i am a fit female and it took   people to set this up and   hours   after set up  machine was locked until you subscribed to minimum        month program  that is the push  don t fall for it  push and hold bluetooth button for    seconds and it will unlock  had to get a customer service to tell me this   a bit of a scam if you ask me    not too happy with the thickness of belt  seems flimsy  not impressed with nordictrac for               
1024,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this treadmill is great   i got free assembly from amazon   i was able to start it manually just by holding the ifit button for    seconds   i didn t have to create an account the floor is firm  yet has a nice cushion to absorb pressure when running      
1025,3.0,                         stars for misleading packaging disclaimers re  ifit  treadmill arrived today  assembly instructions well written  straightforward  no real time spent on it yet  so cannot attest to overall quality  will review after time   but seems very solid for an entry level treadmill from a reputable company  that being said  there are multiple disclaimers on packaging indicating unit will not function until you register sign up for an ifit plan  this is misleading false  to bypass  once assembled  power on unit hold ifit logo on front panel down for appx        sec  this bypasses any need to register unnecessarily  and unit will function as intended  again  the packaging would lead you to believe you must register with ifit  this is misleading and incorrect  unusual that nordictrack  a company with a very solid reputation would do this without informing consumer      
1026,5.0,                       this treadmill is a fine purchase  don t bother paying for additional shipping options  we paid to have it delivered to the room of our choice and got it left at our door  amazon would not refund our money  that aside the machine does the trick  not a lot of bells and whistles but provides a smooth run  i ve had it up past  mph with no problems  we also bypassed the ifit program by calling the number on the treadmill and saying we didn t have internet access  my only complaint is that once you center the belt it moves with use and becomes off center  you just have to adjust it every so often  not terrible  overall  pleased with the purchase  does the trick when the weather is bad and i don t want to run outside      
1027,1.0,                       very poor customer support  shortly after purchasing i one day started to hear a squeaking sound  customer service refused to send a tech to look at it even though it s under warranty      
1028,5.0,                       i got my treadmill in about   weeks before i broke my hand  thankfully it is so easy to fold that i can do that with   hand  as for ifit  i have never found a program that makes me so engaged as the ifit app does  i don t even care to try to figure out how to use the machine without the app because there are so many places to explore and so many talented and knowledgeable trainers that keep me      engaged  i love being able to do a work out and then get so wrapped up in learning about the geology  history  and views of foreign countries and cities that all of a sudden the work out is done  i am currently doing the iberian beginner running series with tommy rivers puzey and i can t recommend his program enough the machine is nice and stable and i have had very minimal glitches with it  mostly  it occasionally doesn t want to start the video right away and i have to close the app and reopen it  nbd very satisfied  very much worth the price      
1029,3.0,                       for the amount spent on this treadmill i feel like their should be a little more into it  it was heavy and a little annoying to put together as expected but the plastic and some parts feel too flexible  flimsy you d think it would be strong heavy duty plastic  although once together it feels a little more sturdy  i really wish it was a little more tech advanced like with bluetooth enable and able to have apps like youtube  it s a little loud too while warm up walking but once running it s not too annoying  i really like this treadmill but i think they over priced it a couple hundred      
1030,5.0,                       i was looking for a treadmill that i would actually use not just as a clothes hanger  and i quickly realized the cheaper options were not going to cut it  i came across this model  and the description sounded perfect to me  wide belt  automatic incline  easy assembly  free delivery  and hydraulic assisted unfolding  the motor is quiet  and powerful enough for my needs  speed         miles   although i can take it up to speed     customer service is great  as i already used them soon after my delivery  the hood cover broke during shipment storage  and i called to see about a replacement  both amazon and nordic track were on top of it  and they shipped out a cover within a few days free of charge  one complaint is the display is a little hard to read if the lights are not bright enough  sure you can read the time and distance  but if you want to change speed or incline  i have to really look hard  the other complaint is that with this kind of money spent on a treadmill  they couldn t even add a charging port for my phone  smh  great treadmill otherwise  would buy it again      
1031,3.0,                       i m giving this three stars due to several factors one of the screws included in the assembly packet was a defective screw  once the product was assembled it was still not very sturdy and it also was not level   the process to get the machine activated and to use it without ifit is a headache i wouldn t reccomend it but if you do go with this treadmill be sure to pay the extra for expert assembly to save you the headache  also be aware of the hoops you have to jump through to activate and then deactivate ifit if you are not interested in a monthly premium workout program      
1032,2.0,                       just got this machine yesterday  assembly was relatively easy  and the machine itself runs smoothly  the major issue is with start up  nordictrack wants you to sign up for its ifit service  which is     a month  my wife used it first and the treadmill easily paired to her phone  she was able to start up the machine and take off after just a few minutes  i went next and had a completely different experience  i downloaded the same app  but my screen looked completely different than hers  i also wasn t able to pair until my wife disconnected from it first  even paired to the machine i could not get it to start i went online to try and troubleshoot and nordictrack s website which indicated that something was wrong with equipment and needed to replaced  fortunately  my wife found on a review that if you hold down the ifit button for    secs the ifit system eventually shuts off  this is indicated by the light turning from blue to green  once that happens the machine works exactly as it should      
1033,5.0,                       i ve been a runner for     year but i admit that running in high hear  bitter cold or heavy cold rain is not my thing  i was looking for a treadmill that won t break my budget and helps me keep going  a friend got this one and highly recommended it so i bought it  best decision ever  my significant other installed it in an afternoon  we have been using it for the last   months regularly  he s mostly power walking but i m running  hiking  you name it  the ifit app keeps me entertained and gives me the opportunity to virtually travel to places where i only dream to go while i train  highly recommended      
1034,5.0,                       it has been about   months since i ve been using this nordictrack treadmill  so far so good  i like the folding technique as it is fairly easy to store when not in use  it runs smoothly and the incline is a nice touch  the only downfall would be the set up process  it took me a couple of hours to setup but if i had someone else helping me it would of taken less time  overall  a pretty nice product      
1035,3.0,                       cant use the screen if you dont have internet connection  so basically your buying a good treadmill with a white screen and an arrow in the middle of it      
1036,2.0,                       our brand new treadmill arrived with a bent frame  we didn t realize this until the treadmill was assembled and the base was off center by several inches  we have contacted nordicktrak and are supposedly going to be contacted by a technician to repair our brand new treadmill  it has been over a week  if it wasn t so large and already assembled  it would have been returned  i can t blame nordicktrak  it was probably damaged in shipment  they do have our money  and i am still walking outside      
1037,3.0,                       while the treadmill is nice  the ifit application almost ruins it and their customer service doubles down  cant even activate your treadmill unless you go through ifit for whatever reason which was an aggravating process in itself then be prepared for multiple emails a day  when simply asking to unsubscribe to the emails  i was informed they had to delete my whole account thus removing me from the free month  then chat closed  ifit is a horrible experience the treadmill itself is pretty nice and gets the job done however  its a shame they are linked with a company like ifit     
1038,1.0,                       do not order a nordictrack unless you are prepared to do all the work on it yourself   my belt wasn t adjusted properly on install   i bought a   year maintenance plan that says it covers in house work   but they will refuse to honor that   you are on your own   one day you are going to have to change the belt   you have to disassemble the whole treadmill to do this if you are an expert treadmill technician then go for it   otherwise do not purchase a nordictrack      
1039,3.0,                       an extreme hassle to put together  takes way longer than expected and not too many of the pieces holes actually line up  not all the told are included  instructions get a little iffy  do not toss any of the screws they tell you too until you are completely finished   you will be asked to reuse some of them later on  i always keep mine just in case   theres an additional wire on the base part of the treadmill and the screen that is not listed anywhere in the instructions or online  do we connect this  or not  also weighs     pounds so i d pay someone to deliver it and bring it in  will take two people to put together  someone you trust and can politely feud with over the idiotic design of how to put this together   not everything is tight and not all screws will go in  i would start with step       first as it has to do with the bottom on the treadmill  they want you to put the entire thing together and then put the bar in on the bottom that holds it upright for its store away design  don t be fooled  someone will have to manually hold it up as someone fenagles the putting together of the bar set up  it isn t fun  it s heavy and arduous      
1040,3.0,                       i purchased this treadmill to use during the winter months  given that gyms are closed  the treadmill is great when it works  unfortunately  the treadmill console stopped working about    days after receiving it  just in time to not be able to return it   nordic track customer service was unable to help and directed to me to a third party called ifit who determined i probably needed an entirely new console  the console will take     weeks to get here  and they did not guarantee it will work  the treadmill will not turn on at all  this means that after    days of owning a treadmill which i used maybe    times  i already cannot use the treadmill  will update if there is any improvement with new console      
1041,3.0,                       i use this for walking   miles per hour  hard stuff  i ve walked    miles  the belt no longer works  excellent value for the price    took forever to arrive  broke almost immediately  love it edit  i fixed it myself  the belt came off of the motor connecting the machine to the treadmills belt      
1042,4.0,                       so far  so good  runs smooth and relatively quiet  we use it mainly for walking  but it also provides adequate performance for moderate running  please note that it is a heavy piece of gear  and requires two people to lift  assemble  and or move from one location to another  you ll need quite a bit of clearance and space to store this away between uses  otherwise  expect to add it to your home as a permanent piece of furniture      
1043,1.0,                       the assembly was a pain  when i got to the upper part of the treadmill the pulse bar would not align with the uprights  little did i know that they added two right handle bars   instead of left and right handle bar  i would not understand why things were not aligned  i tried hard to make it match but it was impossible  after   hour of trying to align everything  i found out that is was a part error and i was given two identical handle bars  i had two cheap proform treadmills over    years  with no problems  i upgraded to a better brand  just two find out that nordic track does not know how to include the correct parts for their treadmills in the factory  very disappointing     i called support but they don t work on saturdays  of course  stay clear of this sloppy company      
1044,5.0,                       i get terrible shin splints no matter the shoe or running service  so far  nothing  run walk on it   times as a week  so far so good  yes  fan is noisy  but other than that  all is good  note  we didn t sign up for the ifit program as we are usually overseas  and it still works fine  we just use it on the manual setting  it gives me all the info i need  we have one small issue with the heart monitor  and they shipped us the replacement part very  very promptly  no complaints  just a great running experience      
1045,1.0,                       i recently bought the nordic track    s   both me and my wife have been using it for    minutes every day and it was running ok for a month i am   ft     lbs and my wife closer to     lbs  i guess i should have been skeptical and put a little bit more faith in the critical  negative reviews  it broke down after a month and customer service is very poor  can t even get to the customer service after waiting on the phone for more than an hour never will buy anything from nordic      
1046,5.0,                       first off  pricing on this treadmill was a great deal  i have rated it   stars as     is not possible  i love how easy it is to fold up and drop down  i also put a lot of pressure on the locking strut without lifting the base any further to test how it would hold up if it was accidentally bumped  it didn t budge  you actually have to push the base up a little more to disengage the lock assembly was fairly straightforward and the instructions were very detailed  i marked it   stars under assembly as the box was not holding together very well once delivered and some of the plastic pieces are cheap fragile  navigating downstairs with a heavy treadmill no longer in its box proved difficult  the plastic cover for the motor incurred a little damage to   of the   internal screw hole locations  luckily the nuts used are the little metal clips that are slid on  there was still about half the plastic for them to hold onto  so i was able to put the cover back on with no visible damage or issues  other people may not be so lucky  so be careful with the plastic parts if you are assembling this yourself as for actually using the treadmill  it is great  the incline action was a little louder than my wife expected  but doesn t bother you once you are listening to music  the speed adjusts quickly and we love the quick select options to adjust the speed even more quickly  great for manual interval  sprints   if you want to bypass the ifit on this particular model  be sure the emergency cord is attached and then just hold down the ifit button for like       seconds i highly recommend this treadmill for others than want quality without all the unnecessary bells and whistles of some others      
1047,5.0,                       i had a cheap and flimsy treadmill because it was free  and i didn t want to spend money if i wasn t going to use it   well  i didn t use the cheap and flimsy one because it was too hard to use   you definitely get what you pay for   assembly took my spouse and i   hours   i want to thank everyone who left reviews before us   you do not have to register with ifit or anything before you use the treadmill   we put it together  pressed and held the ifit button for    seconds  and have been using the treadmill with no problems ever since   i have been using it every day for the past week      
1048,1.0,                       norditrak used to be a reputable company   we purchased this treadmill because of their reputation   i was shocked to find i had to sign up for an ifit membership in order to use it   well  i found out you don t through work arounds on amazon and youtube but after i activated it   it s infuriating that in order to use the product you bought  they make you think you have to buy another   for       they should have sent a thank you note and  complimentary bottle of wine  not tried to scam you into buying something else      
1049,3.0,                       the side bars weren t aligned so wasted time screwing all the nuts manually  no biggie but i suggest to check the side bars first for misalignment and if you re worried if the treadmill even works you could also try connecting the head and having it run by itself before full installation   luck of the draw i guess  expected more from nordic      
1050,5.0,                       i ve done a lot of searching before i decided to purchase this one  and i believe this model is a good balance between budget and features it took two adults a whole night to assemble  the instruction can definitely be better  and i had to revise some steps which was frustrating  the activation process was kind of hassle  i had to go to ifit and leave privacy info there before i can use it my family and i have been with this treadmill for months   so far so good   we re satisfied with the quality and features  it s sturdy  quiet  and with the adjustable incline it really helps to burn the fat      
1051,5.0,                       great and does what a treadmill is suppose to do  during assembly the pulse bar didn t fit but with some elbow grease it was made to fit warnings  the treadmill does not gradually go up in speed so if you press a number it will go to that number immediately so don t be an idiot and complain that you were injured  it s a treadmill not a toy it has running pieces try not to get caught in it      
1052,4.0,                       i had nordic trac for over   years and it conked out  i was looking for a treadmill as quick as i could  i needed to workout i bought it on amazon  quick delivery  and amazon serviceman  he was very good fixed it up  i have been using it for about a month and it is very good  just a little noise  nothing to worry about  i have not tried all the programs  there are many  i am still doing my straight manual work  it is slightly less wide than my old nordic trac  but that is fine  no problems  i hope it continues to work out without any problems     
1053,5.0,                       this was delivered to the room i wanted it in assembly was straight forward and pretty easy there are a couple of things you need a second person to help hold stuff mounting the display is one and installing the gas shock to the fold up platform was the other this treadmill is well made and solid  no wobbling around as you us it more programmed functions than i will ever use my wife and i use it    minutes every day just starting out and increasing to   hour every morning i have ran on it but i m not in good enough shape to run long i bought it because  while i have to get old i do not have to be fat down    pounds and counting will pay for it s self in   months of our old gym membership      
1054,2.0,                       the treadmill is fine  it works like any other treadmill  just more expensive  the reason i bought this over any other treadmill was because i loved the idea of the ifit stuff where you can hook up to a tv and have it show you running through different parts of the world while the treadmill matches inclines of the view  what they don t tell you is that to get that option  there is a required module that you need to buy from ifit for       before shipping and tax  to get the option  i m pretty bummed      
1055,5.0,                       i absolutely luv this machine and once covid    hit and the shelter in place begun  i was extremely happy i had it   i am able to workout around the world in the most beautiful locations in the comfort of my home   another reason i bought this one is the ability to fold it up and use less space   i actually rarely use this now  as i just leave it open but it s still a great feature to have for when i need it   i use it daily and love the ifit workout library   i have a free year but plan to keep subscribing once it expires next january  i highly recommend this machine  great price  great quality   value    worth every penny      
1056,5.0,                       i read a ton of reviews for treadmills  this one is wonderful  i use it for running daily  it is sturdy and comfortable to run on  it says the ifit is something you have to do  if you hold down the button for a few seconds it will start without paying for that subscription  it is extremely heavy so i recommend at least paying the extra money to get it in the room you want  i ve been very happy with this and it is very easy to operate      
1057,5.0,                       my main goal is to walk  i ve lost    pounds by just walking and counting food points  i ve have     more to go  the weather isn t always cooperative where i live and i don t want to join the gym  the treadmill is easy to use and has various preset walks without an ifit subscription  i use my iphone to track my steps which ends up in my pocket and it tracks my mileage steps for ww activity points  the ifit is an app for an iphone cell or pad  not super thrilled to pay for a subscription to watch scenery on my phone plus not have it sink with ww  other than the ifit subscription which one doesn t have to have  this is a perfect set up      
1058,5.0,                       buyer beware  you can use your treadmill without registering with ifit  don t get scammed you can get around registering for ifit to get around this scam  hold down the ifit logo on the treadmill for    seconds and your treadmill will work it works     
1059,5.0,                       took a while to receive but fully met my expectations   only problem was that it came locked and the instructions stated the only way to unlock it was sign up for ifit program which requires a credit card and includes automatic monthly renewal unless canceled by purchaser   fortunately i read reviews which explained how to bypass that by pressing the hidden switch underneath the ifit logo   now works like a charm without the hassle of canceling the ifit program or paying a monthly fee      
1060,1.0,                       the treadmill comes preloaded with ifit  an icon brand  which is effectively subscription ransomware  nordictrack  another icon brand  tries its best to make you think that you need to sign up for an ifit subscription before you can even use the treadmill  luckily  other reviews on here pointed out you can hold the ifit button down for    seconds to clear the system and actually use it  i feel like i should make a trip to      s      w logan  ut to have a little chat with them face to face  regardless  i ll never buy anything associated with icon ever again      
1061,3.0,                       you cannot get a human voice by calling              or               if you go to norditrackservice com you will see ad announcing that the name  nordictrack  maybe for sale  if you go to ifit com you won t find any useful information  forcing customers to subscribe to an unwanted service in order to unblock a machine you paid good money for should be illegal      
1062,1.0,                       free    month ifit membership was what helped sell me on this product  so i bought it  delivery came with a promo card for the    month membership  the promo card was declined as ineligible on the ifit website  i ve reached out to amazon and the manufacturer to fix this  and i ve received nothing but triangulation and passing me to the other entity  shouldn t be my job to fix this problem  i paid   k for this  and now i m spending my spare time trying to fix their problem  figure it out or don t offer the service  will likely return unless i get some help from someone soon      
1063,5.0,                       we are thrilled with our nordic track purchase  it was a big purchase for us and we ve been thinking about for a few years  we are so glad we finally did it i love the interactivity with ifit  the videos and trainers are a blast  i especially love being able to walk and see places all over the world when it is bitterly cold and cloudy outside here  getting it into the house was a trick  and getting back where we needed it required some ingenuity  but it wasn t too hard  make sure you get the delivery people to get it inside your door  we then opened the box and took the pieces to the room we wanted we saw comments about not being able to use it without ifit  but i use it on manual mode often  a member of our family is working through long term illness so sometimes they need control over speed and incline  the manual mode is ideal for that again  we re super happy  if you want to walk or run inside  this is a great machine      
1064,5.0,                       home gym for two adults and one pre teen  it s been two months now  i run daily     miles  hubby and son walk daily     miles  nice and steady at a fast pace  my max     great incline  but not as high as others  speakers suck but that s not what i bought it for  i was more worried about loud squeaking noises  hasn t happened yet   display is nice  ifit was nice to have  but i don t use it enough so it s been cancelled  the built in intervals  without ifit  are awesome   i put it together myself  but i would recommend that you have someone around to help  i would not hire someone to do it because it s really not that difficult  i will update this review if anything changes       
1065,5.0,                       delivered on time  paid extra to have it delivered to a room  put it together by myself  i felt like not tightening screws per instructions  was the key to get parts to fit   particularly by the console  take care to not pinch the cords  follow the directions  read many reviews before buying this treadmill  and this was my third choice  first was a         bowflex  second was a         nautilus  then this one  three hundred dollars off was too good to be true and the reviews were very helpful  bluetooth works great  fan is ok  relatively quiet  did not use ifit and probably won t due to the negative comments  added maintenance plan for   years overall i am very pleased   exercising  patience helped me get a good deal      
1066,5.0,                       honestly my favorite purchase of my life  the girl who fell and got all rug burned     had to have it cranked up without the safety stop clipped to her  obviously  that s dumb  don t do dumb things  lost    pounds so far  now i hate days i don t workout  amazing machine for the price      
1067,5.0,                       excellent treadmill  fairly easy to assemble with some care and time  product is extremely heavy which tells you that it has good bones  not very easy to maneuver especially if you don t want anything to happen to your wood floors or heaven forbid linoleum flooring  just take your time and be patient if you have to move it  ideally you have a second person to assist you so as to ensure no damage  overall  product is far better than anticipated  works very well with multiple adjustments you d expect from a high end treadmill  which in my opinion this is      
1068,4.0,                       you don t need an ifit account to make it work   make sure he red key is in place  and then press the blue ifit button and it starts immediately   nice little machine  delivered on time  needs   people to assemble  me and the hubby finished in about an hour   it folds up and has a great feature where it folds open slowly instead of slamming down  which made me worry  i have littles  can t wait to use it      
1069,5.0,                       if you are looking for a relatively compact  inexpensive and functional treadmill for your home gym  this is a great choice   we have been using it for the last three months and it has been a great experience   we use it on average   to   times a week for about an hour each time   some negative reviews mention the ifitness setup after installation  there is a way to bypass the ifitness app by holding down the  ifit  button for longer than    seconds   i learned this by reading the reviews before purchase and it worked like a charm   if you don t take the time to do your research online and read the reviews before buying a product like a treadmill  you should not be shopping online   the speed and incline setup is very easy and straightforward from   to      the cup holders are big and nice for me to put down a water bottle and a towel   when i am running on it  it is very sturdy and doesn t shake   it is just big enough to feel comfortable on it but not too big where it fits nicely in the basement corner   you can fold it up if you need extra space when not using it   it is very easy to fold and unfold   personally i don t need all other frills that come with the treadmills that cost        such as a built in fan or tv screen   for the price of under       we have been very satisfied with this treadmill      
1070,1.0,                       no easy start button   i seldomly write a review  but this really made me angry   while other reviews claim you can start your equipment by holding a button    seconds  i wasn t able to do it   so i had to create a  free  account to get the machine started   well  the account is not free   it s free for    days  then they charge you      year membership   a very sneaky way to push a membership on you   beware when you purchase  and if you do  and want to cancel   go to your name on top right corner of page  click on settings   then on membership plan   for this reason   this product deserves a no star   as it is deceptive      
1071,5.0,                       everything works so far  it s not the easiest thing in the world to build  some of those bolts are difficult to get in  also  you keep in mind that you will have a huge box and packing materials to deal with afterwards   but most diy ers should have no issue  it s solid  not too noisy  no detectable smells   i d say it s very near the  feel  of the higher end  professional gym  models which is quite amazing based on the significant price savings herethe ifit was very unpleasant to have forced upon me but luckily you can hold the ifit button to bypass decline it  i may or may not check it out but anything that is forced upon me by a manufacturer  cough  laptops  cough  has a bad headstart i ll be back after a while to update my review  even if it s to say how good of a coat hanger it is  hopefully not that      
1072,5.0,                       after reading all these negative reviews about ifit and the treadmill being damaged upon delivery  i was a little hesitant to buy it  but it was on sale so i figured i would gamble  took us only about an hour to assemble and instructions were very clear  i m not sure why everyone is saying your treadmill will not work without ifit  we plugged it in and turned it on and i ve been using it for weeks with no problems  it never asked anything about ifit when powering on  i would definitely recommend this treadmill      
1073,5.0,                       i was desperate  my tready broke during the pandemic and options for replacing were slim to none  i found this treadmill but the need for ifit registration has me skeptical  well    i ve had mine over the    day free trial and literally nothing has changed in how i use it  i used the ifit program once  it s not my jam  i need upbeat music and visual stimulation  smart tv  i can t do the motivational trainers lol  point being  it s a great machine  no problems as of yet     days in  daily use      
1074,1.0,                       update  after waiting another week for the missing part to arrive  we were able to assemble the treadmil  unfortunately it does not work because other parts were improperly assembled at the factory  nordictrack customer support has been notified  but they are mia after a week of waiting for the treadmill to arrive  it could not be assembled because the package included two right handrails and no left handrail   after    hours on hold with nordictrack  i m now waiting another week to    days for the missing part to arrive      
1075,4.0,                       i d really like to rate this     stars but i suppose i ll round up because the machine works fantastic  product was dropped off at my house with one end of the box flapping open  box was very damaged  luckily i didn t have any pieces missing  base of the machine came with a crack in it so it doesn t seamlessly close on one side of the end where the motor is stored putting this together will require at least two people  if you aren t already someone who has a knack for assembling  i would definitely recommend getting someone who is  i consider myself great at assembly and even this has its moments of difficulty  have a wrench on hand for sure despite the initial disappointment  the machine worked fantastic  i really lucked out considering how it arrived  inclines all the way to its level     very slowly but it does  ran a little bit at a     rate and had no problems  as far as loudness  i felt that it gave off a normal treadmill level of sound  if that makes sense  didn t bother me  and if you re listening to music with headphones it should not be a problem anyway  easy to navigate electronic display  looking forward to great workouts      
1076,5.0,                       we bought this because my mom has a    year old proform  same parent company  treadmill that has lasted    years without maintenance excellent for walking jogging without any fancy or unnecessary features  i m   foot and      pounds and have no problems with walking jogging  very tall people may have problems with a full sprint  the treadmill is quiet and very sturdy with a clear display don t expect any fancy features or for the heart rate monitor to be even moderately accurate  just buy a smart watch and tablet with your savings over the expensive treadmills expect assembly to be     hours and there are steps that really need   people note  bypass ifit setup by holding ifit button for       seconds  only the first time you setup   no big deal      
1077,5.0,                       after years of contemplating buying a treadmill but always deciding it wasn t worth the money since i had access to them at the gym  i started looking seriously a few months ago after several months of covid lockdown kept gyms out of access  and even after they opened  i was leery of going into one  i had a tough time deciding on a treadmill  i was looking at budget treadmills in the         price range but every time i read a review it said things like  belt too narrow    not sturdy enough for running   i didn t need anything with bells   whistles like a huge display or tv or speakers or fans  so i kept raising the price range until i found one that i was able to find the qualities i was looking for  i came upon the nordictrack t series    s  and i love it so far  i like the spacious    x    tread belt running surface  i like that it is sturdy  the speeds are      and most of the time i can t even go past     to   for my fast jogging  the panel has plenty of options to keep track of all kinds of stuff  i only use time  or distance   i wanted something that could be folded up  this thing is heavy   i had to hire someone to put it together for me  thanks to other reviewers  i was able to figure out how to bypass the ifit registration to activate  i have had this treadmill for over   months now and so far i am very happy with this purchase   my only regret is that i paid      for it and have since see it list for around         a price that would have made this an even greater value      
1078,5.0,                       works great  hubby put it together in about an hour  but had trouble getting the tension bar  what helps it fold up and down  together  make sure to follow the instructions to get around the start issue  press ifit button for    seconds      
1079,4.0,                       this treadmill definitely helped me stay active at home  decent purchase for the price and carrying the brand name nordictrack  ifit connectivity with this treadmill is definitely a plus  even though it has monthly fees it does the job well of having you connected  motivated with different workout options and reasonably priced  the only reason i give a   star is mainly due to the fact that it makes a creeky noise during the incline walk run  would have been nice to have a smaller display than digital numbers  have found models with display after the purchase for about the same price but have long lead times for delivery      
1080,5.0,                       i have had this for about a month now  i got this for a discounted price and it works great for my purposes  and couldn t beat the price for what you get  i was surprised how nice it actually was once assembled  folds easily  soft tread  it doesn t have a fan or a fancy screen but i use a larger tv in front of it anyway and have a fan overhead  would prefer an option of more than     incline but again for the price it s great  there is a way to bypass the ifit membership      
1081,5.0,                       so far so good after about a month of use  i just use the manual mode and have not yet used ifit  am sure i will at some point due to the free year  but was not why i bought it  very quite especially compared to the proform unit this replaced after the motor went  no complaints aside from having to wait for the unit to load and then skip the ifit mode before you can use the manual mode  a little annoying but after a minute am up and running  assembly not the most enjoyable thing as others explained  but not bad and pretty much as expected  overall very pleased  as normal  delivery from amazon on time and without a hitch      
1082,5.0,                       i like that it s easy to use  easy to fold  but harder to move than the last nordictrack i ve owned there are no front wheels so it s a bit more challenging  i ve only had it for a couple of weeks  assembled  but i use it near daily   i put it together myself  one person  a women    it s not that difficult      
1083,2.0,                       this is a basic home quality treadmill  no frills and definitely lacking the robustness of a professional fitness center machine it took me   nights to get it assembled  by myself   the pieces are not well formed and don t easily fit as per the instructions  the machine bounces much more than i d like      
1084,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is exactly what i was looking for  it s perfect  just remember when you put it together to start it without ifit subscription you just have to press and hold the blue ifit button on the treadmill and it will by pass it  i highly recommend this treadmill      
1085,1.0,                       i purchased this treadmill and opted to assemble it myself to save the     bucks  the assembly was difficult  the treadmill comes with certain parts screwed together for shipping purposes i guess  but they re not permanent screws  the instructions neglect to mention to remove these screws until after you ve assemble a part causing you to have to un assemble that part  remove the screw  and re assemble it  which is annoying and wastes time  other than that  the assembly was going okay until i realized they forgot to send me a part  it was the bar that attaches the two handles and that the console screws into  so kind of a key component  it took three weeks to get through to icon fitness to get my replacement part ordered  every time i tried to get in touch  they were experiencing longer than usual wait times  even first thing in the morning  and when i would get through to somebody  they said they couldn t help me with my issue  finally  i thought i had the part ordered  but a week passed  and i never received a confirmation email  so  i ordered the part again  a few days later  both parts showed up  no idea why the first part took so long to ship but the second one only took a few days  seems inconsistent  but anyway   neither part fit  both were too short to reach from one handlebar to the other and if even they did  the treadmill wasn t built squarely  so the screw holes on the bar were nowhere near lining up with the holes in the handle bar   so after much frustration with reaching customer service over three weeks  i got duplicate parts and neither fit  waste of time  i sent this treadmill back and ordered a proform treadmill      
1086,2.0,                       the package arrived damaged  nordictrack s customer service has not replied to my ticket that i submitted over a week ago after trying to call  the automated answering system for their customer service actually hung up on me because they did not detect a registered product under the phone number i was calling from i ve since needed to ducktape the broken plastic back together  the motor is making a rapid tick  tick  tick sound while running the belt has a huge oil stain from assembly at the factory that you can see whip around when in use really disappointed in this purchase and the lack of customer service      
1087,5.0,                       lots of pieces to put together and very heavy in the box  partially due to some of the heavy packing material    however  once together it works well and it a great piece of workout equipment   i don t use all of the features like the incline and the programming for different courses  but it seems well made   i love the built in speakers where i can plug in my phone to hear music or watch a video much easier than having to have my earbuds in  i did have to purchase a compatible cord to connect it though as it does not come with it   i was disappointed that one of the feet was damaged during shipping  but nordic track replaced it at no charge and it was able to get it on with no problem  i can honestly recommend this as a great treadmill      
1088,2.0,                       i received this from my amazon order on april     it did not come with any of the hardware parts to install  since this was a saturday  i had to wait until monday to call customer service  i was on hold for over an hour  and then was hung up on  i got ahold of someone the next day  who put in an order for my parts  it is now   weeks later  may    and i still have no parts  i am constantly given the run around with their customer service and spend minimum    min to an hour on hold to try and reach a customer service rep  i would love to say whether or not i like the actual treadmill  but i am still yet to be able to put it together  let alone try it out  i will update when i can actually try the product out  but so far i am far from impressed with nordictrack customer service      
1089,5.0,                       bought this as a christmas gift for my wife  we have both been using it  it works great  love it  the box came in good shape  all the parts were undamaged  assembly went perfectly  all the parts  hardware etc  are good quality  holes all lined up perfectly  no complaints  the box is quite heavy  two people to move it for sure if someone got a damaged treadmill or something doesn t work  i can understand a bad review  those things aside  this treadmill is everything it claims to be  i have assembled countless things over the years   this is well made      
1090,5.0,                       we don t know how we could have coped without the nordic treadmill during this coronavirus pandemic  with the closings of parks and some rainy days we are able to exercise anytime on any day  we constantly talk about how ordering this treadmill was the best luckiest thing we ve done to prepare  wink wink  for this time in our life  the treadmill has been flawless and the ifit programs have taken it to a level we never imagined  picture  literally  you are able to world travel during this time of isolation and being able to work out at the same time  well  that s what you get an assemblage of super trainers to lead you through exercise routines geared to your abilities with the backdrop of some of the most beautiful locations in the world  and the trainers are so knowledgeable about the history and culture of these locales  besides the techniques and conditioning needed to achieve your health related training goals  my wife and i have found this to be invaluable  you also have the ability to develop your own routines  there is a website where you can adjust the speed  the intervals  the incline for any timed workout you want to create  and then when you are ready to workout it miraculously shows up in your favorites on the treadmill itself  it s like magic  well not really  your treadmill needs to be connected to your home wifi for internet connection  but that s pretty much it  the only thing you have to do is to make exercise part of your daily routine  this nordic track treadmill has taken exercise to a new level of enjoyment      
1091,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  this treadmill was easy to put together  my family tried it out for the first time last night my teenage boys loved it and that s saying a lot right there because they hate to exercise  this machine was very fun and easy to use  the only thing that was kinda funny about it we didn t know it was that huge lol  we had to move around furniture to make room for this giant treadmill  it was a good buy and price      
1092,3.0,                       it s a nice  basic treadmill   that said  it promises a lot of things that it doesn t deliver   e g   it claims that it integrates a heart rate monitor   when you go to the instructions to find out more  it says  consult the front cover of this manual for details    there s nothing on the front cover of the manual  or anywhere  about a heart rate monitor   and so on  and so on dealing with support has been a nightmare   first jump through a million hoops  a million forms asking me irrelevant questions  so they can market to me  and then once i finally did all of that i got told that they don t handle  software issues  and to call some other number   where i waited on hold forever and gave up i really wanted to give this   stars because for its price it s a nice treadmill for what it is      
1093,5.0,                       so far the treadmills excellent i m happy with it and the delivery was so cool thank you very much     just one other thing about assembling the treadmill you do need the special tools like the mechanics use i don t know what they re called wrenches or you could buy that and home depot for about maybe     cycle little set and and it ll be much easier instead of just using like like pliers or you know little pools that you have any in your house plus it will be a little difficult to do it on your own but i did it on my own it took me about   hours but if it could get done but it s better if you have someone to help you some of the parts some of the treadmill is how can i save this you just need two people to help you figure it out you know so anyways good luck out there     
1094,5.0,                       love this treadmill  my husband and i did a lot of research on a treadmill that would work well in our basement without my husband having to worry about his head being too close to the ceiling on incline  he s       this tread fits the bill without losing any performance features of a more robust tread  we ve been using it every day for the past few months and are very happy with it      
1095,5.0,                       i had gotten my hands on a rw     rowing machine  from nordic track and loved the ease and simplicity of the unit  i decided to also get their treadmill  and i was not disappointed  we have had commercial treadmills in the past  i did not want a big bulky unit and i also wanted the metrics and the interactive w o s from the ifit to see how i was doing and if i was improving or not   the unit was easy to assemble  and its small size works great  i am not a fast runner the unit can go to a speed of    i have only had it up to    i typically run with the interactive programs or in manual mode with zwift cannot say enough on how i enjoy the units from nordictrack  rower and the treadmill      
1096,5.0,                       great treadmill      mins to assemble with   people   you do not need an ifit membership to start the machine    put the key on the machine and hold down the ifit button for    seconds    don t forget the switch at the back by the cord  voila   we watching hiking and running videos on youtube while using      
1097,5.0,                       this treadmill is perfect for a home gym  i really like all the features and it s so smooth  it s not obnoxiously large but not dinky small  i am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others shipping  i choose front porch drop off  i was unhappy that they left it in my driveway under no cover  had it rained  this would have been ruined  it is very heavy  my husband and i struggled to get it to our basement  but we did it    eventually      
1098,5.0,                       a year later and still love it      
1099,5.0,                       i like it very much  i haven t used the guided programs with instructors because i can t move that fast  but i have  used it manually with some of the trails on the screen  which is nice  i had back surgery and this was to help me get back on the mend  i needed to walk and i don t do cold  now i have to wait for my next back surgery until after the covid    thing is over before that happens  so the treadmill is just patiently waiting until i can get back on there  i hope the free i fit membership still works by the time i am able to use it  as i never used the card yet  otherwise i think this treadmill will be great      
1100,5.0,                       i m very happy with this treadmill after a month  the only thing that doesn t work well or consistently for me is the heart rate monitor  i assembled this myself and it took me a full day working on and off because i kept making mistakes and needed to take breaks for my sanity  but i persisted and felt very accomplished when i was finally done   i wish the tread was more cushy  but for the price this is a solid treadmill and i love the       incline option   i only walk on the treadmill and the incline gives me the workout i need without having to run   it s a bigger treadmill than i expected  but true to the size specifications   my husband travels a lot so right now it s on his side of the bed  lastly  i held down the ifit button for    seconds like other reviewers have suggested and i was then not required to pay for ifit   i use the treadmill without the ifit      
1101,5.0,                       my gf and i went half on this treadmill as soon as i noticed the price drop  the item was delivered on time  remember though  that this item is huge and there is no way you can assemble it alone  it literally took me from  am  pm putting this thing together  but once it was put together  i love using it and definitely recommend others to buy it  i didn t register for anything and took advantage of the  holding blue button for few seconds  you will need a wrench and screw driver other than the tools that were included  good luck  eat well and work that booty      
1102,5.0,                       we love our new treadmill   i like that you can adjust the cushion and that you can link your bluetooth to it to listen to music with the speaker of the treadmill   sound is really good   it s more narrow than our old one but is nice to not take as much space   i m actually for once excited to start training for a race on this treadmill   happy with our purchase      
1103,5.0,                       it is a very good product  it is very big and heavy  came in good packaging  we asked nordic track to send in a technician for assembling it  for a charge initially we faced some issue but because we bought the nordic track warranty so it was covered under it happy with the purchase      
1104,5.0,                       i was looking for a decent low cost treadmill and was a little concerned about the mixed reviews  i m very happy i purchased  this fits my needs perfectly  setup was straightforward and took me about an hour to put together with help from my wife  it was very simple as long as you follow the instructions  though i d definitely recommend assembling in the location you ll be keeping the treadmill due to the weight deliver was also easy  it came through a separate freight company who were communicative throughout the process about selecting a date and time and contacting me when they were about an hour out from my location on the delivery date while other people have talked about the need to use ifit  you can bypass this  but i actually decided to try it out and have continued using since  i like the preloaded workouts offered along with the ability to create my own and it s cheaper than a gym membership  having that extra motivation knowing i m trying to achieve a certain distance or duration helps me to keep pushing myself i ve been using it   times per week for   months now without any issues  it has a nice range of speeds  i m not a sprinter by any means  and generally keep my runs in the     mph range  the incline function also works well all in all  it s a great value for the price and the build quality compared to similarly priced machines is fantastic      
1105,5.0,                       with the recent pandemic and gym closures  it became increasingly difficult to maintain a sustainable exercise routine  buying our nordic track treadmill with ifit has been the solution  with this machine in our home  we have no excuses to maintain or lose unwanted weight  and keep fit  which is so important during times of stress and while we age  we love this product and would highly recommend it to meet your health and fitness related goals      
1106,3.0,                       the toughest part is the assembly  you have to read instructions carefully otherwise you will end up having to unscrew it again  once installed i tested the treadmill and of course i heared some things off but this is the just the break down part  once it was actually used it worked fine for me  at the time i purchased it the assembly was not available until   months but when checked again after ordering it  it was a lot sooner but i would have liked receiving the order and paying the assembling instead of taking a couple of days to assemble it when i had time  overall the treadmill works perfectly fine so far  no problems but customer service is really slow  almost non existent   that is the reason why i am only providing   stars  though amazon service did try their best  it is the product service that does not respond      
1107,5.0,                       so glad i bought this  kinda hard to put together    you need two people but so worth it  we are using it daily with no problems at all best part is that you can also install apps like youtube  spotify and more on it to use while using the treadmill  it s also very quiet      
1108,1.0,                       in less than a year this treadmill has had three catastrophic failures after about   months the belt control module died   at that point the treadmill belt no longer moved it took   months to get a replacement part  which was covered by the warranty a week or so after replacing the module  the walking deck cracked down the middle   the actual wooden deck has a foot long crack caused by  ish months of normal use   keep in mind  i weigh about     lbs  which obviously isn t pushing the upper limit of treadmill s weight rating   however  the walking board was also covered under the warranty  and took another month or so to arrive that takes us up to the year warranty that comes with the treadmill everything worked well for about a month  until the motor started making a clicking noise   softly at first but over the next week it continued to grow louder   additionally  the treadmill could no longer maintain speed and would jerk randomly while in motion   finally  it completely died   the entire treadmill went black  everything shut off and no amount of unplugging or resetting would get it to turn on since it was no longer covered by the warranty  and considering in less than   year  i had only been able to use the treadmill for about   months  i abandoned it so  i have some additional thoughts that i ll go into below  but if you don t care about my personal opinions experiences with nordictrack  the above list of problems should be enough to give you pause before spending money on this treadmill ok  so i have some additional thoughts related to  but not specific to my series of problems   nordictrack customer service is a joke   i ve seen other reviewers mention this  but you won t be able to talk to anyone personally   i sat on hold for   hours before hanging up   i tried calling a few other times and sat on hold for    minutes before giving up   the point is  it doesn t matter when you call   or how long you wait  you won t talk to anyone   it s not worth your time to try that being said  the online customer service was fine   they responded relatively promptly and for what it s worth  sent me the replacement parts i needed   i do understand it isn t personally their fault that it took   months for a computer part and another month for the walking deck to ship keeping in mind the numerous calls and being on hold for as long as i d want to sit and wait   never personally talking to anyone throughout the entire multipart ordeal    the single most annoying part of my entire nordictrack experience was receiving a call from nordictrack trying to get me to renew my warranty   all of the sudden when they want more of my money  they have people available to call and talk   amazing   needless to say  i didn t extend my warranty sadly  what this all means is that i wasted       bucks and the only thing i got in return was a crummy  poorly made     lb clothes hanger if it s relevant to any other runners   i usually run       miles a week  so  if you re looking for a treadmill that will hold up  this is not that treadmill tl dr  don t be like me   don t buy this poorly made treadmill      
1109,4.0,                       this took about   hours to assemble  two of the pieces were not manufactured correctly so the thing would not go together properly without having to try to modify the piece  once i got it assembled it was nice  the track seems to be a little loose even after tightening  and the built in heart monitor is definitely incorrect  pros are that it came with a year of the ifit membership  its all touchscreen and that it is about      cheaper than the nordictrack website     
1110,5.0,                       to be honest if u r smart enough u can install alone in   hours  cause it says u need   people for installation pretty nice unit  solid  quiet     it works with ifit    day free membership however u have to give your credit card number on activation otherwise not really huge and took place in your room screen is not good but so so   u can use your own tablet  ipod  smart phone finally happy to buy it   lets see whats going on    in a time       
1111,1.0,                       i ve called nordic track several times  i moved and since moving i cannot get this to start  i have spent hours on hold with nordictrack trying to get resolution  one call reveled it was the cable harness    it wasn t  the next reveled it was the motor    it s not  the message on the screen shows e     i believe it s the control panel so for months it sits in my spare bedroom unused  i just want it fixed  my recommendation after dealing with this for over   months    do not buy a nordictrack from amazon      
1112,5.0,                       i love this treadmill i already lost    pounds in almost   months  and i m going for morei definitely i recommend this product from norditrakpros  easy to foldeasy to working outcons  nothing     
1113,5.0,                       this treadmill is everything i was looking for  plus more  it is easy to use and has more bells   whistles than i will ever need  i do not have an ifit  so that part is useless  although i guess i can see why some people would like benefit from that  my son put it together in about   hour  he does have experience with assembling exercise equipment  no problems encountered  i am using this since having a heart attack and the weather is not conducive to walking outside all year round  the down side  my dogs give me the evil eye when i hop on this machine and they don t get to go for a walk      
1114,1.0,                       i have no idea if this product works because  it remains in pieces on my floor   when i first unboxed i was unable to find    page manual with assembly instructions   i was able to find online and managed to get printed   i then discovered no screws or washers were sent      days later  wow that s speedy  i received missing parts after lengthy discussion with nordic track customer service   one would think i m all set  but no  still missing parts   after cross referencing with manual  i have some parts not able to identify  and missing some i need   after yet another call  i am again eagerly awaiting parts to be delivered   i purchased this treadmill so i could run in the winter   at this rate i may not have a functioning treadmill until spring     not happy      
1115,5.0,                       great once we got it working  my boyfriend who weights      lbs and me who weighs    lbs are able to use it just fine  there was a two month hiccup in getting the right parts but the customer support was knowledgeable and kind  and sent a service repairman to make sure the treadmill was fully functional and was kind enough to make sure the belt was on straight  very happy with this purchase  i hope it will last many years in the future  folds up nice so that when we clean the house      
1116,1.0,                       the ifit   year free trainer is not true   i tried to sign up and i get the biggest run around   then they want you to pay for the free   year trainer   what a disappointment   never will ever buy nordatrac again      
1117,5.0,                       as a     pound jogger i was afraid i d beat this machine down  it stands up pretty well  it s not as solid as a commercial one as it will shake on my heavy steps  i m sure if i maintain it well it will last for years  i assembled it myself and needed my wife s help a few times towards the end just to hold stuff up while i a bolted it in  otherwise as a person is put stuff together before i felt confident assembling it  the bolts are staged together in vacuum seal with a number for which step they belong to which made it much simpler to know what to use next      
1118,1.0,                       so after we got the treadmill all setup  went online and activated it  paid for the subscription  i started to mess around with it and it wouldn t incline  you could hear the motor trying to raise it up but it just wouldn t go  i looked through the manual and they said to try and calibrate the incline so i did and it then went up and down without issue  after i looked at it i noticed it was still inclined and never went back to   on the incline  it was stuck at    so after exhausting my knowledge i called nordictrack and they said it sounds like a bad motor or a incline sensor so they ll be sending me out a new one and i have to install it in      business days  so now this all happened within the first   hours of me having the treadmill and i was a little disappointed with their customer service that it s going to take      business days for them to get me the new motor all and all i ve still worked out on the treadmill and i love the ifit app that controls the treadmill and your workouts  it s a great addition to it  the treadmill seems to be build well and it s very sturdy and overall i m happy with the treadmill just very bummed about it not working correctly out of the box      
1119,4.0,                       easy to assemble   i did not have second person help   the problem during assembly is that some of screw holes were not tapped to size and i had to use other tools to install screws and it was really hard machine is running well and not too much noise   the belt off the center and there is adjustment allowed it asked for activate via ifit and i don t like it   why we pay it and why i had to activate it   be careful when asked for put you credit card information  it is not required unless you want join membership      
1120,1.0,                       i just received my order today and did the set up myself  after finishing the set up i followed the instruction to activate my treadmill and work on it  however  they are asking me to sign up for a monthly subscription of more than      i didn t sign up for that when i ordered the treadmill  why should i pay every month for life for something i didn t ask for   i don t need any trainer  i don t need your nutrition advice  i know what i want   i wanted a treadmill  i didn t sign up for anything else and i won t  i just want to use my treadmill they way i want  anytime i want  i have been using amazon prime for many years and i haven t seen anything fishy and un ethical like this one   very disappointed      
1121,5.0,                       the nordictrack t series treadmill has been excellent as i ve canceled my gym membership due to covid     the treadmill is heavy and assembly took about   hours so i recommend having   people as assistance was required  the grounding screw was defective but we had no issues with contacting nordictrack and getting a replacement screw shipped  the belt can slip a bit at higher speeds  but just make sure to properly adjust the belt with the allen wrench  we did this using youtube videos for assistance and it s working great  the treadmill isn t too bulky and fits nicely in our basement  it folds easily  i do recommend buying a treadmill mat the absolute best feature of this treadmill is how it syncs to my ipad to use ifit  the treadmill came with a free    day ifit subscription and i was hooked  ifit has a wonderful library of workouts  i started with power walking and now i m jogging for the duration of my workouts  with the ifit sync  trainers can control your speed and incline which tends to give me the extra push i need  this has helped to motivate me to keep consistent workouts at home  i m enjoying this so much that i don t anticipate another gym membership post covid      
1122,4.0,                       i m in love with this treadmill  i ve waited a long time to replace mine since it broke several years ago  after lots of research i decided on this one but i was skeptical about the ifit membership  thankfully the treadmill came with a year for free  after a month of actively using the treadmill and the ifit training  i will gladly pay for the membership yearly the machine is very user friendly  it s very easy to fold up each day  i left the hydraulic arm to assist unfolding  it s convenient and saves space the treadmill was delivered in a heavily damaged box with a small hole in the belt which was a minor set back  i called nordictack customer service and after providing the serial and model numbers they were able to ship out a new belt that was received within seven business days  unfortunately  due to covid  there wasn t an option for a tech to replace it but my husband was handy enough i m overall extremely satisfied with my purchase and look forward to using it every day      
1123,5.0,                       i ve had the    s for a little over a month  and i think it s a solid machine   i needed to replace my old proform cs  which after only    years of use gave up   i was looking for a foldable unit  and one that would fit in a tight space  about     width available   this one fit the bill  and had good reviews the assembly took a bit  and does require two people at certain points  but generally speaking it wasn t too difficult   once up i created my ifit account included in my price was a free one year membership   i was a little skeptical of ifit  as my old cs had  ifit  probably v     so    years ago that pretty much consisted of running dvd s through an attached computer   shockingly  things have changed a bit since then  and i can say i m really enjoying the guided runs   there s enough variety and skill levels that you can always find the type of walk jog run you want as for the treadmill itself  very smooth belt  good controls for both incline and speed  the tablet screen is responsive  the speakers are loud enough to hear when you re running at a good pace   lots of good metrics are available through the screen  and the information on the tablet during the workout is easy to read  and all the controls are big and easy to read   ample storage areas on the treadmill   the fan is nice  it does a nice job of circulating the air   my knees have become less forgiving on certain outdoor terrains  and the deck on the    s has provided enough cushioning to allow my to run without any major pain issues that i would normally have running outside the bluetooth connectivity works fine  but i haven t really listened to my music much  as i m running mostly with a guided run all in all  i m quite happy with the    s  and i can only hope i get    years of runs out of it         
1124,5.0,                       aight well the treadmill is really good  i get on it as much as i can  the thing i am missing is pretty significant and just noticed it  so i would just set the manual setting and run or jog  today i wanted to time myself  i go online and search for the setting to set a time or whatever and see that it keep telling me to go to  set a goal   i can read and don t see it anywhere on my settings  so i look online to the one that i bought and it has it in the photos  hey amazon  can you explain that  i am missing the following buttons  map  train  compete  track  set a goal and lose wt my t    s doesnt have those options      
1125,5.0,                       the delivery guys were awesome  they were on time  very polite and in and out  super easy and quick delivery  not to mention i saved close to      on this piece of equipment through amazon   so far the hard part was only putting it together  and clicking that buy now button lol  it s exactly as described however one perk i didn t realize was  the bluetooth option on the treadmill only works if you subscribe to ifit  which is crap  but aside from that  that s the only complaint i have with this purchase      
1126,5.0,                       i was so nervous to spend      on a treadmill cause typically it s garbage  but we coukdnt really afford to spend more and didn t want to get used  so we went with it after reading all the good reviews  this treadmill is worth alot more in my opinion  but i love that they re selling an awesome treadmill at an affordable price  kudos to this seller  you can t go wrong with a nordictrack      
1127,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill in march and it is now mid november and i use it to run     times a week running a  k each time  my biggest concern was how this thing would hold up to that kind of workload with me being a big guy           lbs    there was no need for concern as this thing looks and works exactly the same as it did when it was brand new  older model different brands always required me to adjust the belt constantly  i haven t had to adjust this one once  very happy with performance and very highly recommend this treadmill  cannot speak to the i fit program as i never used it      
1128,5.0,                       great range of manual workouts  up to     incline and    mph   ifit trial pretty neat but not sure i want to pay a monthly fee for mostly straightforward calorie burn exercise  nice simple versatile treadmill  after months of use  i love it and the ifit app that records all sessions and provides  infinite  variety of travel based training  opportunities  also can program a desired manual workout that controls incline speed repeatedly  good value      
1129,5.0,                       we bought this during the stay at home orders and i am so glad   we love our new treadmill   it s easy to use and i love traveling to different places all over the world via the ifit   it makes it not seem like exercise as you get to travel all around the world as you exercise   which has been great during the pandemic as there s not much real life traveling going on    i love the large touch screen and the trainer john peel is my favorite   i also like that it automatically inclines to go along with what the trainer does   if i were to purchase another in the future i think i would get one that has the decline feature too  just to make it that much more realistic as you jog up down a hill for example   i definitely look forward to exercising now the only downfall was that we purchased it during the stay at home orders so had to assemble ourselves   which we did  but would have been nice to pay someone else to do it and probably would have taken them less time to do it          
1130,5.0,                       first time buying a treadmill  bought a used one in good condition  delivery guys didn t properly carry the item and dropped it once  the package had handrails missing  together with a damaged belt  tracked out to amazon techincal support  best way is to register your product and bring up any missing parts and issues in a service ticket on the support website  contacted nordicktrack support during working hours and they initially said one of the part was back ordered  was about to return the product   but got the order passed for missing parts  even got a replacement belt  assembled everything myself   felt the product was very good at the price  able to perform brisk walking and jogging   belt needed adjustments initially  satisfied with the purchase  customer support was also good      
1131,4.0,                       we have been enjoying this treadmill for a few months now and i am happy with everything about it   we did not sign up for the online workout program  but instead we just do our own thing   we have been pleasantly surprised   i was worried about it failing  and was hesitant to purchase so a big product  but it has been great   the price was also a big plus   i would recommend this purchase      
1132,5.0,                       i m overall very satisfied with this purchase  i wanted to buy a treadmill so that i could go running inside  without a mask   for both physical safety and covid related reasons  this is my first treadmill  so i don t know too much about different treadmill brands features  but it s a great deal for the quality of treadmill  with many different incline and speed buttons and a nice screen display  it s not too loud when running on it and it has nice shock absorption  plus it has built in speakers so you can plug in your phone to listen to music with an aux cord  i used the ifit app with the treadmill and really liked it  but unfortunately the subscription was so expensive that i stopped using it when the free trial ended  i will say that assembling the treadmill was not easy  and it took several hours  but i didn t want to pay an extra     for assembly  i did pay the extra     to get the treadmill box delivered to a particular room of the house  which i am very glad i did because it was extremely heavy  overall i would highly recommend this treadmill for the price      
1133,5.0,                       minus  has the   pay for infinity  activation subscription as described in other reviews  but this can be bypassed as also described plus  assembly was straightforward  it works as intended  seems solid   well constructed   using it to break up endless zoom meetings while working from home   have recommended it or a similar item to friends      
1134,5.0,                       i ve had treadmills where when you run fast they feel like they re going to fall apart under your feet  a treadmill shouldn t be like a roller coaster though  we ordered the nordictrack t series around the holidays when it s too cold to run much where i live and it has been a wonderful treadmill  the only thing negative i have to say is that it took awhile to figure out how to use it without paying nordictrack for a subscription with four of us in the house  it seems like someone is always on the thing  now that it s gotten warmer i kinda  miss watching the news while i run  but i do love getting outdoors  unlike the kids who try and play video games on the thing    they wouldn t do that on a roller coaster  would they         
1135,1.0,                       first  they threw box near sidewalk a day before the delivery day  box destroyed because it rained  we had to pay someone to take it upstairs  then we assemble it  to our surprise it did not work   called the manufacturer and they say they can not send someone because of the coronavirus  understandable  then we called amazon  same  thing they can not send someone to pick from a second floor  they told us we have    days to send it back  meanwhile the manufacturer said they will send us a part for us to put it by ourselves  i feel that under the circumstances we are in  they should send a full refund  and pick up the damaged treadmill when this is all over      
1136,5.0,                       we ordered this and scheduled the delivery between      on a saturday  we also paid the     to have this treadmill delivered to the room we wanted it in  definitely recommend   the guys showed up at      and had the treadmill delivered before  am which was awesome  it did take a while to put together but it wasn t hard to put together  after reading the reviews  we were able to bypass the ifit trial with the work around everyone recommended  we ve been using it for a week and it s great  great for running or walking   this is a great deal for an awesome treadmill      
1137,5.0,                       i love this treadmill   i use this thing every day  i ve heard people complain about the ifit program  but i really enjoy the workouts  great options for the price point and made very well   i feel confident that every time i step on it  it s going to do exactly what i need it to       
1138,5.0,                       i ve had this treadmill for about four months now and i m very happy with it  i haven t taken advantage of all the workout programs  so i can t speak to their value  this is a very sturdy home treadmill  i m pleased with the quality and value  i got someone else to assemble it for me  and i m glad i did  the process looked way too complicated  one part did arrive broken  but i called nordictrack and they quickly sent out a replacement with no questions asked  i d been apprehensive about spending so much on exercise equipment  but i m glad i did      
1139,1.0,                       nordic track was not only useless  but unfriendly   one part was missing and nordictrack would not even talk to me until i registered the treadmill    which i couldn t do since it had just arrived   i needed amazon to get through to nordictrack  they wouldn t tell me how long it would take to get the part  but said it could take several weeks  i m still waiting  i can not rate the treadmill since it can t be assembled til i get the part  but the customer support is horrible one other thing  i m    years old  an the nordic track  customer service  woman  had the nerve to  force me to give her the serial number of my partially assembled teeadmill which was located on the bottom of the unit  i had to lift and hold up the track section  with my head and neck  and read her the numbers and at the same time  hold my phone  as a result  i injured my neck of course the  helpful  customer support woman suggested that i should have someone else hold up the heavy track while i read her the numbers   i was home alone   and  as with all the other info i had given her along the way   she would constantly repeat the info back to me to be sure it was correct  and invarably got it wrong almost every time   it was like talking to the keystone cops       
1140,1.0,                       i have been using this treadmill for two months and it is working great  it took my about an hour to setup and was not difficult at all  the built in programs are great and the motor runs quietly  i would highly recommend this for the price full disclosure  nordictrack offered me a gift to write a positive review but refused to send it once they saw that i mentioned it      
1141,1.0,                       the company that makes this model force s you to subscribe to ifit for     month which you can only do if by giving them your first and last name plus your email and phone number  if you don t it says your treadmill will be locked and unusable  you can bypass it but it won t tell you how unless you subscribe to ifit honestly just a scummy business practice     
1142,1.0,                       ifit is absolute trash  to make you create an account online then tell you can activate the treadmill online which you can t until you install the app yet there are errors uploading the app  it says if you have errors uploading the app to call and when you call no one answers  if i would ve known i d go through this i would ve bought a treadmill without this ifit garbage  i don t need someone to track my use of a treadmill      
1143,3.0,                       hello   the handrail that measures your heart rate already doesn t work and we put together friday  may   nd  i had to request a service appointment   haven t heard back on that what really bugs me is the manual screen  it only has one screen and that shows you jogging around a track my old treadmill had me running through a forest at least  the other work outs i can create on my own are interesting because you can go anywhere in the world but they stills   meaning you run as a camera clicks versus a fluid run  it s offsetting   not a big fan of it all in all  this will get the job done   once i get my handrail fixed      
1144,5.0,                       pleased and satisfied with this purchase and all comments also relative to the professional level equipment i am accustomed to at my gym likes  appears well built and sturdy  relatively easy to assemble  electricity consumption is minimal relative to my other equipment rated at or near high wattage as well  the impact this has had on my monthy electricity bill has been minimal after averaging         hours daily for the past     months   excellent customer service in replacing a broken part that was damaged during shipping  accommodates my running at   or     mph easily  easy elevation controls while running  walking  strong warrantyroom for improvement  higher resolution  crisper led display would have been a bonus  even stronger shock absoption  controls for speed   elevation would have been better with switches with tactile feedback vs these touch sensitive ones  adjustable  removable tablet ipad holder positioned at top of console in addition to the support at the bottom of the led display would have been great to allow users like me to watch content on my ipad at eye level  i had to purchase one of these as an accessory    gooseneck tablet holder  lamicall tablet stand  flexible arm clip tablet mount compatible with ipad mini pro air     
1145,5.0,                       prior to the start of covid    i had been going to the gym a minimum of   days a week   when the gyms shut down i decided to purchase this treadmill for home   having a treadmill at home has been awesome and since i don t need to travel to the gym i have been able to spend a bit more time working out   my favorite feature by far is how it is integrated with ifit   i enjoy the variety of workouts and programs and complete at least   each time i hop on the treadmill   i do wish the treadmill was quieter when inclining and declining   some guided programs have lots of inclines and declines integrated throughout the workout and this can make for a noisy workout      
1146,1.0,                       motor cover scratched and control panel screw will not tighten nordic track is sending replacement parts after verified damage with video  the problem is after   hours of unpacking and assembly  i need to disassemble and reasemble the damaged parts  where is my compensation  even though it is     lbs and went down    stairs to the lower level  i am ready to return it to amazon      
1147,5.0,                       i bought this machine to get some exercise   i love walking and it has been wonderful   the pre programmed apps are good  but i use ifit   i love walking in all the different places   my table syncs with no issues and i was able to use my    days ifit free before i bought it   no credit card for the free trial period   i waited to write my review and i have had this for a few months   it s not too loud  it is sturdy  i am    lbs     it is also compact enough to put in my home office  tucks away nicely when folded   i could not be happier  i put together with my husband and we had no problems  most of it i assembled my self      
1148,5.0,                       this is by far the best treadmill experience i ve ever had in my life  i was an avid gym goer for years but i got too busy and i decided to work out from home  i own another treadmill that is broken and is a clothes hanger now but this one makes me want to work out daily  the free yearly ifit subscription is amazing     i love the auto speeds and auto inclines that make for lots of sweating and great workouts  to note  i have a neck and back injury and it helps me stay active without injuring myself      
1149,5.0,                       this was the best gift i bought myself  i use to walk all the time back in the day but it got worse with everything that s going on  thankfully with this and my tv i can go back to walking i ve already put in over    miles and i can t wait to put in more      
1150,4.0,                       this is a very nice piece of equipment  but with a few unfortunate feature design flaws   the heart rate monitor seems pretty accurate     until i actually start moving  then it fluctuates widely  making it useless   the pre loaded programs seem nice  but i cannot seem to establish their speed limits to match my needs capabilities    it can make fast speed changes of  mph  which is quite dangerous    if this is something i can control  the documentation does not make it very clear   i would really like to create my own programs  but that feature apparently does not exist   i still like using this treadmill  but i have to make all elevation and speed changes manually      
1151,1.0,                       this product was extremely difficult to put together  not for those who are older  worst of all  this company stears you into a    day free trial for ifit in order to activate the treamill of course you have to give them a credit card in advance and cancel before    days  still trying to figure how to cancel      
1152,5.0,                       i really enjoy this treadmill  we just wanted a reasonably priced treadmill that you can run on and has an incline option  this product has both  i walk run on it several times a week and have had no problems at all  was not too difficult to assemble   just make sure you have someone helping you to speed it up  not very noisy either   about the same you would hear at the gym  overall  i am very happy we bought this treadmill      
1153,5.0,                       i love my new treadmill  i use ifit for my daily workouts  the workouts are fun and the trainers are fantastic  so far i have walked run petra  salt lake city  phoenix and bora bora  i have been to all these places and enjoy seeing them again  i do wish the sides were a bit wider  i have had problems when i want to momentarily step off the belt  all in all  i am glad i made this purchase  would buy again and have recommended this equipment to friends      
1154,5.0,                       been seeing a lot of negative reviews on this treadmill and it almost made me choose something else  but in the end this was the most cost effective option i found that had an incline  we had to get doorstop delivery because of the virus right now so it was a challenge to get it up the stairs with just me and my husband but we managed  took an hour or so to put together  and was a process but not overtly difficult  i also liked the ifit idea when i ordered  and after using for a few weeks it s been really great  i like that it changes the speed and the incline for you during the class so you can just go without worrying about the adjustments  it also keeps it more interesting than just walking on the treadmill  the walking classes have been a very cool stress relief during the quarantine  i m very glad that i went with this machine over a more basic walking treadmill  didn t want to spend too much as i was worried that i wouldn t use it  might upgrade in the future but for now i just use an ipad to make up for the lack of screen  no regrets      
1155,5.0,                       i wanted to use for a couple months to see how the treadmill held up  use   or more times a week   i am pleased with my purchase  works as described  size is perfect and i do love the ease of the fold up option  i used the ifit program and great for experienced or beginner  bluetooth works great  i like that there is not a huge amount of noise  it is not silent but it is a treadmill and you are running walking  i compared with other models and in store and this is a great price  would recommend        
1156,5.0,                       directions where easy to understand  the screen is very bright and i love the follow along workouts there was an issue with the year of ifit and one quick call fixed that right up some slight lag when going slow but at a good jog i don t feel any lag while running folds up very easy and soft lower      
1157,5.0,                       love my new nordictrack treadmill and the ifit programs   i would not characterize myself as a serious runner  just an average runner that walk jogs runs to keep in shape  i bought the treadmill so that i could walk or run whenever i want and not have to worry about the weather and so i could get my   k steps in each day while i m working from home during covid   i m on the treadmill at least once a day sometimes twice   the ifit programs make walking running more enjoyable with the diverse intensity levels and locations that are brought to you by talented and engaging trainers that keep you motivated      
1158,5.0,                       the box was damaged upon arrival but the treadmill had no damage at all   it took two delivery guys to drop it off in my living room   i decided to tackle the assembly by myself   it took about   hours but that is because i had to drag it down     flight of stairs and my arthritic hands using the dinky little allen wrench   other than struggling to tighten the screws on the  hand rails and the cross bar under the deck  it was easy to assemble   i suggest getting an allen attachment for electric screw driver or a drill   i used a pole to prop up the deck while i attached the hydraulic pole   i held down the ifit button for about    seconds and that overrode the  free trial  that was supposedly mandatory   it turned right on and the belt started right up   i plan to walk run on it tomorrow so i can t say whether or not is has good cushion   by the looks feel of it it s not that great but for the price i ll just invest in more cushioned running shoes  p s   i m about            and i was able to maneuver it just where i wanted   good thing it was down stairs and not up      
1159,5.0,                       great product great quality  it arrived earlier than expected  the gentlemen delivering it did a great job getting it into house  we did not op to have it built by them chose to do it our selves which was rather simple  basic tools needed  took about    min to assemble and set up  so far it has been a top notch piece of equipment the only issue we had was we did not do the i fit which upon powering up it seems to make you feel the need to down load app and sign up  which as stated we didn t want to do  found instructions on  by passing i fit      
1160,5.0,                       it is a great treadmill time consuming but easy to put together if u follow the directions  bypassing ifit is very simple u just hold the button for    to    second then again for    seconds and it bypasses ifit  it works great and is well worth the investment if u are looking to workout at home  it folds and unfolds easily and simple to store      
1161,4.0,                       i am very pleased with this treadmill  it is sturdy  quiet and was easy to assemble  i would recommend it to anyone wanting a good machine for a good price  the only issue i have is not so much with amazon but the shipper they used in our area  they made several excuses as to why the machine was sitting an hour away from me and yet it took four days beyond the second due date for it to reach me  the box was busted in on one area and when opening the crate we found that the cover over the front of the belt was cracked right where the box had been damaged  we had the option of boxing it all back up and sending in back or taking a discount on the total charges  we feel amazon s offer was adequate and accepted it as this issue would not affect the use of the machine  i don t know if i will order any other large items from amazon if the same shipping company is used      
1162,4.0,                       i read many reviews before purchasing this treadmill  it runs very smoothly and is relatively quiet  but what you need to know   rst  you do need   people  after unpacking  it took   of us  an rn and a mechanical engineer     minutes to put together  not counting clean up  whoever said that they put it together alone must have been a body building contortionist  i don t see any other way   nd  the box is much larger than expected  have them deliver it where you want to set it up   rd  it does not fold up  flat  it props up in a lean  and sticks out about   feet from the console    rth  a huge thank you to the reviewer that said that you do not need to sign up for ifit to use the machine   just hold down the ifit button until it unlocks  so  basically a good machine once it is set up  like the wider tread      
1163,5.0,                       we bought the treadmill because i got gestational diabetes in the  th month of my pregnancy  my doc asked me to walk after every meal and this was difficult because it was too cold to go out for walks at night  we installed the treadmill all by himself  he took   hrs to do it  it was extremely easy with the help of a few youtube videos  the treadmill is the best quality one and i love walking on it while i am pregnant  i can control the speed and the elevation easily  i have been able to control my sugar levels and not depend on my husband to join me for walks  at night in the cold weather      
1164,1.0,                       i am so upset  i ve attached a photo of the sticker they put on the console  i feel so ripped off   forced to pay     per month to even start using the treadmill the treadmill does not start working even once until you sign up for ifit s monthly     subscription      
1165,5.0,                       it s just the right size to fit  we had it professionally assembled  so that was stress free we wanted a treadmill with a range of speeds and incline  this unit can make small or big adjustments  you can plug in music to play through the built in speakers  which i wish could be louder  it does a ton of other stuff too that i ll never use  but it doesn t get in the way or make it hard to use  it is simple to use and it s quite  surprisingly quiet for a home unit in its price range      
1166,5.0,                       great treadmill for working out   the product came in a compact package that protected it during shipping and was easy to assemble   the treadmill can be folded easily for storage if that is needed   the most confusing part was activation   they try to get you to buy into the training program through a trial period using an app that makes it easier to activate the treadmill   however you can activate without the app but it is not easily determined how      
1167,5.0,                       assembly was difficult but not impossible   the arms   still not totally aligned but still sturdy   don t drop a screw inside   hard to retrieve  if at all  use it every other day   love it   it s smooth   sturdy   quiet  don t order it from the company direct   after   weeks   no word   i called them  my order was still in the computer   not sent to the warehouse   cancelled   ordered from amazon   expected in   days   got it in        
1168,5.0,                       this is a great at hothis is a great at home treadmill   it s easy to operate has a great instrument panel for tracking your workouts and can be inclined for a more strenuous workout   what was most important to me was the width of the running deck   it s not so narrow as it be dangerous but not so wide that it takes up so much space   we moved from the city where there were plenty of sidewalks to run on  into the country where there are none and this treadmill still allows me to run safely  i highly recommend this treadmill  the cost point and size and extras are all a great deal      
1169,5.0,                       this is a great value  i love the ifit option and i signed up for the monthly subscription  there is an option to use the machine without activating this app and all you have to do is contact them for instructions  but given covid and the fact that gyms are not going to be open for a while  the ifit option is a great value  it s a very responsive machine and has a smooth transition when i m adjusting the incline while running  highly recommend      
1170,5.0,                       well i love my nordic track treadmill  it s not that easy to put together  it may take you awhile but read your directions   but other than that   it s super easy to fold and use  i would buy it again if i had the choice  i m a real customer and i love my nordic track      
1171,5.0,                       as a           lb runner  i was having a difficult time finding a treadmill that sits low enough that i could comfortably use in my basement  without sacrificing machine performance   after doing my research and selecting this model  i couldn t be happier   the box it arrives in is big and heavy   plan on having help getting it to the room you want it  i believe i paid for the delivery service to bring into my basement   that was worth every penny     everything was packed well and arrived in good shape   with the help of a youtube video  i was easily able to assemble the treadmill by myself  likely not recommended  but certainly possible     the ifit videos are a great way to get lost in your workout whether it s a leisurely walk through a german christmas market or interval runs through snow covered mountains   the treadmill itself is large enough to run with a full stride  the belt is among the quietest i ve come across  and  unlike cheaper  lighter off brands  provides a sturdy base that you can run confidently on   it folds up nicely and has several places to hold any personal items you need nearby   would definitely recommend this   am very happy with my purchase      
1172,5.0,                       overall this is a great treadmill  it was easy to assemble and feels very solid  i like how the folding mechanism has struts so it won t slam down   much safer  my only complaint is that the powered incline is very slow and very loud  other than that  it s great  we ve had the treadmill for about a month now and have had no issues      
1173,4.0,                       the assembly was a nightmare   several screws left as placeholders were stuck   then other areas were not large enough for screws   we ended up having a professional come over to do the assemble   it s a good thing we did because he got stuck a few times as well thankful to a previous reviewer who mentioned how to bypass the stupid ifit registration treadmill itself works   is as expected   louder than i expected but then again it s not in a gym with a ton of other noise drowning out the sound      
1174,2.0,                       i don t recommend this product  don t waste your money  the inclined engine went up and never went back after the first use  the running belt slips while walking so it wasn t safe to use the machine for running  the belt stops suddenly while the machine is still counting time and distance update  we requested a replacement and it will arrive next month  we still have to reassemble the old machine  package it and return it to the carrier      
1175,1.0,                       the machine is great quality  it was easy to assemble  screen is easy to read   i would love to give this   stars for shipping and delivery  ordered on march    was suppose to receive delivered on march   per the delivery desription and box moved into entryway  instead i received on march    and the driver left in the yard on a rainy day  if you don t mind waiting it for weeks and putting in your home yourself     lbs  then order it      
1176,4.0,                       assembly is a huge pain  the screws don t fit perfectly and require a lot of adjustment also  you have to sign up for a membership in order to use the machine  which is pretty deceiving and misleading  i m close to sending it back      
1177,5.0,                       i m a big guy and been using this for over a month  this has been a great treadmill  very durable and quiet      
1178,5.0,                       its been as planned so far  wasnt super difficult to assemble now i just have to get on it  thats the hard part lol     
1179,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          while the treadmill is a good value in my estimation  the customer service response to an issue with the unit is disappointing and extremely poor  when put together  the unit has a  squeaky  belt noise when in use and i ve reached out to icon fitness several times  they finally replied asking for a video of the issue and our address  sent that over a week ago and crickets  we ve now had the unit for one month and forced to use it with the annoying belt sound  their response is terrible  perhaps consider a different brand for better response time to any potential issues      
1180,4.0,                       this is a great and durable treadmill for daily workouts  mid range  affordable  and gets the job done especially during our current  shelter at home  situation i have walked on it on an incline and jogged on it  slight squeaking noise on the first day during the first   mins and then it went away my only complaint is their big removable sign on the screen that says you must sign up for their ifit program to turn the machine on  no thank you thank you to previous posters for posting the workaround for that  push down on the ifit blue icon on the screen and hold down for several seconds until the machine turns on  viola  good to go and no need to pay any additional fees unless one chooses to and would like to access additional programs  i just need a standard treadmill      
1181,4.0,                       i have used my t   s treadmill just about every day since i got it   weeks ago  over     miles    assembly was not too bad  although you do need two people   i have been happy with the machine speed and incline and it makes less noise than my old one  different brand    i did have a problem with the bottom half of the display board  which stopping working after about   weeks of use   fortunately the top half still works and i am able to still use the treadmill while i wait for the new board to be shipped   the company was responsive to my problem and if it were not for that problem i would have given a   star rating      
1182,5.0,                       i ve been using the nordictrack t   s for about a month now and it is working great  i d read a lot of the reviews and noted quite a few mentioned that they squeak  my unit does not squeak and belt noise is minimal  if you don t want the ifit program just hold that button down on the display for       seconds and it will go away  i ve used it daily since it arrived and wish i d had one a long time ago  it s a breeze to use and easy to put together   i put it together by myself with no problems      
1183,5.0,                       the guys that put my treadmill together did an awesome job they could figure out the ifit so they called their manager he came over the next day and i love my treadmill the first guys out it together with care and their manager helped me install the ifit on my phone i would use them again and again      
1184,2.0,                       learned the belt was torn when we turned it on after setting up  set up wasn t the easiest thing in the world but it s doable  fitness videos are great to watch and work our with others  custom setting to work our without a coach which also good  doesn t come with a lubricant for the belt so you will have to order some before you can even use it      
1185,5.0,                       the treadmill arrived on time and was well packaged  two delivery men placed the treadmill in my house where i asked them to  the treadmill is very heavy  so i emphatically suggest putting it near where you expect to use it   or at least move the individual parts a couple at a time  if there are two of you putting it together  no problem  hopefully  one of you is somewhat handy with reading directions and using hand tools  there is a hex wrench  but it is only good for starting the screws  you will need a better hex wrench because of torque needed to fasten the screws down  also a correct phillips screwdriver is needed  the instruction booklet is very good  just slowly and carefully read the instructions  don t rush the installation  i was missing one little star washer  no big deal as i always save extra hardware  now the good part  the treadmill is very heavy and stable with all kinds of options on using it  i got it for my cardiovascular workout and not wanting to put a lot of pressure on my hips and knees  this treadmill is perfect for me  you can do a lot of different exercises on this unit if you really want to  i usually turn the radio on high incline to   and speed to     mph for    minutes  absolutely perfect for me    as a postscript  this unit isn t really meant for moving around    did i mention it is very heavy   i also don t plan on lifting the deck up anytime soon  i did install by myself      
1186,3.0,                       they paint over the screws and bolts making them very hard to put in  stripped   trying  assembly is very difficult with one person as well  however  once you get through that    it seems to be solid and nice  delivery directions were a bit misleading with set up being implied including demo and clean up but i found out that was not true   not sure why it was stated without a disclaimer but that is a separate issue  product itself meets expectations      
1187,5.0,                       this is perfect for me  i m a power lifter that also likes to run  weird i know  age has caught up with me and two ankle surgeries later  hard to run at    yrs old and    lbs  realized that i like to jump on the treadmill and walk at an incline  got this treadmill because of the reviews and the reputation or nordictrack  i love it  moves well  quiet and easily carries my giant body      
1188,5.0,                       bought this the first day of shelter in place  i have four teenagers and hamsters stuck in a cage need a  running wheel  after they get up and eat lunch all of them spend some time running walking sprinting on the treadmill in the garage  it is saving us     my husband assembled   took     hours  i have a hs school varsity ball player and a division   college swimmer and they both find it sturdy enough to work out on        
1189,5.0,                       we bought this treadmill a month ago and we love it    works great    first it came packaged very well  the treadmill was very secure inside the packaging  it s instructions were very easy to use  and assembly took me two hours  the treadmill looks really good and works really well  i haven t even used any of the settings yet but the basic machine itself is wonderful  incline and speed  comfort  etc  spacious enough to not fall off the back  a perfect ridge to hold an ipad but still able to see the information display  etc  it s awesome  great machine  great price  definitely recommend nordictrack treadmill       
1190,4.0,                       pros  very easy to use  simple machine that gets the job done  great for beginner intermediate runners  i run     miles per day and is great for my purposes   relatively quiet machine  easy to fold up trackcons  customer service people are nice but it took   attempts      weeks  to get the appropriate parts sent to me to put it together  so it sat in my living room collecting dust     i had to call   times to get the right parts because the piece kit it came with was incorrect and they kept send the wrong ones    but now that s it s finally together and working i haven t had issues  good machine  probably won t buy from them again though because their customer service was very poor in execution though they were nice when they spoke with me      
1191,4.0,                       read some negative and positive comments about these   this is a great treadmill  very heavy package  requires   person to lift and assemble  i would like to give it a five star but only   star because of ifit   it works without ifit   dont connect to the internet   you can skip setup and do manual start  people dont want to pay extra monthly payment for ifit and watch it over a small screen  people will not but this if ifit is not resolved  nordick track take notice  quality is great  i only have it for a month running  i just want a treadmill that works with no  fancy  subscriptions  i want to give it a     but because of ifit only a      lets see after   months   year        years          
1192,4.0,                       i m very happy with this treadmill  it s the third i ve owned  its extremely sturdy and the programmed workouts are nice it says you have to signup for ifit to turn it on but you can bypass that by holding the bluetooth button for    seconds  you cant use the bluetooth for anything except the ifit app which is super retarded  i would have given it   stars if i could just use the bluetooth with my phone for music other than the dumb ifit and useless bluetooth this is a solid treadmill      
1193,5.0,                       absolutely the best treadmill  seen people complaining about needing to purchase a membership with i fit but it comes with the machine itself  i got a actual card with serial numbers and once everything was installed correctly it was ready to go    year free family membership  the assembly was so easy to do  did it all myself within   hour  only hard part was bringing the whole package into my apartment because it was heavy     out of        
1194,5.0,                       my    year old and i have been using this for a couple of weeks   it s been great for short breaks during schooling and working at home   it s really what we have needed to adjust in a healthy way to the way public health restrictions have changed and impacted our school and work life we assembled it together  no problem   it s been working well  and i love that it folds up so that we can use our space better   the incline and speed variations are enough for us this is a solid product  especially at this price point   we did have to go to the website to activate the treadmill  but you just  decline  the ifit subscription upsale and it works just fine   we bought the   year maintenance plan to be sure this investment will last at least several years very happy with this purchase      
1195,5.0,                       after purchasing another treadmill that was a nightmare  my son recommended this treadmill   it is bigger than the last one  but  it works wonderfully  the assembly took us a little longer than i thought it would  but my son and i took our time and made sure we did it correctly  it really wasn t hard at all  only issue was the display came already assembled and i had to assure myself we were doing it right before we continued  no adjustments had to be made  i just turned it on and it worked  i did take the advice of other reviewers to bypass the ifit  so that wasn t an issue  either  i don t think it is too loud  so this is a perfect fit for me      
1196,3.0,                       the treadmill itself is great  the shocks on it are as good as a gym treadmill if not better  beware of the ifit  it won t let you turn on the machine without it and if you dont cancel the membership they will charge your card and they will not refund it      
1197,5.0,                       due to the close of gyms i wanted to purchase a treadmill  i did research on multiple products and decided on this one  i most admit its my best investment for       i absolutely love this treadmill  you don t have to subscribe to ifit and your treadmill will still work  it took some work to put this together you will need at least one other person to help you  i m not a runner jogger so this works well for my workouts  i m sure this will hold up if you are a runner its very sturdy  i would definitely recommend this treadmill      
1198,1.0,                        st delivery mother board didn t work  second unit works intermittently and my feet slip any speed over  mph   waste of money      
1199,1.0,                       the craftsmanship was so poor on the treadmill i received it made the product borderline defective  i strongly dislike the fact that i have to register and download the ifit app just to turn on the treadmill  evidently nordictrack holds it s treadmills hostage after the sale  predatory sales marketing techniques like that should be illegal   last nordictrack product i will make the mistake of purchasing      
1200,4.0,                       i was hesitant to purchase this treadmill because i wasn t sure just how much it relied on the ifit app subscription  but i needed something with the gyms closed  and outdoor temps of     or higher  so i decided to chance it on this treadmill because of the affordability and nordictrack reputation   the ifit app does offer a lot in terms of workouts training  but is not necessary to use this treadmill  there are    built in workouts to choose from  or you can just run in manual mode  any of those options still allow you to change speed and incline at any time  you can adjust the softness fitness of the tread platform  and at          lbs the platform is plenty long enough where i don t feel like i need to crowd the front for fear of coming off the back  also no issues of the belt stalling  or stuttering  with any footstep landings   the only cons i really have for this treadmill is that you can t input your height weight setting  and you can t create custom workouts  other than manually adjusting on the fly while running in manual mode       
1201,5.0,                       this is a great machine  received at a great price  bypass for the i fit works  so you do not have to buy this program  use it daily bypass is holding the ifit button for thirty seconds once on first use  track slipped a bit but the tools provided for assembly helps you adjust  assume shipping   overall my husband and i are both using it with no issues  recomend paying the extra for inhouse delivery  unit weight is heavy and the two guys that brought it in had a hard time  so its worth the delivery fee      
1202,5.0,                       so far    month  this is an excellent treadmill   the     wide belt is much better than the     width often seen on home treadmills   the incline and speed are just right for the range of running that i want to do indoors   i like that the speed and incline selections are great big buttons  responsive and easy to hit even when running full speed   the treadmill has a solid feel  is not too loud  and overall performs very well      
1203,1.0,                       please note that before you are even allowed to turn this treadmill on you are forced to log into an  ifit com  website and enter your credit card number and sign up for an auto renewal monthly membership of     month   there are warnings all over the treadmill and stop and before first use you must  activate  your machine   meaning you have to log onto this website and  activate  your monthly subscription   you are allowed to cancel anytime but this is a ridiculous bait and switch tactic and entirely unacceptable   i already paid for the treadmill   if i wanted the monthly subscription i would sign up  but forcing new purchasers to sign up before they can even turn on their treadmill  you need an activation code  you are forcing something on us we may not want   if these were easy to return i would   and i suspect that s part of their reasoning   people are just going to do this b c they don t want the hassle of returning a heavy treadmill   well you got what you wanted but i want to make clear every prospective purchaser   beware of this forced requirement   buy at your own risk      
1204,1.0,                       after spending almost  hrs to assemble this by myself  the last step requires you to  activate  the treadmill via ifit   once on ifit  you have to provide a credit card to proceed to the next step to activate the treadmill   while the first month of ifit service is free  it automatically enrolls you in a     month plan  unless you then go back into the site to unsubscribe   after spending      and  hrs to assemble a treadmill  do you really think someone wants to have to provide a credit card to turn the damn thing on       
1205,4.0,                       this treadmill definitely requires multiple people to help unless you have at least one person who loves to assemble things  then two people will suffice  it s super heavy  easy to fold and roll backwards but pulling it forward out of a corner  ehhh not so easy  i m not a runner so the preprogrammed workouts on ifit aren t for me        i just use it to walk with an incline which is awesome  all in all it s a great machine  it tracks calories based on your height and weight   distance and time   not many bells and whistles but perfect for daily usage  it s not quiet nor loud but right in the middle  i d recommend to others     
1206,3.0,                       ok  this may be review number  one of several  i had a nordictrack pt    i bought around    years ago  i put     every other day on it over that    year period  it finally started having issues  frigging amazing so i got another  makes sense had a lot of trouble putting it together  things don t line up   the plastic pieces do not fit together well and so forth  next will be to see if it is as quiet and performs as well as the old one  i do not have high hopes to be continued      
1207,5.0,                       i ve been using this treadmill for about three months and have been very pleased  it s a great treadmill for squeezing in a quick workout  many of the lower priced treadmills i looked at were for walking only  so the fact that i could actually run on this one stood out  i haven t used this one at it s top speeds but it s been very capable and comfortable for easy and moderate runs  the ability to change the stiffness is a really nice feature  i ve done a little bit with the ifit integration  but not sure if i will keep it  it feels a little small and cramped compared to the gym treadmills i ve used  but i m sure i would need hundreds more for that quality  this treadmill is a great value for the money i highly recommend paying the little bit extra for professional assembly as well as the delivery upcharge to deliver to a specific room in your house  this package was heavy overall i feel really good about this purchase      
1208,4.0,                       we love the treadmill  i would rate it at a   as far as structure  feel  features etc   but  you literally cannot use the treadmill until you register through ifit and enter your credit card information for your free trial  i buy a      treadmill  set it up in my home and i literally can t use it until i sign up for your ifit program  that is complete bs  i signed up and cancelled it immediately which isn t that big of a deal   but still  i shouldn t have to submit my cc information to you just so i am allowed to turn my treadmill on  i could understand registering it for support  etc but to actually have to enter payment information seems very wrong to me      
1209,5.0,                       once assembled the treadmill is great  lots of settings to adjust to get your perfect run  i played with the trial subscription for a bit  but didn t find it worth keeping  i forgot to cancel and got charged  customer service was great and removed the charge without any questions  the longer tread is great for taller people  i m       tall and have never felt like i was running out of space  i m also    lbs and quite often run into  slip  issues on other treadmills where my weight would cause the treadmill to lose grip and slip beneath me  i have not had any issues with that so far  assembly is a little difficult  but not too bad with the help of someone else  make sure you read every step though  i missed two covers  aesthetic only  and i didn t notice until the end  just left them off because i had to take the whole thing apart back to step   to get them on      
1210,1.0,                       i called nordictrack and they kept me on hold for    minutes before i hung up   i called back and they said i had to register my equipment before anyone would help me   but on the manual it said that if you have any questions or need a part  don t call the store call customer service   a rep finally called me back after   days and said that he had to transfer my call over to someone else   i held on for another    minutes before hanging up   i called back and they said they no one will help me until i register the equipment   i just need a new screw   i don t want the ifit membership   they can come get this equipment and give me my money back      
1211,4.0,                       easy to assemble instructions are really easy to read  sturdy  not loud  only complaint no fan and no on off switch or sleep mode  there is a re set button not sure if that is like an off button  first day using treadmill  so far only used manual mode  no need to buy the ifit membership  i read other reviews   you just have to hold the ifit button for a few sec and it starts  i really like the treadmill for the price      
1212,4.0,                       i m so happy with this treadmill  down fall it s so heavy  we had to carry it to our basement and it was rough  i figured it would be heavy though  assembly was extremely easy only issue is that it s definitely a two person job in certain steps  i fit is awesome  however  after the free   year trial is up i don t want to spend that money to renew it  overall happy  i read a lot of reviews that their treadmills were damaged upon delivery  it s just a gamble you take ordering online  luckily  ours was packaged well      
1213,5.0,                       edit to add   i ve had the treadmill for a little over a month now  i ve done over    ifit tours programs and the treadmill is still holding up beautifully  this was definitely worth spending a little extra on  and i am pleased with my purchase  definitely recommend and will likely purchase more equipment from nordictrack in the future    and i ve lost   lbs so far  so that s also nice granted  it s only my first day with it  but this treadmill is fabulous  it was easy to assemble  it was done in about an hour  we did need a couple of tools of our own  but nothing out of the ordinary  nothing was damaged  scratched  or missing  and it s performance was great  i got   miles in and didn t notice any issues  and i love that it came with a  yr ifit membership  i love their virtual tours  absolutely fabulous      
1214,5.0,                       the     t series treadmill by nordictrack was well worth the price  the price was actually      less on amazon  the worse part about this purchase was that due to covid    it s very hard to get someone to assemble it for you  and getting it delivered in a   floor walk up was also challenging  but now that s it here and up and running  we absolutely live have it  now we have it  we canceled our gym membership as well      
1215,1.0,                       buyer beware  we had nothing but trouble with this treadmill since we received it  we paid for the professional installation  but from day one  there was a really loud squeak from back roller  i contacted amazon and the rep suggested that it may have been a problem with the installation  the installer came back out and took a look and just confirmed that there was a loud squeak at the roller  then  while my teenage son is running on the treadmill  it just cuts out and loses power  i called nordictrack this time and they suggested that i get a professional electrician out to check that the treadmill is on a dedicated circut  i had an electrician come out and everything was set up the way it was supposed to  he even measured the amps for the treadmill and we had plenty of power to run it     amp   four days later and now the belt just stops moving when you step on it  i finally had enough and just called amazon  amazon offered a complete refund on both the treadmill and assembly  i really appreciated that  but i cannot recommend this machine to anyone  now i have to find a way of disposing of this piece of junk  probably have to pay to have it moved to the dump  frustrating   love amazon  but will never order or recommend any product from nordictrack again      
1216,5.0,                       dont get scammed by nordictrack  dont give them subscriptions  avoid by holding down ifit button for    seconds  may have to do several times and you will see   s or letters at bottom left screen on t   s then hold ifit again until activation screen is gone then use your machine and nordictrack can shove where the sun dont shine with there subscriptions   i read it s a absolute nightmare to cancel subscription after your credit card is inputted     
1217,4.0,                       i love this treadmill and the only reason i gave it five stars is because it would have been nice if they added a usb port so you can charge your cell phone while working out  i love the ledge it really holds my cell phone in place and the two side cup holders are square and flat at the bottoms  i use one for my water bottle and the other for the remotes to our tv and roku  great quality item  and  i loved that they offered a   year in home warranty i mean who wants to drag a treadmill to the shop for repairs and they ll replace it if they can t fix it   nice      
1218,5.0,                       treadmill works great  ifit has improved the intensity of my workouts too      
1219,4.0,                       the treadmill is heavy  so make sure you take a help of another perosn to get it to where you want to have this installed  moving around in the same room is easy  but to a different floor level should be thought out prior to assembly the assembly and set up was easy with the help of the instructions  i wish there was a way to disassemble this without having to take the entire top portion apart  there could have been a better way to attach the wires connecting the controls  but its okay  managable  one of the cup holders was broken in shipping i guess  i called the customer care and they send a replacement  so its okay the set up needs to be with ifit log in  but it was easy  i dont usually use the ifit options  i have my own routine  so it doesnt matter  so far its working very well  no problems   overall quality product      
1220,5.0,                       best amazon buy yet   single mom assembled myself  recommends   plp  i used bungee cords vice a second person     hours assembly  ok directions lacking diagram closeups and at times the diagrams were too busy the electric grounding screw didn t fit at all seemed like the screw thread was not complete  had to use a regular screw because with covid i can t exactly go buy a new one from a store right now   hoping that wasn t an electrical mistake   looking forward to using it a lot with covid lock in      
1221,4.0,                       this is a great treadmill  which we have had now for a couple of days   we will see how it continues to function   but it is a very sturdily built piece of equipment   i have one main concern   trying to get through to them to activate took nearly an hour on hold   however  once i got through  the lady was very helpful   we did not want to make use of the ability for the treadmill to be on line   to get around this only takes pushing the small blue button  entitled  ifit   for about    to    seconds  until all zero s came up on the screen   but it took me all that time on hold to find this out   if you are not interested in using the internet connection  just go straight to the blue button   it does take   to put together   i highly recommend the treadmill itself      
1222,1.0,                       piece of junk  nordic trak and amazon should be ashamed   building this thing was a nightmare   holes did not match up   once the thing is complete it will not start unless you register with ifit   complete nonsense   it should be illegal or criminal to out something out like this   very disappointed with amazon      
1223,5.0,                       this is a high quality machine   just like the ones in the gym   easy to use  assembly is not difficult  strong construction      
1224,5.0,                       this is a great entry level treadmill  it is very smooth and the shock absorbers work really well  not too bad to assemble  about       minutes total time  i would definitely recommend it  one thing to keep in mind  if you unplug or turn off using the main power switch you will have to hold down the manual button every time to use it without the ifit setting      
1225,5.0,                       press and hold the ifit button to disable and go the manual way  took us   hours to figure that out      
1226,4.0,                       i ve owned this treadmill since january thinking it was my new year s resolution to get fit  since the whole covid   situation  this purchase makes more sense than ever  i ve been running almost everyday for about     miles everytime  this treadmill is amazing for the price   the ifit program is a great feature because there are all types of instructors that push you  the treadmill was fairly easy to put together   you need atleast   people   a wrench and alot of patience   took about   hours or so to assemble  i m glad to have purchased this as i use it everyday  it beats going to the gym when i can run in the privacy of my home  i would highly recommend buying this product      
1227,5.0,                       i had such a hard time deciding which treadmill to pick when buying one  i did a lot of research and nordictrack seemed to have good reviews at an affordable price  i have had it for almost a year now and i am so happy with my purchase  it is pretty light weight and it has a stand so it can be lifted up after use which is cool  it s not very loud  the run is smooth and the belt is just big enough  i really have no complaints      
1228,5.0,                       i use this treadmill at home and i am replacing another nordic track treadmill that we owned for    years  the reason i went back to nordic track is the quality of their product  i had the previous treadmill serviced once in    years for routine maintenance  this unit is improved in design and easy to set up and operate  great product      
1229,4.0,                       takes   mildly intelligent people to assemble     ish hours  it s true you can bypass the ifit membership thing  once assembled  plug in  attach red safety  flip the off reset switch on the bottom corner  the screen will light up  hold down the ifit icon for    seconds and yeehaw start jogging      
1230,5.0,                       really impressed with the quality given the price   very solid and enjoyable run   took my husband about    minutes to assemble   tech is a bit dated   who uses an auxiliary port anymore   but has a ledge for me to watch youtube virtual trail runs on my ipad   would highly recommend      
1231,5.0,                       i was looking for a quality treadmill to fit into a relatively low ceilied basement  less than   feet high  that had a belt long and wide enough for somone   ft     this nordictrack fit the bill  the treadmill has a low belt  and a convenient fold up storage feature   but is a comfortable width and length  i also appreciate that the treadmill can be set to a specific speed up to a tenth of a mph  assembly was easy  was able to do it with my husband at home   the treadmill was also a very  very reasonable price for the quality  i would recommend it to anyone looking for a starter treadmill  and who may have limited space for the equipment      
1232,2.0,                       very upset  ordered this product at a higher price than it should have been  and it came in a damaged box and the treadmill was damaged  rips in the belt and cracks and breaks off the edges  i ve heard horrible things about nordic track support  so i m unsure how i feel about going through the return process  overall severely disappointed      
1233,4.0,                       received the product within   weeks of ordering it  assembling took about   hours  just pay attention to the instructions and you need   people to assemble it pro s  it is strong and sturdy  has different options for the runs which is great depending on what you are trying to achieve  noise level is not an issue for us because it is in the basement and it is no different from the treadmill at the gym   length and width of the track are a good size  if you have space this treadmill is good but if you do not have a lot of space  you may want figure the size first con s  speaker s are not the greatest but they work okay for the workout overall  i am very happy with the treadmill  it is worth the amount i paid for and gets me moving which is what i wanted to reach my goals     
1234,4.0,                       when i received the item there was some cosmetic imperfections in the plastic engine cover which wasn t unexpected since i bought this via an amazon warehouse deal and this was disclosed  unexpectedly  the incline motor was bad and was unresponsive to any input  customer service took a couple of weeks to get back to me which brings the overall review down to   stars  but when they did  they sent the replacement products based on my explanation of the issue and had a local technician reach out to me and schedule the repair  after the repair was complete  it now works flawlessly on the incline  i understand things like this happen  and they stood by their warranty albeit with not overly fast service overall a great purchase for the home gym  i use it     times per week and it feels very sturdy and like it will last a long time      
1235,2.0,                       it s not a bad unit  it definitely costs more than it should  it was delivered with chunks busted out above the screen which is the packaging company s fault  but still the material used looks and feels cheap  i was surprised with the name nordic it would be such a cheaply manufactured piece of equipment  i would recommend buying a different brand entirely  pretty disappointed in this purchase but it ll do the job if you re willing to deal with extra bs     
1236,2.0,                       i ve had this machine for nearly   months  and use it   to   times a week  i m not a big guy at     lbs  just have a little spare tire from quarantine  unfortunately  this machine louds croaks and groans several times during a workout when changing inclines  it is very noticeable and causes some anxiety when i start interval running or high incline hiking  i m just waiting for the support structures to crash down mid workout and take me with it the interface is pretty easy to use and understand  the ifit program is the greatest part of the workout though  since you can select a video and the program will adjust your speed and incline while you focus on the trainer and scenery  or tv  would i buy this again  maybe  if the price point were lower and more in line with quality of the machine i received  it is overpriced for the lack of quality      
1237,5.0,                       this has been a great purchase  the touch screen makes using ifit extremely easy to navigate  and the ifit program has been well worth it also  putting it together took about an hour and half  but easy to follow directions of where everything goes  also  super easy to fold to clean under or to push out of the way  the only issue that i ve had is that it s not bluetooth compatible on the revision i bought  and the aux cord is for input only   so you can t jack in to hear the ifit audio  i just run the app and the machine at the same time to hear the audio   overall  it s been an a great purchase and couldn t be happier with it      
1238,5.0,                       love my nordictrack  this has been a lifesaver during quarantines hot summer months with my gym being closed  my husband put it together by himself  it did take him a few hours but was successful  it does not have a huge footprint in the room we put it in  it doesn t take up too much space  the programs are amazing  you can go to a different country every day and exercise while learning something new and distracting yourself from the exercise  you can also use this as a regular treadmill without the programs  overall  i would recommend this to anyone and everyone  it was so worth the investment  i love it and use it every day      
1239,5.0,                       this is a fantastic home treadmill that has all of the functions  speeds and features that i could ask for   it was relatively easy for two of us to put together in about an hour  you definitely need two people   the hardest part was getting it from the front door to the basement because of how heavy it is   my only complaint is the attempt to force us into signing up for an ifit membership   there were big  bold notices on top of all of the paperwork and the treadmill itself saying it won t function until you register for an annual ifit membership  which i did not want to do   thankfully i read a lot of reviews ahead of time and learned that i could get around this loophole by holding down on the ifit button on the console for    seconds the first time i turned it on   thank goodness this worked because i would have been upset to have to register and pay for a membership that i didn t want after spending hundreds of dollars on a new treadmill   hopefully nordictrak will reverse this strong arming practice with ifit for future customers      
1240,3.0,                       we received the treadmill in time and in good condition  appreciate the packaging from nordictrack i gave a   star as i ran into some problems  and havent had the chance to start up the treadmill  my      investment has to wait for another week to experience the roi     the equipment is heavy  so you need   adults to help with the initial assembly    strange that the pre attached screw for grounding at the bottom of the right handrail fits better than the one provided in the pack     the equipment comes with some pre attached screws  i am still not clear why screws are pre attached when they anyway need to be discarded   maybe there is an engineering reason    while setting up the handrails  there are   sets of pre attached screws on each handrail  i could remove   of them but the fourth one wont budge  its seems to have got stuck in the body of the handrail or the threads are stuck  unless i remove it  i cant fit the console with the screws provided in the hardware kit  i reached out to their customer service chat and after a few minutes of online conversation  they ordered a new left handrail  i have to wait for     days for that part to arrive so  eagerly waiting to receive the part and experience the treadmill      phase    received the part but was the wrong one    i had an issue with the left handrail and after speaking with the customer service agent  she ordered the same part  however  ended up receiving the left upright  anyway  i then ended up going to home depot and remove the screw with a power tool with their help so far  the treadmill s been running well      
1241,5.0,                       the t series    si treadmill is working great for me  it took me a long time to diced which machine to get  but i think i got the perfect size for me   to assemble takes two people and you really need to read the instructions before you do anything in order for it to work  it took us some time but was worth it  we did it with out any problems its easy to fold and it works great   i got the perfect size and equipment for me    nordictrack makes great products and this one is one of them    ana emily     
1242,1.0,                       the treadmill works fine except for one problem  about a week into using it it developed a horrible squeaking noise  i sent an e mail to support and they said they would contact me shortly  while waiting i found a temporary fix by putting the incline to   and the squeaking noise would stop  this work around only worked for a week and now the squeaking noise persists regardless of incline  i would give this   stars even with the squeaking noise if it wasn t for the horrible customer support  i contacted them exactly   weeks ago  i have not gotten a single reply through e mail or phone call  they just completely ignored me      
1243,4.0,                       this was relatively easy to assemble if you follow the directions step by step  once assembled and you begin using it you will realize that it is a good quality treadmill  the downside is the    screen is too small to see when you are doing some of the ifit workouts that require you to step off the treadmill to complete  also  the boot up is pretty slow and you have to wait   or so minutes before you can use it once the switch is turned on it is very responsive and overall is a good treadmill      
1244,5.0,                       i am a female    feet and   inches      pounds     years old  i essentially jog      miles per hour        minutes per day   i have had this machine since summer and it is awesome   i did not contract the ifit  i enjoy listening to news podcasts instead   so i cannot discuss this  not missing gym at all  assembly was not very easy  took about a couple of hours  and you need two people to assemble      
1245,4.0,                       the amazon ad is misleading  the treadmill weighs alot more than they advertise   it weighs      plus the weight of packaging which includes alot of wood for safe shipping    probably another       and with covid  they only bring it in just past the front door  and it does not say that one needs to spend over an hour putting it together   these facts should be made clear      
1246,1.0,                       i m very  very unhappy  first  the treadmill itself was well packed  relatively easy to assemble  looks great and may well be a good treadmill   but it won t run unless   until we go to ifit com  give them a credit card number   authorize ifit to bill us     monthy after    day trial for their service  i m filing a complaint with the federal trade commission for false advertising  et al  i bought a treadmill   not a subscription to ifit com  i cannot and will not recommend buying this or any treadmill crippled by ifit com  this is beyond the pale  it s sunday    customer support  is closed      
1247,1.0,                       i have struggled with this piece of junk for   years  i have owned many treadmills and have never had so much trouble  almost everytime i use it i have to reset thewhole thing and troubleshoot some new issue with the completely pathetic electronics that are completely useless to start with and then plague you by stopping the stupid thing from performing the one thing we want it to do  this is good for raising blood pressure and stress levels  but you won t get a workout on the stupid thing        
1248,3.0,                       got the treadmill yesterday and spent   more hours on disassembling and assembling  now i am being blocked by step    the screws     x        screws     mentioned in step   can t be fully tighten in and it blocked the remaining steps  i checked the screws and looks they are all a little bigger then the holes so they can be fit in  attached pic for reference i am gonna call customer service to ask their suggestion  be aware of the issue before clarifying the issue  i will rate it     starts      
1249,5.0,                       love this treadmill  if you don t have someone to help you put it together or if you re not great at putting things together yourself  invest in getting the assembly assistance be aware of you put this together yourself  it s as heavy as an elephant and not the easiest thing to maneuver  leave it in the box until it s in the room where you want it  also  lift with your knees the online registration is slightly aggravating but otherwise a simple process if you re looking for a mid priced  full size treadmill and with a great incline this one is great and works like a charm  i highly recommend this product      
1250,5.0,                       three days after gyms closed for shelter in place  got this treadmill and its kept me sane   i power walk incline so it s perfect for what i need p s  regarding another review  i never had to sign up for ifit membership at all   my husband put it together and we registered it to begin  no credit card was given needed   don t fall for that when in the app  if you don t want to use the app at all  then register  don t pay for anything and don t use the app people just need to be smarter and take time to pay attention  look into things on their own before complaining      
1251,1.0,                       this came quicker than expected to replace our old treadmill that had gone bad  it came quickly and went together with no problems  however we we attempted to start the treadmill  it would not allow us to run it until we had first signed up for a  free fitness plan that required our credit card in order to register  no no no no no no no  absolutely no  when i pay for a product  it should not be locked out because of some  extra optional  feature  we bought this expecting to be able to start it up and go  but were locked out by the software  this is the most shady practice i have ever experienced in my life and will not be buying another norditrac product aside from being a useless brick until you surrender your credit card information  after you do that  it does work well as a treadmill  relatively low profile and has a good solid step      
1252,2.0,                       this is crazy that you can t even turn on the treadmill without putting your credit card information on their membership   i just want to have treadmill that works  they should not lock the machine when they sell it at all      
1253,4.0,                       pro  good for home cardo   the majority of the assembly instructions were clear con  i bought an extended warranty through amazon  and it took a long   long time to get my paperwork in the mail  i tried to contact icon fitness customer service but had a hard time getting ahold of someone  the majority of the time  no one was available  or i kept getting transferred  it was frustrating   the belt kept moving to the right  should have been already aligned  however  the good point is that there are instructions in the manual on how to align it general point  good for an owned house or first floor apartment  for higher levels without an elevator  it will be a real pain to carry or even have it carried up the stairs     
1254,5.0,                       great treadmill  the guy who assembled it said it was one of the good ones  he stated that some of them are rickety  not stable while you re working out i advise you not to use amazon s assembly company  they changed my appointment   times  treadmill was delivered in september  assembly was scheduled for october  then rescheduled for november i canceled and found someone who came the same day      
1255,4.0,                       sadly had to end my gym membership recently  but wanted to continue running   this was the perfect choice   set up took a bit of time and ability to follow directions  but it can be done   treadmill is heavy  so beware that it may take   people to move the box parts the only issue i have so far is with the pulse monitor    it only works some of the time   sometimes good  sometimes it fails otherwise very pleased with this purchase   and   it is less expensive than the version with the video screen  but i don t need that for home use      
1256,5.0,                       we purchased this after comparing to other makes and models  the nordictrack t    s is all we could ask for at this price point i was able to assemble this completely by myself but would probably be better with one other person if possible the one thing that was not in the instructions was getting the console out of the  ifit activation  screen  which you cannot get past without holding the ifit button on the console until the screen changes to manual mode nowhere was this in the instructions and i was lucky enough to come across the tip searching google for    beeps when any button pushed on nordictrack t    s console  one thread had this tip buried in the comments that was the only hiccup in the assembly and start up very pleased with this treadmill      
1257,5.0,                       this thing works great  i was a little hesitant based on some of the reviews but i ve had no issues  you do need to activate ifit  but just to get it started  i did not have to enter a credit card number  i m sure it would be a little more fun with the workouts activated  but it works just fine without it      
1258,1.0,                       first  when assembling  the drilled holes were too small for the screws  after an hour on hold for customer service  i was told  just use all your body weight and really shove them in   i can send you new parts but they won t work either   what  then  as we lifted the treadmill for the final steps of construction  every step was labored  the entire bottom metal bar is bent  it is where the metal is super thick  so i don t even know how that could have happened except maybe in the factory  it s much more than someone dropping the thing or anything  i am so frustrated  now i m going to have to go back to square one        
1259,4.0,                       i m very much in love with my new norditrack treadmill  i use it everyday and i use the ifit programs that come with the machine  i just finished my  th week running on the beaches of costa rica with ifit trainer ana maria  it was amazing  and the treadmill runs smoothly  mostly all the time with the exception of some skipping  which is the reason for it not getting a full   stars  when the machine is at a higher speed over  rpe then the belt skips  i keep meaning to call norditrack about this issue because it should not be having this problem being so new  i got the warranty just in case  aside from that its wonderful and i love it      
1260,1.0,                       horrible customer service  always received promises of replacement parts which took weeks for a couple of them and finally received the missing handrail after i had returned it      
1261,1.0,                       this purchase has proven to be one of the worst i ve ever done on amazon  the treadmill never worked after assembly  i called customer service   times only to be left waiting  sometimes for    minutes  without anyone picking up the phone  nordictrack has very limited phone support  only   hours during the weekend  and nobody picks up phones  the only phone line attended is the sales line the person who assembled the treadmill  hired by nordic  said he ve seen many defected treadmills coming from factory but he is equipped only for assembly and can t do anything to fix the problem total nightmare      
1262,5.0,                       this nordic track t series treadmill performed as expected and better  first of all  right out of the box it seemed slightly overwhelming to put it together but with the simple installation instructions it made it simple and quick to put together  i did not have any problems  took about    min  my family and i all love it and we have had it for a couple of months now  it has worked flawlessly   out of the box there was a small cut in the belt and i contacted customer service and they were really polite to work with and they quickly sent out a replacement part  as for the folding and storage it is surprisingly easy to fold up  even my    year old can do it  so far the product has been great  the customer service has been great and it has been fun for me and my family  i definitely recommend this product to anyone thinking of setting up an in home gym      
1263,4.0,                       great unit overall   quiet and comfortable except for rails motor cover   motor cover is too close to step pattern when short armed   ft   in person holds onto rails with monitors   arms being square are not comfortable to hold onto in lieu of monitor rails   with nothing to comfortably hold on to  it is not possible to walk with higher speeds      
1264,5.0,                       i have had this treadmill for about   months now  and absolutely love it  it replaced my old nordic track that i purchased in      and used regularly for    years before i decided it was time for an upgrade  it is still working fine and i plan to donate it to charity    the big selling point for me purchasing this particular treadmill was the sturdiness of the device and the online reviews that had nothing negative to say about it  plus the ifit capability  to which i am now addicted  due to covid i miss the ability to travel  and with ifit i ve been able to visit and do hikes and walks from coast to coast as well as many foreign countries and exotic islands  in short  it s awesome  i am also thrilled that you do not have to be a runner to enjoy the ifit products or this treadmill  with the ability to do a     incline  plus the variety of ifit programs  i can walk and incline hike until my heart is content  i have nothing short of praise for this treadmill      
1265,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill as soon as covid    took hold and all the gyms closed  so glad i did  i use this treadmill everyday  i did not think i would have any use for the ifit classes that come with the ifit membership  but boy was i wrong  these classes are great and give me a great work out  i have had the treadmill for about   months so far and its been great  if your on the fence about purchasing it  just buy it      
1266,1.0,                       i ve maybe left one or two negative reviews in my entire adult life  and i wish i didn t have to leave this one  the only reason i went with this product was that similar treadmills from other brands contained toxic chemicals known to cause cancer and birth defects   probably the only good thing i can say about this treadmill  assembly is a nightmare  i m guessing they expect you to pay for professional assembly  that s the only reason this could be so difficult  the assembly process is confusing and convoluted  screw holes are not threaded and need to be tapped  screws are painted over and so do not fit easily  they did not include the hand rails and so i had to get in touch with nordic track and request the missing parts  when they arrived  half of the parts were still missing  and when i finally got it assembled  it seems the treadmill is locked and cannot be used without downloading an app  thankfully  i found the hack to bypass this here on amazon  started it up and the belt seems a bit loose  wonderful      
1267,3.0,                       i really love this treadmill for working out but i m really disappointed that it s not childproof for little kids  i have to keep my treadmill folded up because it s in a tight space   and it s so easy for it to unfold  you literally just lightly kick the bar underneath it and the track starts to come down  that s a little worrisome when you have a curious toddler who likes to touch everything  she could easily push that bar and it would come falling down on her so for now we have a temporary box around it when i m not using it for her safety  i m really surprised there s no way to lock it when it s folded up        
1268,5.0,                       i love it so far but beware     it was advertised with free expert assembly  so when i emailed to ask when i would get it assembled they said i had to put the assembly in the cart when i ordered the treadmill   the assembly box was highlighted so i assumed   ended up paying     for assembly      
1269,5.0,                       was fairly easy to set up mostly by myself  has worked well the few times the wife used it to walk run on but then apparently changed her mind and decided to use it as a clothes hanger thus it has more functions not even listed in the description  i ll eventually use it but no issues with it yet      
1270,4.0,                       i got this treadmill   months ago and it has been doing great for me  assembly was pretty easy  the manufacturer seems to have thought out the assembly well  i m able to fit on this treadmill in my basement  not full height  probably just shy of     with no issues  and i m      as far as using the treadmill  i have only experienced some minor creaking from the unit when it tries to increase the incline  i bought the extended warranty after the purchase  so i m not too worried about this  power wise  the speed seems very consistent and gets there quickly  i ve had no issues of it slowing down on me while running  despite me being a bigger guy             lbs   i ve been using it several times per week as i m trying to get back into shape to do some triathlons  i don t foresee me exhausting the    mph speed maximum for quite some time the ifit experience was ok  but not worth the     a month to me  i used it during the free trial and enjoyed it  but did not continue overall i m very happy with the treadmill and have recommended it to several friends      
1271,4.0,                       i have had this treadmill for a few months now and it s been a game changer   it is best to watch a youtube video on how to assemble before you get started and as you go  while the written directions are good   i think it s best to watch someone else do it first   i was also able to hook up a stand to hold my laptop so i can use this as a  walking treadmill  during work meetings but then take the stand off and use it as i would a treadmill at the gym   this was a very good investment      
1272,4.0,                       so far so good   it s big it s heavy and it was a pain to put together   but it seems to work very well note the video is misleading   ifit is a subscription based service  and the color screen you see of travel is actually an ipad that you use if you get ifit module as an add on  the screen on  the unit is lcd   and any of the cool features you see in the video when it comes to training   is ifit   again costing you money monthly  just an fyi      
1273,5.0,                       incredible deal for        the ifit subscription is way better than i could have dreamt   takes   strong people to get it to the room you want it in  and   people to assemble   i m  a little disappointed that i didn t splurge and get the incline trainer though   if you are on the fence  get the incline   the     doesn t decline at all   you also have to buy an aux adapter to use bluetooth earbuds   it also has no fan  or donut maker    so it s basic  but does the job for a great deal      
1274,5.0,                       i love my treadmill  i used to work in the tool department at sears so im very familiar with the nordictrack brand  the assembly looked over whelming but was actually very easy  i did it by myself   yasss  one me by myself  it took all day because i was working at the same time  the ifit subscription it comes with is very motivating and there are a variety of workouts  i recommend the hiking   i was sweating like crazy after    minutes   it folds up which i need because i have   cats  its the perfect size   i hate skinny treadmills and this is definitely the same quality if not better than the gyms in    hour fitness  its also bluetooth compatible      
1275,5.0,                       i m an avid runner who prefers running outside  but living in a place that gets cold in the winter while being in the military  i needed a treadmill to keep the legs moving  this treadmill delivered what i wanted  a solid treadmill  that has performed brilliantly  for a great price  if you re looking for a treadmill with tons of flashy buttons and advanced technology  this particular model is not it  nordictrack has many models that have all of those features  this model provides you with a great indoor running experience at a price that most people can afford  i would recommend it to anyone who needs a treadmill without breaking the bank      
1276,5.0,                       excellent treadmill for the price  have had it for about a month now and it works fine  the heartbeat sensor isn t the best though  but that s to be expected in this price range  putting it together was a bit of pain because some stages can require two people  but i managed with just me by being creative  beware   the box is massive though      
1277,5.0,                       we love our treadmill   delivery was on time and was delivered to our garage   it was very heavy but my husband and i  and gravity  were able to get it down stairs   i would recommend a dolly for sure   we set it up in our basement   it took us an hour to assemble and the directions were straight forward   i am enjoying the    months of ifit membership   i didn t think we would like it as much as we do   there a place i can put my ipad however the light from the screen is behind it is bright   so i just cover the screen if i want to use my ipad on the treadmill      
1278,5.0,                       i absolutely love this machine  it is very sturdy  easy to fold and unfold  and the app with running coaches is out of this world  my only hang up was assembly  i had to do it on my own which was a struggle but not impossible  i still give   stars because the instructions are clear that two people should be putting it together which would ve made it super easy      
1279,5.0,                       best gift i have given myself during this outbreak   i am unable to go outside to walk during this pandemic so after tons of research decided to gift myself this treadmill   i have it on the  rd floor and it is so quiet that it does not disturb the rest of my family   easy to put together and the ifit subscription is fantastic   if you are on the fence  the best decision you can make    the nordictrack t series treadmill is wonderful     
1280,5.0,                       i don t like the credit card required to activate the machine  pro  it can hold   suits on hangers      
1281,4.0,                       the nordictrack ntl      t     s treadmill replaces a    yr old nordic track model which provided excellent service until the motor finally failed   repair costs and difficulty finding replacement parts made purchase of a newer reasonably priced model a prudent decision   for the first three months of usage  it has performed to expectations and although primary usage is for two senior citizens  it has plenty of bells and whistles for more strenuous workouts   technician assembled unit in under two hours  provided good instructions for initial usage  and cleaned up prior to departing if i could be certain that it will perform to the level of my previous nordic track   and if warranty service  should it be necessary  is prompt and convenient  i would certainly up the rating to   star      
1282,4.0,                       this would be a   but unfortunately when it was time to put the machine together the holes were not drilled enough to where you can put the knobs in between them goodness for my husband that has tools he was able to mold and make the holes bigger      
1283,5.0,                       while this is not as heavy duty as the one i use at the fitness center it has a     incline and same speeds  we used the info from others to easily and quickly bypass the subscription  perfect machine to survive the lone covid winter      
1284,1.0,                       this treadmill is great for       it has great support for your knees with the adjustable cushioning and you can customize and automate your workouts with the nify ifit app my issue is with support this treadmill worked great  almost daily use  but it stopped working after about   months  the display would blink and the motor stop within    seconds of starting a workout  i got in touch with their customer service guys and they were able to diagnose the issue within minutes  the console had fried  i needed a new one they were to ship me the console and the upright wire  the wire arrived probably less than a week after i talked to them  the console has not arrived up to now  i have been in touch with their customer service to get an estimate when i can receive it  all they say is  out of stock  waiting    days for a part to arrive is insane  it might be ok with ifit  but if you have a plan to get fit  it definitely throws a wrench in your plans      
1285,4.0,                       the treadmill has good shock absorption and we love the free ifit trainer programs for one year  so much we will probably renew  if you don t want to use them or get the renewal  the treadmill can be used without those programs  despite the reviews  the heart rate monitors are placed in an inconvenient position so we don t use those at all  plus they don t seem very accurate when we have used them  the arms of the treadmill are also pretty short  but probably so it folds more compactly  assembly was fairly simple  but there were some screws that didn t go in properly due to manufacturing of the screw holes the one thing we re not happy at all with is that the display where all the speed and incline buttons started peeling almost immediately  trapping what looks like moisture inside  see photos   not sure if we just have a defective layer on our display  but if not  it s very low quality      
1286,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill in april  it came half assembled  i only had to assemble the poles and controller  display   the instructions were clear and i was able to assemble it within less than    hrs myself  then i was excited to operate it  thanks to other reviewer who mentioned that ifit account is not required  so i long pressed the ifit icon next to the display and thats it  the treadmill is ready to use  me and my wife have been using it for almost a month  everyday  and i really like it  i am yet to explore all the settings  but it does what is supposed to  as i work from home as everyone else due to pandemic  i often use it whenever i have meetings      i almost lost  kgs in about   weeks  with some diet control too  and i am really happy about it the treadmill is sturdy and it is not shaking much even when i run  not so noisy  i can easily jump to any speed and incline level directly without keep pressing the plus     icon  it has a wide holder that can hold the ipad pro too  overall  satisfied purchase      
1287,5.0,                       purchased this for cold  rainy  inclement weather days  however  i use it as my sole source for running  even on sunny days   husband and    year old son set it up in an hour    quiet  has all the bells and whistles i need  and very affordable  large  smooth running board  easy to use controls  and love the   large storage spaces      
1288,4.0,                       got my unit today and had professional installation  the unit works and i am surprised how smooth the belt ran compared to crappy treadmill my apartment gym have or previous treadmill i owned  i would have given it   stars if it weren t for huge burn marks on treadmill hood  it has huge scars on hood and it is down right ugly  it may be a bad luck and doesn t effect treadmill function but i don t think i can ignore this as it bothers me every time i try to use this treadmill  nordictrack  please send someone to replace hood or send me a part          
1289,1.0,                       the treadmill console speed button function stopped after one month  especially  if you re a fast runner  do not buy this treadmill  i m only    lbs and run at a fast pace  the treadmill is not sturdy when i run at over the speed of    also  the warranty service is awful   generally  i don t leave negative feedback  but this treadmill is not worthy of money      
1290,1.0,                       after a couple of hours of assembly  i just wanted to see if the treadmill ran   i flipped the power switch and    i m locked out    go to ifit com activiate    i had to create an account  enter my credit card info  download an app  pair the treadmill to my phone  and then and only then could i run the flipping treadmill i spent hundreds on outrageous   i then had to go through a lengthy cancellation process with    are you sure   screens to make sure i don t get charged every month for a service i didn t ever want for all i know the actual treadmill works fine  but who cares   i never would have bought this thing if i knew it came bundled with trashy business practices      
1291,2.0,                       amazon didn t like my first review so i will try again to meet their guidelines  i was sent the wrong pieces needed to assemble this machine  nordictrack customer service will take a large portion on your day and patience to remedy the situation   they then offer to send part in      days but will expedite shipping if you complain  quality of machine seems inferior to my old sole treadmill   amazon customer service tech leon was helpful and did a great job assisting  he gets   stars    nordictrack gets a   before i even get it turned on      
1292,5.0,                       treadmill   fine and dandy   works great  wife loves it  the delivery is what i was impressed about  amazon said delivery would occur between  am and  am    days after i ordered it  i thought  sure it will    the morning of delivery when i checked the status i was presented with a local map and the current location of the delivery truck with a notation our delivery was   stops away  they arrived around  am and even called prior to showing up  very impressive       
1293,5.0,                       thanks to other reviews talking about the ifit scam on these machines i was able to bypass signing up for ifit and getting locked into a subscription   hold down the ifit button after it starts up and tells you to activate online   the red key magnet needs to be in place   you only need to do this once  then it is a normal treadmill after that   the treadmill is fine for the      price point   i weigh         
1294,4.0,                       this product has been great so far  i ve used it since just before christmas  i ve probably logged       miles on it  no problems as of yet  i do wish the side boards  for stepping off the belt for a quick drink of water or whatever  were wider  and i also wish it has a pause feature  other than that  it s been great      
1295,3.0,                       this was my feedback to customer service   the package arrived teard down apart   there was one piece broke from the panel but not sure this was on handling or how got broken   the walking belt looks like it was reworked  is this normal     the side of the walking belt looks uneven   the walking belt is not balanced  this should have been adjusted from factorynot a good answer from the sales repafter a few e mails i decided to use my equipment  works well for nowlet s see how long it lasts     
1296,5.0,                       excellent product  very high quality  better quality than most treadmills i ve used at the gym  simple to adjust incline and speed  it syncs with ifit cardio which is a subscription service  but if you own an ipad i strongly encourage the use of the app as it is very immersive and fun  using the app you won t have to do any manual adjustments at all  there are a ton of videos for all levels of training from beginner to experienced  my wife and i had so much fun we ran a combined   miles the day we set it up  the training videos are engaging and shot from a first hand view in locations all around the world from italy  to france  to south america  beaches  cities  and mountains  as well as group training sessions  i never like running on treadmills because of the tedium  but these videos are a beautiful distraction and allow me to get a great    minute run in simply instead of having to leave my house and add travel time set up its easy if you follow instructions and take your time  it helps to have another person just because this is a sturdy piece of equipment and tough to maneuver before it s completely assembled con  you do need to activate it initially and put a card on file to use it  but you can cancel immediately  i didn t like this feature because if you don t have a card or easy internet access it would be frustrating for a person to setup  it s really my only complaint and it has nothing to do with the equipment      
1297,5.0,                       i purchased the t    after reviewing several models in fitness stores   i mainly exercise in front of the tv  though i bought the treadmill because of the large screen and the option to connect to ifit in the future   there are many pre loaded trails and programmed workouts that i use   the treadmill is easy to choose an existing program or use it in manual mode   my one comment is that it does take a minute to start the program each time the treadmill is used   the ramp operation is smooth   i am very happy overall with the treadmill and highly recommend nordic track   i had the treadmill was delivered and assembled as part of the purchase price   delivery was excellent  on time and placed it exactly where i wanted it   the assembly crew was okay   they were not experienced  but they figured it out      
1298,1.0,                       the treadmill itself is nice  my issue is the hard sell eveytime you use it to subscribe to the paid membership  they make it as difficult as possible to go into manual mode      
1299,5.0,                       my nordictrack t series treadmill is the best   easy to assemble   set up and use   i paid        with free shipping from amazon and would have paid a         for it is worth it   well built and many options on the display   not on the large size and not small just a perfect size   easy to lift up and move out of the way if needed   i looked for a few months before i purchased and almost bought a used  one on craigslist for the same price   i researched and checked reviews and made the purchase last november   i am so happy one of my best purchases ever      
1300,4.0,                       i only have the t     s for a couple of weeks  the assembly instructions are very clear as well as the parts are identified by construction step number  my only problem was thst in step   i imissed the installation of the covering boots and i had to dissambly the entire treadmill  the second assembly went very fast this is a big treadmill and it will not pass thuogh standard home door without major manuvering by   strong individuals it has the stard controls expected from a quality tradmill and a bluetooth connection  you will need your phone to activate the tradmill througj ifit  this for me was a major negative  regardless what ifit has to offer i would much prefered to look for such application ruther than being forced down my throat      
1301,4.0,                       first item was delivered with broken box and damaged item  they cannot take it away so buyer must place request for it to be picked up  second item was not damaged  very heavy and requires   people to setup  the quality is very good but not the best  they used to make these more sturdy  this one shakes when you walk on it  the upper portion not the actual tread path  as it is made from thinner metal  overall happy with the purchase      
1302,4.0,                       bought this treadmill for the apartment when the building gym was shut down due to covid  it s a good value for the price  opted for the smaller screen     inches  due to cost and availability  has all the basics to get a good workout in  accelerates quickly when changing speeds  may be a little more difficult to use if you re a taller individual   have a longer stride  paid for someone to assemble it and it took him     hour  overall good purchase and would recommend      
1303,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  i am a retired school teacher just looking to get a good  uninterrupted walk on a daily basis  while i love to walk outside  the weather isn t always conducive  this makes it possible to do daily and i catch up on shows or binge ones new to me  i would  however  think carefully about signing up for the ifit app  i did the    day free trial and now am haggling about my cancellation  which i did well before the trial time was up  it just wasn t for me  but their customer service is terrible   totally unresponsive   most unhelpful      
1304,1.0,                       installation took a couple of hours only to figure out the incline does not work  that is in addition to the deceptive marketing content in the box about requiring an ifit account for this to work  it does not customer support was bad   no effort to dig into the issue   all they had to offer was i will send you a part that i think will solve the problem  but i am not sure  in addition  you have to open heavy equipment to install it  even when i was within the warranty had bought extra service package   go fork yourself customer   and buy again      
1305,1.0,                       they don t tell you when you order this machine that you must sign up for a subscription for their ifit   the machine won t work without it   its free the first year  but you still need a credit card   the machine won t work otherwise   there are ways around it  but they don t tell you   if you don t have  or want to use wifi  you are sol i feel this is underhanded   i would not trust nordictrack the machine itself is okay   not great  but it is a     dollar machine   i didn t expect much and wasn t disappointed go for another brand the online help is just  awful      
1306,4.0,                       i ve had this treadmill for   months  i get a lot of use out of it and it performs to expectation  however  i have   complaints first  it apparently comes with a free   year subscription of their digital fitness program  but they still want me to enter my credit card  so i didn t end up using it second  i find it to be a bit pricey to not have built in fans on the main console like most treadmills  stair masters  etc nowadays do third  and this one is the one that actually really bothers me  the heart rate sensors absolutely unequivocally do not work  i can be at the end of a   mile run and the sensor reads   bpm  which of course is poppycock  this part never worked properly if that part is important to you  you might want to check to make sure that works right away and if it doesn t  call their customer support which frankly isn t something i ever did since i assembled it myself out of the box and didn t want to hassle with returning it  box was incredibly heavy  overall  it s a treadmill with a digital screen that has some cool features that i mostly never use  and it largely works as a home treadmill should      
1307,5.0,                       directions for putting together could definitely be better   putting together took some work  about three hours  for our daughter   however  that is the only negative   she said it operates very smoothly and is in her words  futuristic    we bought it so that she could work out from home during all the ups and downs with covid and closures   it is a great size all away around and fits in her urban condo   we would buy again      
1308,5.0,                       this is the second treadmill i purchased and so far i have not been disappointed   you will need at least two people to lift and move the giant box into your assembly location   the unpacking and assembly can look overwhelming however the step by step directions are easier than you think   the treadmill is constructed with strong metal and plastic materials   the shock absorbers on the running platform are exceptionally strong for smooth running walking use   the ifit additional add on is an awesome bonus to the nordictrack     si      
1309,5.0,                       assembly was fairly easy  although some steps took a little work   once assembled  the treadmill works great  and has been a lifesaver during this quarantine lockdown   walking or running on it feels safe and secure   two large compartments are large enough for water bottle  towel  etc     i also love the shelf which can be used for a tablet phone so you can watch something while exercising   only small complaint is that the power switch is located on the front of the treadmill  at the bottom  right where the motor is  it s a slightly inconvenient location if the treadmill is placed near a wall   highly recommend a mat to put underneath  both to protect the floor and keep the treadmill stable   overall  very happy with the purchase      
1310,1.0,                         days after assembling this machine  the incline motor failed    weeks after going back and forth with customer service  i finally have now received the new incline motor   now  i m supposed to install this and expected not to void my warranty    hours of time spent today trying to replace it  and i m just barely at     complete with the install if i could go back and do it over  i d have forked out at least double on a machine that is reliable  this get what you pay for  product and service       
1311,5.0,                       way easy to put together  much more solid than i originally assumed it would be  super easy to fold up  screen is large and the app is easy to navigate  very good speakers  the work out programs are very enjoyable and it is cool how the speeds and elevation change on their own  on lower speeds    and below  you can feel an inconsistency in how fast the track is moving each time you take a step  that is the only complaint i have  very good product and i am very satisfied      
1312,5.0,                       i m really enjoying this treadmill  the belt is a perfect width  not too narrow  and the the length is great too the  incline   speed  one touch  controls are my favorite part of this treadmill  i don t have to spend time pressing up or down buttons multiple times while running  i just press once on the   i want i don t use the ifit app so i can t report on experience with that  when you first turn on the treadmill the screen will ask you to register with ifit  to bypass that  you just hold down the ifit button for about    seconds and then it takes you to the treadmill screen  you only have to do that once  the next time you turn on the treadmill it ll take you directly to the treadmill screen convenient shelf allows me to rest my phone comfortably so i can watch something on it  and and the cup holders allow me to keep water easily accessible   great value for the price point  highly recommend      
1313,5.0,                       love my nordictrack and the ifit app  delivery from amazon was great and they even delivered it to my basement door  assembly was easy  you get a year of ifit included which is a      value  this was an awesome purchase      
1314,5.0,                       this a very great machine  it took me couple hours to unbox and assemble  it is not loud and contains a variety of workout for any level  i would recommend it for a home gym use      
1315,5.0,                       i love my treadmill   i hadn t stepped inside my gym in months due to covid    and needed something to keep my workouts going  i wanted something that i could run  not walk  on and something that wouldn t break the bank  this treadmill has been used almost daily for about    minutes and is still running well  my husband and i set it up and it was relatively easy to do  the only setback is that the arms are loose and thats because i didn t tighten the screws before attaching the top part  my treadmill is a life saver      
1316,5.0,                       i really love this treadmill  wonderful quality for a reasonable price  the treadmill is quiet and runs very smooth  i use it nearly daily for  k runs  the ifit membership has been awesome  you receive a complimentary free one year trial upon purchase  i can  go  on runs and hikes in global destinations like hawaii or thailand  they have engaging trainers and highly realistic scenes  there are so many virtual runs hikes to choose from  from beginner walks and hikes to advanced marathon runs  and everything in between  you can also download the ifit app   simultaneously follow and track your progress on your smart phone  i always check in with the calendar on the touch screen  which helps me see  track  and monitor my goals  there treadmill track is also long which i love  i am     and my boyfriend is      we each have a long stride while running  and we can run at fast paces easily and comfortably  with the longer length of the track  assembly directions were clear and relatively easy for my boyfriend to assemble      
1317,3.0,                       the tredmill itself is quiet  sturdy and i m overall happy with it  the assembly instructions  on the other hand could have been written by a   year old   whoever wrote the instructions apparently never tried to follow them   the c as pper was the last detail told you to slide the foot covers down the front rails   you would have had to take the whole thing apart to do that   i was also happy i read prior reviews to learn how to bypass the ifit feature   hold the icon for approximately    seconds    this made things a bit easier      
1318,5.0,                       you do not need ifit to use this product  after receiving it all you need to do to activate it is hold down the ifit button for approximately    seconds and it will bypass ifit activation  i read another review that mentioned you could bypass the activation as well but was skeptical until i tried it myself  it may be plastered all over the device and box but do not fall for it  ifit is not required  the subscription is not mandatory  other than that it is a great treadmill for the price      
1319,4.0,                       the treadmill is great  but like  the other reviewers mentioned  i absolutely am opposed to a company making you join a network ifit that you don t want and would never use even if it was free  that s the only reason they didn t get all   stars  it makes me look at nordic track differently that they have to use sneaky gimmicks to get your info   including for some people their credit card info   but you can bypass the registration  put the safety key in and press and hold the ifit button  it works  what s sad is the company does not offer this direction to those that aren t interested in ifit i used the amazon assemblers to put my treadmill together   it took him   hours and i heard a lot of sighing  he did an excellent job  but i don t think it was easy    probably cause the instructions say it s a   person job and he came alone       
1320,4.0,                       i   alone  put this together  i am    yr old woman   i carefully read the instructions  step by step  and it was very helpful that each step was also written on the screws supply package  because of this   i knew exactly what to do  it took me   hours to assemble   it was also very helpful to read other people s reviews on this   because when it came time to turn it on  i knew how to bypass the ifit membership   this treadmill is built strong  running pad and motorization is great  and the computerized screen is great too      
1321,5.0,                       i cannot express how i happy i am i bought this  it is amazing for the price  perfect at home treadmill under      wow wow wow  the minute i started using this treadmill the joint pain i was getting after running disappeared  i have no idea what anyone is talking about the i fit being a scam  i set it up with i fit used the one month free cancelled it and now use it without  you do not need i fit to use it    i am beyond pleased with this product      
1322,5.0,                       not incredibly easy to put together  but then again its a big heavy piece of equipment that has to be shipped to your house in   box     so  i m not complaining  it is a   person  or   very handy boyfriend   it is sturdy and smooth  no damage during shipping  and i was able to bypass the membership scam with the  hold down sync button for    secs trick   i am very happy with it      
1323,1.0,                       doa right out of the box  controller board dead  had to take the thing apart in order for them to help me     minutes on hold for assistance    to   weeks for a new part which i will have to install myself  i would definitely definitely not recommend nordictrack       
1324,4.0,                       we got this treadmill a few months ago and have been very pleased overall   easy to assemble and quick to setup and start using   we never tried the ifit feature   membership and emailed them to cancel it so we wouldn t be charged monthly   no issues in regard to the ifit membership at all  very easy to cancel  my wife and i each run on this a few times a week and have really enjoyed it while it is too cold snowy to run outside   it doesn t have a big tv screen so if we want to watch something there is a place for your phone or ipad   we only give it four stars for a couple reasons     we have ran on nicer smoother better treadmills    not sure the mph is calibrated correctly  seems slow    we bought it to run on when too cold outside so we were really looking for dependability and reliability   four months in and we re very pleased    it has been really solid  allowed us to run  and no mechanical   computer issues whatsoever   great product at a good price      
1325,5.0,                       i love this treadmill and the ifit program   my daughter and i put it together in about   hours  girl power   it is very heavy so   people make it much easier all the way around  we have used it     times a day  everyday since we got it together and have had no problems with its programs or its sturdiness  it is also very quiet and smooth  no floor shaking while using it  highly recommend this treadmill  great price as well      
1326,1.0,                       to use this treadmill you have to activate it on the ifit website  this website is very deceptive  all it contains are misleading membership registrations  i joined by accident and had a very difficult time trying to cancel it   i tried contacting them by email through their website  but all i got was a message  there is a problem with sending your email   like i said  shady   now i have a bricked treadmill decorating my basement  not recommended      
1327,4.0,                       for home use  this is a nicely featured machine  solid to walk run on and not flimsy feeling  pre programmed workouts are nice and also has the ability to just go for a quick walk or run with manual settings  you don t have to subscribe to the ifit either so don t panic  the box is heavy when it arrives so have help moving it or open it up wherever the delivery guys put it and carry the parts in   once together though it moves around with one person      
1328,5.0,                       the treadmill arrived damaged so i called amazon and they immediately corrected the situation by arranging pickup and redelivery for a new one  great customer service  the treadmill itself works great once i figured out how to adjust the belt      originally the belt was uneven and kept pulling to the left but after some youtube research  i was able to adjust the belt with a wrench in the back legs  perfection        
1329,1.0,                       one star as of now  setup the treadmill  started jogging for about two minutes and it stopped working  contacted noridctrack and waiting for them to send me the part update    so far    if i can go lower than one star i would  so far customer service said that my treadmill isn t under warranty because it s in my garage where i set it up  i would ve assumed that they would have shipped out the part asap so i can actually use the treadmill but they re more worried about where it s located  smh      
1330,3.0,                       took me nearly   hours to install it with all the unique i already have  overall it s a good machine with fair price  i only hated how they trying to lurk you join the membership to unlock the machine  instead you can just put the red square key to the center key spot locates at the handle bar and hold the ifit blue button for    ish seconds  if you still have trouble just go to youtube  that s how i unlock it without give up my personal info and force to join ifit membership      
1331,5.0,                       this machine in awesome   each day i visit some far away place courtesy of the ifit subscription to walk in some beauitful place  bora bora  costa rica  lake tahoe  paris     the     video screen and the thoughtful video workouts provided takes the boredom out of treadmill training and is truly engaging   the walking deck is well cushioned nicely so it s not hard on the body   i opted for the in home delivery and installation service so that i could get set up and going right away   very pleased with this product      
1332,5.0,                       nordic track makes nothing but the best quality products   this particular machine is packed with high tech features easy to use to get the best out of your walking or running workout   the wider and long tread area is hard to find on many treadmills unless you pay a fortune   this one surely won t disappoint anyone looking for a great workout machine and it s an awesome deal too      
1333,5.0,                       after weeks of reading reviews  i decided to purchase the nordic track t     s treadmill and am so glad i did  i love how i didn t have to break the bank to have a reliable and sturdy treadmill that didn t feel like it was going to fall apart when you actually run  i also did the free trial of ifit and liked how the app syncs with the treadmill  when the incline goes up on the app  the treadmill will move your incline up as well   if you are looking for an affordable  sturdy  treadmill with a few bells and whistles  then this is definitely the one to get      
1334,5.0,                       this is the first treadmill that i ve owned     s   i ve used a treadmill at the gym for many years  but can t get there now because of covid so i m using this one in my garage  it was somewhat easy to put together  took me about an hour  and folds nicely to take up less room  i ve been using it for   months now and have had no problems  i m tall and weight      pounds and use it daily to walk on an incline  the deck seems sturdy and well made  the control panel is not fancy but it gets the job done  i m happy with my purchase and would recommend this treadmill      
1335,5.0,                       this is my second nordictrack and it is an upgrade  love the larger viewing monitor and i think it is a little smoother and quieter than the one i bought ten years ago  for me  working out at home on my treadmill is so much nicer than driving to a gym  the video trainers are great  my only complaint is that the other ifit video courses are glitchy and have lots of lag  so i end up listening to music while running   but the treadmill itself is great  highly recommend it      
1336,5.0,                       awesome treadmill for the price  a little difficult putting it together by myself  but well worth it  you don t have to purchase ifit  just hold down the ifit button for    seconds  and you ll be good to go  definitely recommend this product      
1337,5.0,                       good size for running  reccomend having an extra pair of hands to put it together  hold the ifit button for    seconds to bypass activation and get straight to running without a subscription      
1338,3.0,                       well i can t review this product because it s not yet assembled   half way through the assembly  the technician discovered that there were two right handrails in the box   and no left handrail   had to hold on the phone for    minutes with nordic track  but someone finally came on the line and they re hopefully shipping us the right part   pretty disappointing first impression of a      product   i definitely recommend paying the extra     to have the box delivered to the room where it will be assembled   the box is super big and heavy      
1339,5.0,                       we have had our treadmill for few months now   it is so handy having a treadmill in a climate controlled area   now heat  rain etc we can always get in a workout   really not to hard to assemble and so far very reliable      
1340,4.0,                       we really like this treadmill and its features however some of the negative posts on assembly being difficult were true for me   i didn t mind the registering the treadmill in advance part  but we are still struggling a bit to get the tension on the running belt just right as it slips to one side or the other   i am hoping that we can get that worked out in time   other than that the treadmill was a great deal      
1341,3.0,                       we put it together only to be held hostage by the ifit com activation screen  we were ready to send it back to amazon but i searched the amazon reviews and found someone who got through to nordic track  press and hold the sync button for    to    seconds  now it works  i gave it   stars for the aggravation and the busted box during shipping      
1342,4.0,                       pleased with quality and solid construction of treadmill  it is easy to use and make adjustments to speed  incline  etc assembly was somewhat time consuming  but videos were helpful  definitely requires   people to safely complete assembly  once completed it feels sturdy and safe      
1343,5.0,                       my husband assembled this himself  it s great for home workouts when you can t get to the gym      
1344,5.0,                       amazing  this was my first treadmill purchase   got it professionally installed   works great  roomy treadmill with comfortable handlebars   display window  love running and walkin on this  would highy recommend the purchase      
1345,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill in april  it was hard to find one when quarantine started but this one was affordable and had good reviews so i decided to give it a try  i use it between     days a week to walk on incline  it s perfect for a walker i m not much of a runner but i bet it would be good for light running  it was super easy to put together  folds easy for storage  and is quiet  i don t use ifit  you have to sign up for the    day trial to start it up but you can cancel it right away  still works afterwards without it  treadmill was much larger than i expected but perfect beginner treadmill      
1346,4.0,                       the treadmill overall is fantastic  there are just a few problems that keep it from being   stars  we are unable to use the treadmill without an internet connection  when you try to  manual start  a workout  you are greeted with a  loading workout  thing that spins forever and never loads the workout with ifit and an internet connection  when you get it to work  the treadmill and the ifit workouts are fantastic the little tablet attached to the treadmill is underwhelming  old  potentially unsecure version of android  and kind of slow  i wish they would just include a usb port and let us plug in our own tablet phone instead of selling us a preinstalled one      
1347,5.0,                       this high quality treadmill checks all the boxes   easy to put together with a quiet and smooth operation   don t fall for the big stop sign sticker that says you have to register with ifit to get it to operate   just power up the treadmill and hold the ifit button for about    seconds and you re good to go   no need to register or subscribe with ifit   works well for walking and running with zero wobble   highly recommend      
1348,5.0,                       my husband did the assembly and said it wasn t hard  but kind of a pain  not the best directions  the quality of the machine is great and i love using it  there was a tip in another review about the ifit being bypassed   it worked  push the ifit button for about    seconds  you ll hear a beep and the machine is ready to use      
1349,5.0,                       we really like this treadmill  once we turned it on with the key we pressed the ifit button for a few seconds and the treadmill started working without purchasing the ifit app  thanks to a previous customer who shared that information      
1350,4.0,                       so the treadmill when using it as a treadmill is great  if you re buying this for the smart integration though it s a hot mess  you are forced to sign up for a free trial that automatically renews at     month unless you cancel and when cancelling you can t type your cancellation reason so their metrics show either  not used enough    too pricey  or  technical issues   the treadmill is great  especially if you just hold the ifit button for    seconds to completely skip the  mandatory setup process  it s great      
1351,5.0,                       the treadmill came in a slightly damaged outer box  i was concerned that the treadmill itself would be damaged  however  the protective packaging inside worked well  not one thing was damaged the treadmill is easy to put together if the directions are followed closely i started the ifit because it has a year free subscription  i am not impressed with the classes  but that is my own personal opinion  i do like using the google maps street view to  walk  around areas that i might never get to see folding the machine up after use is a plus  i am unable to use the machine as a clothes hanger         
1352,1.0,                       after   week of using had to reline the belt         had to reline the belt   times after every use  only had  weeks  emailed the company   time still haven gotten back to me   went on youtube to see if i was doing something wrong  not     did i waist my         
1353,5.0,                       my wife and i have been through cardiac rehab and we wanted the nordic track exactly as rehab  my son in law and daughter bought the very same model and knew a work around for complete functionality without purchasing the fitness app it said was required  we re very happy and both of us have used the machine since it was assembled yesterday and there were no problems at all      
1354,3.0,                       i can never get it to read my heart rate  and it s lame they want you to sign up for there program  glad i could by pass it but if you by pass you can t hook your phone up to it and play music through the speakers so if i could go back i d probably pay less for less features because that s what i m getting for more of my money     
1355,4.0,                       haven t had it to long to do much of a review boyfriend said it was a pain in the butt to put together that next time he would pay to have it put together the override for the ifit was simple   holding ifit button till it beeps it takes longer than i thought holding it in but it does work  just keep holding it  one complaint would be the wheels on it are so small its very hard to move around on carpet its a very nice looking treadmill and easy to run  i would diffidently recommend it      
1356,5.0,                       it is exactly what i wanted and a tad more  very pleased  we are over    yrs and it took us a little longer to assemble  i would pay the money to assemble but it is covid time and did not want someone in my home      
1357,2.0,                       this treadmill has been the bain of my existence  i ordered assembly and it took   weeks to get someone to finally come put it together  that happened on oct  th  on october   th  i started having issues with the screen  it s just blank  so i can run on the tread  but can t follow any programs from the ifit app or even see speed  incline or miles i m doing  i need to call to get it straightened out  but i m exhausted from already investing so much time on the phone trying to get it set up in the first place  fail      
1358,3.0,                       i did a lot of research while shopping for treadmills  i was not looking for anything fancy  but just wanted one that could incline  was at least    inches wide  and was a reasonable price  this checks all of those boxes so i am pleased with the treadmill itself  however  the assembly was a real pain  many of the bolts are impossible to screw all the way in because of the angle or tools provided  and some holes don t exactly line up  there are some screws that come screwed in  that you have to take out and replace  which are extremely difficult to remove  the instructions specifically say not to use power tools  but it is impossible to remove or screw in some of the hardware with just a traditional wrench  we searched for assembly videos of this model online  and some people had different types of bolts screws  so it might vary on the one that you receive      
1359,4.0,                       i m happy with the treadmill but there is a catch  it s very sturdy and has all the features i want  definitely great quality  however  i purchased the amazon assembly options  the guy put it together in less than an hour however it looks a little crooked  the only thing this affects is being able to fold the treadmill  it doesn t fold properly  other than that the treadmill works just fine      
1360,4.0,                       i needed a new treadmill right away and i found this and the price was right   it looked similar to the nordic track that i already had   the delivery was very good and my husband put it together that night   it is not as heavy or sturdy as the nordic track i had before  but it is a good product at this price and does what i need it to do   i do miss not having the fan on this one  which i had on my old one   i would recommend this product      
1361,4.0,                       after researching for a while and a few weeks of using it every day  this nordictrack was a very good choice for about       just make sure to carefully read the instructions during assembling and follow each step before moving to the next one  easy manuals and pre program workouts  also a free month of ifit training  you can press the ifit button for about    seconds to bypass the machine to use the manual workouts  you can register to ifit if you want and the credit card is optional  theirs workouts are very engaging and challenging  always clip the key to your body for safety  no many complaints at this moment  more updates later      
1362,1.0,                       have had this product less than   months  am under warranty  and nothing but problems persist  the belt on the treadmill makes a salt shaking sound and sticky residue is left after every use i have had to jump through numerous flaming hoops to try to get a service repair person out to fix  again  under watranty   at each attempt  i am met with some offshore tech support person who refuses to speak over the phone  bombards me with unreasonable email requests  e g   requests for personal information  videos  pictures  explanations for items i have already outlined   it is very clear their customer service department purposely gives you the runaround and makes it close to impossible for you to get the requisite service to which you are entitled under warranty overall miserable experience     
1363,4.0,                       fantastic so far  came with a free year of ifit  doubt i ll pay for it next year as i mostly use manual mode  my   year old loves the trainer hikes though  wish it was easier to browse and save a workout found on my phone   that could use some improvement  quiet and sturdy  fairly easy to put together  wish the handles were longer and had the heart rate monitor on them as my arms seem to short to take my heart rate without hitting front of the belt  would have been full   star rating if it had a built in fan   missed that when purchasing      
1364,5.0,                       my first priority was that the track needs to be wide and inclination should be good  this machine satisfied both  i was able to run walk comfortably with full incline   ifit is optional you can get past that and workout on your own   you do need to register first time though   folding option is good for space saving  delivery was perfect and assembly instructions are good  very cost effective  when all the gyms are closed now  awesome product      
1365,5.0,                       i searched around for a good treadmill and this one was the best option  the touch screen is very easy to use and intuitive with a pretty good graphic the pre workouts are very nice and easy to search for  the manual workout option lets you set up your own workout and is giving you the option to save it after you finish until now  everything is working well  i have with my wife around     miles on it if you want a good treadmill this is a very good option  it fills a solid and high quality product      
1366,4.0,                       i got this about   months ago and so far it has been reliable   it hasn t failed to run so far   two minor issues i have had are       at times the display resets for some reason   it will erase the distance and calorie information       after pausing  it won t start when i hit the start button   i have to remove the safety key  place it back on to start   as long as i only experience these issues it is worth   stars      
1367,5.0,                       live in texas   since the pandemic  i was walking   miles in the neighborhood but it got too hot   my gym had reopened but i was very uncomfortable with the way people walked in with their masks on  but once they got upstairs  they were off   people didn t wipe down machines   i was very uncomfortable with the lackaidasical attitude of people there   my son in law scoped out machines and recommended this one   we ended up hiring someone from taskmaster to put it together but we love it   i do go to the gym occasionally to do the elliptical but every time i go  i am dismayed by the utter disregard to the regulations posted by the club and the fact that none of the staff goes upstairs to the aerobic and weight area to enforce their rules      
1368,5.0,                       i went back and forth looking for treadmills for almost a month and finally decided on the nordic track   it took me   days to assemble it because i was too busy to devote the time to do it in one day   it works wonderfully and is very sturdy   the only thing bothered me was that i had to sign up for ifit in order to use it but i canceled the subscription after a week and everything worked out      
1369,4.0,                       was delivered on time as i scheduled  guys dropped it where i asked  took time to unpack and put together   was perfect until i saw the display screen was cracked  it works beautifully and is super solid  i decided to keep it  amazon refunded a portion of the cost since it wasn t in perfect condition  i love it and so glad i bought it   if your a bigger person my guy is     and      and he is very comfortable on it with plenty of room  i would just suggest you look at your display before assembly  if it looks abit rainbowed  return it before fully assembling      
1370,3.0,                       i have an la fitness membership and used to working out on those commercial matrix fitness machines   i looked them up they cost like    k when i first stepped on this machine it slows with each step and speeds back up when i remove my foot  it s annoying  i went to dicks sporting goods and checked their horizon machines on display   looks like this is a common problem among all non commercial treadmills for people who are spoiled by nice machines at the gym  you are going to be disappointedi don t like writing reviews but i was sorely disappointed  i wanna return it but spend   hours assembling it and getting rid of packing so feeling guilty thinking of returning and i didn t find an alternative that is as good as gym machine      
1371,5.0,                       i am a treadmill newbie and decided on this unit due to its features compared to other units  it was fairly easy to put together but was really heavy and required to be opened and moved piece by piece with another person to where i wanted to set it up  there are several onboard exercises that do not require the subscription to ifit and plenty of variety to get started with before using the ift membership  i find it really convenient to use and have really enjoyed it  the screen is awesome and the video workouts are really well done too  super satisfied with my purchase and it has helped me get in shape      
1372,5.0,                       treadmill is good for basic model  assembly is easy just read all before you start the packing is overwhelming   lots of packing i had the inside delivery  received no calls prior to delivery   all of a sudden they were at my door  the box was all tore up  manufacturer puts strap bands which the delivery team pulled them thru the box make sure you buy silicone oil as the treadmill didn t come with any  you will need to coat belt well  if not you will have a good hot belt and burn smell adjusts easy and works well with ifit app      
1373,2.0,                       nearly impossible to fit through a standard doorway  i wish i had not purchased for that reason the surge suppressor used with this treadmill must be ul     listed as a transient surge suppressor  tvss   with a minimum surge dissipation of     joules  despite searching  no surge suppressor that meets the first standard can be identified on amazon  if someone finds one  please link      
1374,5.0,                       wow this nordictrack is worth every penny  not nosy at all  you can get a great work out  listen if you want to bypass the ifit subscription make sure that your equipment is fully installed  i got anxious and i had it fully installed by    percent  with out the safety key  i tried to bypass by pressing down on the ifit but it wouldn t work  so i called customer service and they guide me   the representative stated that the equipment needs to be fully installed   the safety key needs to be on or it will not work  so i tried that method and boom it worked  so if you want to bypass the ifit you can hold down for    seconds after your equipment is fully installed  i refuse to add another bill to my budget even if it s    dollars a month  you can manually use it without the subscription      
1375,4.0,                       much easier to put together than other reviews said  it did however take   hours  there are a few  other odd things i noted however  the ifit app is       a month and not user friendly  secondly the unit is giant so takes a lot of space  more than i had thought  that also relates to the height of the hand rails  they are made for someone who is more than     and best for someone       but overall a great price and unit      
1376,5.0,                       the product was surprisingly easy to assemble  i would say it is the same or better quality than what you would find in a gym  my wife and i have used it   or   times a week for over   months with no issues so far  very satisfied with the purchase      
1377,5.0,                       i just got my new treadmill after my previous one of       years went out on me  i did lots of research and wanted a budget friendly treadmill but needed a good quality one due to how much running i do daily  this treadmill is great  its nice and quiet and perfect for my running  i average    miles of running a day and so far i have no complaints at all       
1378,4.0,                       i was so scared to order this machine as i read so many reviews where it arrived broken   mine was the same thing   it was broken on the top of the motor i returned it and asked amazon to send me a new one   this one came perfect   my husband and i put it together   it took a few hours   it is a big machine and heavy   i have not used it yet   i am going to try it tonight   i will place pictures and i will give another feedback soon      
1379,5.0,                       i had a different nordic track treadmill for years and loved it   when it broke down i held off buying another but quarantine lead me to buy again   i didn t expect to value the ifit subscription that came included for first year but my entire family loves it   we each have our own profile and there are programs for all levels of fitness  the guided tours make me look forward to working out each day   my old treadmill had built in fans   i miss that feature but overall i am so glad we bought this nordic track      
1380,4.0,                       it is a sturdy machine and have a bigger motor compared to the other similar product and hope it will last longer  it does have a friction noise from the belt and the motor  but it is not too disturbing  it would be better if it remove the ifit program to unlock the treadmill initially  i do not use the ifit but use the treadmill daily for light exercise  overall  i like the product      
1381,4.0,                       product is a bit noisy   assembly was ok for one person with some experience   i used a strong rope at step   get the arms to align so i could put it together   overall the machine seems solid   it was missing a nut bolt that is needed for the folding feature and support has not been great  too long on hold  lots of web forms  other  support sites  asking for money       it is functional but the motor jumps a bit from time to time   again  this amount or treadmill for price is still a fairly good deal      
1382,5.0,                       we did a lot of research and decided to purchase this treadmill after a while  i m very happy with it overall  i really like that i can  fold  it up when not in use so that it isn t taking up too much space or getting walked over by our dogs  it offers a lot of pre programmed workouts but i d also easy to adjust for your specific needs  i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a treadmill      
1383,5.0,                       if you have ever bought a treadmill then you know how expensive they are  this treadmill works as good as the one s at the gym  it s smooth  quiet and most importantly it cost s about a third of what the gym machines do  for the price i thought it would work for a while then start having problems  but no it just keeps going and everything is just great  you can t ask for more  my wife does over an hour a day  some walking and some running  so the machine gets a full workout and again works perfectly      
1384,5.0,                       this is a wonderful product for the price  i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a treadmill  i have put a lot of miles into it and it is holding up very well  putting the treadmill together wasn t the most difficult thing in the world  but i would suggest having two people when assembling  overall i am very happy with my purchase      
1385,5.0,                       i loved the price  and all of the features it has   i also love the way it folds  and the bluetooth capability   great buy      
1386,4.0,                       i purchased assembly service but it looked a lot more difficult and heavy than i could have ever completed by myself  it runs smoothly  i thought it had blue tooth connection for my phone but i had to buy a cord that attached to my phone and then attached to the console speaker  the speakers are not great but adequate  it s a good basic machine  it has blue tooth for ifit programming  heart rate monitor is not accurate      
1387,5.0,                       all the bells and whistles i need  and none that i don t   my training runs on the road are normally in the          pace range  this treadmill has no trouble easily exceeding that speed if desired  the incline works great and the buttons are easy to use  as was previously mentioned in another review  you do not have to join ifit to use the machine  upon your first power up  simply press and hold down the ifit button for    seconds and you will be ready to go    my nordictrack      
1388,5.0,                       we ve had this treadmill for about    days and are very pleased so far   it s a very heavy piece of equipment but once you get it assembled it s easy to move and doesn t take up much floor space   my wife likes the audio features   now that it s getting colder i m loving having it near the home office so that i can get a quick run or walk in right before work or at lunch   just as powerful and sturdy as the ones i used to use at the y only a tiny bit smaller      
1389,1.0,                       the t     s is nice until it needs repairs  our treadmill stop operating june       since then  nordictrac had service repair workers replace all electrical and moving parts with no success  we are now being offered one of two options     refund only the service warranty        get a credit of        towards another treadmill starting at          they want us to pay double for their poor product and service  unacceptable  february             
1390,4.0,                       it weighs a ton  and even for   people  it was a nightmare to haul it into the house  i did the assembly myself and it took me most of a day  i would have paid for assembly on delivery  but it would have delayed delivery by   weeks  i would recommend paying for assembly  assembly was pretty straightforward  with a couple of confusing steps  the recommended   d assembly app doesn t offer any guidance beyond what s in the assembly booklet  the machine works well and seems sturdy  unless you sign on for the i fit subscription  the console doesn t store your time distance or any other data      
1391,5.0,                       put key in  hold  i fit button    sec i fit is gone   enjoy your new treadmill      
1392,1.0,                       waited a while to receive and the box and treadmill came all busted up and spent half the day on the phone w amazon trying to get a pick up sooner than    days as this huge box unpacked was sitting in my entrance   not to mention i have to wait another    days to get a replacement and who knows if it will come intact   very disappointed     
1393,4.0,                       we ordered this on a sunday and received tuesday morning  worth paying amazon     to install  overall very happy   it seems high quality build and the ifit app is cool as you can follow along with the trainers  there were some glitches setting up and nordick track charged us a full year upfront and it was supposed to be free for first year however call to customer service fixed it      
1394,4.0,                       early review the nordictrack arrived yesterday   after reading all the comments about shipping damage i was worried what shape it would be in on arrival  sure enough the box had significant damage from what appears to be a forklift tine  there was also some secondary tearing damage  that said  the device itself had no obvious damage so i accepted it from the shipper assembly was pretty straightforward with what may be the best set of instructions for assembly i have seen  the only hitch was getting the hydraulic lift into position  that took some work and expletives took it for a half hour test drive and no problems emerged  if no issues arise i may come back and alter the rating upward  nonetheless  the persistent reports of shipping damage should make one careful to inspect on delivery      
1395,5.0,                       we wanted a lightweight treadmill and this machine has been a great purchase  my wife and i each run on it daily and it seems able to handle the many miles with no problems so far  assembly wasn t easy  but it took less than a couple hours  we didn t expect to love ifit but after the one month trial  we were hooked and signed up for a year  the programs are really interactive and make you want to get in a workout      
1396,5.0,                       so happy i got a great price on a great treadmill  have been using it to walk and jog and it is very good  you have to have the app to do a lot more with it  but it can do the basics on it s own  the app is free for a limited time and up to you if you need it longer  definitely read the manual through or call to find out how you can work it without the app  i will have to do that myself soon      
1397,1.0,                       zero stars the first one   purchased was damaged in transit and never made it to my home the csr told me they were having problems with it making it through shipment the replacement arrived but even putting it together with a professional gym installer  it was terribly shakey and the bolts stripped just by our hands  it was even unbearable to try and disassemble for return pick up  also  please provide your delivery drivers with trucks that have on off ramps they had to unload and eventually reload this extremely heavy item onto a truck bed that was   feet high        
1398,5.0,                       we had an older model of nordictrack that gave us a good run for the money  twenty years   thought it was time to get a newer model  so when a good deal came up on amazon we jumped on it  the package was delivered on time  and up two flight of steps  the box was a bit battered and i was apprehensive  but everything inside was intact  assembly took two people and two evenings  but was straightforward   we watched a couple of youtube videos and those were very helpful we didn t turn on ifit  treadmill started up without it  the treadmill was whisper quiet  and it gave just the right amount of feedback when walking and running  no bounce  no creak  the controls were intuitive and simple  all family members are very happy with the experience and we use it every day  it has only been three months  we hope we won t need to replace it for another twenty years      
1399,5.0,                       i really enjoy this treadmill  i share it with my mother in law  who uses it for    min walks   times a week  and my wife  who goes on moderate runs for about       min twice a week  i use it whenever i can about     times a week for       min runs  don t have any troubles with it  very easy to calibrate belt since it can move slightly to the left or right  my guess is because we all have different running forms  i enjoyed the ifit trial it s very cool to see different landscapes when you run  don t think it s worth it to keep the membership though  hr sensor doesn t seem very accurate  but it s okay because we all have fitbits  all in all  good dependable treadmill      
1400,1.0,                       this is an update to my last review very disappointed in this thing  literally my husband and i used this thing   times max and it s already broken  the belt  which is already on the treadmill came unaligned  we noticed that it was making a very loud scraping noise  not much time afterwards  the belt completely folds  it s not even usable anymore  definitely contacting them directly for at least a replacement  not worth it      
1401,3.0,                       came in damaged  was a lot of work back and forth to get the free parts from nordictrack  now i have to disassemble and rebuild  works good but don t like the ifit having to be activated to make work during the set up process  you should not have to activate a monthly subscription to activate a treadmill  i know it s free for the month but still not right      
1402,4.0,                       this is perfect for our needs  it is still well made and with a good motor  all we really wanted it for was walking and changing the resistance when we were ready  we didn t need the video trainers  higher speeds  or any of the much more expensive features we would never use  the only negative is the shipping companies seem to have a penchant for mishandling treadmills  this one came in with the box destroyed  and several broken parts  it was a replacement for another one that arrived in even worse shape  we decided to let nordictrack replace the parts  and kept this one as everything else was ok  and now that s it is restored  it is just what we were looking for      
1403,5.0,                       i was really nervous about this purchase because of the negative reviews   however  i m loving it   i didn t want to spend lots of money on a treadmill and this seemed to be an affordable and sturdy choice   i didn t need a big screen and all the bells and whistles   it  has all i need  one touch incline to     speed to     and distance and heart rate monitoring  at the end of the day   it s about the workout   i m extremely happy with the choice   i had the assembly done through amazon and the guys were amazing and fast   i guess i was lucky and didn t have any dents or scratches and all works well   i say go for it  and get it assembled   it s worth it      
1404,5.0,                       for the price  this treadmill is worth every penny  i bought this for our home gym so that we don t have to run outside around the block during our hitt workouts  florida mosquitoes are terrible here  the package arrived on time  our carrier called the day before and gave us a  hr window of when he would show up  they showed up on the earlier side of it  the box wasn t damaged what so ever  the padding inside the box seems to ensure of that as well  we ordered just before christmas on the   rd and it arrived on the   th  so we were worried of the  rush deliveries  getting sloppy  definitely not the case  assembly took me and my wife about   min in total and we weren t in any rush  it comes with an alan wrench for most screws  but you ll need a phillips screwdriver and a wrench for a few of the connections  other than that  if you re competent and can follow instructions in order  the assembly shouldn t be hard at all once the treadmill was together it s been pretty awesome  it vibrates a little bit when you really get running on it  but not too bad  everything works great  the functions on it are great and very useful  it goes up to a    speed and also a    incline  it has an auxiliary connection to play music from if you choose to do that  obviously if you have an iphone  or higher you ll need that adapter piece for it  for the price of this treadmill you really can t beat it  we opted to get the warranty on it  but hopefully we won t need to use it  better safe than sorry though  i read some reviews of people that got it damaged and couldn t return it because they didn t purchase the warranty  thankfully that wasn t the case for us  we will get a lot of use out of this machine      
1405,5.0,                       we purchased this machine back on december   th  we ve debated about making this purchase for a couple of months this machine has taken a daily pounding first from me and then by my wife  it operates exactly as it should and it is ready to go every morning when we are i would recommend this machine to anyone looking for a machine that provides a good value      
1406,5.0,                       this was my birthday present that i requested  i love it but my husband loves it more  it s so easy to walk and run on and it has ifit red for a month which was nice to explore  we love our treadmill  it took a while to put together but it was fairly easy and it had multiple ways to get the directions which was great       
1407,5.0,                       extraordinary quality and performance for the price level  definitely worth the investment  don t expect this basic product to perform as the top of the line  does the job and exceeded expectations given the price  which includes shipping  contacted tech support and they were very responsive  t does not get any better than this  given the price category      
1408,4.0,                       first  you do not have to register for ifit to use the treadmill   thanks to another reviewer on this thread  you just hold down the blue ifit button for around       seconds and it will bypass the requirement to register and pay the monthly fee  now  you will not be able to access the workouts  but if you just want to do your own workout  you don t need to pay the fee  the treadmill was easy to assemble   you really need two people    it took my husband and i about an hour to set it up  it works great for what i need to do  on my first use  i ran    miles on it and it worked just fine   not as fancy as the gym treadmills  but a great price for a sturdy and reliable home treadmill for a decent price  i plan to use it for my very early morning runs or days when i don t want to go outside  i did purchase the three year warranty for around     just in case  but great purchase so far      
1409,1.0,                       so far  this is the worst experience ever  we have had this treadmill for over a month and have not even been able to use it because it was broken when it arrived  took forever to get a tech to come out  when he finally did we then continue to assemble it  and of course something else broke  when we called nordic track they wanted to charge us for the part that broke  ugh  if it ever gets fixed and assembled then i will hopefully be able to give a better review     
1410,4.0,                       this treadmill is great so far  it has tons of options and the touch screen and ifit make it seem really high end  my only couple of complaints are really nothing that should deter you from ordering this  however  for review purposes i ll list my minor dislikes anyway  although this treadmill folds  it doesn t fold completely upright  it still sticks out quite a bit  making it a little bulkier than most foldable treadmills  my husband put this together in about   hours while i was at work  he said it wasn t too hard  although  he did have a time getting the belt to line up perfectly  so that it did not rub the sides  my last annoyance is the plate that is directly in front of your feet when standing on the treadmill  it seems like it should be further back and it s slightly in the way  i think nordictrack could easily re position this in future models  these things are truly just personal dislikes  they would in no way cause me to re think my purchase  i m very happy with it overall      
1411,5.0,                       i am very happy with the nordictrack treadmill   it is large enough to walk and run comfortably  even with wide steps   incline feature feels real and incline range is big enough   it was easy to assemble  but it takes at least two people to bring it up a flight of stairs as the main component was heavy even before assembly  after assembly  it is quite easy to put in upright position and move around with the wheels   the trainer programs are awesome  it really gives a sense of completion in your workout  and you get to do all this tours around the world   sometimes my    g network has issues  and the treadmill can t connect to the  g network  i know that this is a problem of my network  but it would be nice to have the additional option      
1412,1.0,                       the machine didn t even last a year  i bought it and now it doesn t run  it turns on and then resets when i hit start  i called and was on hold for over   min  finally got helped and they are sending a replacement part     
1413,1.0,                    compre esta caminadora el ctrica fue mi regalo de navidad y nunca funcion     luego de tratar de comunicarme por dos dias con la compa  a por fin me asistieron y dijeron q era un problema el ctrico de la consola y ellos enviaron otra nueva que al ser instalada tampoco funcion    c mo es posible que compro algo nuevo   supuestamente de excelente calidad y viene da ada y por si fuera poco el d a   de enero realice la devoluci n de un equipo q pesa      libras y hoy a n aparece como devoluci n en proceso o sea que estoy sin caminadora y a n no recibo mis      que he pagado   en cuanto uno ordena algo inmediatamente se lo descuentan pero hasta cuando tenemos que esperar por recibir el reembolso de nuestro dinero         no revomiendo este producto        
1414,3.0,                       besides the fact that this thing is heavy as hell  the preassembled part came missing brackets     we discovered this when we increased then decreased the incline  when we decreased it  the fact that there were missing bolts on the mainframe caused the frame to bend  because of covid  we couldnt have anyone come and fix it i bought a bolt at home depot  but it was too late  the damage was done  we cant ever use the incline thanks for skipping the bolt on the assembly        
1415,5.0,                       super sturdy    i love it  it does not shake or wobble when you are walking on it  to assemble it you need two people but the instructions are easy to follow  you don t need an ifit membership  once you plug it in  press the ifit icon for    seconds and the treadmill board will be ready  i love it     i m a    lb girl trying to lose weight and needed a sturdy treadmill but on a budget and i found it   i would definitely recommend this brand and delivery method through amazon      
1416,5.0,                       researched and looked for a treadmill and finally just did it   very happy with the nordic trak t series treadmill   my husband and i put it together without any problems and so far it is working great   the incline and speed are perfect for me   my daughter who works out a lot harder than i do used it while in town and got a pretty intense workout too   pleased with my purchase      
1417,4.0,                       the nordic track is a great product  quiet belt and sturdy construction   did not come in time promised  came a week later   putting it together was comical and annoying   the instruction sheet left a lot to be desired  example take out this screw and put this new screw same size in its place  do not use a drill with screw driver bit  but yet the screw holes were extremely tight even for my husband      
1418,5.0,                       i have been using this for several months now  it is a great machine for the price  not to big  not to small  easy to sync with ipad for the interactive workouts  i have to connect it via aux cord though for the sound  online workouts give you the option to stay in sync with the speed and incline of the program  or choose your own  recommend the online workouts    really motivates you to continue      
1419,5.0,                         stars because i m happy with the purchase  i was not impressed with pilot  the shipping company amazon used for delivery  they rescheduled my delivery twice setting up the treadmill was frustrating and you definitely need a second pair of hands for part of it  also the release system for bring it down is odd  but happy with the performance and love how strong the fan is      
1420,5.0,                       i had a little trouble assemling the product  i think a more detailed instructions for pieces or the pieces being numbered or labelled would have helped immensely  but the product itself was great  i really liked it  it cushioned a lot where it bounces back so it is very smooth and the machine is pretty quiet  i have it in my home office next to living room and they cannot here the machine in the other room      
1421,5.0,                       easy to assemble  but definitely need   people to do it  i always roll my eyes when people say that  but it s true for this  you also need to have wrench s since it doesn t come with anyway  just as a heads up    also  i m so happy that someone mentioned out to bypass the stupid ifit program  the reason i bought a treadmill was so i wouldn t have to pay for memberships  anyway  just hold down the ifit icon for about    seconds and you ll be able to use the treadmill without signing up for the account  so even though it says you can t start the treadmill without activating it in    different places  you really can  i love this treadmill  you should buy it        
1422,5.0,                       i like simple and easy to use treadmills and this one fits that to a t  the only thing it s missing  for me  is a fan  my last treadmill had a built in fan and that was very handy  but the room i have it set up in has a ceiling fan  so that keeps me cool enough  the incline is quick and easy and the speed adjust really fast  which i like  the deck has a lot of cushion to it  i don t have any pain or aches in my knees or joints and i use it every single day  i m a heart patient  so i mainly use it for cardiovascular exercise     minutes     hour power walking or light jogging   i don t miss a day of use  so far  so good with this treadmill  i absolutely love the customer service  they sent out a maintenance technician  just to make sure it was set up and the belt was aligned properly  because i wasn t sure about it once we assembled it  i was super appreciative of that   it s a very well built and sturdy treadmill  i really like it      
1423,3.0,                       cost benefit ratio was great and so we decided to buy this one  assembly was a little bit of a pain but if you are generally handy  you can do pretty well  it started out great but then less than a month in  it stopped working  the computer would say it is working but the belt wouldn t turn after a while with customer support they said the main panel went back  after less than a month   and shipped me a new one  i am currently waiting on the replacement part and we will see  really wanted to give it more stars but can t since it is currently not working      
1424,5.0,                       so happy we purchased this treadmill  we get our       steps everyday   i thought maybe we would get it and not use it  but it s so convenient to walk on it and not have to leave the house      
1425,3.0,                       i received the machine and spent a fair amount of time setting it up  treadmill  only to find it doesn t  unlock  without activating an ifit subscription  this is like the old pc windows apps bundle  i called amazon and there is a hack   press and hold the blue ifit button   on the console   for     seconds and it will  unlock  and operate with full functionality   if you want the ifit features  you can sign up but its not good business practice to force your customers into a subscription after they spent          on the machine      
1426,5.0,                       very comfortable treadmill to walk or run on      
1427,5.0,                       relatively easy to put together  use it all the time and have no issues      
1428,5.0,                       ordered this unit on christmas sale  great price  including professional assembly  the delivery crew of   were on time  fast and capable  and put the unit in the basement of my home  no problems with the unit or navigating the stairwell  the assembly tech came on another day  he was also timely  professional  and did assembly in about an hour   well within the estimate to do the job  assembly was perfect  the unit is used by two people primarily walking  it operates well  and quickly adjusts elevation and speed  the controls are easy to read  haven t used the sound system yet  the shelf holds a book or kindle  the unit is reasonably quiet  no problems to report  this unit is similar to treadmills i used at fitness centers  but the speed is limited to    mph  and elevation to          on gym treadmills   this is plenty challenging to raise my heart rate and develop my leg muscles   i would recommend this product to a home user      
1429,5.0,                       i went cheap and had to return the thing because it felt unsafe every step i took i felt like it was gonna stop and i was gonna break my ankle  i then bought this machine and it was double the cost of a cheap one but way better quality  i have had this for a few months and put many miles on it  you dont need the membership to use it  its a great treadmill      
1430,5.0,                       great size  not too loud  so i purchased based off of reviews  was concerned with the ifit and it saying you need to activate to have treadmill work  i did what another reviewer suggested  hold the ifit button down for    seconds until the screen changes and you can bypass the ifit activation and need for monthly fee if you choose very satisfied with my purchase i purchased the assembly for     and he had it done within   hour  my treadmill was delivered friday and assembled by sunday      
1431,5.0,                       i absolutely love this treadmill  i was worried the screen wouldn t be large enough but     is perfect  the ifit trainers make working out funand it fits well in my small spare room i would recommend having someone help you put it together  i was able to do most of it myself but needed my husband to help hold it a couple times  i am not good at putting things together at all  but watched a youtube video and was able to complete it in a couple hours      
1432,5.0,                       i read other reviews and was worried about the ifit i had to sign up for     not true followed directions and hold the power down you can bypass that altogether  machine is amazing love it    it did take my husband   hours to put together but so worth it      
1433,5.0,                       had a huge issue with set up which i scheduled and then was canceled without warning after the first delivery and set up was postponed bc there was an issue with the wiring being damaged  amazon eventually did right by me which i appreciated  that s my only issue  otherwise it is great and a good price     
1434,5.0,                       i ended up paying to have some from amazon come and install this  the treadmill showed up broken but no one did anything about it  thankfully  it was a plastic piece on the side that didn t affect the performance of the treadmill  you do not need to sign up for any membership  i read from previous reviews  hold in the ifit button for    seconds and it ll work for you  i use this treadmill several times a week with no issues      
1435,5.0,                       the package is very bulky  as expected  and it was a bit damaged when it was delivered  but the product itself was not damaged  the assembly takes at least   people for sure and the instructions are not that great either  apart from that  i am giving it a   rating for the product itself  it is a great value for the money  i used it twice and when i run on it  i do not feel the keen pain that i experience when i use the treadmills at the gym  i love this treadmill      
1436,5.0,                       as some others have pointed out  it should be published that you do not need to buy the subscription services to make the treadmill work      
1437,5.0,                       i only use the treadmill for walking each day   it s easy to use   it arrived quickly   i m a diy person but for something as important as this  i thought it was better to have a technician to put it together   max from icon fitness was my technician   he called to let me know that he could come earlier than the appt time which is a plus in my book   he was very courteous and professional and took the time to explain the treadmill operation i am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase and the service      
1438,5.0,                       very pleased with this purchase  nice sturdy unit  not overly noisy other than what you d expect from a treadmill  the auto incline is a nice feature and all of the various features  workout routines  heart rate  etc   add to the value  highly recommend for someone looking to add a treadmill to their home gym      
1439,4.0,                       it was at an amazing price that i could not pass up  it was a bit tough to put it together  but after a while i was able to put it together  you ll need two people to put it together however  it works great      
1440,1.0,                       treadmill arrived defective  the motor is broken   after   weeks  we still have had no satisfaction   following much effort on our end  calls  e mails  etc    we have a new motor  but installers arranged through nordictrack never showed or called   no idea really if the treadmill is any good  because we can t get it to work   too big after assembly to return  so we are stuck   worst purchase ever      
1441,4.0,                       this treadmill was everything is was advertised to be    it works great for me  because i do shorter runs and i do not need all the bells and whistles  i use it with the peloton app on my ipad and it makes for a great work out    the ifit bypassing trick that everyone tacks about does work perfectly    i had no issues  just make sure you have the key in place    i didn t have to pay for any subscriptions to activate it despite all the warnings    the only reason i am giving it   stars is because it is a pain to put together    my husband is pretty handy and the two of us put it together the day it arrived    it took     hrs and it is really hard to fit the screws in the holes    looking back i think it would have been worth it to pay to have it assembled         
1442,5.0,                       i was hesitant to purchase equipment online without trying it out first  but have to say i am so happy with this treadmill  it is very easy to fold and the front has wheels so can moved easily  i love the ifit feature because it makes me feel like i am back at the gym doing a class  there s many options to choose from  studio style  outdoor runs  and even stretching classes  i feel for the price it s a great machine  have had it for about   months and been running     days a week and so far so good      
1443,5.0,                       we bought this product about two months ago to stay active during the covid    pandemic  i have to say the treadmill has exceeded my expectations so far  it is easy to operate and the quality seems to be very good  i am also enjoying the free ifit trial that came along with the machine  i have not had to contact customer support yet and hopefully won t have to any time soon  but i am sure nordic track will stand behind their product  love the longer base on this model which provides a pleasurable walk run experience      
1444,5.0,                       i received my nordictrack t series treadmill near   months ago with pro installation and still i am happy with  the only thing that they should have told me is about surge protector you may need when you install it in your bedroom  i checked different surge protectors but finally  belkin    outlet power strip surge protector  worked for me  now everything is ok and it is working properly      
1445,5.0,                       i bought my treadmill about two months ago and overall i have had a great experience   i run     miles a day and this treadmill has been perfect for that  assembly took about two hours but the instructions were clear and easy to follow  my treadmill has performed to expectations and have not had any issues with it  overall  this is a great treadmill if you do not want to sped thousands on a treadmill  thanks      
1446,5.0,                       very solid and easy to use  we ve been running on it for about   months so far and no complaints  as others have mentioned  you can bypass the ifit option easily  the hydraulic fold up is a nice option  though its footprint remains pretty big    as is only reasonable i used amazon s option to hire someone to set it up  so i can t opine on how easy or hard it was  but that process    hiring someone through amazon to set it up was straightforward and easy      
1447,5.0,                       this treadmill is really nice  easy to fold and easy to install  also  its user friendly and i am enjoying this since i bought   months ago      
1448,5.0,                       treadmill runs more evenly and smoothly than any i ve used before in a home setting  no speed jitter or wobble   of frame or belt   even when running at   mph  and i m above     pounds  so that s some stress on the machine    hydraulic folding mechanism is robust and easy to use  assembly was a bear  but truthfully  no worse than comparable products      
1449,3.0,                       the first one we received  which was new  came broken  the replacement has similar issues  still made weird noise   assembly was not fitting    the technician recommended that i either get a full refund or a huge discount  neither was offered  by that i mean  we got a small discount if we kept it  it had already been a couple months since we had purchased it and i was losing  money with our trainer  the replacement machine itself runs ok  i wish the fan was a bit stronger  and that the speakers were a bit louder  takes some time for it to  start   on screen   serves its purpose      
1450,1.0,                       do not buy this product if you just want a treadmill without a fancy  and expensive  fitness program   i was just put on  hold  for    minutes trying to cancel an ifit subscription which i didn t want in the first place   had i not emailed them while i was on  hold  i d probably still be there   purchasers of a treadmill should not have to go through this      
1451,5.0,                       i have had this treadmill for   months now   it s been great to have a safe place to get my walking in   i did not put it together  my husband did   it took him about  ish hours to complete   it s very well made and very easy to use   the ifit program that came with it for a free month was great   you do not have to continue the ifit membership to use the treadmill  but it s a great program  the treadmill syncs to the workout   if you are running walking uphill the treadmill automatically adjusts to the terrain of the workout you choose   i would recommend this nordic track because it s a fairly good value and in      it s easier to stay inside and workout than to wear a mask outside      
1452,1.0,                       so excited to receive my nordictrack only to discover that as soon as i started to unpack it  it was already cracked and dented  who knows who s fault it was  shippers or originators  but i m not happy  sorry nordictrack      
1453,5.0,                       for the price it was an excellent deal  i literally use it everyday and absolutely love it  i ordered the ifit app for a year which was also a great purchase since i also  use it daily   this was the cheapest norditrack treadmill i could find so it doesn t have all the bells and whistles as the other one s but it gets the job done  i do wish i would have splurged a bit more because i have to use my phone to access the ifit app since it doesn t come on the actual screen of the treadmill   still it was a great deal and i m so happy i bought it      
1454,1.0,                       my machine was sent to me with a part meant for another model  making it useless  i have now waited for a month and a half for the defective part to be replaced and the return window has closed  so now i have a machine that won t work  no replacement part  and no recourse  amazon tells me my problem is with the manufacturer  manufacturer tells me my problem is with amazon  i have now lost    hours of my life trying to resolve this      
1455,4.0,                       per title i really love my nordictrack   easy to use  not too big but not too small  this is rarer than you might believe   and surprisingly not too loud it is a bit of a hassle to assemble  but i would not doc points on a review  it is what it is and i can t imagine how to make it easier    my issue is that you have to create a nordic account   sign up for  free  workout plan to get started   yes  you can opt out of the  free  trial but note that if you will be paying   opting out is not as easy as it should be  and honestly speaking it should not be a precondition to start using your track once you are past this hurdle though  you will love this nordic        
1456,3.0,                       i would not recommend buying this product if you plan on using it to run on a regular basis i bought this machine at the beginning of        within a month or about    uses  the control panel shorted out   after several days of navigating through customer service and tech support  they sent a reset key and then eventually a replacement console panel  which i spent a couple hours installing  and the unit worked fine i stopped using the treadmill when the weather got nice   i resumed using the treadmill when      started   within a month or about    uses  the console shorted out again   this time  the treadmill and the replacement console were no longer under warranty   customer support offered to send a repairman        to put in a new console          in summary  the repair would cost almost as much as buying a new unit and would most likely only last another month or two   did i want to buy a different norditrack treadmill   no thank you i don t know why my treadmill console shorted out twice each time within one month of use   i was running     miles daily  enough to break a sweat   i suspect liquid may have entered the console through the speaker units   whatever the reason  the treadmill does not seem to handle regular use and would caution buyers against purchasing this unit if they plan to use it regularly      
1457,5.0,                       if i could buy it over again  i would have purchased from a local store  so they would have put it together for me   i purchased the additional delivery charge to have it delivered to the room that is was to be used in   my thought is they work put it together for us   definitely  like the machine  but did not like the job of putting it together   sometimes saving money  costs a lot of your extra time      
1458,5.0,                       i m so in love with this machine  i have   small children so in the midst of this pandemic i am home all the time during this pandemic  i used to work during the day as a teacher so i got   miles day just in the classroom  i can now sneak in a workout during their naps  it s great  the ifit app is ok  it s nice that they have hikes and things to feel like i went outside  the app is awful for picking workouts though  you can t filter and they are by location  not difficulty or time or even activity which just kills me  i also have the peloton app and i have to use that one if i don t have about    min to sit there and search the random categories  the machine itself though is great  it folds up easily and securely  it s not too loud  and it s user friendly  nice size cup holders  etc      
1459,4.0,                       the assembly parts are not well made such as the screw holes are not precisely drilled for easy assemble  as a result the dashboard is shaking once you start to walk or run on the treadmill  it took me several install and uninstall to get it right  as far as for exercise  the machine works well especially it can be integrated with ifit where i can use their exercises and see how others are doing  it gives me a sense motivation   in terms of amazon s delivery  it s horrible  it took over three weeks to get the package delivered and i am a prime scriber  supposedly two days or   days delivery  their delivery system is broken where amazon  site texted me i missed the delivery  but in reality  the vendor said they didn t even tried yet   it turned out amazon s tracking system sent the wrong text      
1460,5.0,                       great value for the machine   it has worked fantastically it has the features we require   it has a month belt      
1461,5.0,                       i like the wide belt on this model   it s easy to operate and gives a smooth walk   the screen is a little small for watching workout videos from ifit   i really didn t like that i had to sign up for ifit in order to turn it on originally   i don t use credit cards and had to borrow one or i wouldn t have been able to operate it   i ve read that there was a way around this but it didn t work for me  now i have to remember to cancel the subscription or the card will be charged  love the treadmill but hate being strong armed into a feature i haven t used and don t plan on using in the future      
1462,3.0,                       the arms that mount to the base of my treadmill are crooked  they should be at a    degree angle to the base  but they are at an    degree angle or so  they mount to the base with   bolts each  so this was not a setup error  this was a manufacturer error  when i fold the treadmill up  the right side rubs against the right arm  while the left side has a big space between the track and the arm  a good product overall  but i am disappointed the product is not as it should be      
1463,3.0,                       pros  i am picky when it comes to treadmills  i ve used many at various gyms and have owned two others   and i love this one  it s very stable and comfortable to run on  the screen is very clear  the touch screen works great  and the sound is good also  ifit is very fun  there are so many different workouts you can do other than just running  hiit  yoga  etc  which makes it a versatile machine   so  i like that there is a lot of different things you can do with this treadmill  which makes it s fun to play with  i look forward to my workouts cons  my treadmill came with a broken fan  the fan is very important to me so this has been a major inconvenience  fortunately  nordictrack sent me a new fan  free of charge   it took    days to get here and i had to install it myself  unfortunately  installing the fan myself wasn t an option  the directions were garbage and not for my model specifically  so i have to get a technician to come out and fix it for me  it will be another     business days until i hear from one to make an appointment  by the time this gets fixed  i will have lost   month of my ifit membersip i was also disappointed that getting the ifit account setup has been difficult  the treadmill came with an activation code that is basically useless   you have to call ifit and they will get you setup  not a huge inconvenience  but rather an annoyance  i will need to make another phone call to get my husbands account setup ifit is great  but i do hope to see it improve to make browsing and scheduling workouts much more convenient all in all  i would recommend this treadmill because it s great  it may take time to get it setup  hopefully your luck is better than mine      
1464,2.0,                       just to be clear  you are not really buying a treadmill so much as you are buying a kit which includes all of the parts required to build a treadmill yourself   it takes about five hours  and is not for people who are casual do it yourselfers   having an extra person on hand helps during certain parts as you will be required to lift and hold the treadmill while screwing in items under it   overall use is good and was as expected  but i really think they could have spend a few bucks to have some of this assembly done at the factory      
1465,3.0,                       what do i mean by  runner    you ll know who you are   anything above   mph makes the treadmill rock back and forth  even after multiple adjustments  tightenings  and reallignments   my water bottle basically rattles back and forth in the built in cup holder for my entire run   it s not like the treadmill isn t sturdy  but it s not the same experience as a commercial grade treadmill you would find at a gym also   this treadmill cannot display speed in minutes per mile  only mph   this should be a basic function of any treadmill  so it s really disappointing   i know i can convert using math  it s just not what i want to do while i m trying to get through a workout      
1466,4.0,                       i really love this treadmill  i only had it one week and i m a fan  is very sturdy it has good workouts  it s very easy to fold and unfold it comes down by itself very strong treadmill  so far i haven t had any problems the only thing i can say is that the front console is missing some features that are shown on the picture  that s the reason why i m only giving it   stars  but other than that it s a great treadmill  also the ifit feature can be override by simply pressing the ifit button for    seconds and it will setup to normal  i definitely recommend      
1467,5.0,                       when we decided to create a small exercise room at our home  i was very  ify   wondering how sturdy a personal treadmill would be  if it wasn t commercial grade   the kind i would use at a professional gym    i am so pleased with this treadmill  ironically  we bought my mom a treadmill about   year before  and we purchased a more expensive one for her  when i visited her last  i realized that without a doubt i prefer the one we bought   which cost about           less   it s sturdy  doesn t shake vibrate when i am on it and feels great      
1468,5.0,                       i see a lot of negative reviews  but i bought my treadmill in april      and have had   issues with it  i love the ifit workouts  i was pretty out of shape and started doing the hikes to get my heart going  i got an apple watch in december and have been getting a workout in everyday  my husband even uses it on manual mode to listen to podcasts  something for everyone      
1469,5.0,                       i love this machine  it works great and has everything we need   the whole family uses this and we are loving it  setting it up was not easy and you need to be prepared for how heavy it is but my husband was able to get it all set up with only a bit of help      
1470,4.0,                       we ordered this treadmill to use when it gets too hot outside to run   we were surprised at how easy it was to install  but it did require   people   i have it in the garage and i am able to move it around by myself when needed   the only thing i wish it had was a fan   but i have set up a pedestal fan and it is working out great   i would recommend this treadmill   we are very satisfied      
1471,3.0,                       i ve had this tredmil for about a month and run on it   days a week  now the tredmil has developed a really annoying squeak if there is no elevation  the track also appears to be shifting to the left  it does the job but still not a superior tredmil you get what you pay for  don t expect to be blown away by any tredmil under            
1472,5.0,                       i am very happy with this treadmill  i have been using it for a couple weeks and i m impressed with the quality  it took my husband over an hour to put it together but the finished product is nice  you do not have to pay for the fit program in order to get the treadmill to work  hold the fit button down       seconds and it will reset to normal mode      
1473,5.0,                       the product arrived on time  neatly wrapped  with instructions for assembly   the assembly took about two hours   the product worked as advertised  the only mildly negative comment would be that the arms don t come far enough back for the jogger  runner to grasp  at least in my opinion   but the positives  especially fitting in a smaller space  are really positive      
1474,4.0,                       this is the first treadmill i ve ever owned and i m glad i went with this brand  it s a solid  well built platform  the information screen and input buttons are conveniently located and easy to read  the added value option of the ifit program is an interesting plus  i have yet to use the ifit program myself as i m recovering from open heart surgery but the demos look interesting as mentioned  i m recovering from o h surgery where a mitral valve was repaired  a bypass graft was installed as well as having a hole between the right and left ventricles repaired  the local cardiac rehab was going to charge me a co pay of    bux a session with three sessions a week that equals     a week x four weeks a month for three months for a total of      bux  all that for three    minute sessions on a treadmill per week  soooo    i decided to buy my own treadmill and save      bux  now  i don t have to get myself ready for the day and  drive over to rehab in inclement weather  i just grab my t shirt  shorts and  running shoes and have at it  as mentioned before  the machine is quiet  built sturdy to last and a stable platform able to accommodate the beginning walker as well as a marathon runner wannabe my only complaint thus far  is that the pulse meter readout is a bit flaky it flashes bpm in a somewhat erratic fashion  being a heart patient  this was a feature i truly wanted needed for my rehabilitation  perhaps someone at support can walk me through a fix  we ll see  it was this issue that kept me from giving five stars instead of four regards john f      
1475,5.0,                       i like this machine i am     so i don t want to run but like following the walking trainers between     and     miles an hr  or less with higher levels obviously at my age i just want a decent workout but will never run as much as i love the machine i sometimes have a hard time to fine different walking places on the places offered  i wish i knew where the best walking areas are with the trainers for people my age  maybe someone can help me i like john peels costa rica beach walk very much and did the mountain climb in the alps and a lady in hawaii on the beach  like i said i am having a hard time finding many places to fit my level there also is a great scotland mountain with an older gentleman   all in all i love the machine as they have changed so much since my last machine of    years ago pro form  which is still working but antiquated glad i decided to get a new one it stimulates me more with the video  linda n      
1476,5.0,                       i did lots of research to find the top treadmills  this was by far the most affordable  very easy to set up  extremely heavy though   works very well  smooth  quiet  my only concern was that you were forced to register for a     month subscription with ifit  turns out  it is super cool   with walking or running routines with a coach  music  great sites  and it runs your treadmill another positive   the treadmill is very quiet  using it does not disturb others in the house who want to sleep  it feels very sturdy and after using it for five months or so i m very pleased with its features and performance      
1477,4.0,                       overall the product is pretty nice  it s not that easy to assemble but understandable  however i am really frustrated about the ifit bundle  make sure you cancel ifit right away after you activate the product      
1478,5.0,                       i thought i had to spend thousands to have a good quality treadmill  was looking at the peloton but was resisting to spend so much  in the end i decided to give it a try  must confess i was skeptical about it  after almost two months i can say i couldn t be happier with the choice  everyone at home uses it  so  daily workouts with no excuse      
1479,2.0,                       it does fold nicely and is easily cleaned underneath  runs well despite lifetime wanting you to subscribe i use it on manual with no problem  software updates are slow this would be a great product but unfortunately after less then a year the tread has torn as shown in the photo  i now have to go through warranty service and get scheduled for repair  stay tuned      
1480,3.0,                       so once receiving this item i was excited to put together  once opening i notice a crack on the side of the computer board  the packaging on this is not so great  everything else is intact but what i don t understand is the fact that they package all the heavy stuff on top of the light material  which in this case caused the board to crack  contacted the company and after   months they finally got back to me  they told me they will send me a replacement part which i m still waiting till this day  they take for ever to get in contact  the machine runs great  the assembly took some time  but its a good machine   hopefully if you get it it will be better packaged  its the reason i m giving it   stars      
1481,4.0,                       this is a great and fairly quiet treadmill   the   inch screen and wifi connectivity are solid   i love being able to create my own workouts with google maps and   man in the street   i ve created my outdoor routes and some from high school and college   shortcomings   heart rate monitor is not accurate  i wear my apple watch so not an issue  no bluetooth connectivity  no negative incline for downhill simulation  and must join ifit to really get the most benefit from the unit    year included   a      value    these shortcomings do not take away from the capabilities of the treadmill which are great for the price      
1482,1.0,                       this treadmill looks good but came broken for me  i have been trying to reach to nordic team about this product and haven t heard from anyone yet      
1483,1.0,                       i have been attempting to assemble this product for literally over   hours   none of the screws line up  the directions and pictures are so crammed  you have no idea what you are looking at step     remove and discard screws step     use screws from step         which we were told to discard    they then say do not use power tools    well  the screws will not go in by hand  they barely went in with the power screwdriver honestly  if i could return it or just throw it away  i would      
1484,5.0,                       install was easy and step by step   super quiet while working out   bypass signing up for program  it s not necessary      
1485,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the product came in very poor condition with a large crack in the foot plate base board  and the handles with the attached display are wobbly  with some small cracks  and scuffs  to even start the treadmill you have to purchase the ifit app and start an account online  it was a big pain  i highly recommend buying new treadmill with protected packaging      
1486,1.0,                       this is cheesy  i shouldn t be coerced into an subscription just to use your product  also it s not natively bluetooth capable with android  seriously  i think even my toothbrush is      
1487,5.0,                       i m very happy with our nordic track     the ifit service is amazing and has opened up a whole new world for us during the pandemic  it s in our living room but i don t care  we are using it  lol   very happy with the performance of this machine   i don t think the bpm function works properly though  i use my fitbit for that though      
1488,5.0,                       so amazing  arrived early  easy to put together  took me about   hours alone   all needed tools and hardware are provided and does not make loud stomping noises when you run  even at lower paces  i broke the outside of my foot back in high school and it never healed properly  when running outside i always feel the painful compression of running on the sidewalk in my neighborhood   when i run on my nordic track  the shock absorption mechanism allows me to run pain free for as long i want  the price is also very worth the value and ease of mind as i m in the midst of also trying to slim down a bit for my wedding coming up  especially for buying on short notice  the price is very reasonable for such a well made machine  you can definitely tell they created this treadmill with their customer s in mind  highly recommend        
1489,5.0,                       this treadmill is awesome  great quality and price  the setup was easy and simple  the treadmill is sturdy and the belt is wide enough to run on  i would recommend it to anyone      
1490,3.0,                       the top part of machine in which you hold on to is not sturdy  i have to hold on for dear life at faster speeds  more than  mph  and inclines of   or higher  i actually love the free   yr ifit program  makes working out entertaining  once the free subscription expires  i may pay the     month to continue it  you can t get a personal trainer for a month this cheap  plus you have a variety of workouts all over the world  it is a welcome venue in this coronavirus time  that being said   the computer for ifit app has some glitches from time to time  even though it s not perfect  this treadmill has saved me from going stir crazy at this unprecedented time so it is worth it to me     
1491,5.0,                       my wife loves it   it is very heavy to move  thankfully once the box was opened i was able to assemble it in our basement   you do not have to activate the online service as all the labeling suggest   just hold down then irun or whatever it is for    seconds      
1492,4.0,                       this is much sturdier than the first cold up treadmill i purchased and was very clear with its instruction  i m not thrilled about it s connect to ifit and it took me a full week to close the trial membership with them  the other issue i have with this is that it kicks my breaker is anything else in the room is even plugged i   i ve learned to just unplug them rather than go through hassle of searching for yet another treadmill  i like the features on this  the shelf is deep enough for my ipad to rest and the side pockets hold either water or phone  all in all  i would buy it again     
1493,4.0,                       well we don t use the ifit  but prefer the manual track  however the walk through the pyramids on ifit was cool   as for the treadmill itself  i set it up with only a little help from the spouse  so easy set up folding is a little heavy  but if you leave it down it takes up a good size footprint  speakers are good to listen to music on and a ok shelf for your tablet  phone fits better if your trying to see your screen and progess     
1494,5.0,                       i researched and researched and researched  a treadmill and to match my expectations and my price bucket was not an easy job  i ended up buying this and and am really happy so far  it s been   months me and my husband workout on this treadmill  we are in our early   s and don t even use the max speed really    and   levels are good enough for us  my husband assembled this by himself  we had a mismatched screw but we got a replacement from the local lowe s  nothing that couldn t be helped we are in love with this guy  if it is in your price bucket look no further      
1495,5.0,                       we have had our t   s since mid november   my handyman friend helped assemble it   actually he did the work and i handed him the tools   it would be great if amazon offered assembly   the ifit program makes perfect   keeps you interested and motivated  excellent trainers   so far i have seen easter island  iceland  new zealand  holland  transylvania  santa lucia  and the german christmas markets   it is like traveling the world while staying home   i am    yo  overweight  have a fused spine and two artificial knees   it is a great way to get fit   i have lost nearly    pounds since november  even though that included thanksgiving  christmas  super bowl and two adult birthdays o     
1496,1.0,                       bought on sept          some functions on the console was not working  manual workout  manual incline and speed adjustment   contacted amazon which directed me to contact nordictrack for a replacement parts  contsctrf nordictrack which states that the console part is not currently in stock and there s no eta when it will be available  tried using the treadmill  this morning  none of the function of the console is working  the console would light up but it wouldnt start  the console would show     mph speed after turning it off and back on but the treadmill is not even moving  how do i even start on returning the horrible item      
1497,3.0,                       well it arrived safely  install took hours but  it was done  after putting key in place  i was able to bypass ifit  so far its good  sturdy  and neat  stay tuned   i love it so far      
1498,1.0,                       the ifit software isn t compatible with the spectrum internet which severely limits the functionality of the unit   the response from nordictrack customer service was to contact spectrum and have them add the mac address to their router  spectrum s response was that s not possible   i could have paid a lot less for a treadmill that didn t offer internet connectivity but did provide the same functionality  less internet capability  for much less      
1499,5.0,                       good experience with the treadmill so far  easy to use with intuitive controls and is relatively quiet when in operation highly recommend paying the extra amazon delivery fee  approx      where the box is placed where you want it in your home as the box is     lbs   not hard to put together with two people if you follow the instructions  it took about    minutes to unbox and assemble  happy with the purchase      
1500,5.0,                       we are so delighted with our purchase and use the nordictrack every day   my spouse and i are both     so we found assembly challenging  but the instructions were clear and we succeeded   this machine has so many features that allows us to customize our workouts   it s sturdy  solid and has us feeling very secure   wish we d done this sooner      
1501,1.0,                       my nordictrack was broken in the box and the incline doesn t work   the pulse sensor also seems to be having issues      
1502,1.0,                       so far not so good   motor stopped working second day   followed all instructions even used surge protector which seems ridiculous as is grounded   called customer support they dropped call never called me back  called again no response      
1503,4.0,                       i would have given this treadmill   stars but i cannot stand when my feet hit the front while walking or running  that s the only negative thing i have to say  other than that  it s a nice piece of equipment  the buttons are super responsive  and it s wide long enough that you don t feel like you re going to fall off  i just received it today and my husband assembled it for me  i ran for over an hour and did   miles  i would buy it again      
1504,4.0,                       we shopped for a treadmill for a while and ultimately chose this due to price and amenities  i use it almost everyday however am a novice runner and love the ifit program it comes with  the touch screen tv is easy to use and swap back and forth to multiple accounts the treadmill did start grinding though when it inclines and makes a squeak sound   i was surprised bc it s not that old  we need to call and get it serviced after the pandemic regarding ifit  there are so many programs to follow for both on and off the treadmill and for all fitness levels   there s supposed to be a live trainer class feature but i can t find any information on it  regardless this is a great machine for the money      
1505,5.0,                       honestly i couldn t see what all the negative reviews are about  if you don t wanna use ifit  then don t  put the emergency key on and hold the ifit button for    seconds   as for assembly anyone with common sense should be able to easily put it together  had it together in an hour  would definitely recommend      
1506,5.0,                       this treadmill is very awesome  our whole family loves to use it  it is a great warmup for workouts  the assembly is okay  as long as you follow the directions really well  it is pretty easy to assemble  we had a few troubles during the process  but we could still fix it  overall the assembly is as great as the whole treadmill  i love that it has workouts that are designed to burn a number of calories because you can know how much calories you burned  using it  is really easy  everything works great and nothing is not working  the one thing that bothers me is that they tell you to download an app but you really don t need to  you just need to plug in the key and hold the ifit button for about ten seconds   overall the treadmill is great  everything works fine and i suggest anyone to buy it      
1507,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill after trying out the nordictrack my daughter bought  this purchase also came just before the covid   shutdown of gyms occurred  it is a very sturdy product and is probably more than i need but will be used continuously by other family members when the weather keeps us indoors which is   months out of the year where i live  there are many choices on this machine for incline  speed and workouts for those who do more intense activity  and i don t plan on using it for laundry   lol     
1508,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  you do have to get the ifit subscription  but mine came with a yr ifit  i ve been pretty happy with it since i got it  runs really smooth and the tablet on it just adds to it      
1509,5.0,                       bought this treadmill so i could stay active while i was quarantine ing  i m a big guy       lbs and i was a little concerned about it handling my weight  no such concerns after i got it unpacked and assembled  solid frame and decking  nice layout for the controls  i opted for this model because i didn t need the large fancy display that costs the extra       i just needed a tread mill that will go  no problems with the belt sticking which can be a problem for bigger guys  fairly easy to assemble  been on it for a month now with no issues  using it any where from     minutes to an hour and a half a day  incline is nice  goes to     which is more than enough  treadmill doesn t move  currently on a tile floor and hasn t slipped a bit  easily lifts up with piston system and comes down slowly and under control with same piston  will not crash down  easily worth the price paid      
1510,5.0,                       this treadmill was easy to assemble and works great  the deck lifts out of the way very easily and comes down very gently with hydraulic assistance  the speed and incline works very smoothly and there are many interactive and built in workouts  definitely worth the price which is very reasonable for a treadmill of this quality      
1511,4.0,                       the price point isn t cheap or expensive to say the least  the quality isn t superb as you can get a much higher quality built machine for a few hundred dollars extra  this machine runs smoothly and you can expect it to last for a few years at a minimum  this is for those who wish to run at home during the coronavirus outbreak or during the winter when it s freezing cold outside      
1512,4.0,                       this machine was a good price for a decent workout   i m just a basic walker for the most part  going up to   mph   i haven t tried running yet   i have done the incline also which works well   at times the motor can skip a little giving a jolted walk but it doesn t happen that often   overall it gives me a good workout that i m able to do in my own home   i d definitely recommend      
1513,1.0,                       this my second nordictrack  the quality of this product and support has gone downhill this model stopped working after     months  i called service and i am patiently waiting for an electronic part to install myself  so much for the   year parts and service warranty on the owners manual  they have a    day warranty when you register online update  the control board is out again  less than   years old  amazon info says   years parts warranty  per nordictrack only one year   misleading      
1514,5.0,                       product works great  was delivered in good condition and it works as expected  the assembly was a little challenging as a few of the screw holes were a little hard to find because of the placement on the machine  but it wasn t too bad  you definitely need two people to put it together  loved how the screws were packaged and the instructions were easy to follow  didn t like that i had to sign up for the app to get the machine  unlocked   but i was able to cancel immediately  so it wasn t a big deal      
1515,5.0,                       love love love this treadmill   easy to start up and the   amazon workers that came out to set up the equipment were very friendly and very professional              
1516,4.0,                       this is a good treadmill and it is super easy to use  it was a lot of work to put together and it took us about three hours to do so  the panel is very basic and i was a little disappointed but it does the work and that s all that matters  i would have given it   stars if the panel was more advanced but i use it with the peloton app instead of ifit and it is perfect for that  do not sign up for ifit unless you really want to  it is not needed as it says on the label  that s very misleading      
1517,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill after looking at other similarly priced treadmills  of the others at this price point  this one had overall the best reviews and features that i was looking for  i was looking for a treadmill that could go at least up to    mph  and    elevation grades with quick buttons on the interface for each level  i usually do hiit sprints and wanted something that was easily transitional from high to low speeds  along with elevation gradient increase  this had all of these  and is also very sturdy given me sprinting at   mph          lbs   overall decently priced for what you get  the only thing that was a little bit difficult was assembly which i did alone  while not impossible  it s definitely not easy  additionally one of the screws they sent was wrong  but i contacted customer service and they sent me another one in the mail      
1518,5.0,                       so happy with this purchase  this treadmill with the ifit app has made it an enjoyable experience   i work out each day usually taking a hike or interval walks through beautiful landscapes   the treadmill is perfect in our unit  which is not large  but with its ability to fold up it is a perfect got      
1519,5.0,                       my wife and i decided to buy a treadmill as an alternative to our gym subscription we choose this model because of its low height base from the floor  our basement has not a very high ceiling  and because of its large screen a couple of hours of assembly and now we both use it every single day since some months the ifit program is very affordable and various and it is fun and effective to plan different training programs we definitely would buy it again     
1520,1.0,                       i really liked this treadmill  t     s  and thought i was buying quality  until yesterday when the track motor stopped functioning  i did not buy the extended warranty  i never do when i think i m buying a quality product  a call to nordictrack and i learned that a service call is      just to determine the problem  the repairman does not stock parts so the second service call to actually fix the darn thing is another     plus the cost of any parts which could be    s of dollars  i don t know  all this for a      price  delivered  treadmill  it only lasted    months of fairly light use very sorry i bought this piece of junk and will not throw good money after bad   i will never buy nordictrack products again and strongly suggest you do the same douglas b  hoffman     
1521,1.0,                       the machine literally started to crack and sink in after buying it last month  if you increase the speed above    mph  it makes a loud clanking noise  the belt was slipping  prior to this  i wasn t impressed by the machine  but it was getting the job done  but  now it has fallen apart a month later  i would not recommend      
1522,2.0,                       i would love to say if i like this or not but i haven t even been able to use it  clips that hold some of it together arrived broken  the belt is off  no idea how to fix that yet   several other issues that are preventing me from using this treadmill      
1523,5.0,                       easy to assemble  if youre a diyer   durable  sturdy  no loud mechanical sound  good design and does the job of keeping cardio health going strong  highly recommended      
1524,5.0,                       i had a rough start with the treadmill  upon assembly it appeared as if the console  crossbar  was not a fit for the rest of the treadmill body as it seemed a few inches too short  i saw another review stating something similar and was very disappointed  amazon support was super responsive and was ready to ship me another unit  meanwhile i got in touch with nordictrack  through the online form   and they were super responsive as well  within a couple of days i was facetiming with kay lynne  an extremely helpful employee who walked me through the finer points of the assembly  in short  it was critical to loosen some key screws before connecting the crossbar  and console   after that  the assembly went smoothly the treadmill works great and it s sturdy  the price is great  i disabled ifit by pressing the ifit button for ca     seconds  make sure the magnetic key is attached while you do this       
1525,4.0,                       will update review once used  assembly wasn t awful    but wasn t easy  you do not have to create an ifit account like the machine says you do  just simply hold the blue ifit button for    seconds  save yourself the trouble      
1526,5.0,                       i love this treadmill   we have had it for about   months   i was able to assemble nearly all of it by myself  in about an hour   we used the free ifit membership for one month  but decided that the included features  pre programmed workouts  and space for an ipad to watch other videos or listen to music  were enough for us   i run on it nearly every day  and have had no issues  the convenience of having the treadmill during winter cannot be overstated   the screen is bright and easy to read  and it is very easy to switch speeds or inclines   the interface with ifit was also great when we used it  and i d recommend it for those who want that extra motivation or to change up the workouts   scenery   coaching each time the only downside is that there is no pace info  miles per minute  on the display  but through time i ve learned what the speeds  in mph  are for my goal paces      
1527,4.0,                       this machine doesn t have all the bells and whistles that you sometimes see  but it is good quality  affordable treadmill  i have had it now for a few months and it gets used almost daily by my wife and i  so far no problems  it did arrive with a cracked plastic cover piece but nordictrac replaced it quickly at no charge  so far  very satisfied with this purchase      
1528,3.0,                       if you want complete control over your machine  this one is not for you   this treadmill manufacturer only offers workouts plans  if  you purchase their monthly subscription   otherwise  it s a manual world you are buying into      
1529,5.0,                       was delivered on the day i made appointment for  worked out great with our schedule  treadmill track is    inches wide nice and comfortable  it took a little over in hour to assemble  not difficult at all  the treadmill is easily folded upwards  and barely takes up any room  electronics work awesome  screen is big  bright  and speakers are loud  packaged well  lots of styrofoam  pieces of particle board placed around components  a          
1530,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  my husband bought it for me for christmas and it s perfect  it s easy to use and pretty simple to put together as long as you follow the directions  i put it together myself with very little help from my husband   the only thing i don t like about it is that i had to signup for fitness before i could even try it out  but i ended up liking the app too  the only problem i have is that i need to figure out how to move the belt over to one side a little more as it looks like it s much closer to one side than the other  i do also wish i could fit it through my bedroom doorway      
1531,5.0,                       was not sure how i would like this equipment but i am not disappointed   i would recommend this to everyone it s easy to use and fits very well in the location at home      
1532,1.0,                       for one  the ifit thing in general is a scam   if i didn t see the workaround in other reviews  i wouldn t have been able to start up my treadmill in the first place since it didn t come with a card and a code   i even made an ifit account before i discovered that and had to confirm my cancellation about fifteen times before it finally let me   i got in a good half mile run to test the waters and it was nice and quiet despite being on the highest possible settings   i turned it on the next morning only for the display to light up and go out entirely   i tried turning it off and back on   i even tried unplugging it while in the off position  then turning it back on  but nothing   i literally got half a mile s worth of use before running into my first major problem   i usually love the quality of nordictrack  but this model truly disappoints me      
1533,5.0,                       it s great for me     yrs old    just wanted it for slow to medium walking when it s too hot or cold outside   it s great for that   since it was relatively inexpensive and i had someone to assemble it for me  took him       hrs    i bought it   and i m not sorry   i wouldn t recommend it for a young athlete who wants to run very fast   it can go fast  my grandson tried it   but it shakes a lot at high speeds   i don t think it would last very long taking that sort of treatment      
1534,5.0,                       i would definitely buy this again  but hopefully i won t have to  the assembly is fairly easy  it took my daughter and i about an hour and a half or so to put together and neither of us are mechanically inclined  the treadmill itself is super sturdy  i love being able to get off the sofa and walk two feet and be able to work out while i m still able to watch tv  it s super quiet as i keep opposite hours of the house and it doesn t wait anyone up when i turn it on  i  actually  like the ifit feature on it  but you don t have to have it in order for the machine to work  please see other posts about bypassing that option  all in all i will say this is a great machine i ve had it for about   months now and i have absolutely no complaints      
1535,5.0,                    la idea era comprar la maquina s lo para mi  pero mi familia qued  encantada con la compra y ahora todos la usamos y estamos muy satisfecho con la adquisici n   la oportunidad de usar por un a o ifit es genial  muy util y con grandes y buenos entrenadores  recomiendo ampliamente nordictrack        
1536,5.0,                       been using it for a month now  came perfect in box  no damage  runs smooth  tracks nicely  be careful on price though  changed every day and they will not refund the difference  i had to cancel the delivery    minutes before arrival because the price dropped     dollars days later    the price range was     to     dollars during a    day period     
1537,4.0,                       so far so good   i had it professionally assembled which took the guy about   hours  so i can t comment on the complexity but i imagine it wasn t easy as far as my experience using the treadmill   no problems as of yet after   months of regular usage   there is a weird screeching sound that comes and goes  so hopefully that s not a sign of issues to come  but aside from that my only complaint is how slow it is to get the unit from a point of powered off to the point where i can start running   it takes a while to boot up from pressing the power button  then i have to press  continue without signing in   then  manual start   and by the time i m actually running it usually burns about   or   minutes of my lunch break   i could just leave it powered on between uses  however  the display remains on and i imagine that over time that may wear it down so i d prefer to leave it off      
1538,4.0,                       i ordered this to use during the winter so i could keep on a regular exercise schedule   i did utilize amazon s service to bring it in and set up   glad i did  as they did so much better than i could have done  and took the empty boxes with them   usability is good although i don t find that i need all the features   i just like to walk for a substantial timeframe either reading or watching tv while doing so   this machine allows me to do all of that without having to spend money on a gym and going outside in the winter at      am   also with the covid    stay at home   i was still able to walk everyday   don t plan on using the machine for heavy duty running as it is definitely not built for that  but for walking or a light run  it works well      
1539,5.0,                       if you watch a  how to  video on youtube  w  the printed directions   you have someone to help you   very doable to put together  we love this   haven t been to the gym because of covid so this is a really  really good machine for home use  it is pretty sturdy   is handling my             lbs walk run on it while also handling my boyfriend s         lbs of running on it  it s only been a few months so we ll see how long it lasts  we got it for      total   a good price for a machine this size  delivery was a bit rough  box was broken up a bit   i was worried it was damaged but the packaging held up  no marks etc      
1540,5.0,                       i purchased this treadmill in october so i could walk and run indoors during the winter  it was easy to assemble  i m glad i paid extra for the  room of choice  delivery service as it was way to heavy for my wife and i to get it into the basement      
1541,5.0,                       we had a earlier version before we moved to our new home  it was too hard for us to transport  so it was sold  this new model is more technical for an old guy but it works just fine  highly recommend nordic track   our previous model had a motor problem  good thing we had the service plan  a new motor was sent  technician arrive and installed  no cost no hassle  recommend the service plan  at least for the first year      
1542,5.0,                       i got this treadmill for a steal and i love it  it s really good quality for the price   for all the reviews that warn you against having to sign up for ifit   you can bypass that  just hold down the ifit button on the treadmill for    to    seconds and you will be able to use it freely without the app      
1543,5.0,                       made in the usa and i love this treadmill    my husband is really good with putting things together  so  if your not good with putting things together  please hire someone to set up this treadmill      
1544,4.0,                       i had paid extra for to room delivery of the package because as a    yo who is   months out of open heart surgery  wrestling a    lb box up    stair is ill advised  unfortunately  a series of failures to communicate from the delivery side meant that the package had to sit in my entryway for a week until i could arrange for help once the package was in the room  it only took me about   hours to unpack and assemble the treadmill  since long experience has taught me to triple check my understanding and performance of the instructions once assembled  i had trouble starting the unit until i realized that i didn t have the safety key engaged     once that was done  everything started working fine and   weeks later i m very pleased with treadmill      
1545,5.0,                       this is a really good treadmill  we purchased it because with covid  going to the gym is no longer possible  so  we brought the gym home to us  we love the ifit features    inch screen  the library of walks and hikes and the variety of different trainer  it keeps it fresh every day  if you are going to put it together yourself  you will need two people at some point  because it can be very heavy  but  all in all the directions were very clear and it was very easy to put together as long as you follow those directions  we have had to call the service number for a couple of parts that needed to be replaced due to damage during shipping  but the service was excellent and the parts were replaced very quickly  we are very happy with this purchase  highly recommended      
1546,2.0,                       start with positive  speed and incline is very fluid   now the issues  the machine has a horrible squeak  nd day of use and i can t get it to stop or a response from nordictrack to troubleshoot   have to give it   stars because of that   with poor customer service and a break down that quickly i would not recommend this product      
1547,3.0,                       this treadmill was purchased in response to quarantine orders due to covid      it s a good name  it was a great price and had the features we needed   for us  it works as expected   however  i would not recommend using the treadmill for anything under     mph   at that pace  the treadmill is jerky  and only gets worse as you slow down   so  if you are ok going    mph or faster and can do your own cool down  it works well      
1548,2.0,                       plastered all of the treadmill and instructions is that you must go to ifit com activate just to turn the thing on   of course  there is nothing telling you prior to purchase about this  you cant turn the thing on until you register and buy a membership   so anyhow  i spent a half hour waiting for customer support gave me a work around    hold the ifit button down for       seconds with the key in  the real issue is that everything to this point is requiring you to give them your credit card to sign up for automated billing   there is no opt out or any indication of the instructions above anywhere in the documentation   this is a horrible way to do business   i d be ok with opting in but they chose not to do that instead wasting my time and yours if you buy it      
1549,3.0,                       i would have given this over all    or   stars but it came very damaged due to shipping  not packed well and box had several holes  then upon opening a few of the plastic parts were broken or cracked  the speaker has a gash at top  none of these effect performance so i am contacting nt to see about replacement parts for broken pieces  assembly was not real intuitive  over all plastic pieces are very flimsy compared to my older nt  however actual workout performance is good  i haven t tried speaker yet and will not be using ifit so i bypassed it when activating  they should tell you off the bat you can bypass by simply starting  put in safety clip  then hold down ifit button until it beeps and sets track      
1550,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill when my gym closed back in march  i did not need a large treadmill with tons of bells and whistles and this is perfect  i am          lbs   and it does not shake or seem flimsy in any way  solid treadmill even for someone larger than me  easy to use  reasonably easy to put together but you definitely need   people to do so  i did not need a screen or specific workouts as i am just running or walking and i use my ipad for entertainment  such a great piece of equipment and great price  highly recommend      
1551,5.0,                       i m in love with this treadmill  great shock absorbers and you can  with a little work  download netflix on it  relatively quiet  and the speakers are loud enough  my husband loves all the ifit trails  i definitely recommend this one if you know for sure you re going to use it      
1552,5.0,                       the only issue i had was the delivery   it looked like it had been through a war and back when i got the box   but luckily the packing to keep everything safe worked really well   the box was extremely beat up though   we were able to assemble with no problem though   she works like a dream   i really enjoy using this treadmill   there is a work around if you don t want to use the ifit option      luckily someone posted it earlier   the speakers could be a bit louder to be heard over the treadmill itself   i would advise using head phones to help being able to hear what you re using to entertain yourself in your workout   i would get a better clip for the magnet   the clip that s on there is a bit cheaply made and cumbersome to put on your clothing      
1553,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  i was worried about not having seen it in person  but it was absolutely the best choice  set up required   people  and took a bit of time  it is important to note though  that the set up makes it a very sturdy and stable unit to use  i am very happy with this treadmill and i am so glad i went with this choice      
1554,5.0,                       great product  it s like using a professional machine at the gym  i haven t folded it because it would be hard to fold  assembling needed   people and took a while for me      
1555,5.0,                       this treadmill has changed my life   i debated on buying a more expensive commercial version but i am so glad i did not  i have had the greatest experience    this treadmill is smooth  not too noisy  an occasional squeak  and the ifit membership has kept me fit during quarantine  the controls are easy  the screen  although small  is just fine  and i use this treadmill daily  i am so happy that i bought this one  assembly was a little tricky  and delivery was to the driveway so we had to unbox it out there and bring it in piece by piece because it is so heavy  but overall  i am so happy with this treadmill  i highly recommend it      
1556,5.0,                       i got this a year ago at the start of the rona i m super happy to have made the decision to get it  put on a mark weins travel food video on youtube and time goes by fast the pulse monitor is pretty much off most of the time  the audio isn t very loud but with my       ipad  things are great       
1557,5.0,                       we ordered and had the nordictrack t series    si during the covid    outbreak so it was delivered to our door  we were not able to get assistance with putting it together  much less getting it up our stairs  the package is very heavy so beware  the treadmill itself was not terribly difficult  it took us about   hours to put together after assembly everything was a breeze  the treadmill is very sturdy and feels like a high quality machine  it runs very smooth and is respectably quite  i would also mention that it comes with a    inch tablet screen that is much bigger than in the pictures  we were torn between this model and the next step  the     with a   inch screen and a built in fan  but for us  casual walkers runners looking to be more healthy  it was perfect      
1558,5.0,                       i bought this for covid home workout for      and it goes pretty well so far i usually ran for   hr every other day and it just fit my needs not too large that could fit my small living room  not too noisy that i could still enjoy the tv show while using it love it  the price is dropping now  i wish i could get this good price for it      
1559,4.0,                       not too bad to put together   some of the molded parts don t fit together as cleanly as i d like but it s somewhat expected with molded plastic   did t have to do any adjustments out of the box to the belt   the software is a bit annoying to navigate until you log into the ifit system      
1560,5.0,                       average joe here  i was able to assemble this treadmill in around   hours  taking my time  once you understand the instructions manual lingo it s easy  you ll need help to take out of box and help to add the piston stand  also pay no mind to the ifit feature  you can bypass it bu depressing the blue button for    seconds      
1561,5.0,                       i was hesitant about buying this product sight unseen  but after   months  there have been no issues   quick to set up  use it daily and quiet as the first day   well worth the price and would suggest anyone wanting a treadmill to look at the t      great screen  ifit is actually really cool how it mimics the speed incline of the locations and you get to tour some amazing places that are hard to get too   i am very happy with the purchase      
1562,4.0,                       great overall product   need a second person for certain sections during assembly   requires ifit subscription according to all docs and signs   can bypass and work without subscribing to ifit   hit ifit sync button for    seconds  this info does not show up on manuals    a bit loud while using running speeds   stable when running   overall great product      
1563,3.0,                       not built like they used to be  def not anywhere near the quality nordic used to be known for delivery was a disaster as well  if you order it  the delivery date is wrong  that s the date it gets to the local shipper  then they schedule your delivery from there regret the purchase and i just got it today      
1564,5.0,                       works too well  i was hoping to be able to hang my clothes on it but it seems bullet proof  strong  sturdy  only complaint would be the weak little tablet screen  the thing is not at all user friendly  slow and takes the product down from a       to a           
1565,5.0,                       just what i was looking for   this is an uncomplicated basic treadmill   assembly was straight forward   about   hours    nice features   very well made   excellent price if you are looking for a good walking running treadmill without all the  bells   whistles   this most definitely fits the bill highly recommend      
1566,5.0,                       the treadmill itself is great and my wife and i have used it a lot in the first   months of owning it the only downside is that it makes you sign up to a prescription based workout app before you can even use it  the app itself is actually very good and after the trial subscription ended we renewed it  but i can imagine this would annoy most people      
1567,5.0,                       i have to turn the volume on my tv up almost as high as it ll go when i m on the treadmill  but i can still hear the tv  run and not bother my neighbors it s heavy  really heavy  if you have to take it up a flight  or two  of stairs  i suggest paying the extra     to have the delivery people do it i generally just run on manual  so i don t have insight on the different programs it has      
1568,5.0,                       love this treadmill but i agree with the negative comments on the ifit being too pushy and making you feel like you have to register your product and do the free trial for the first month but you do not  i held down the ifit button  for about    seconds and i was able to bypass the crap and go straight to using my treadmill      
1569,3.0,                       i was present when treadmill got delivered  friendly   courteous delivery people the box looks undamaged  halfway during the assembly process i discovered this crack  the frame is sturdy and solid  however  the plastic components feels cheap   substandard  the cracked plastic on the base just looks unpleasant  but the machine per se is good  i purchased the      year maintenance  i tried contacting their customer service to inquire about the details  legitimacy  of the program and how far in advance i can schedule my annual maintenance    so far its been days but i still couldn t get a hold of anyone  anyway  i ll give them a separate review  back to this treadmill  i think its ok      
1570,5.0,                       this treadmill was really simple to put together    of us did it in under   hours  it is exactly what i was looking for and i am excited about getting started on my new fitness routine  don t be sucked into the i fit scam  just hold down the  i fit button and the machine will unlock  i am very pleased with this purchase and hope to put hundreds of miles on this treadmill  be safe everyone      
1571,5.0,                       i do like my nordictrack  it is easy to use  it took me longer to put together because i did it on my own  this thing is heavier than i thought it would be  it runs well  and so far the incline and speeds are great  i am really getting a good workout on this  and plan on continuing  it is long enough to fit me walking or running  and wide enough so i am comfortable  i would definitely recommend this for the price      
1572,1.0,                       the treadmill is very poorly made with cheap plastic   the shipping box was fine but the unit was damaged   it came with a broken side  will not incline at all  and has scratches   marks   i called nordictrack customer service and they are sending me replacement parts  new side rail and controller  for me to fix my brand new treadmill   it is going to take a week or two to receive the parts   i spent two hours putting it together and i can t even use it   i am so disappointed with my purchase update   after waiting   weeks for parts  called customer service and was told that it will be at least another month because parts are not in stock   i am returning this junk product to amazon      
1573,1.0,                       need two people to put together that s fine  but when go to use it its locked  no information on how to use the machine only you have to sign up for their program  only reading other reviews did i find out how to bypass by pressing the ifit button for    seconds this is bullying   otherwise it s seems to be a nice machine     
1574,5.0,                       i love this machine   it is intuitive to use  and if you get the ifit package  which i can t recommend highly enough   you can have a tour of the world while you exercise every day  i started with cardio workouts  a weight loss program in turks  caicos and aruba   and continued on to turkey and new zealand  exercising is fun   i love the way my machine does the work on hills and more brisk walks  keeping me on track  buy one       
1575,5.0,                       bought this for my wife at the start of the pandemic as she was a gym regular but falls in a high risk group   we both use it and absolutely love it  extremely simple to assemble for me   very customizable as far as workouts go   another plus is that we find it very quiet   overall a really nice quality product      
1576,5.0,                       i like that it s easy to fold up and down i disliked that when you first set it up you are almost tricked into buying an exercise program to get the unlock code  you have to call then the phone acts like it hangs up after instructions to buy app  after a   to   second silence then it instructed you to press   to get unlock setup code      
1577,4.0,                       i love this  i bought it because my gym closed because of covid     it s comfortable  but not like the ones at my gym  it seems like it runs faster than the speed it displays  either way  at this time  i feel lucky to have a treadmill that is not gym quality  but definitely better than most  the ifit app is free for the year and i really enjoy it  buy the extra protection plan if you workout daily  it s well worth it      
1578,2.0,                       bought this treadmill last weekend  there was issues with shipping since the first one apparently got lost so another one was ordered  once it arrived and opened it  it was really annoying to see scratches on the treadmill  if it comes new it should come new  also find it irritating how   days after purchasing it  they drop the price almost      dollars on it which is very annoying  overall decent treadmill  i did not sign up for the ifit thing  even though it has signs all over it saying you have to register on the site it s all lies  one you hold down the blue button for    seconds after turning it on and pressing start  the tredmill works  find it interesting how they try to make you purchase the ifit thing or else your tredmill won t work is all a lie      
1579,5.0,                       i bought the nordictrack t series treadmill  so i could workout on my schedule  honestly  i couldn t be happier with the purchase  it s a wonderful product  in my opinion is that the treadmill is  easy to run on  it s quiet  and easy to fold up  also  the ifit workout videos are amazing too  they really motivate me to workout i highly recommend this product      
1580,4.0,                       i bought this treadmill for my health specially after heart surgery   so far it been great to have at my house  which didn t take that much room  to walk and run anyrtime   i do walk outside as well couple of days a week   the speed and incline is suffieceint to what i need   it s also great for kids as my   year old use it to walk when she see me getting to use it   great machine all around       
1581,4.0,                       my wife and i  both in mid    s  had it assembled in about two hours   once assembled it s pretty heavy and awkward to move  so put it together close to where you ll use it  seems solid and stable  my only complaints would be that the motor is pretty whiny   and it s hard to get a good pulse reading without constantly re gripping the contacts  if it holds up it ll be worth the money      
1582,2.0,                       i ve been using it for a little bit more than a year  and it s already broken  the treadmill got overheat so easily that it broke  i can t get in contact with the company s customer service and i am just desperate for help to fix my treadmill       dollars for something that can only last for a little bit over a year        
1583,5.0,                       we are very pleased with our nordictrack treadmill  it was easy to assemble  easy to use  and we love the ifit option for the various workouts  it s a sturdy piece of equipment and we know it will give us plenty of opportunities to get a great workout for a long time  we highly recommend this equipment      
1584,4.0,                       assembly was cumbersome  but once it is put together it functioned fine  some of the plastic external  aesthetic  components didn t quite align  but that could have been my fault  it can take a minute or two to boot up if you turned it off  it jerks a bit when the tread starts moving  when running on treadmills  i normally just his  start  and then set a speed and go  but on this treadmill you have to cancel out of the automatic  warm up  that it has as a default  not a big deal  just a couple of extra seconds and steps at the beginning that i would prefer to avoid      
1585,1.0,                       item arrived damaged and machine has damage to it      
1586,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  conveniently   easily folds up so it s out of the way and easily lowers when ready to use  it s sturdy  the deck don doesn t wobble while i run  very pleased with the quality and reasonable price of this machine  would recommend to anyone in the market for a at home treadmill      
1587,5.0,                       i particularly like all the needed features being at my fingertips  the slope change  the speed change  even incremental  can be reached while walking or running  time  distance  calories burned  current slope and speed readings are all clearly visible on the display  as soon as i get my speed and distance to my goal  i will consider getting the ifit app  the treadmill is quiet and runs very smoothly      
1588,5.0,                       i was skeptical at first that a treadmill at this price would be sturdy enough to run but this treadmill is above all of the expectations  i love the fact ifit can control it   i love running in all over the world by using ifit    my husband loves that he can manually control the treadmill  definitely would recommend       
1589,5.0,                       this appears to be a well built quiet treadmill   this is the perfect treadmill for us  we are not runners  we just wanted this for walking during cold weather months  my husband and i aren t handy people  but we managed to put it together following the step by step instructions  it took us about     hours and only a couple of disagreements      the hydraulic space saver works great for our guest room  another plus is the shelf that holds my tablet so i can stream my shows while walking      
1590,5.0,                       love this  before the pandemic  i went to the gym every day and spent an hour plus on the treadmill  i spent months looking online for one but didn t think to look on amazon  my friend bought this and when i saw it  i knew i had to have it  it s exactly what i wanted  simple  folds up  it s just great for a lower priced nordictrack  took us about   hours to assemble from start to finish but worth it  i highly recommend this treadmill for anyone who wants something simple but good quality     
1591,4.0,                       pros affordable price for the product  it has a    speed and motor it is really fast   strong  the incline works perfectly as well  measures heart rate   has aux cord with built in speakers  ifit membership not needed     seconds on start to bypass membership sign up  assembly is not hard at all and comes with instructions  but you will need   people to assemble  has a phone ipad holder cons due to high demand  wait time for delivery was   weeks after delivery date stated after purchase  does not have an updated technology screen but a holder for your phone ipad      
1592,4.0,                       the assembly people were wonderful  polite and professional and knew what they were doing  and this treadmill does everything we wanted it to    great speed variation  incline  pulse check  distance  calories burned  etc   you can get around the ifit membership by simply holding down the start button for    seconds  the only reason i did not give it   stars is because the belt squeaks when in motion  with my earbuds in it s not too bad but if i m reading or watching a tv program it gets a little annoying  all in all we are happy with it      
1593,5.0,                       i got this product for my wife and she loves it  we ve had it for   months now and it s been working great us for we used about an hour and a half to assemble it and we love it so far  my wife mainly walks on it for an hour straight and she gets a good workout with it especially at full incline  it s a great investment towards our health and fitness  you get a gym feel workout right at home for your own convenience and it doesn t run down your wallet too with the power consumption which is a huge plus  it stores up pretty nicely as well so it won t take up a lot of space  i was pleasantly surprised at how quiet it runs too if you re thinking of buying this  don t hesitate with this treadmill  you won t regret it       
1594,3.0,                       one would think that the primary component  being the tread  would be easy to keep centered  you know  some space age self centering track  i am so tired of adjusting the belt after a couple of miles      
1595,4.0,                       it does the job  it doesn t have wifi or blue tooth  and the there s not much  if any  amplification for the speakers  but if you want to exercise then it works fine  it is also sort of noisy  but that s probably the case with all treadmills  plus  there is a squeak somewhere that makes an annoying sound each time i take a step  there is no display on the small monitor  just digital information about time  speed  etc  your basic treadmill      
1596,5.0,                       for what you pay  this is a solid quality treadmill  my husband and i are both tall so it is nice to have a wider longer belt  also  compared to other similar priced treadmills  it has the bonus of automatically inclining and still able to fold up out of the way  the addition of the   year family membership to ifit  included in initial purchase price   has been fun to explore and keeps us motived  definitely would recommend this product as a staple in any home gym      
1597,5.0,                       love it  the shipment was very fast  said it would take   weeks got here in a few days  easy instructions for assembling  not very loud and it has a soft cushion for your joints  doesn t shake while running  great purchase and for those saying you need a membership to use it is false  just hold down the bluetooth for    seconds to unlock     
1598,1.0,                       the machine did not work after several hours of assembling  quite a few screws not fit well    very disappointed especially a brand new machine  then we called the technical support and was told that the problem could be the motor  the technician ordered us a new motor  about two weeks later we received the motor and installed it  which also took us couple hours replacing the motor   the machine still not working and we called the technical support again and this time was told it might be the control board problem  as far as today we are still waiting for the control board to be delivered and hope the problem can be fixed  we ordered the treadmill around christmas and expected it being a great gift  never thought it is a defect      
1599,5.0,                       i absolutely love this treadmill   the assembly was pretty straightforward   the parts  aka nuts and bolts  were packaged individually and labeled according to which step they are used  which takes the guessing out of everything   the most difficult part was putting the hydraulic piece that holds it upright  so i recommend having a second person to help   as far as ease of use  it was very easy to set up a profile on ifit and this purchase included a one year subscription   there are several workouts to select   i prefer running  and i have been able to run in places i would never really be able to go and see the area and with trainer led workouts  they have so much knowledge about fitness and well being  but also the areas where they run   i would highly recommend this treadmill      
1600,3.0,                       i ve had my treadmill for almost a year  so far so good   i typically run on speeds     mph and i haven t had issues there  i ve encountered two issues this far   i used the incline twice   during the usage it was fine  the next time i went to use it after the incline  the treadmill would continually incline and decline on its own for about   minutes   my second issue happens occasionally   an hour into my runs  the treadmill belt  sometimes feels as though it pauses  it doesn t happen all of the time but enough that i ve  noticed  i live in an apt so my favorite thing is that the treadmill is pretty quiet      
1601,4.0,                       i had to pay someone to put this together for me because my assembly skills are nonexistent  it took the guy over   hours so i would say it does require some elbow grease  it works well but there is literally no cushion on this treadmill  i am used to the treadmill at my boutique gym that is very bouncy which was great for my bad knees and weak shins  since this machine is like running on concrete  it aggrevated my shins like crazy  i had to order some different shoes to specifically use when on this treadmill  once i did that  i ve not had issues so i would still recommend this machine  and i agree with other reviews that you can easily bypass the ifit subscription and use it in manual mode      
1602,5.0,                       i d been looking for a treadmill for months  but was unable to find something under      with width and length  all of the ones under      may be fine for some but they re much smaller and would be best if you re under     or only have room for that this automatically raises and lowers for program  ability for ifit  and plenty of space for those of us with longer legs stride the top tray is very large and while the belt is not padded the shocks seem to help  i ve been using everyday and love      
1603,3.0,                       took two of us two hours to assemble this  and the instructions were very difficult  to say nothing of the assembly   features are adequate   takes forever to boot up  at least two minutes  so they clearly cheaped out on the processor  base screen is kind of blah  all in all it does what is should  but it s nothing to get excited over   and be sure to hire someone to build it for you   and budget for that      
1604,1.0,                       this is a piece of junk  if i could give it zero stars i would  i ve assembled hundreds if not thousands of gadgets in my life and this has got to be the most frustrating  threads weren t machined right  missing bolts and asinine instructions  the display screen and settings are totally unuser friendly  they make you jump through hoops to just activate so you can use the thing  one of those add your credit card for free trial and you can cancel anytime deals  it s noisy and feels unstable  safe yourself some headaches and don t buy  oh and while dealing with the assembly i decided to check where it was made and you guessed it china      
1605,5.0,                       the most challenging thing about getting a treadmill online is hoping that all the specs are true  so to all my big brothas  i got you  the weight limit for this listed at     pounds  i am      at     as was nervous i was gonna be too close to the limit for this machine to work properly  well  that is not the case i can run on this machine and it holds up just fine  very sturdy machine and i love it      
1606,5.0,                       i brought this nordictrack t series for my wife and she loves it   yet  i find myself enjoying using it as well   i love the videos that help me to push myself to exercise harder and to jog or walk go further   the feature i like the most is the videos that synchronizes with nordictrack simulating it is going up and down hills you see in the video      
1607,2.0,                       what you save in money you ll more than make up in a headache  to start  the instructions are horrible and add an additional layer of complexity to assembling this treadmill  most people don t know the measurements and names of each specific screws  so making this the key distinguishing information makes it so much harder  even the illustration aren t helpful  with good instructions  this should take       minutes  not to mention the ifit bs you have to deal with      
1608,5.0,                       i m happy with this treadmill   after a couple hours of use  it feels like a quality product  assembly took a couple hours  the instructions were pretty good  i am very disappointed in the delivery  i paid extra for the amazon option  deliver to any room in your house   the delivery company missed their   hour window by two hours   the   guys who delivered it were not going to bring it into the house  i had to be very firm with them  i feel like if this were my mother or somebody less assertive they would have just left it in the porch      
1609,5.0,                       i love my treadmill  getting it put together  which i mainly did just by myself  took a couple days since i was sent a wrong screw but i called nordictrack and they sent a replacement  love this for the price     
1610,5.0,                       i received this treadmill last week and purchased the professional assembly to set it up so worth it   there s no way i would have been able to do this by myself   the man who came was quick  polite and had my treadmill up and running in about an hour and even cleaned up all of the packaging ifit you do not have to sign up to activate the treadmill   simply push down on the ifit button for about       seconds and it automatically turns out without having to activate any account or give any credit card information i have been running and walking for the past week and it s been great   the only thing it doesn t have is a fan  which i was aware of when i purchased it   other than that i m so glad i didn t spend double the price on a newer version   this definitely gets the job done   hope this review is helpful for anyone looking to purchase     
1611,3.0,                       this product is easy to put together  but it took me three times longer trying to activate it with my ipad  iphone  and computer  finally i have to use chat to resolve  the customer service rep to me to press and hold down the ifit button on the console until i hear two beeps  this procedure finally activated this treadmill  i almost returned it      
1612,1.0,                       i have had this unit for over a month and am very satisfied with the quality of the product   my huge issue comes with the ifit program that appears during set up and and the requirement to set up a membership before you can start using the machine   unfortunately when you try to cancel this membership you cannot reach anyone on their phone lines and there is not an easy way to cancel on the ifit website crazy scam and i am amazed a company like nordictrack would partner with ifit   i absolutely would not buy this unit again based entirely on the ifit partnership       
1613,5.0,                       my wife and i looked at many options for treadmills under        we ordered the nordictrack and another brand to try them both at the same time  the nordictrack has a better manufacturing quality and most importantly an incline feature that is electronic whereas the other ones for similar prices you either have to do it manually or it is not available      
1614,5.0,                       my only regret is that i waited so long to finally get this  you need   people to put it together for sure  there were some curse words and threats of moving out  but we made it  i never thought i d subscribe to ifit but with membership included i am able to try it out  i love it and will likely pay for membership  treadmill is great  worth paying extra for the bigger screen  love that i can bluetooth my music over the speakers      
1615,3.0,                       the machine seems solid  but one of the main reasons i bought this particular one was for the interactive online workouts  however  when i entered my code from the card in the box  i was told that the membership had already been redeemed and i could not activate   i contacted support via their chat system and then was told that they were unavailable until monday  this was on a saturday    monday came and went with no response   just reached out again via the same system and again it says that they are offline  even though i am within the hours that they say they are available    anyway  if the online experience is a big part of what you re looking for  look at something else as i now have to decide if i want to go through the hassle of returning this thing      
1616,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill for runs during the winter  it took about   hours for me and my dad to set it up  you need two people to set it up yourself  it s easy to fold up but it s a little heavy but that s to be expected because it s a treadmill not a yoga mat  i would recommend this treadmill to anyone who is going to use it for running or walking  i didn t do the ifit subscription so i can t talk about that but if you want a treadmill to run on without all the bells and whistles this is the treadmill for you      
1617,2.0,                       for those sifting through all the contradicting q a  no  this treadmill is not made in utah  usa   it s made in china the instruction manual can be rather vague sometimes the activation process was annoying  why do i need to activate something that i should be able to just plug in and go  especially after spending all that money  they make you sign up with ifit com which wants your credit card  the website is flakey and hard to navigate on chrome for android and you have to manually cancel a subscription in order to avoid monthly billing i really regret buying this      
1618,5.0,                       very happy with this purchase  i don t need anything too fancy and this model fits my needs well  has ample incline selection as well as easy to operate speeds  incline is smooth  treadmill is also not super loud which is great  i do at least     out of   runs a week on the treadmill for like   months out of the year  the other   months are entirely on the treadmill so we will see how it adds up      
1619,5.0,                       this machine was extremely easy to assemble especially with the online   d video  i love the ifit program   yes you have to pay for it  but it s just as much as a gym membership   overall my husband and i love this machine   perfect purchase      
1620,5.0,                       purchased this treadmill about   months ago as a replacement upgrade for a much older unit   two mid distance runners hikers  avg    miles per day each  use this machine on a daily basis and it is holding up very well   the treadmill itself is very sturdy and has proven to be easy to fold when needed to save space in the home gym   the tablet ifit features are very useful and the different programs help to break the monotony when distance training the assembly was a bit of a bear but nothing too strenuous  it did require two people for some steps overall no complaints  well worth the price  especially considering the included   year ifit membership    would definitely purchase again      
1621,5.0,                       love this treadmill  it was easy to assemble and only required a second set of hands for a couple of the steps  i fit was quick to install  it is quiet enough that i can use it for early morning workouts and not wake the family  it is sturdy and runs smoothly  i like the available settings and really enjoy the trainers who help you forget that you are working out  it has an easy to use touch screen which is the perfect size  very pleased with my purchase        
1622,1.0,                       once i built this i noticed none of the buttons worked except the speed controls  i read other reviews that said you could bypass the ifit  but the bluetooth button you need to hold to bypass wasn t responding  i figured this was just that the ifit was locking the treadmill so i signed up for ifit reluctantly  after that my phone connected to the treadmill and unlocked it  but still the buttons other than the speed ones did not work  so i think i received a faulty control board  was such a pain to work through the ifit that i would not buy ever again even if the buttons did work as intended     one of the most deceptive marketing techniques ever and should be illegal      
1623,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  nordic track is a great brand and i m so happy i got this   i use it twice a day and my kids use it daily as well  i didn t purchase the newest and most expensive one and i m very pleased with the quality of this one       
1624,1.0,                       i m now on day three of the assembly process  besides poorly diagrammed and worded directions  there seems to be a major quality issue  most of the predrilled holes will not accepted the screws and bolts supplied  the shipping box said it was made in china  which could explain the problem  or it could be poor engineering by the company it certainly doesn t appear to be usable if i complete the assembly given its current state of wobbliness  i have been a purchaser of nortictrack products in the past but this unit and its poor construction is a deterrent to future purchases  now on to customer service  i hope that wasn t outsourced to china  more details to follow  i m hopeful customer service will come through      
1625,5.0,                       i love this treadmill   the instructions made me feel as though i had to sign up for ifit app   which that really annoyed me but the treadmill itself is great and you don t have to sign up   it has speakers on it but i can t seem to get any music to come out of them   another thing not listed anywhere      
1626,5.0,                       it was delivered and setup correctly  it came a day earlier than the block scheduled  a little bit of a miscommunication between seller and shipper i am assuming  it has been working great  i use it almost every day  i feel it was a good purchase      
1627,5.0,                       we bought this when the quarantine began thinking my wife and i would use it  however  several of my kids are using it as well  it easily gets three hours or more a day and has worked perfectly  very happy with this product      
1628,5.0,                       though delivery was delayed   days  no one knows why  the end result was better than expected  good quality treadmill  software and tablet are all good quality  mechanics and frame feel solid  assembly took about an hour   at this point i could not be happier  did a quick pre loaded run  croatia i believe  the treadmill moved between speed and incline with little effort  i have to boost my wi fi to log on and have better software response  free ifit for a year too  i ve had no problem switching the machine on and going for a run  i m not sure why some are having an issue  it s plug and play  it s good so far  fingers crossed  good job nordictrack        
1629,2.0,                       the treadmill itself is good but the heart rate monitor is horrible very inconsistent  when i called service they said that is just the way it is and they know it does not work well   when i pushed the issue more she  tylesha s  just disconnected from me   terrible customer service   i then called customer service and she also said that their heart rate monitors are very inaccurate  but as long it reads anything it is considered to be working and they will not address the problem   she basically said take it the way it is or leave it   i left it and returned it   bought an ancheer model and the heart rate monitor works great   not rocket science   don t buy this just for the name      
1630,5.0,                       having this treadmill has been a lifesaver   i run on the treadmill several times a week during the winter and don t know what i would do without it   i did quite a bit of research looking for the best treadmill at the best price and i am not disappointed   i have especially enjoyed ifit   the exercise app that comes installed on the nordictrack   i have gone running all over the world with a variety of coaches   it really helps take the grind out of a long run on a treadmill   so far the nordictrack has functioned flawlessly   i assembled it myself  it is easy to move and to fold  simple to use and smooth and quiet to run on   i highly recommend it      
1631,3.0,                       i would have rated this treadmill much higher but i did not receive the expert assembly that i selected when i made my purchase  thankfully it was a free option because if i paid for the expert assembly and didn t receive it i would be pretty livid  and luckily my husband was able to assemble it for me  this beast of a treadmill weighs    lbs and can be tricky   we had to take a door off the hinges to fit it in a particular room  so make sure you have at least two able bodied people around to assemble it and do not count on the expert assembly  with that being said  the treadmill is great quality and perfect for my needs  it also has this pretty neat hydraulic mechanism that allows it to easily unfold from the upright position  you just press on the bar underneath and it sort of slowly falls into place  and it appears to be able to take a beating as well  my husband is a little over    lbs and he ran on it at it s top speed of    and it was able to handle it just fine  my only gripe about it is that it s very large so if space is limited this may be an issue for you  even when folded up and the speakers are very basic  best to use earbuds if music is important to you during your workout      
1632,5.0,                       my grandson      and i      put this together   it takes a little tenacity   since vivid it was not an option   love ifit   free one year but you have to give your card for auto renewal   if i don t like it i ll cancel and set my own programs   my grandson uses google maps to set courses like from home to high school      
1633,4.0,                       my wife and i both use the treadmill     times a week  we are extremely happy with its performance  it is a durable  well engineered quality machine  we are in our late    s and use it for walking   miles per session  for what we paid it is a great value  my only disappointment is that we wanted to buy one for our son for xmas  but it was discontinued i assembled it by myself  assembly was straight forward  instructions clear and u tube videos helpful  some of the screws were hard for me to screw  but hay  i m an old guy      
1634,2.0,                       you cannot play music over bluetooth from any app other than ifit   in fact  you cannot even setup bluetooth without ifit app   no pandora or spotify etc   for no reason   it s obviously capable of it since ifit app has sound   the     mm jack is mono only so that s not really a good alternative   besides who wants wires when you have a      machine that has bluetooth      
1635,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill to get me through the winter months in chicago and still get some cardio  i usually workout at orangetheory fitness  but stopped at the beginning of the pandemic  i live in a   bedroom condo and needed a treadmill that could fold up but also have decent shock absorption   i ve been using it for about   months and it seems to be working well i put this treadmill together with my brother and it took about   hours  assembly requires   people no matter how strong you are  but it s not difficult      
1636,5.0,                       i m really enjoying the treadmill  during covid  i ve had to cancel my gym membership  now that the cold weather has settled in and we have much less daylight  the nordic track is a perfect solution to getting some exercise  the ifit is a really nice addition  but it can run manually as well if i choose not to use ifit  it runs well  i enjoy the variable speeds and inclines  and the fan is a great addition as well      
1637,1.0,                       save your money  i am so disappointed with this purchase  first of all  our new treadmill stopped working after   weeks of use  the connection between the electronic display and the running belt disconnected  the company is sending us new parts  but it s our job to fix it  i ve had several treadmills   this is by far the worst  you cannot enter your weight or track calories  i wish so badly i could return this      
1638,2.0,                       received today and the engine cover has cracked  will need new cover to replace      
1639,4.0,                       living in a climate where fifteen minutes is the difference between sunshine and pouring rain means that a treadmill is a must for working out and the nordictrack    si delivers  it connects easily with both ipad and android phone via bluetooth for guided runs by ifit trainers  and has both the speed and incline to make a self guided workout a challenge i took a star off of my review due to issues with the hr monitor bar  i ve never experienced a treadmill on which the hr monitor bar actually worked  so this isn t an outlier  nor should it be a deal breaker  but the bar on the    si will read a hr out of the moisture in the air in the room  it has not once reflected an accurate hr either being held or just left alone      
1640,4.0,                       there s nothing fancy about this treadmill  but it works great for basic running walking   we did not sign up for any of the ifit features   we simply use it for walking running  and for that purpose it works great   the only complaint is the heart rate monitor is a little touchy  meaning you have to have your hands positioned just right to get a reading   it doesn t bother us much the one thing i love is the ease of lifting the track up and down for storage   it s very simple and light   assembly is possible with one person  but it gets a little challenging on a couple parts if you re looking for a simple  no frills treadmill  i highly recommend this one      
1641,5.0,                       i am absolutely impressed  i have never had a treadmill  at first i was a bit intimated when i opened the box having to put it together  i was amazed at the design and easy assembly  it was easy to put together and works perfectly  very smooth and quiet  i highly recommend this treadmill      
1642,3.0,                       it s easy to put together but u definitely need   person  i did it with my daughter who is only   and i am a woman never done such things like this  i found out it s very noisy when u workout  i use it in the basement but my daughter could hear the noise from upstairs  and u don t need join the ifit membership u don t fool by the scammer  hold down the ifit logo on the treadmill for    seconds and your treadmill will work      
1643,1.0,                       just got this and put it together  i do not want ifit  but they are trying to force you to get it  i tried to use the bypass trick  holding down the ifit button for    seconds  and it didn t work  i do not appreciate spending this much money on a piece of equipment and then being forced to get a membership to use something that i own  i only purchased this because others reported that the bypass trick worked for them  i may send it back  i will certainly avoid any future equipment purchases that are attempting to pull the same scam  and i will against this to others      
1644,5.0,                       this is my second nordic track treadmill   my last one lasted    years and i really loved it   very smooth and easy to program  highly recommend it      
1645,5.0,                       i m so glad that i decided to go with this treadmill  i was originally shopping in the      price range and i m so glad i spent the extra money  this thing is soooooo study  i love the automatic incline adjustment and not having to do it manually like most cheaper ones have  it s quiet but not silent      
1646,5.0,                       i was terrified to buy this product after seeing a bunch of negative reviews but it has been awesome   it s perfect for jogging on  and it is pretty darn quiet  my husband is a bigger guy       and it doesn t squeak or make noise when he runs  the ser up is fairly intricate and time consuming  but it was so worth it  just make sure you have a second person there with you to help set up because some of the steps required two people      
1647,5.0,                       one of the most solid and relatively inexpensive treadmills i could find here during the pandemic  great brand  solid customer service and ifit if you want to get into that  but also it is optional if you don t  it was in stock  arrived quickly  and was not that hard to setup with a little bit of help from my wife  so far so good as far as operation and durability for a hefty dude like myself   hopefully in a few months i will have worked up to running consistently and not be as big         
1648,4.0,                       i am giving it   stars because i just got it   i will see how it holds up over time  a little hard to assemble  the screws and holes didn t line up perfectly  also  couldn t get it started right away  had to google how to bypass the ifit app  turns out you just hold down the ifit button for    seconds to do that  that should be in the instructions instead of making people think you can t operate it without it      
1649,5.0,                       about      cheaper than we found at our local sears and sporting goods store for a comparable treadmill  paid extra for delivery inside the house and that was money well spent   box arrived damaged but it was a minor issue  took about a hour and a half to two hours to assemble  when it says  ipod compatible  on the dashboard you know it maybe isn t the latest greatest of technology  but it is a nice stable treadmill that isn t very noisy  hard to beat this value      
1650,5.0,                       works great and gets the job done  we recently had to move it from the front room out our front door and into the garage and it moved pretty easily   it folds up well and is nicely balanced so wasn t too much effort  kids love it as well and it s helping keep the covid gain at bay for now would recommend to whoever      
1651,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the noise never stops  walking or jogging its the most annoying sound ever  would not recommend     
1652,5.0,                       after researching and reading reviews i settled on this nordictrack treadmill for my home gym  i have had it about a month now and i love it  both my daughter and i use it daily and it works great  i absolutely love the ifit classes and trainers  i m so glad i bought this treadmill  we did pay extra for in room delivery and install which was also well worth it our installer was very quick professional and helpful      
1653,5.0,                       heavy item so make sure you get it delivered where you want to keep it you need two people to lift it  easy to assemble and good quality  as others mention you can press blue iflogo button for    seconds and the warning to register this product goes away you don t need to purchase any plans   i am enjoying this product      
1654,5.0,                       this treadmill is very high quality especially given the low price we paid  it was much better than i was expecting  when i was researching i found the price range for treadmills all over the board  some treadmills run into the thousands and didn t seem to have features that were worth the extra  money at least to us  we just wanted a basic treadmill but this is so much more  the installed programs have some challenging options which my family uses  i prefer to use my own manual settings  either way gives a very good workout  we are very happy with our purchase      
1655,1.0,                       the handrail screws don t fit         days to get sent new ones  guess what  those don t fit  new handrails sent         days later those arrive  guess what  you guess it  the screws still don t fit and  get ready  the hand rails are only half finished  amazing  can only ask for someone to come to the house so many times to fix this problem and get zero response   we ll send you a new one  comes so quickly as if they expect none of the parts to fit regularly     
1656,3.0,                       i would have spent more money for a better machine  the belt is narrow  the motor cover is large and interferes with running  the electronics are good  as i said i would have spent another   or   hundred for a better machine      
1657,1.0,                       this is the first time i am writing a review on any product i purchased  i am writing this because i am extremely disappointed with this purchase   non of the screws that came with it are of right size  it has been   weeks and i have not been able to assemble it yet  when i started assembling  i realized one of the screws was defective  i requested a replacement  which i got in about    days but they ended up sending a wrong one  after complaining i received a right size one after about   days  then i proceed the next step of assembling  then i realized that another set of screws were also not right  now they are sending me the whole set of new screws  terrible product and terrible customer service      
1658,5.0,                       excellent easy to use   love the self adjusting incline  tread belt sturdy   great to have cup holders and work out app  this family loves it     
1659,4.0,                       for the money  this treadmill is a great investment   i ve had it for about   months  and i have had no issues with how the treadmill performs   it isn t fancy  no video screen  etc    but if you just watch netflix on your phone anyway  who cares    but it is very sturdy   it is more than adequate for a moderate exerciser like myself   i m not putting    miles per day on it  but for    min  runs a few times a week  it seems like it will stand the test of time on the negative side   it is very heavy  probably why it s so sturdy   and it wasn t super easy to put together   assembly may require   people  and i would not recommend moving this beast up or down stairs upon delivery  or purchase the option where someone will set it up for you    aside from that  for the price  it s a great deal      
1660,5.0,                       this was a great buy    not bad for two people to put it together  it took about an hour to put together  it works great and came pretty quick  within a week  just check it when you get it because the box was damaged but luckily the equipment was not   highly recommend      
1661,5.0,                       exceeded expectations  this has a smooth consistent feel when walking across it  it also comes with a lot of workouts to choose from  it s also comes with a built in touch screen that allows me to easily choose what route i want to go and what workout i want to complete  this is very cushioned because of the flexselect cushioning system which i really lov  but the great thing about the flexselect system you can choose your cushioning level so if you do not want cushioning you can select no cushioning to make it feel like your outdoor running  it also fold up saving space      
1662,5.0,                       this is the best  treadmill  ever       i m telling you an honest review  if you are hesitant  buy it  i will admit  it did have a crack in it on the side from shipping but i am honestly so happy with the treadmill  it is steady and firm  there is a huge front piece with controls and handles but it is the perfect size treadmill to fit in a small place at the same time  it was the only good treadmill i have found that had the wide running belt  i hate narrow ones where my feet touches the sides  this treadmill is perfect and is better than any other one i ve looked at      
1663,5.0,                       my wife loves it  the only problem she faces is no pause button to  do something for a few min  and return  fairly easy to put together  don t understand the screws in holes that are to remove and discard  threads are wrong and hard to remove      
1664,1.0,                       this product is not suitable and was a waste of money after assembly the incline feature did not function  the manufacturer was insistent that i not contact amazon for a replacement and instead proceeded to send a new part for me to install  which did not work  after a second contact they sent another replacement part for the entire incline motor  which did not work  they did not offer to send a technician and their customer service is not satisfactory  as this is an expensive piece of equipment i am continuing to try to troubleshoot and i am giving nordictrack until the end of the month to provide a workable treadmill  if they can fix this issue i will possibly update my review  until that time buyer beware      
1665,4.0,                       i have had this product for little over a month now  purchased through amazon com  happy with the delivery   assembly   it is a two person job   pros   hasn t given any problems yet  on average  i run two miles on alternative days at speed level        and if i want to challenge myself i can push it to speed level    which is more then enough for me  for average runner  this machine is perfect   cons   the only minor issue i have with this product is  the belt keeps sliding to left edge  you can adjust that with allen key which i did but after some use it does that again      
1666,1.0,                       bought the product brand new  very important   my teenage son  wife and myself tried to assemble this product to no avail  first  it took as   minutes to attached the left leg  once we go to the right leg   the screws will not tighten but hand in which we had not issue with the left leg  i had to dig into my toolbox to find the right tool and tighten the screws  we finally got to to the console  the left side aligns with holes for the screws  however    the right side aligns but the holes were the screws supposed to go in is about   to   inches too high   there is no other way to put the console in   as you can see from the pictures      
1667,1.0,                       this treadmill seems to work well enough and  as expected  was very difficult to assemble  before use you have to sign up with a service called ifit  wherein you are required to start a free trial and provide credit card information  beware that once you select  start trial  you give ifit permissions to automatically bill your account once the trial has expired  all this was very frustrating because i was not able to immediately cancel my membership  i went through the motions on their website and app just to have the page freeze before finalizing the cancellation  i wasn t able to continue with ending the membership until i spoke with a representative during ifit s business hours  these types of transactions are very sketchy  had i known this is what i d be facing after a long day of assembly  i would have purchased a different piece of equipment      
1668,5.0,                       well the best i can say is my wife loves it  the first threadmill we ordered we had to send back because the handles were to low and was uncomfortable to use  we ordered the nordic track and it is just the right height  the speed and incline controls are very easy and accurate to use  i like to watch tv while i workout the nordic track is very quiet  i also like that the belt is a little wider then others  overall very happy with thread mill      
1669,5.0,                       love having this in my home   get up every morning and get on it for       minutes i don t have to drive to the gym  even if it was open    the treadmill itself works great inclines   goes as fast as i need it to      
1670,1.0,                       i bought this treadmill in august  but i assembled it until september  when i received the box it arrived broken  when i started to assemble the treadmill i got a broken piece  i made a claim to nordictrack but i have not had an answer  also in september this same treadmill under price that i pay         
1671,1.0,                       i have had this treadmill for less than   years and it broke  the control panel is toast  come to find out  because i kept it in my clean working out garage and not inside my home  it s loud  heavy  bulky  the warranty doesn t apply  these treadmills are suppose to work    plus years and mine wasn t even used much  i used it all but    times probably   now i have a broken      treadmill in my garage  i wouldn t not recommend this treadmill to anyone  this was my worst purchase      
1672,2.0,                       after   weeks delay  we got the item    the box it came with was damaged so first reaction the machine is damaged     assembly is not complicated  the problem is you have to force fit some parts  some screws are wore out and dont hold  some were so hard to screw in  some holes still open  not sure if something need to be attached to     first time usage was ok  there is some noise but the volume speakers are horrible  my iphone speaker sounds better and louder than the treadmill speakers  what a disappointment i am sure i will be back for more updates  the more i use it     
1673,5.0,                       okay so this treadmill is really heavy but once you get it into its permanent spot it s good  the assembly has    steps but they explain pretty well  it took about   hours total  make sure you don t tighten anything till the end or unless it says to do so  like for real follow the assembly steps to the t  was able to get it up and running and already have used it   times since assembling it  really good space to run in almost feels like the ones at the gym  i m glad i went ahead with this purchase     
1674,5.0,                       as other reviewers have mentioned  insert into the instructions that you need a   mm socket  a    mm open end wrench    to be aware the silver grounding screw is a thread cutting screw  which requires some amount of torque to get it seated   the nut on the bolt on the lifting cross bar needs a   mm      socket    some of the screws that get thrown away were hard to break loose   a    phillips tip and rachet works wonder   other than the tool gathering  everything was  straight forward  and detaied in the assembly instructions      
1675,5.0,                       we are enjoying our treadmill   my wife and i were getting very little exercise during the lock down so i decided to get the treadmill for us and hope it would not turn into a clothes hanger  so far we are using it and getting our exercise  we are still learning just what we can do with all the options  that is the only complaint  could use a booklet on how to use the different items on the screen  but we are loving it      
1676,5.0,                       first things first  putting the treadmill together was easy for the most part  there is one set of screws that are a bit hidden and a little tougher to get to  but overall very easy  instructions were very clear as well  once it was together  the screen is very easy to read and operate  we had the basic functions going within minutes and it s all very self explanatory  the folding feature is awesome  extremely easy to fold up and get back down without any real lifting  i would recommend this product for sure      
1677,1.0,                       took about  hr to assemble  holes where not pre driller correctly  on top of that  the wrong item was sent  bad seller too noisy     
1678,4.0,                       this product s what is showed on the description and has the quality and worth investment  you need to use your screwdriver  the assembly it s for two persons  and the instruction guide in some steps is not clear  if you live in an apartment  it s useful that you get help at the time to get in your home  the box it s cumbersome to handle it  it comes with a subscription of i fitt app that you must first register with your email before start using the machine      
1679,4.0,                       actually i have been pleasantly surprised with this purchase  i guess i had my expectations set low  i have been using this pretty much daily in the morning and the evening  was able to happily cancel     month gym membership  i mounted a    inch tv to my garage wall and haven t looked back since the treadmill lacks some bells and whistles but it s sturdy for a big guy like me  simple to operate as i don t use the preprogrammed workouts or the interface to the special app i d highly recommend for people wanting an easy way to exercise      
1680,5.0,                       i have used this treadmill everyday for over three months  i love how easy it is to use  i have had no problems with it  it has plenty of room to walk or run  i did a lot of research on this treadmill and it paid off since i am extremely comfortable with it and trust it will continue running smoothly for years to come      
1681,5.0,                       we absolutely love our nordictrack treadmill  it s not too noisy and doesn t take up a lot of space   we love the extra features such the fan and audio slot so we can listen to our music  we love the big display and the ifit app is a plus   we re extremely happy with our purchase      
1682,5.0,                       very good product  as stated by others  it tells you that you must log into ifit and create an account prior to using  once on  hold down the ifit button for       seconds to bypass the ifit  if you don t want the subscription  you must do this  it is simple to do      
1683,1.0,                       i had high expectations for this treadmill  i had thoroughly researched a few of them and i decided to go with this nordictrack because of the generally positive reviews unfortunately  my unboxing experience was quite unpleasant at first  even though we applied extra care when removing the items from the box  we could hear some broken lose pieces falling from the belt back down to the box as we were lifting it the first impression  therefore  was that it felt  cheap   the right side bar  foot rest next to the belt itself  was shattered in various locations  causing it to completely unatach from the belt  the screws that kept it together tore apart  this also caused the front  shell  that covers the motor to detach on the right side of the belt  so yeah  things felt a little lose with some patience i applied some super glue to the little pieces that could be reattached  but it wasn t feasible to do so with all the pieces  i ll have to see how to continue it fix those issues we still went ahead and finished assembling  good news is that the treadmill did turn on   that was one huge worry we had given all the hard work we put in to asssemble it the attached pictures are just some of the broken pieces it is a little noisy  but i think i could live with that now it s there  already set up  now i m afraid to use it because of the lingering fear it ll continue to break  kind of an unhappy customer here        
1684,2.0,                       difficult assembly   arrives with some screws in places that don t require and instructions say to take them out but they were screwed in incorrectly at the factory  sideways and bent at top  and i had to wait for my boyfriend to come over during a pandemic to help take them out  too expensive to be such a hassle with assembly and then you can t just plug in and use  requires signing up for trial period offer to start using      
1685,4.0,                       overall  i like this product  assembly was not hard if you follow the steps  took me about       hous   i can not rate performance yet since i ve just use it for   days but it feels very sturdy so far  my only complaint is that a broken piece of plastic with a screw that goes at the bottom of the belt platform came broken in the plastic bag that the treadmill came with   i noticed this as soon as a opened the box   i hope it does not compromise with the performance on my new treadmill in the future      
1686,5.0,                       i love this treadmill   this is the first one i have owned personally  and i could not be happier with my purchase   i have used it every day since the installer set it up   it s great to be able to use a different program  with a different trainer every day   i think it is well worth it   i would definitely buy this or an upgrade   i love my nordictrack      
1687,5.0,                       my husband and i both have wanted a treadmill for years  with four little kids  the gym is no longer convenient   we looked for a used one  but we were just a little wary  we finally ordered this  with the expert assembly added on after we made our first mistake   and we ve loved it  if we d have realized the quality we could get for such a good price  we d have bought it years ago      
1688,5.0,                       great treadmill for the cost  the delivery was easy and the driver put it into our garage  it is very heavy so i would suggest two strong people to carry it  overall  having it has motivated us to workout more because we literally don t have an excuse now  good purchase  i recommend      
1689,5.0,                       assembly was not as involved as anticipated  it was rather simple  the machine is heavy  well built with a sleek design also surprising is how quiet it runs  maybe i was just use to my old machine being loud  this motor purrs in comparison if you are looking for a quality treadmill with a good price this should work for you  i rarely exceed     mph so i can not attest to the running performance  but from what i have seen this should do well      
1690,5.0,                       the treadmill arrived very quickly and was easy to out together   you do need two people  one to hold pieces in place  i got it turned in and bypassed the ifit registration by holding down the ifit button for    seconds  it runs smoothly and looks like it will be a great addition for our light cardio  walking for my lovely bride and jogging for me       
1691,5.0,                       this was a very good find for me as i was looking for a good brand treadmill under my       budget  this treadmill is well made and sturdy  it took me and my husband about   hours to assemble  lots of screwing but follow the manual and its pretty smooth  needs atleast two people to assemble  we have been using it for walking and light running and its been good so far  i am happy with the purchase      
1692,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the treadmill that was sent out to us was defective  we were on the phone with the manufacturer for    minutes and now waiting on the company to ship us new console  very disappointed        
1693,1.0,                       awful customer experience  product delivered with broken console and it has take two months for it to ship      
1694,1.0,                       if i can rate this treadmill a zero i would    this product is not worth the price do not waste your money or time i bought this treadmill it was received in good packaging when we tried to put everything together none of the screws or pieces went on correctly completely horrible considering how much you re paying for this treadmill i had to call customer service and they were trying to get me new parts that would take up to   days for me to receive not even knowing if that s the part we need the representative also told me they do have a lot of problems with manufacturing for this treadmill this experience makes me not want to buy another treadmill to end up with the same problem     
1695,5.0,                       love    love    love    i enjoy ifit and all the choices i have in workouts  this treadmill is beautifully larger than the one it s replacing  it did take me approximately   hours to assemble  i m sooo happy i picked this one  arrived very well packed and no blemishes or damage from shipping whatsoever  super quality and price      
1696,5.0,                       i ve had this treadmill for few months now  and it is really great treadmill for home  you can t really tell difference from ones in gym  and it comes with many useful features      
1697,5.0,                       great quality for the price   i was able to use without paying for the subscription with the instructions another buyer posted  hold down the blue ifit button for    seconds      
1698,3.0,                       i love my treadmill and am so excited everyday to get my workout on  i am disappointed in the customer service of nordictrack  i am having a mechanical issue which causes my treadmill to not follow the trainer  it has been   weeks since the last contact with them  i am still waiting for a response      
1699,5.0,                       great treadmill and not that hard to assemble  part of the housing cover was cracked and the company sent me a new cover free of charge and now my treadmill is perfect  we use it everyday      
1700,1.0,                       i am changing my original review   i have had this for about    months  and suddenly the paint started coming off and the metal underneath is all rusty   contacted the firm because the product is still on warranty  but they will not take responsibility   i am regretting the savings i did initially   last nordictrack product i buy  after the horrible experience with the company   oh  they are willing to replace the motor cover  which is cracked   enjoy the pictures showing how my money fades like cheap paint      
1701,5.0,                       great buy   great price   smooth and quiet   easy to operate   did not need ifit as we have a walking app that we like already      
1702,5.0,                       we have loved the nordictrack  use it several times a day  has been a fantastic addition to our home gym  the set up took a bit of work  since then have has zero problems  has been a great product in the snow swept rock mountains  has allowed us to run and stay warm      
1703,4.0,                       i  was hesitant about buying this but decided to take a risk anyway  somebody assembled it for me and it was worth it since i would never have been able to  if you press down on the ifit button for    seconds  you don t have to activate the treadmill but i m sure you knew that from the other comments i can walk and run    mph without a problem  it is noisy when i run but it s not a huge problem since i listen to music  i wish there was a pause button instead of just slowing down   overall  i can walk and run on it just fine and it will come in handy during the winter when its too cold to go out      
1704,4.0,                       comfortable and sleek are my first impressions during the first week the flexselect cushioning makes my walks longer and pain free  after using the same treadmill for the last    years  this one is a big bump up one touch controls makes it easy to go straight to whatever mph i want to start at without having to scroll through each tenth of a mph i do have a couple of complaints  the first being the lack of blue tooth for using the speakers  with todays technology  who has wired speakers anymore  totally incompatible with my iphone xs  my second compaint is that there is no usb port to charge my iphone   bummer  or i would of given it a   star the instruction manual was easy to follow but was tedious  i thought i could put it together by myself but did need some help near the end  i liked how the parts were labeled with the step number rather than just a part number  this made it easy to tell which nuts and bolts go with each step so far  so good  i would recommend      
1705,4.0,                       comfortable and sleek are my first impressions during the first week the flexselect cushioning makes my walks longer and pain free  after using the same treadmill for the last    years  this one is a big bump up one touch controls makes it easy to go straight to whatever mph i want to start at without having to scroll through each tenth of a mph i do have a couple of complaints  the first being the lack of blue tooth for using the speakers  with todays technology  who has wired speakers anymore  totally incompatible with my iphone xs  my second compaint is that there is no usb port to charge my iphone   bummer  or i would of given it a   star the instruction manual was easy to follow but was tedious  i thought i could put it together by myself but did need some help near the end  i liked how the parts were labeled with the step number rather than just a part number  this made it easy to tell which nuts and bolts go with each step so far  so good  i would recommend      
1706,5.0,                       the unit itself was easy to put together   the motor hood was broken where the screws held it to the treadmill and customer service replaced it quickly   their response time takes a few days but they are very helpful when they respond      
1707,5.0,                       amazing  i don t know why i didn t get one last year  looking forward to get a second one  the ifit subscription is great      
1708,5.0,                       arrived on time delivery guys put it into the room i wanted a friend and myself assembled it in about an hour  works great have been using an hour or so a day for a month now and no problems and i weigh around         
1709,5.0,                       very reasonably priced and good quality for the price   assembling instructions are clear  though it is an involved process   easily foldable and overall a good size for running  i run     miles a day on it    because it has a smaller motor than the elite models  it can be loud at times  but keeping the belt lubricated helps  and the price is worth it   it s very comfortable to run on  and you can change how much give the running deck has with the shocks on the sides   overall  i would highly recommend      
1710,3.0,                       overall a quiet treadmill   very smooth and does give you a good workout   also has a good  shoulder  to place your ipad or fire to watch a video while working out   i wish the side arms were longer   you really need to be running jogging quite far from the display to prevent your feet from banging on to the front of the treadmill   big disadvantage if you want to hold on to the side arms while walking   not an issue if you are jogging or walking   wish they had a usb port for charging   how difficult is that   the     mm audio adapter never got used   i rather have in ear headphones while i am jogging      
1711,4.0,                       my nordictrack     treadmill came in tuesday  i was upset cause it got delayed   times when we were putting it together the treadmill  it was not easy the handles was not aligned with the metal stands to put the screws in only thing we are trying to figure out is way the speakers are not working we used a aux cord still the speakers are not working i have a samsung galaxy note    ultra if you can use your bluetooth it should work i did not pay     dollars for something  to not work easy to fold with no problems making sure everything worked it s for working put always wanted one you dont have to subscribe to ifit for your treadmill to work just hold the ifit for    seconds     
1712,5.0,                       we were hesitant to buy a treadmill in the first place  we worried we would use for a short while  and then it would collect dust  this has not been the case  however  my wife and i use the machine every day between the two of us now  the machine is solid  and the incline feature is probably the best part  we are not runners  so walking at an incline was a great way for us to burn more calories in a manageable way  i also have enjoyed the   free year of ifit  the guided workouts help me stay motivated to keep exercising  every month we ve seen progress in our fitness and now i am able to run     miles  which for me is a huge accomplishment  as long as the machine continues to hold up  we are very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to others      
1713,5.0,                       the treadmill does what is supposed to really well the assembly was fairly easy  two of us put it together in a couple of hours we have been using it for   months and it has been working great in terms of ifit  yes  they do push it on you  but  we got   year free and we did not have to enter any credit card information or anything  there is a manual mode that is easily accessible  so  you don t have to get ifit      
1714,2.0,                       the treadmill came with a cable loose internally  i would not have minded attempting to repair it but seems to have no way of opening the inside of the console  the treadmill in its  new  condition came with one of its core functions  the start stop buttons  to not work at all  the plate where these buttons are located is loose as well  leading me to find the disconnected ribbon cable that s meant to connect to the main console  it should ve at least given us a way to remove the back rather than to close off the whole thing  only way to stop it now is to remove the key      
1715,4.0,                       overall the product was easy to assemble   we bought this treadmill during covid and have used it     times a week   the button s are easy to navigate   i do wish the normal screen would give you the mile rate   i am sure if i connected it to ifit i might get this information overall good product for the price and we got it quickly and started using it right away      
1716,5.0,                       i m very happy with my new treadmill  i had a friend come over to help me put it together  will deff need two people to carry into house  it s very heavy  i find it pretty easy to roll to my tv and back to spot i keep it in  i also love ifit  makes the works outs more fun  and it s also hard to get bored with since there is so many works out to choose from  i definitely do not regret this purchase  it s also my very first treadmill i ve ever owned      
1717,4.0,                       replaced my old nordictrack with this version  after taking the advice of some of the amazon reviewers of this product  i was able to skip the ifit set up  so far this has been a good treadmill  a little wobbly at times but nothing severe  running on this treadmill is smooth  auto incline works great  my husband put this together and there was plenty of cussing on his part and frustration so beware when assembling it is not the easiest thing  overall i am happy with this purchase and would recommend     
1718,5.0,                       it s not easy to assemble but i did it alone and there are some heavier parts  it s not complicated just not easy to do without an extra set of hands  i love the treadmill though  i don t use any of the apps or workout videos but it s a really good treadmill  i run on it at an incline at about     mph and it does great      
1719,1.0,                       inverted incline function makes calories calc trash    makes it to lowest position  parallel to the ground  and   makes it steepest i contacted support and received an email requiring issue videos  videos sent and no response heartbeat sensor is not accurate either touching with one hand or two hands      
1720,2.0,                       i purchased the t   si last week  i returned it because i hear a knocking sound every belt revolution coming from the rear idler roller area  i called nordictrack and spoke to a service person who said it was probably the rear idler roller  he offered to send one out  i figure you shouldn t  have to fix a new treadmill out of the box  i returned it i got my replacement today  after putting it together  i hear the same noise in the same area is this inherent of the machine  anyone have any thoughts or experiences this problem   thanks      
1721,5.0,                       it s an amazing treadmill  gives you great workouts  you ll need the   years coverage offered   purchase because the belt has to be readjusted and lubed once a year  customer service could be better  bought it   years ago for less than       sad to see it now    k  way too expensive      
1722,5.0,                         shipping from amazon was smooth  packaging was good parts were all there   professional assmebly from amazon was seamless  he did an excellent job in about   hr    minutes   treadmill  works great   have used it for walking daily for over   year and still working wonderfully   loses points for being moderately loud even at low speeds   no bluetooth connectivity  loses another point for this this but this is a minor issue for me      
1723,1.0,                       if a company would make it the hardest to put together they would get the prize  no reason for so much assembling and pulling wires through  it is costing me another      to have a person come out from thumbtack to put it together for me  i am doing more and more shopping at best buy since they have the people to come and install etc things i buy      
1724,1.0,                       i spent about two hours working to get this into my house and partially assemble it  but it is impossible  in step    the screws they give you to put the hr bar on the hand rails will not go in   they cross thread and don t attach   that  and the plastic covering on the cord breaks off   if you re not paying for professional installation  don t bother      
1725,5.0,                       i am very pleased with this purchase  it was delivered promptly when it was promised  the packaging was very good and easily removed  assembly takes a while but instructions are clear  the machine functioned flawlessly the first time i turned it on thank you nordictrack     
1726,1.0,                       the incline motor broke within the first week of using it  had been used maybe   times before something snapped mid use  a burning smell filled the room and the belt dropped  it also arrived beat to hell with the box taped up and some of the plastic covers inside were cracked  sent it back  it s not worth dealing with a repair if it broke so soon      
1727,5.0,                       i ve had my nordic track treadmill for   months now   i ve been using it almost everyday   i enrolled in the ifit app and use their online videos trainers   i really enjoy using the treadmill and fulfilling my exercise goals      
1728,2.0,                       small things that will actually annoy you quickly  short people can t use the handle bar  or else you step on the plastic part and not the actual treadmill   the console portion is not super stable  there is no usb port  you can t type in a speed  just press       etc  or           
1729,5.0,                       since the gym is still closed  and i love running  this treadmill helps a lot   i ran outdoor and indoor   and easy to assemble  and saving a lot of spaces  i have a small exercise area  and i love that it tracks my progress every day good stuff   good products      
1730,4.0,                       i really want to like this treadmill  i got mad right after the install because it wanted me to suscribe online to a fitness membership  i looked online and found a video on how to bypass that feature  at low speeds  the motor doesn t run smooth  once you re above  mph  it gets better  other than that  it s a really good value when comparing it to other treadmills in the same price range  install is pretty straightforward  only issue there was mounting the bar that holds the monitor button board  you have to loose the  vertical legs  where it s screwed onto      
1731,4.0,                       the only negative comment i have on putting this treadmill together is that not all of the screw bolt holes were bored and had to do some of that myself  i am thankful for having access to those boring tools  otherwise it would have been a lot harder for install  otherwise the instructions were clear  all of the tools were included and i am very happy with the purchase      
1732,5.0,                       nice treadmill  this is my first treadmill so i wasn t expecting much but this treadmill is really nice for the price  goes to   mph      incline  it doesn t wobble when running  very sturdy and seems durable  nice size cubbyholes  has speakers  and tou do not have to sign up for ifit     you can bypass this lock         
1733,5.0,                       the belt is plenty big to walk or run  the power incline is great and there are several challenging workouts to keep me working hard  it said the unit was locked until i signed up for ifit but this isn t true all you have to do is hold the ifit button for    seconds and it unlocks the treadmill for regular use   i m   ft     lbs and there is no issue with the weight or stride length  all around a good buy     
1734,3.0,                       we are just days into using this  things are great  but the heart monitor is not working  we will have to put in for a repair replacement  otherwise it s going good  when this is fixed  we ll update our rating      
1735,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          really like this treadmill and it seems like a solid product thus far  however  be prepared for a lame experience if you need to have their support help you   reported an issue  see attatched video  and was told i d hear back from a tech in   to   business days   its been   more emails and over a month later with no further replies from them    the video shows what happens when you go past level   incline and come back down   would have given this a   if it wasn t for my support experience      
1736,5.0,                       awesome purchase for the price  delivered and assembled yesterday  enjoyed my first workout  easy instructions  we took the advice of another review and bypassed the ifit   hold down the ifit logo on the treadmill for    seconds and your treadmill will work   only complaint is the company sent the wrong screw for the grounding  overall great purchase      
1737,1.0,                       when it arrived on may     we assembled and started enjoying it  after not even    days it is acting  ifit screen is not loading anything and keeps on rotating icon with loading message  we press manual button and still it goes back to loading  i thought it may be wifi issue so i reset the wifi but same issue we can not use this trademil without the screen shows something i am in customer service line holding for    min     
1738,5.0,                       i bought this nordictrack treadmill on amazon  it s easy to assemble  instructions is very easy to follow  my family been using this treadmill daily  very satisfied with the quality of this nordictrack treadmill  highly recommend  definitely will buy more products in the future  thank you nordictrack for a such a good product      
1739,1.0,                       very unhappy with the service on this product including the assembly scheduling  it took over a month to have someone install the treadmill then the assemble tech let me that the item has cosmetic damage  i do appreciate that i was offered a full refund but not sure how i will be accommodated for time and the hassle for this  i would definitely express how unpleasant the experience has been      
1740,5.0,                       works great  and it s pretty quiet  folding it is initially awkward  but once you figure it out there isn t an issue  i also highly recommend having someone else assemble it      
1741,1.0,                       the product arrived in the box  but it is locked with an activation code necessary to start using  the code is on a card that is supposed to be with the owner s manual  but there was none in our package  there is no customer support  it is absolutely impossible to contact a human for resolution  all answers are computer generated and the phone number is endless hold  so it looks like it has to be returned  if you buy this be sure to check that the card with the code on it is included before assembling  this is beyond frustrating     
1742,5.0,                       my husband and i are in our   s  we used to go to the gym several times a week to use their treadmills but the pandemic put an end to that  we decided to purchase a nordictrack treadmill for personal use and we re glad we did our t series treadmill is quiet and consistent  it s big enough to feel sturdy and small enough to fit comfortably in our finished basement  we had it professionally installed and we use it daily  it s held up well so far and every indication is that it will continue to do so for many years to come      
1743,5.0,                       relatively quiet  i use this in my living room with no complaints from the upstairs neighbor  lots of settings  i am not a runner  so i mostly use this for long distance walking and medium speeds      
1744,5.0,                       i m really impressed it s a really good treadmill especially for the price pretty easy to put together instructions are really good one person can put it together except the folding feature requires two people the only thing i had difficulty with is belt tension try quarter turn at a time righty tighty lefty loosey     
1745,5.0,                       this is the first treadmill i have purchased in my life  i did a lot of research and looked at multiple products  i have heard good things about nordictrack and finally got this one  i can say i did not make any mistake in getting this treadmill  first of all the quality is excellent  no doubts about it  but more than that their customer service and their technical support is extraordinary  i have a little noise coming from the belt and they sent new parts and technician right away to fix it  we have about   people using this machine for an hour each everyday  and this machine holds up very well  love that i can connect my phone to it  sinple but great machine      
1746,1.0,                       my treadmill was delivered today at       am   right in the middle of the   am to    noon window   they brought the box inside  opened it and carried the pieces upstairs  they then left  informing us that someone else would come assemble it   my receipt from amazon states   treadmill assembly   service provided when your item ids delivered  i chatted with customer service   they had no idea why it was not assembled   but they will have an update for us in three or four business days   unacceptable      
1747,1.0,                       to be clear  this was not a treadmill i bought  it was a paperweight   if you buy the treadmill and an ifit membership  then you have a treadmill   it is the same if you bought a car  but you can t turn it on unless you goht a service like onstar   any comments that suggest you can start up or in anyway use the treadmill without first getting an ifit membership are incorrect   you have to register  give them your credit card  etc   also to be clear  you can t contact them with a question until you first register with ifit   i tried the phone number in the front of the nordictrack owners manual and was told by the computer that they didn t recognize my phone number as being registered with ifit so they couldn t take my call  both companies are owned by icon       
1748,1.0,                       worst fitness scheme nordic track has ever come up with  can t even use this pos without setting up an ifit account and entering a credit card that you then need to remember to cancel so you aren t charged a monthly fee  and then still have to download their crap app just to turn this turd on and activate the screen to do anything   if someone from nordic track knocked on my door right now i d knock them out and shove this treadmill right up their a   worst purchase ever  never buy another nordic track anything again     
1749,5.0,                       i was spektical because of the reviews and the low price for a treadmill   the treadmill is great quality   i am very happy with it and it works well the only thing i don t like is that it seems like the workouts that are specialized are limited if you don t get the ifit subscription   however  it s great and gets the job done   i m very happy with it my husband assembled it by himself in less than   hours   he said it wasn t bad to assemble at all      
1750,5.0,                       this inexpensive unit is perfect for my use  i do not take advantage of the training programs but i can manage my own settings as i please  it is a great unit for light duty  i walk an hour every day and i prefer inside air conditioning to the humidity and warm days of summer sue k     
1751,5.0,                       we love this treadmill  my    yr old daughter and i assembled this together  it was quite a task but overall  it was doable  this treadmill is very sturdy and easy to use  we use it everyday and i believe it s going to last a very long time  i d definitely recommend this treadmill  the price is excellent and the quality is superb  i m very happy with my purchase  tip  keep the allen wrench that goes with it so you can make adjustments to the belt later on      
1752,1.0,                       i received this with a dent and the power cord damaged exposing the bare copper wires inside  this is all straight out of the box  i don t know it this was a returned product from somewhere but i am  not taking any chances  i am returning this  it is disappointing and complete waste of time      
1753,2.0,                       the product is so heavy  i was not expecting that  i was not even able to move it from one room to another  not easy to assemble   it s not suitable for single woman in apartments  i didn t try it therefore was not able to provide my feedback on the other points  the good point is that it has been delivered on time that s why i m adding another star     
1754,4.0,                       purchased this due to covid    and wanting to continue walking during the colder weather  great machine  very quiet and easy to usethank you to all who mentioned how to disable the ifit setup  easily done and was working out ten minutes after assembly      
1755,5.0,                       this is an excellent and sturdy treadmill  and it looks great    i love it so far  and you don t actually have to register for the ifit  not even to activate warranty   if you have trouble with anything   call customer service and they will help you   my only complaint is customer service is a long wait   select for them to call you back   otherwise     out of    for sure   if you want a great home treadmill   i recommend this one   if you go lower price you will more than likely regret it      
1756,1.0,                       i would not use ifit if it was free most likely   i cannot recommend a product that forces me to activate my product with a  rd party company i want nothing to do with   moreover the fact that i was required to enroll in a program that required me to give my credit card information to   unhappy     
1757,5.0,                       we luv our treadmill    however  we did end up getting the  professional assembly  the next day   they were great  the assemblers used power tools which the manual said not to    but they assured us they have been doing it for so long they know the exact pressure to put in the bolts   so far so good    but if we had used power tools we might not have had the need for help         
1758,5.0,                       we purchased the nordictrak treadmill with ifit and home assembly   the assembly was done quickly and well  and i have been using the treadmill virtually every day since   i love the programmed training sessions   i m    years old and just starting to run  so have been alternating between beginner running sessions and hiking trekking sessions   the treadmill automatically adjusts speed and incline throughout each training session   i actually look forward to working out each day   i m very happy that i made this purchase      
1759,2.0,                       way too many parts and little pieces for  assemble at home   plus they sent parts that didn t fit together properly and sent the wrong part altogether to be able to store fold the treadmill or the screws already attached are too big      
1760,2.0,                       i needed a treadmill  per my doctor  to walk   ergo  i found this and it looked reasonable   i m not running  i m not doing any spiffy workout  i just need to walk but to activate this thing  you have to not only go to a website  but enrol in their  ifit  program  of course  it must have a credit card  and install an app  of course  you must give height  weight  age and sex  just so i can take a walk if i buy another treadmill  it won t be this brand      
1761,4.0,                       ok but the handles are slightly too short  the front plastic piece that houses the motor protrudes too far so you occasionally tap it with the tip of your sneaker  and you can t enter your weight for more accurate counting of calories burned  good for the price      
1762,5.0,                       its amazing i love it  only downside was it took me over an hours to assemble other than that i love it  i am     pounds   foot     disabled vet  and if i cant run a whole lot who cares at least i am on the damn thing trying  that s what it s all about     
1763,4.0,                       overall i m really happy with the quality of this treadmill  my husband is over  ft tall and has a long stride and had no trouble walking on this model  it s smooth and pretty quiet  it does not feel or look cheap like some affordable treadmills  and it arrived earlier than expected   a few minor issues were that it was very heavy and took me and my husband to lift the box  it took my husband about   hours to put together and it was not easy  missing a small cosmetic part but amazon gave me a partial refund if i would keep it which i was fine with  plastic protective lining separated  most likely from being in a hot warehouse and truck  and it left some residue on the screen      
1764,5.0,                       easy to ensamble  took my husband and i less than a hour to do it  very sturdy machine my husband and  i like to power walk and feel very comfortable  my son is     and he said running on this machine feels good  th app is awesome  we all have use it every day since the day it was delivered  overall we think this is a great machine for a home gym      
1765,5.0,                       great treadmill  i use this several times a week  i got this when it was on sale from amazon  it was easy to put together and the directions were very clear and understanding  treadmill is a lot bigger than i expected but for the price it is well built and has many functions and power incline      
1766,5.0,                       i searched a long time for the right treadmill for me  and this was it   the features will give me room to improve my workout over time as well as allow others a bit more fit than me to get the workout they need as well   the unit is quiet  display and controls easy to use and the motor one of the strongest for this class of treadmill   i have used the machine every day for the past   weeks now and each day i am happier with my decision      
1767,2.0,                       my headline says it all  the packet of parts had no correlation to the instructions  terrible  shame on nordictrac      
1768,5.0,                       i bought this to maintain my physical activity as we enter into winter  rain and dark  season in oregon  i was willing to spend more money for the quality and maintenance support from nordic track  my husband and i built it and stumbled on a few steps at first and were able to get it sorted after pausing and returning  you do not need to sign up for the ifit account  check out youtube for steps to bypass this friction  i use the treadmill everyday and love it  it is not small by any means  i traded our living room couch for this product and i have absolutely no regrets  especially i will not be going into the office or to a gym for another year or so      
1769,5.0,                       this is a heavy duty treadmill compared to those used ones on fb   if you hold the ifit button for    seconds you can bypass the ifit setup and exercise right away   the only other thing is when running the wire up the right rail you will need the plug inside the pole to push it down once hooked up      
1770,5.0,                       i am impressed with all elements of this treadmill purchase   quality of the machine  features and functionality  price  and affordable white glove delivery   i strongly recommend the affordable optional  room of your selection delivery  as the box is extremely heavy even for two adults   assembly takes a little time  but is easily self performed   this is a great value and i strongly recommend it      
1771,5.0,                       my husband and i needed to get exercise indoors  we were skeptical of buying a treadmill again  this one comes with a screen and ifit workouts with trainers  we went on    grand canyon hikes  hikes in costa rica and the alps and took tours of many cities  i am convinced that this machine saved my sanity  it is easy to use  quiet and sturdy  i use it     times a day and do not get bored         
1772,3.0,                       over all a nice treadmill  easy to fold up but not as easy to move back toward a wall even with the wheels   if you dont join ifit and just do manual sessions you can t save your statistics   i usually read on my tablet however there is no usb hub to keep it charged  fairly large can t move it to another room unless you take it apart      
1773,4.0,                       really like the ability to gold it up to save space  we had to get professional assembly  it still took   people     hours to assemble it  very easy to get a walk in  reai or shine      
1774,5.0,                       cannot operate until you log in with ifit com  the website is extremely unfriendly  tried to register my treadmill for the warranty  but i needed an invitation code to register  never received the code when i purchased the treadmill  had to call the customer service phone number  line was busy and left number for call back   was called in in approx   hours  then placed on hold again for approx    minutes   i finally talked with a customer service rep  phyliss   she was extremely helpful and had my treadmill up and running within five minutes and she then register my treadmill for me  customer service is hard to reach  but when you do they are very helpful   can t say enough about phyliss      
1775,5.0,                       fantastic treadmill  more than my husband and i wanted to pay but well worth it  he did the assembly and said it took a while considering he was one person doing it all  but the instructions were straightforward  it was also easy to move on the wheels but it can be heavy  and it s important to be careful  we live in an apartment and everything was closed for covid  and we don t live in a safe area to just go out and run around so it was a great investment  has    speed and incline levels and also programmed workouts to try      
1776,5.0,                       took some time to put together but for the price point it is a great value and works great   the only thing i would include is how to activate it   i had to call in to ask   me and my wife are bigger people and it is heavy duty enough   i would suggest a treadmill mat so it doesn t wreck your hardwood or laminate      
1777,1.0,                       extorting my credit card info to even be able to use my own property   filth nb   the bypasses for avoiding installing ifit no longer work not the    second hold not the    second hold shame on you  nordictrack      
1778,4.0,                       love this treadmill  great machine for the price  it stays quiet while i am running at speeds usually around  mph  and is overall a solid way to get a run and workout in  a bit disappointed the speakers are aux in only and no bluetooth and not very loud  but i just use other speakers in my workout room the track is a great width and length is good too  at times i wish it was a bit longer but it s much better than other options it s easy to fold but i never really do it  assembly was ok   not hard but takes a bit of time      
1779,1.0,                       to start   package came in with missing parts  forces you to download their app to activate your treadmill to get you to pay for their monthly subscription  incline and belt won t even move and when you try to call them for support  it hangs up on you i dont know where all these good reviews are coming from   but it shouldnt be this difficult to set up a treadmill  plug it in and go      
1780,4.0,                       nice unit took a little while to install but got it done   i did not like having to give my credit card number to activate the ifit to enable the unit to work  don t believe the dot that follows you around the track is     mile which i would prefer and it doesn t tell what speed per mile you are exercising at a particular pace as my older nordictrack had which is important to me  other than that it is a nice unit      
1781,5.0,                       this treadmill works exactly as i was hoping  i have copd and need to do a non stressful workout so being able to set it to different speeds and grades at the push of a button is awesome  the assembly was a little tough for me to do myself due to lifting and breathing issues  took about   hours to assemble because of breaks in between  i would recommend having someone strong and mechanically inclined to put it together  it is well built for the long haul and that being said its really heavy  i have been using it everyday for the last   weeks or so and am glad i decided on a quality machine      
1782,5.0,                       great treadmill especially for the price  great for running and walking  took about   hours to put together so would suggest paying for someone to assemble for the       i held the ifit button down for   seconds like another reviewer recommended and it worked  no need to buy ifit      
1783,4.0,                       treadmill is perfect for our needs and budget  unfortunately  the first treadmill we ordered and it s replacement were damaged  amazon picked up the first one and gave us a reduction for the second one  screw holes on the front panel are broken   i ve corresponded with nordictrack through email  they are sending a is new cover you do not have to register with ifit to start the treadmill  to unlock the treadmill  press  and hold down the ifit button on the console      
1784,5.0,                       i am really impressed with the ability to put the treadmill together  one of the parts was defective and customer service was very accommodating by diagnosing the problem through a remote app  and then ordering new parts  parts were delayed due to covid     but once received the treadmill came together quickly   i would advise that you watch videos ahead of assembly to make sure you have the right tools      
1785,4.0,                       we live in arizona  where it s often too hot to go for a nice long walk  this nordic track is perfect for us  as we can jump on and walk for as long as we want at any time of day  we re not dedicated athletes   this is a great treadmill for simply walking  with sufficient variety of speeds and inclines to keep us happy  the only drawback has been a constant sprinkling of tiny black bits  apparently from the walking belt  that shower the mat at the end of the device  we checked the alignment and then spoke with customer service  who said the problem should clear itself up  we hope so  and meanwhile  we very much enjoy the treadmill and are glad to have made the purchase      
1786,5.0,                       my whole family is using our new nordictrack treadmill and we love it   the assembly was very clearly laid out and my son put it together in just a couple of hours   we had no issues with the parts and everything was labeled very nicely   great product and great price   we love it      
1787,5.0,                       love this treadmill  it s everything i wanted  don t waste your money an upgraded screen   i just use my fire tablet and it s perfect      
1788,1.0,                       very junk product  the instruction manual is very unprofessional  you do n t want to install it smoothly  and the product cannot be activated successfully after purchase  the activated website cannot be opened now  this is a very junk product  amazon s most junk products     
1789,5.0,                       i ve had this treadmill for almost a year and it s been fantastic   yes the ifit registration is bs but just cancel after signing up and you re done   it has definitely been worth the investment      
1790,5.0,                       takes some effort to assemble  when installing the connecting piece between the handrails it takes some force to pull together while attaching  so you will need help here  to bypass ifit sign up hold down the ifit icon for    seconds to bypass this feature      
1791,5.0,                       the purchase and warranty protection plan were easy   the delivery was well coordinated and treadmill arrived in one box on the doorstep assembly was remarkably easy and only took about an hour   the warranty paperwork arrived about two weeks later   the treadmill floormat is not included in the sale  so if you have tile or hardwood be sure to purchase one all members of our family capable of using the treadmill do in fact use it and it has been a blessing to have access to it whenever we want  instead of relying on a gym great piece of health equipment      
1792,1.0,                       i received a damaged product   i sent multiple pictures directly to the customer care team and i got zero response   i received confirmation that they received my email  but they couldn t even bother to respond   i was simply going to ask that the damaged piece be replaced   would not recommend      
1793,5.0,                       really like it a lot heavy duty   i m      no issues   but hate the ifit sign up bypass by downloading app from your app store i use google play  then registration to treadmill costs nothing it works great     
1794,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill when i started working from home and it has been one of the best purchases i have made  i use it everyday during my lunch break and several times a week after work  i am close to    years old and the lower impact surface has been better for my knees  i can adjust the incline for more variety in my workouts  i highly recommend this treadmill      
1795,3.0,                       the previous nordic track i owned seemed better made  this unit  though competing with several companies  appears to be a scale down model  this system is not easily moved with your home as it has no casters  previously had   small things such as cooling fans eliminated on this model assembly instructions were poorly written  low hanging fruit to improve  seems to be more emphasis on the subscriptions to online trainer than providing quality product      
1796,5.0,                       i have used it almost everyday for speed walking     mph down to       used incline upto to       i have had it a couple of months works great  however don t like ifit you don t have to buy it and the speaker whoch could easily work with the blue tooth in your phone doesn t   not a deal breaker treadmill is good quality and sturdy      
1797,1.0,                       before using this machine you have to install and activate the ifit  work out program in order to get it running so the program asked for the credit card number and needed to sign up  i was so wondering why they asked for the credit card information  i called the product company  he said  don t worry about  you won t get charged for that  but today i got charged         be careful  the ifit does not work  we never use one  if i were you  i would go to buy another company machine as well     
1798,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill that we got for a great price    i love that you can walk different places with the video or just use a track i have recommended this to my friends and family      
1799,5.0,                       i wanted the best treadmill for my money   i read countless reviews on many treadmills   hesitated on this due to the number of customers reviews   even though it had close to      positive reviews   decided to purchase   best decision ever   delivered as promised   i set it up myself and was surprised how easy it was   directions were spot on   the ifit was a breeze  did not require my credit card   guess the old adage is true  cannot please      as     will write a bad review just cause they can   seems the truth does not factor into a review      
1800,5.0,                       fantastic product   great value and functionality   assembly was straight forward with good instructions   all the benefits of a commercial treadmill at a fraction of the price   i am surprised at how quiet it is as well   i have used it regularly for a month and not one problem   the ifit videos are wonderful and have every conceivable workout  with around the world locations   i now have a gym in my home   i highly recommend the nordic track      
1801,3.0,                       we purchased the product and our son had to put it together  after several rounds of plastic parts not aligning together  we were frustrated   my son did some minor modifications and worked around some of the plastic parts that broke by the screw inserts    after all of that  we turned it on and have been having a great workout ever since   product works great  low sounds for a quite area  i like this product overall and it serves its purpose      
1802,5.0,                       absolutely one of the best purchases i have ever made  with the current environment i feel safer working out at home and this was an excellent addition to my home gym  in addition to the awesome ifit classes  amazon hosts live courses you can complete with different trainers while incorporating your treadmill nordictrack is one of the superior brands of treadmills that truly stand the test of time  my mother has had hers for years which is what encouraged me to commit to this brand  i ll never look back      
1803,4.0,                       the treadmill is great for the price  it doesn t have a bunch of high tech elements to it  but i didn t want those anyway  this is a relatively basic machine for those who want that  my only complaint at this point is that the front of it seems to be a bit elevated  even with the incline at     so if i run past a certain mph  i almost immediately get shin splints  my boyfriend has experienced the same thing  so we aren t able to full out run  but we are able to walk and jog just fine  overall  a very good treadmill      
1804,1.0,                       the packaging tells you that you must register your product to use it  this is a lie designed to get you to pay a monthly rent on a product you already paid close to  k for      
1805,5.0,                       we have been using this for over a month now with no problems  the packaging was in bad shape upon arrival but nothing inside was broken  setup was fairly simple but it does take two people at times   although i didn t time it it probably took about an hour  both my wife and i have been using it along with kids and grandkids when they visit      
1806,5.0,                       great treadmill   very heavy to get upstairs but after that it was easy to put together and have enjoyed the large screen for ifit  would be nice to have the power switch in a more convenient location as you have to unfold it and reach behind the motor      
1807,2.0,                       the delivery man didn t have any help  so i had to get my husband to assist him this thing is horrible to put together  the screws didn t feel like the right size and half the time i was worried i was stripping them  the code that came with the treadmill for the   month trial is invalid for ifit  i m a little frustrated but it seems to work so far      
1808,3.0,                       this thing took    hours to put together  recommend paying for someone to do that if you do buy as it took   of us   hours to put together   the wheel was broken  the screen film didn t come off right so now all the film is left hanging as well   the ifit registration is also a rip off  just hold the button for    seconds and you will be able to use the machine without registering or giving your credit card and personal info      
1809,4.0,                       everything was working fine i wish i can only deduct a half point  since the issue was from the shipping company they dropped the box from the truck that caused the belt s head cover to cracked i was thinking of returning it  but it didnt damaged the motor  as far as i can tell   and it s running just fine maybe the seller can get a discount from the shipping company for not being careful on the item i will add some photos once i figured out how      
1810,4.0,                       this is a great machine for getting in some cardio when you can t go out  it was super easy for two people to assemble  and once it s up  you re ready to go in no time  the ifit app that s associated with the machine is great  it s easy to set up and use  and the free trial period doesn t require you to submit any payment information  so you aren t automatically locked in at the end of the trial  that said  i enjoyed the app so much that i didn t hesitate to purchase a membership long story short  the machine is great in and of itself  but combining it with the ifit app makes my workouts enjoyable and the time pass quickly  i definitely recommend it      
1811,5.0,                       the treadmill is rugged and sturdy  we use it for brisk walking for several hours most days  after   months  we ve had no problems and continue to enjoy using it  we use this system in manual mode and have not tried to use the sophisticated ifit workout features yet  assembly of this unit was not complicated and the instructions were clear and complete  it took about an hour for a mechanically inclined person  me  to do      
1812,5.0,                       this treadmill is perfect   i love that it folds up because i have limited space to store it in  assembly was very easy and it took my husband and i no time to put it together  the ifit app is amazing paired with this treadmill  i have been using this for a couple of months and have nothing bad to say about it      
1813,5.0,                       this is one of best treadmills  it is very sturdy and well made  you can bypass the ifit  no need to pay for the program  i use the treadmill with out it  the incline works well  and it is a space saver  it and can be easily folded  it has small wheels to allow moving it  i am so happy we purchased it  i would recommend this treadmill      
1814,5.0,                       i purchased this treadmill in august       it is a great product and it was easy to install it too  i have been using it consistently and had no issues so far  it does have a great connectivity with ifit   i love the workouts with ifit and built in tablet works really well   i would recommend this product to others      
1815,5.0,                       it was delivered and set up by amazon  the set up was just great and the machine was working the way i wanted it to  i especially like the shock absorbers as i am a senior  but it seems a lot like walking outside and you can set it up for whatever program is best for you  you can t ask for anything more in a treadmill this is lovely good quality      
1816,4.0,                       ordered this for getting into daily walking and this treadmill is great  the integrated ifit is a nice feature as well since it makes working out much more enjoyable and interesting   this isn t the top of the line machine by any means  but for someone getting back into walking and light running this certainly is a solid machine  i use it primarily for walking and hiking  through ifit  and put over     miles on it in the first two months  assembly wasn t too difficult  however you definitely need to use the included instructions instead of trying to download the manual as i tried to do since there is a slight difference in parts  also  having another person to help with moving the machine during assembly is recommended  overall  i would purchase this machine again      
1817,4.0,                       i have ifit already and like nordic track products it is a bit noisy but it seems to work well one of the cup holders didn t have a hole drilled but i think i can fix that   i hope to get years of good use from it  takes a lot of patience to assemble      
1818,4.0,                       the cancer warning is unclear  or maybe i need to do more research  other than that it works great  we paid for someone to install it  if you have oddly curved stairs the box is is awkward  definitely need help getting upstairs as installer is not allowed to lift  overall i am happy with my product      
1819,5.0,                       i have only been using this machine for a couple of weeks but i absolutely love it   the interactive screen and ifit training is awesome   i love how it automatically adjusts to the hills as you walk   i have done workouts in bora bora  alaska  hawaii and scotland so far  i really enjoyed the views and the history lessons that graham mc tavish give you while hiking in the scottish highlands   i honestly look forward to going on a new adventure everyday      
1820,5.0,                       i am a heavier guy and have knee problems from sports so running outside is a problem  i use this treadmill every day and my knees do not hurt even when i turn it up high and sprint  i appreciate the cushion the treadmill provides and that it folds up should i need the extra space      
1821,1.0,                            treadmill came broken  with a crack in the casing      treadmill popped a circuit  nd time using it  then belt was malfunctioning  attempted to contact nordictrack    different ways email   no response  phone  on hold way too long  and chat  they refused to send technician to fix the problem stating i needed to have a dedicated circuit to run treadmill   did not need for my old treadmilll  never had a problem   i sent them their own info from the user manual that my amps on the circuit were sufficient to run treadmill and low power devices  agent told me to hire a electrician and ended chat  i paid for extended warranty and maintenance program  still refused to send agent  would not buy again  ever form this company    stars       
1822,3.0,                       my treadmill broke after only a few days   i was able to reach cust svc after many tries   they facetimed the motor and sent me a replacement part   after      business days  i received the part and installed it  but this didn t fix the fact that the belt wouldn t run and the incline went up and down continuously and on its own   i have been on hold with customer service multiple times for over    each and have yet to talk to a human   i am currently awaiting amazon s intervention   in the end  i have had the treadmill since july but have only been able to use it for     weeks      
1823,4.0,                       i love my nordictrack so far   the ifit app is awesome along with it  i use it almost daily no hiccups as of yet   fingers crossed  easy to use  easy to setup as well   only cons i have with it is  during assembly the panel did not fit properly  it took   of us to literally push the bars together to get the screws in it didnt have a perfect fit  kind of disappointed about that  but otherwise so far so good  if anything changes i ll be sure to update       
1824,4.0,                       just put it together  it took about four hours  including unpacking   i just want to thank the amazon reviewer who gave the instructions on how to get around the ifit scam  i did as instructed and held the ifit button for thirty seconds it worked perfectly  thanks again     
1825,1.0,                       i ve had this for   months and has never worked correctly  since day one the incline doesn t work  i m on my  th incline motor and  nd control board  the first   motors and one control board icon had me install  didn t work  finally they sent a tech to install  rd motor still didn t work  sent  th motor and a tech  also replaced wiring harness and sensors  still won t work  now theyre sending  rd control board  customer service has been very nice no complaints there except usually   hour hold time  but come on   months and a bunch of parts  it would be cheaper to give me a new one  love the ifit though      
1826,5.0,                       it was probably easy to assemble for the guy i hired to do it         my husband and i are retirees and it was too much for us     years ago  maybe but the gentleman did a professional job of assembling and the treadmill is just what i wanted      
1827,2.0,                       it took two weeks for delivery  then required asembly which was as expected  i went to finally turn the treadmill on and was greeted with  go to ifit to activate  i went to the site and discovered they wanted a credit card in order to activate  after giving them all the information including my credit card  they indicated that my unit was activated  i went to my unit and i get the same message  no help on the chat site  in fact they just disconnected me  twice  there telephone is only available at certain hours  so  here i sit hoping some day to be able to use the treadmill      
1828,5.0,                       i watched a couple of youtube video clips for assembly before i actually received the item  it helped me a lot  i followed the install manual step by step carefully and eventually finished it up  even though it took more than an hour  it gave me a piece of proud  update  changing from   stars to    it s been almost   weeks and working great just for walk or run  i don t use ifit nor integrated speaker at all      
1829,3.0,                       i do love this machine dont get me wrong    but    it sucks that it has no fan or bluetooth connection  at the end i bought a fan and added it  then costco had the same size screen   plus better motor     speeds with bluetooth and a fan for          at that point i realized this was not a great purchase at          
1830,4.0,                       obviously  it s heavy  make sure to know exactly where to place it before assembly  it serves it purpose      
1831,1.0,                       we can t get it to come on  why do we need to get it activated  it s bought and paid for and now we can t sign in  basically we can t use it  can t get customer support  will never buy anordic track product again      
1832,5.0,                       very satisfied with purchase  have lost    pounds on it  been using it  x week for past three months  got it new for       love the wide     running track  comfortable and easy on the joints  can hook treadmill s speakers up to external devices  tv  phone  etc  with aux cable for audio  bypassed ifit by long pressing the ifit button  customer support was quick to respond to a minor issue  assembly not that difficult if you can put together ikea furniture      
1833,5.0,                       this nordictrack treadmill is comfortable to walk on  the operation is quiet  and allows me to get in my daily walking in the comfort of my own home  which is vitally important in the age of corona     using this treadmill     times a week has helped me in many ways   i don t have as many aches and pains  i feel more energetic and i hope it is improving my heart health   it is a great value for the price      
1834,2.0,                       the delivery was great  after waiting for the worker to show up for hours  he arrived at  pm  then   min into the assembly he stated that the treadmill was broken   he couldn t do anything and left  after calling amazon they stated that it would be a week until they could have someone come out to repack   haul away the broken unit  other than that  it looks like a great in home treadmill  too bad it didn t work      
1835,5.0,                       went together fairly easily with the help of my    year old son  i love the i fit workouts  i had no problem redeeming the free year of i fit   the interval training is pretty cool  i am pleased with this purchase and just recommended it to my best friend      
1836,1.0,                       i got it put together and activated  a smart phone or tablet with bluetooth is the only way to activate it     then  i turned the power off to it and went to bed   i turned the power back on and tried to use it in the morning  and it won t respond  i have contacted ifit  and nordictrack  but nothing is working   why spend hundreds of dollars on something that can never be unplugged  needs a paid membership to activate  and has zero customer support  with all of that going on now  what are the chances of this machine working without previously noted paid membership      
1837,5.0,                       i bought this product to help me lose weight and i love it   we elected to set it up ourselves which took about an hour and wasn t too bad but with hindsight would probably have  paid to have them do it to save the stress   however  this is by far the best treadmill i have ever had   you can bypass the ifit if you want to but i chose to do it and it is the greatest   i can choose any program and never do the same work out twice   i love boot camps so i can work on it and off it   there r great trainers and the treadmill is quiet and performs well   would definitely recommend this and the seller got it to us on time as promised      
1838,1.0,                       as horrible luck would have it  i working out on the treadmill the saturday before the return window ended   belt and machine wouldn t work   called amazon and they suggested talking to nordictrack the next day and assess whether to return on monday   machine worked sunday and monday  so i didn t return  now two days after the return window i just worked out  and it stopped working in the midst of my workout   now i have a new machine  supposedly   do i amazon   that i have to use the warranty on   should have bought one used   my expectations would have been lower   buyer beware      
1839,5.0,                       so far  very satisfied with the product first of all  i love the size  it s not too big bulky nor too small compact  it was just the right size for me and our family secondly  it is very easy to control  it s really simple and easy to adjust speed  incline  workout programs  and more also  i love the cushioning of this treadmill  it surely makes my feet less tired afterwards i highly recommend this product to others      
1840,4.0,                       i love this treadmill  it s perfect for intermediate runners looking for a convenient way to get a great at home workout  having this treadmill has really been a game changer for me in terms of getting in my miles with two young kids at home  only reason for the four star rating is because the first treadmill that was delivered had a bent frame  but amazon instantly sent a new treadmill  i recommend getting the professional assembly   it worked out great for us and the tech had it put together in under an hour      
1841,1.0,                       i could not get the treadmill started until i read the very helpful review about how to get around the ifit requirement  i went through the ifit registration  even entered my credit card info  etc  i registered with nordic track separately  i tried to call them  yes  on friday when the treadmill arrived  but ifit is closed the entire weekend   regardless  may not have been easy to get it going  and then  i read the magic review  hold down the ifit symbol on the machine for    seconds  and the machine starts i would not wanted that ifit membership anyway  perhaps that is why they want to force you into it  without even informing you  as the other reviewer said  that should be illegal i will now use the machine  but start off with a bad taste in the mouth about nordic track      
1842,5.0,                       it s a great and solid piece of equipment  easy to fold  assembly was a little tedious for   person  there s a couple steps where a second person is a good idea  i use it   times a week after my weight routine  display and buttons are very easy to use  the price was very reasonable  a lot of bang for the buck  highly recommend      
1843,5.0,                       ordered this due to the shelter in home because of covid      was mostly easy to put together by myself   not thrilled that you have to download the ifit app to unlock the consul   i like that you can fold it up so it doesn t take up as much room   comes in a box much smaller than i expeceted   it s heavy   just over     lbs   my daughter and i have already used it several times since i put it together   i definately recommend this treadmill      
1844,1.0,                       i don t want ifit and i can t get the machine to operate   i m waiting for customer service for a while       
1845,5.0,                       we bought this a few weeks before the stay at home orders due to the coronavirus and i was so thankful that we did because it s saving our sanity and keeping the whole family active  we love how we can switch from person to person and log our weekly miles and calories burned and just how easy it is overall to use  the machine is quiet enough that my wife can run in the living room and i can t hear much at all upstairs in the bedroom  the workouts make our time spent on the treadmill exciting and we love logging in and getting to  run  on the beach or hike or run through the city  one of the best investments we ve ever made      
1846,5.0,                       wanted a smaller unit for space  but wanted all the great things about nordictrack incline treadmill at a great price   and this is it  just love it and want to use it  especially the ifit trainers   so amazing and knowledgeable thank you     
1847,3.0,                       thank goodness for amazon s support team  they were they only helpful group in this process  i received the treadmill in about    days  i was not able to use it for four months due to it not shipping with all of the parts required for assembly  icon was beyond useless and not helpful in the slightest bit  it took at least    phone calls and    follow up emails and a ton of patience to receive the parts needed to finally use the machine  once finally assembled  it works fine  great machine for the price  but i would strongly consider ordering from a different manufacturer to specifically avoid dealing with icon again      
1848,2.0,                       we really like this treadmill  however  we had issues w  the motherboard and the motor within   months  it has taken   months to get feedback from the company  due to covid   however  the customer service  inadequate follow up  nonresponse to email inquiries and significant delays in sending parts has been terrible  they have not provided in home service for the machine and is supposed to be sending parts for us to fix  within   months after receiving   not great at all      
1849,5.0,                       i searched long and hard for the perfect treadmill for me and ended up going with this one  along with regular exercise  i am training for a     mile relay and with children not in school i didn t have spare time to leave my home for a run regularly  shipping was on time  putting this together was a   man job  i needed my husbands muscle  and the instructions were pretty simple  operating this machine is a breeze too i loved the preview you get with ifit too  you do not have to add your payment information when getting the free trial      
1850,5.0,                       looking for the various treadmill and finally land with this one i am very happy with this  me and my daughter running daily     miles each and still good  there is nothing to report easy assemble but the weight is too much even two people cannot able to lift  we need at least   people to lift after you assembled the unit   they can provide some kind of wheel to move the treadmill if we want to move from one room to another room      
1851,4.0,                       i really like the product  i had to assemble it myself so it took my about   hours but everything works great on it and i use the membership workout videos and i like it a lot  only issue is that i am about    lbs so the belt does slip once in a while when i run but it s not very often and not enough to bother me  just breaks my rhythm for a split sec  other than that it works great      
1852,5.0,                       excellent treadmill  it so hard to find a treadmill that has powered incline and a decent belt width and length  it was fairly simple to put together  the only hard part was moving the darn thing to it s intended spot  the item description says it weighs     lbs but it felt much heavier than that  it took   guys to move it up the stairs      
1853,5.0,                       i really like this treadmill  although i was able to assemble it myself it did take some time to put together  i am glad i got the larger touch screen as it helps when doing the ifit workouts  speaking of ifit  be careful  the enclosed year membership is supposed to be a family membership  mine showed up on my machine as a single  i spent    minutes on hold waiting for ifit customer service  once i was able to speak to someone they changed it to a family membership  not sure if this was truly a mistake or not but they took care of it and away we go      
1854,3.0,                       when putting the unit together the part that would hold the walking unit up did not work   i have   open orders for that as well as after not even a month of use the treadmill makes a squeaking noise while walking running on it   no one has replied to my requests      
1855,5.0,                       easy to assemble  and is a great value treadmill  i did what many other reviewers did and bypassed the ifit thing  just held the button until it beeped and went away  note  you need to make sure the emergency switch is attached to the treadmill      
1856,1.0,                       beyond disappointed  this threadmill has dents and missing parts  couldn t get any support from amazon or nordictrack  the membership is a joke  i was supposed to have   year paid membership and that s no where to be found  i went to ifit activate and had to enter my card number and activate manually  complete nightmare and a naightmare to send it back      
1857,5.0,                       bought the treadmill durring the covid crisis for a little exercise  it worked out very well  skeptical about the size but it actually folds up very nicely  the shock holds very well and comes down slowly on it s own  speeds and incline are easy to use  no complaints      
1858,3.0,                       i love nordic track  however this experience hasn t been the greatest  the delivery was awful  the box came completely destroyed off of the truck and the delivery people stated it was a basic drop off and tried to leave in the middle of the road   instead of on my porch the instructions were not complete and thank goodness my husband knew how to do electrical work because the instructions were not clear  for the price of this item  i expected better      
1859,1.0,                       assemble information booklet totally trash  don t take serious booklet  check the youtube for it  i spent my   hour for it  after that still i couldn t put dashboard  because i tightened metal bars  booklet didn t give me attention for that  i half removed bars   i putted dashboard after that i tightened the bars update  i returned my treadmill  because dashboard part is not fit for each other  i sent email to customer service  they didn t respond me back  it s useless treadmill  also customer service useless too      
1860,4.0,                       i ve bought this treadmill around the end of november      and have used it most days  both running and walking  at all levels and it has been running very smoothly so far   of course  i weigh     pounds  so someone who weighs more may have a different experience   i wish the arms were longer and the incline higher but for the home and price they re both good   unfortunately  amazon only sent one person to deliver it  which was a problem and they guy  without asking me first  grabbed my neighbor to come into my house to help   it was not his fault that he didn t have another person  but this was very uncomfortable for me and my neighbor   the assembly instructions were pretty clear and if you follow them closely you should have no problem   i am a    year old female   i needed help one time when i was attaching the parts underneath and had to have someone hold the base up while i did this  but very doable with two people at the last part and some strength is required   overall  i m very happy with this treadmill      
1861,5.0,                       i highly recommend this treadmill because it s sturdy  reliable  easy to assemble  and is a good bang for your buck i ve had it for   months now and i have been using it     times a week for approximately   hour per session without any issues  you do not have to sign up for ifit like the other negative reviews claim  you can easily bypass it      
1862,4.0,                       very nice and sturdy unit  but the crossbar that the control panel sits on  did not meet up clean to secure screws  after fixing that issue  noticed the rubber on the left arm was not cut properly   neither of these issues affect the performance   but for a      price tag  i expected better with that said  i would still recommend it     
1863,5.0,                       great product easy to assemble  u don t have to subscribe to ifit to use it      
1864,5.0,                       i have absolutely no dislikes about my new treadmill   i love  love  love it   i could spend every run   walk on my treadmill if my friends would allow me to stay home and do so   this is the best investment i have made to date with regards to exercise equipment and ifit that goes along with it   its a complete package for anyone to consider thanks again      
1865,1.0,                       paid for amazon assembly   screw is stripped or stuck and can t finish the job   it s     pm   what would you do   not the assemblers fault update   amazon sent a new treadmill to replace defective treadmill   no assembly installer arrived   i now have   gi normous treadmills sitting in my house completely unusable   another fail from amazon   just dont buy anything big from amazon      
1866,4.0,                       the handle is low   the felt thing that cleans the belt is in the way when i walk   i keep kicking it   i bought a table to hold onto while i walk more towards the middle end so i don t keep moving the felt thing other than these quirks i m happy with my purchase      
1867,4.0,                       assembly wasn t terrible  it did require two people on some steps  there were a couple bolts towards the feet of the treadmill which were difficult to fully tighten  dealing with  ifit  to get the treadmill unlocked for first usage was a complete pain and was way more complicated than it needed to be  after using treadmill a few times the belt slipped a bit to the right  support was great at walking me through how to even it back out and since there have been no issues  overall the treadmill works well and we re glad we purchased it      
1868,1.0,                       the treadmill is quality especially for the price   i purchased the t series treadmill     and it arrived timely in mid december        as of today  march     and   parts later and many emails flying back and forth  i am still trying to get nordick track to send a tech out as my treadmill will not incline   it is always a new rep and never resolving the issue  so for that  i rate this machine a   however i rate the customer service a        
1869,5.0,                       because of the pandemic  my wife and i decided to purchase this treadmill since our gym had closed   it was a little difficult putting together  but we managed and finally got it done   it definitely takes two people   it is easy to operate and use   it is very sturdy and built well   we are very happy with our purchase and would recommend nordictrack to all of you for your workout needs      
1870,5.0,                       i purchased item through amazon because of delivery time  the billing comes up that you can take the promotion of         months for purhases of over         i used my amazon store card to pay i was only given points alsonortictrac showed that ifit was included free for   year valued at             
1871,5.0,                       i am very pleased with this machine i don t use the ifit membership because i am only a fast walker  but i find all of the speed and incline controls intuitive and easy to use  and the track seems to have just the right amount of give i chose the option of delivery to the room of my choice and assembly  that  option is well worth the money      
1872,4.0,                       i got this treadmill for daily walking exercise  works great for that  no issues and the incline works well  it s a little funny that the control panel says  ipod compatible  cause like who even uses an ipod anymore    but like i said  it works fine and it was a good value with the sale price      
1873,4.0,                       the machine works great after we got it unlocked   you have to communicate with ifit to get them to  unlock  the machine   when you contact them you have to give them a credit card no  and you are automatically enrolled in one of their programs for free for the first    days   they then automatically start charging you for the membership after    days if you have not cancelled   so  if you do not want to be a paying member be sure to cancel      
1874,5.0,                       i use this treadmill every work day as a treadmill desk   i have used commercial grade treadmills for years and have to say this model compares favorably   it is sturdy and quiet enough that i can talk on the phone when working   i bought acoustic panels to put underneath to reduce sound on my tile floor      
1875,5.0,                       i have owned about   treadmills and lots of other machines and i think i am in love with this one already and it was my first day trying it    working with the trainer keeps your mind off other things  it s big but you have lots of room to move around      
1876,1.0,                       this is a horrible product that has problems and hard to assemble  i bought this as a gift for my wife  after a long time assembling it  i saw the belt was not alined it was all the way to the left and was getting stuck to the side  i saw in manual to use alen key to adjust the screw to aline the belt  the screw is missing  its was not installed in factory probably when it was built  brand new treadmill that doesn t work this is not acceptable     
1877,4.0,                       arrived on time to my door setting up was not too very easy  some of the screws barely fit  i had to use wrenches and some improvisation force to make it fit  once it was set  everything worked as expected after having it for a bout a month  i am very pleased with it   simple but does all that is needed for daily exercise i don t know about heavy runners  but for walking with occasional jogging it seems very good and cost effective      
1878,5.0,                       very durable machine and great quality  it does not fit through doors less than     wide though once it is assembled  it came by a scheduled delivery and was on time  it was well packaged and nothing was missing  it is a very heavy machine though  so onc you decide where it is going to go  make sure you assemble it there and make sure that if you are going to move  you can get it in and out      
1879,1.0,                       this treadmill came in pieces  the instructions are not clear on which hole to screw which screw into  there are multiple holes and multiple size screws  i m stumped on step four of this installation  this is more of a headache than it s worth and i am sending it back  totally not worth the price      
1880,4.0,                       this is worth the price we paid for it  assembly took less than   hours  very basic treadmill  we do not utilize the speakers  so unsure on how they sound  put about    hours on it thus far and have not had any issues      
1881,5.0,                       while it took a long time to set up  because of covid the installers weren t allowed to come into my home to install   i have gone from never working out to doing it    x a week  i love the ifit and the training classes  i ve been running in bora bora and hiking in utah all from the screen  i don t fold it  so i can t comment on if it s easy or not  i m so happy with this purchase  i didn t know if the   k was worth it  but i do now  my only complaint is the fan doesn t put out enough air to cool me down  so i had to purchase another fan that sits on the floor      
1882,4.0,                       very good  but basic treadmill  assembly was a bit of a chore  and there were a few squeaks as the machine got broke in  mostly  though   it works very well and is a good product for the price      
1883,5.0,                       my package was delivered in   days  dropped off at my door   it was very heavy so had to have help bringing into the house   it took about an hour to put together no problems   i really like the treadmill  it s just like going to the gym but in my own house      
1884,5.0,                       i wanted a basic high quality treadmill at a reasonable price and this unit fit my needs  once i bypassed the virtual coach  subscription feature i was up and running   i do wish it had a simple memory feature that would memorize an interval pattern of my design  i would have given it   stars otherwise      
1885,1.0,                       i just got the treadmill assembled using amazon service however the ifit activation was a prerequisite for the treadmill to work  and half of the buttons on the console don t work upon calling the ifit number provided on the documentation  they said they placed replacement for the console  and i need to swap it out when it arrives in      days this sucks     i have a brand new treadmill sitting in my basement and cannot use it because the activation is pending      
1886,2.0,                       it s not sturdy  material quality is very poor  legs and handles are hollow  it appears to only be good for walking at level    once i turn the speed up it wobbles and shake  it s even worse when i increase the incline  i m only     lbs      
1887,5.0,                       a year in the control panel went out and nordic track argued about replacing it like it states in the coverage but husband got that handled and was replaced  to skip the subscription just hold the icon down until it turns to manual use      
1888,4.0,                       this was very easy to assemble  i followed a youtube video  the package is extremely heavy  i had to unbox it to get it in my basement and slid it down the stairs by myself  it wasn t easy the treadmill itself i found to be very sturdy  i m a bigger guy and was unsure if it was going to be strong enough to handle me but it s working good so far  i do walking and light jogging and it s only minimal shake  i do have a mat under the front legs overall i m very happy with this purchase and would definitely buy it again  i would recommend for a bigger guy      
1889,2.0,                       very bad experience from nordictrack  after installing the treadmill we found that incline is not working  we called customer care and they shipped new sensor for incline  it didn t work  then they sent the motor  which was not easy to change  after putting   hours to change the motor we found that incline is still not working  we are going to return the treadmill      
1890,3.0,                       you can not plug in this treadmill anywhere in the house   it works great in   amp circuits like the kitchen and bathrooms   it works in some  but not all    amp circuits   they will sell you an arc filter which usually helps but not always   i m using mine in a bedroom and using a long extension cord to plug it in in a bathroom      
1891,5.0,                       instructions were clear and easy to follow went together easy you do need two people to assemble  did activation and it started no problem  i will cancel membership as i just want it for walking     
1892,5.0,                       fantastic product  high quality equipment  loving it just be aware it requires dedicated    amp outlet      
1893,5.0,                       my husband and i did a lot of research on a treadmill before purchasing  we ended up going with this one because it fit our needs  we ve had it for a few months now and it is great  we use it probably     times per week between the both of us and it has held up great  we did purchase a mat to go underneath it because we put it on a carpeted floor and it doesn t move at all  it goes up to   mph and    incline  i usually jog at about    mph and so far so good as others have said with the ifit membership  you just have to hold down the ifit button when you first turn it on and it won t ask for you to sign up again  no extra expenses at all  i would definitely recommend  it s a great value for the price      
1894,4.0,                       i love the treadmill and the ifit membership is great  so many options available to make working out fun  my biggest negative is that the amazon installer who assembled the treadmill put the belt on slightly crooked  i thought it would be ok by adjusting the belt using the hex tool as stated in the manual  however  less than   months from purchasing the treadmill  the belt ripped on one side and i have to replace the belt  i wish i would have known better and had the installer straighten the belt      
1895,5.0,                       i took the ifit program for   month but did not use it more than a couple of times for a few minutes   i did not feel it was safe for me with quick changes occurring in the programming   i am    years old   i use my treadmill every day to get my walking in after having physical therapy for a few months   it is a great addition for someone who lives    miles from a gym      
1896,5.0,                       i was so torn between this treadmill and the horizon t    and honestly i decided on this one because of the free delivery and assembly through amazon  i am so glad i did  the delivery and assembly was painless and quick  there were   staff who delivered and they were very knowledgeable on the assembly and even use of the treadmill  they had everything working perfectly and i even tested before they left the treadmill itself has been perfect and a very smooth walk  i especially use the ledge shelf for holding the ipad while i walk  my only complaint would be that it s very heavy to roll for storage      
1897,3.0,                       the item was delivered pretty banged up  it took   hrs for assembly  the threads on bolts and screws were messed up that required a screwing in with a high torque drill bit  anyways got it done  big issue is that the belt does not stay centered  it loses alignment after each use  i have followed the manufactures direction to center the belt  but still not resolved  reading reviews here explains that this is a known issue  my bad for not researching before ordering  i am hoping to get a company tech fix the issue  if this is not resolved in the next    days  i will return      
1898,5.0,                       it s great so far  husband assembled it and i had to help slightly by holding it up while assembling the spring  for folding   yes  we had to sign up to get it started  and decided not to do the work around as others suggested  but we re going to cancel before the first month      
1899,5.0,                       this is my first treadmill  i ve run on many different models  and this one is totally adequate for my home  it is heavy and the way you have to put together the  shock piston  under the treadmill is a bit awkward   however  i was able to get it done by myself   with a use of a  x    about the   ifit com        i read a previous review from another person who purchased this one     push and hold the button until it disappears    done      
1900,1.0,                       i purchased the treadmill in march        the treadmill seems fine but the ifit is a scam   we received the gift card but when we registered it said the gift card was already used   i have emailed and to no prevail no one answers or responds to email   very poor customer service and amazon should not be promoting them with this treadmill   that is why i gave it one star   very disappointing      
1901,1.0,                       so far  this very expensive treadmill is a useless multihundred pound piece of junk  nordictrack has diagnosed the issue as  probably the control board  so they want to send me a new one and see if that fixes it  this will apparently take     weeks to be shipped to me at which point a technician will then contact me and take another   weeks to schedule an appointment to come and install it and maybe then it work  or maybe then i have to see if amazon will send a replacement and get this hunk of garbage out of my house  who knows  either way  i would suggest this treadmill isn t worth the money        
1902,5.0,                       when my old  old treadmill broke  i panicked  i had heard all the trouble with finding quality workout equipment right now  just three days later  i got this treadmill delivered  and it is awesome  sturdy  with more bells and whistles than i care about  but very happy with the quality for the price      
1903,5.0,                       i guess i hadn t pieced the measurements into my room  so it s my own fault  but it s huge  it s a commercial size  which makes my furniture look lilliputian easy to use   the speed and incline changes with the touch of a finger you have to sign in through ifit to get the treadmill to work the first time  you can then cancel without a charge  i cancelled  so i m not using any of the ifit workouts   i just like to walk with changes in incline overall  i m very pleased with this purchase      
1904,5.0,                       after coronavirus hit i knew that i needed a treadmill to stay healthy and going to the gym wasn t an option  this treadmill had the best reviews for its price and i totally agree  it does take two people to assemble but the instructions for clear and straight forward and moving it around the house was easy as well  we couldn t decide where to put it at first   it folds up and locks into place for safety and despite its size it packs a punch  i love that it has a decent incline and it goes up to speed    if you are looking for a treadmill that does a little bit of everything and is a     quality  this is it      
1905,5.0,                       the ifit app had challenges to set up as during initial login after setting up an ifit account  i got a message that i could login due to being outside the us   i and my profile are listed as pa  usa   ifit rep quickly resolved the issue by having me reset the treadmill back to factory setting using a paper clip   the procedure is in the manual   very simple and easily fixed   i m excited about starting my workouts      
1906,5.0,                       the unit was easy to assemble like in a couple of hours  operates great  but i love the ifit application even more  i love that i can workout on a series from my treadmill at home and pick up where i left off on my phone tablet if i choose to continue a series on the treadmill when i go to the gym      
1907,5.0,                       did a ton of research before i bought this and really like this treadmill and included ifit service  definitely a two person assembly job  fairly good instructions  some of the plastic shell pieces could fit together better  but overall very satisfied      
1908,4.0,                       two person install is ideal  pretty handy myself and required a second person  the ifit workouts are great  makes working out less arduous  quality is decent  no complaints for a lower end model      
1909,4.0,                       inspect for damages carefully once unwrapped  mine delivered with a giant crack hole in the side where the box banding dug in during transit  also the screws sent for assembling the hand rails do not fit  had to use other screws we had  aside from that the assembly wasn t too bad  took a couple hours with two people  equipment seems to work fine so far despite cosmetic damages      
1910,5.0,                       if you are an active runner like me and you are considering buying a treadmill  this is definitely the one for you  i have no complaints at all  it works wonderful  i use it almost every day and i simply love it      
1911,5.0,                       i truly enjoy this treadmill  excellent workout with or without ifit  i love the ifit features and its only     a month for a single user  love it   i purchased the amazon maintenance program as well and hopefully i willl not have to use it in a long time  enjoy the treadmil especially more during the lockdown period as all the gyms are closed  i am so glad about this purchase  thanks  tp     
1912,1.0,                       do not buy  this product has an issue with the electronic board that operates the motor  this results in the brand new treadmill not operating at all  nordictrack is aware of the issue but is still selling faulty treadmills   nordictrack will send you a self installed corrected electronic board when they have them in stock maybe in a month if you are lucky  bad business and awful customer service nordictrack      
1913,1.0,                       the treadmill came with a broken part   looking at that part and the condition of the box and packing  the unit seems used      
1914,5.0,                       i had a nordic track treadmill for    years and i literally use it everyday  i used it so much that i eventually wore the treadmill out  so i wanted to purchase another nordic track treadmill immediately  the stores did not have nordic track  so i went online found exactly what i wanted and purchased it  it arrived within a week  we assembled it  which was very easy  now i am back on my treadmill every day  this new nordic track treadmill is excellent  i enjoy everything about it  to sum it up    pure perfection     
1915,3.0,                       only complaints are that it s one seriously big beast and it s a slightly difficult to thread the bolts into the uprights   also they try to con you into a subscription training plan   just put the magnetic emergency stop thing in then press the ifit sync button for    seconds or so and it goes away   for that alone they get two stars deducted      
1916,5.0,                       the experience is good  the power is large enough and the machine is running stable  it s also easy to assemble  good for working out at home during the pandemic      
1917,1.0,                       i purchased this treadmill during the covid lockdown when gyms were closed   we assembled it as per the manual and it ran well for     months   we used it    x week for jogs of less then   miles   so not a whole lot of wear and tear on the treadmill   now  however the belt is not moving   the treadmill turns on but the belt remains still   i have called customer support  however they are closed on the weekend and as i work during the week and cannot make calls from my office  i have been unable to figure out what is wrong and how much it will now cost me   i would not purchase this again      
1918,5.0,                       we are super pleased with the design and quality of the product but we would pay to have it assembled next time   also  it really is    lbs so you will need help moving the box once it arrives      
1919,5.0,                       our old treadmill finally gave up the ghost so this is my  nd in home treadmill   i read a lot of reviews and comments about different brands and models and chose this one   i wanted a mid priced model  non professional  because we also belong to a gym and don t need a high dollar model   this nordictrack fits the bill perfectly   we had it assembled by an amazon contractor who was quite professional and knowledgeable   the assembler told me he had assembled well over     of this model   he also said he does a lot of treadmill repair work also but this model is not a troublesome product   we have been very happy with our nordictrack      
1920,5.0,                       its fairly quiet compared to others when running  also  i love the different settings  the bluetooth is super helpful when wanting to play music  the speakers sound great  easy to assemble understand and navigate  worth the money      
1921,1.0,                       came without hardware  husband bought screws at the store after   trips  took   hours to put together then realized there was no safety release  must have been in with hardware   called amazon  recording hung up on me not taking calls at this time but sure taking money  called nordic track  very nice  parts back ordered  if i don t get them in   weeks please call back  belt extremely loose  if it wasn t such trouble would definitely return  would only buy a treadmill in person   amazon usually great  extremely disappointed in them      
1922,4.0,                       this is a great product   easy to use and has all the basic functions you d expect  it ll get you running flat or at an incline  don t expect a bunch of features  but if your goal is to get your heart rate up at home  this will do the job  i ve really enjoyed using it only issue was a problem with getting it set up where the base they sent was misaligned  but once that issue got resolved  it s all functional and assembled and good to go      
1923,5.0,                       this treadmill is great for the short amount of time we have had it assembled  the one big turnoff for me was it tries to force you to sign up for the ifit portion of it  we bypassed the free month trial due to fact that it required payment information for past the first month  you do not have to activate ifit in order to use the machine  you just press and hold the ifit button for up to    seconds to turn that feature off  and than you can use the machine and it s functions      
1924,1.0,                       do not buy   so far it is built and looks great  can t turn on  tried even entering my credit card as even though it says you can bypass the ifit option  it isn t an option  forces you to buy  did that  still won t turn on  keeps flashing and beeping  so annoying to pay this much and not be able to jump on before work like i wanted to be able to do on rainy days   hate it  regret going with nordictrack      
1925,4.0,                       i like the simplicity of the machine just the right of programs to keep the workout interesting   assembly of the machine was ok using the instruction provided   unit does take up some space when not folded but that was to be expected   the width of the machine and the length of the machine is just right   walking on the treadmill gives me a natural stride   feels comfortable while walking   overall this was a good purchase      
1926,1.0,                       i cant comment on how it operated as it never has   despite the customer service sending me out replacement parts with no instruction on how to fit them  none of the replacement parts when finally fitted addressed the problem   they then suggested i voided the warranty and took no further responsibility for their faulty product   avoid icon fitness and their faulty products      
1927,1.0,                       review below is still accurate however i was lured in to make the review by max hadlock who isn t getting back to me now so      star this is a really nice treadmill and was a great price  i bought this because it was the lowest priced treadmill with a good sized tread and a high weight limit  so far it s definitely meeting expectations      
1928,5.0,                       the whole package of this treadmill  is a gem  half priced expert assembly  is a good deal and very useful considering it is a piece of heavy equipememt with lots of screwers  ifit program has added lots of fun when work out  i wish i can keep this program after one year   now   i use the treadmill few times a week   it saves  my travel time  to the gym back and forth especially in the winter season  very happy with this purchase      
1929,1.0,                       received the machine and took me three hrs to assemble i pressed button for incline and walk  the incline part is not working this was really heavy to move  hard to assemble and as everyone commented  the trick of  ifit  you can just cancel ifit right after hope i get help on fixing inclining issue within this week or else i will need to return this machine      
1930,5.0,                       i absolutely love this treadmill and the ifit app    watching beautiful scenery while walking hiking running it s amazing makes you forget about how hard you are pushing yourself   plus some of these places i may never get to see in person so very awesome to follow the trainer and push myself   everyday is a new challenge and i can t wait till i m running miles on this thing  also my kids absolutely love it lol let s be honest after this past year i m sure everyone in the household will benefit from a little activity  so glad we bought       
1931,4.0,                       everyone in the family uses it daily  works great  just the right amount of functionality without being too complicated to operated  we bought coverage which included delivery and setup which went over without a hitch  haven t had any issues with it  strong recommendation      
1932,1.0,                       horrible machine  i ordered it  and when it arrived  the speed buttons were not correct  i pressed   and it would start at       but the actual speed was much slower than   as i wasn t winded as normal  then the distance was not calculating properly  it said i was running at a      minute mile pace  definitely not accurate because i eat pizza and junk food a lot and the fastest i have ever run a mile was       i requested a replacement  that one worked just fine     for a total of about    miles before the motor gave out  it s a piece of crap at best      
1933,5.0,                       love the new tredmill  great value for price we paid  totally worth it   unfortunately   we paid extra for shipping   handling with written request to deliver inside our condo on  rd floor   two delivery guys wanted to leave the tredmill in the lobby  because   flights of stairs was too much   my husband had to help one delivery guy bring tredmill to our condo      
1934,5.0,                       we have had this unit for several months and it s been flawless  we live in florida and needed an indoor way to exercise  my wife and i use it for walking at various elevations and both enjoy it  we haven t used the pre programmed workouts or other features except for the ipod speakers which are ok  better to use headphones everything in the unit seems well constructed and it s a very good price  value deal we bought the assembly through amazon at a sale price and it was really worthwhile  prompt efficient service our unit came with a cracked plastic base cover pointed out by our assembly guy  i called amazon and got a very fair adjustment so we went ahead with the assembly      
1935,5.0,                       if you are looking for a well constructed  but basic treadmill that performs this is the unit for you   reliable  durable and easy to use   we purchased     one for me and the other for my husband   we use it every day for anywhere between     hours at a time   very dependable and meets all of our expectations   highly recommend      
1936,4.0,                       the treadmill works great  after assembly the right side rubs against the hand rail  not a huge deal but over time it will show and the paint will wear off  it s very heavy and no wheels so moving it can be difficult still very solid abd we like it      
1937,5.0,                       easy assembly and the fitness app is worth it i was reluctant to order at first but so glad i did my first run was over   miles and i got lost in running with the trainer     
1938,2.0,                       limited programming options  pulse sensor is too bad  you never get your real pulse  pulse rate reading is absolutely not reliable  i regret i bought oat it i was willing to return it  but the amazon return message was that i have to de assemble it and put it in it original box  which was impossible condition after the box was thrown away  i wish i found out this poor quality before i thew the box away      
1939,5.0,                       once the product worked everything is good  i just didn t enjoy putting the product together and not being able to use it right away  i am convinced the problem is with the ifit software  but the treadmill is great  without using the ifit programs it still measured my heart rate  calories burned distance traveled and elapsed time  that s everything i wanted      
1940,5.0,                       the first one i received was broken which i assumed might happen based on reviews  i called and had a replacement delivered  now that i have a one without a crack  i absolutely love this treadmill  great quality for the price and is super easy to fold up      
1941,5.0,                       we are satisfied by the quality of the treadmill  it took   hours for us to assemble but the instructions are very clear  it is too heavy to move so make sure enough assistance to unpack  move and assemble etc  there was so confusion while activating but it turned out that you don t need to purchase ifit membership for the same  i would recommend the treadmill if you are looking for a exercise machine for your family      
1942,4.0,                       decent treadmill but very difficult to install  u don t need to be very handy but you need to be very strong to install this thing      
1943,5.0,                       it was easy to assemble fits in the small space i have and is great for the run walk workouts i do   i really appreciate the incline up to    and being able to adjust by preset or by up down buttons   so far  this has been an excellent value for what i received and would highly recommend   two thumbs up      
1944,1.0,                       i purchased this nordictrack treadmill to keep my ld body moving with my gym closed  the motor does not work  i called to have it replaced  it is out of stock  guess where it has to come from  china  will we ever be able to live without china      
1945,5.0,                       i put it together myself  have some extra screws available  it didn t come missing any  however there were a few i couldn t get to fit   it was fairly easy to assemble  i m    so it probably took me longer  around   hours      
1946,5.0,                       this product was packaged well  got it put together and had to call nordic track as it was not working  within    minutes they were able to diagnose it and sent me a new motor free of charge  two weeks later i replaced the motor they sent me and it has worked perfectly since  small inconvenience  for the price  this is a great treadmill  i am very happy with my purchase      
1947,4.0,                       took one person to assemble but dedicated a bit of time to it works great  love the incline don t like that the stereo has only worked for the ifit app  i used an aux cord to connect my music and can not get it to work  if the sound was compatible with anything i plug into aux it would have   stars the folding up is not as compact as other treadmills i ve had in the past so it s not as easy to hide    but it has a feature to make it slowly fall so you re not getting crushed by the weight of the treadmill when you unfold it      
1948,5.0,                       i highly recommend this treadmill  especially as the winter closes in and outside exercise winds down for the season   assembly takes some time  but it is straight forward and the instructions are unusually good and clear   the time is worth the investment given the almost indestructible piece of equipment that you get in return   features are exceptional for the price   you won t be disappointed in this investment      
1949,4.0,                       the treadmill works fine  it s a bit noisier than i expected at high speeds  but that s basic treadmill doings   don t buy the extended support   i m sure it s great except that you can t get through to customer support   the treadmill had a broken part when it arrived   fortunately it wasn t an essential one  but i ve sent two emails and spent almost an hour on the support phone line with no response except  we ll get to you    it s been over    days with no contact or follow up   if something was really wrong it s be too darn bad   so  get the t mill but anything goes wrong you re probably on your own      
1950,5.0,                       i am very pleased with this trademill i wanted to have a trademill that is just hardware but with workouts it is really sturdyand well built with ifit software the best part i like is the    screen  i would recommend anyone who is looking for dependable trademill for workout     
1951,5.0,                       my spouse and i are getting a great deal of good use out of this fantastic machine  enough that we may need a  nd one  easy to use  assembly was pretty straightforward  and while i don t need to fold it up to store it  that feature does also works well  it is helpful that there is a place for a tablet or cell phone  quite enjoying the improvement in a timed mile      
1952,2.0,                       no way to get around paying for another service just to use your treadmill   the offer to call support if u ever get thru is a joke as well as trying to cancel if it once u are forced to sign up just to turn your treadmill on   since it is purchased to improve health   skip nordic track and account for paying more for peace of mind and one cost vs hidden service fees     
1953,1.0,                       it s been   week and it has stopped working with a huge noise when i turn on  it did started working by itself but dont know when it will stop again     
1954,1.0,                       worked great for a month  only used manual mode  stopped working after month of use until i enabled ifit membership for free trial  don t want to be held hostage when the trial membership runs out  returning product  bummer since i had to recruit help to lug this beast upstairs  now need to get help to move it back outside for pickup  stay away from nordictrack and other ifit treadmills  tried all the recommended ifit bypass methods without  luck      
1955,3.0,                       i like everything about it except the pulse reading part is wildly inaccurate  also  the belt needs constant readjustment  i haven t contacted nordictrac about it yet but i am feeling that the belt may be slightly irregular the noise level seems quiet enough and reasonable  i don t know if treadmills can be any quieter  it seems sturdy and incline speed adjustments are easy  it supports weight well without bogging down      
1956,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  it s sturdy and well built  the price can t be beat either  i recommend this product     
1957,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          assembly was not hard you just gotta take your time  just got done with a   mile run and the machine worked great  in my personal opinion it was not noisy  you need a good amount of space as it is big  highly recommend    i got it on special for     and i don t regret it  invest in yourself      
1958,5.0,                       love it  i use this about   times a week  with the gyms closing due to the quarantine it worked out for me i was able to still get my workout   when the gyms started to open again my state has to wear a mask while working out which is impossible  i canceled my gym membership and just use my treadmill and weights      
1959,5.0,                       this treadmill is a terrific bargain  quality design and operation  we use it everyday and it keeps track of many valuable stats      
1960,1.0,                       ordered this for my friends   stopped working about a month after my friends got it  they contacted customer support who diagnosed the mother board was bad   this was in may        they got the mother board in august  installed it and it broke again in about an hour   been talking with customer suppose    or   calls    or   people  supervisors and more   generally nordic track has good products and are good quality   i guess my friends got a lemon   still waiting for the issue to be resolved      
1961,5.0,                       we ve used   different home treadmills and dozen of treadmills at health clubs and motel fitness centers   it is as smooth and quiet as any treadmill i ve ever used you will be blown away by the heavy weight of the box it comes in but that is largely due to the careful packaging   once it is assembled  it easy to raise and lower and can be easily transported around the room using the wheels we could not be more pleased with a treadmill for walking      
1962,5.0,                       there is nothing i don t like  i absolutely love my nordictrack  easy to assemble and fold  love the quality of incline   treadmill overall  the best thing i purchased in a long time  very satisfied  and would recommend this to anyone      
1963,4.0,                       easy to assemble and high quality   i purchased this treadmill because it supports larger people   it runs quietly and performs well   the only thing missing is a built in fan  but that is because it comes with many other features      
1964,3.0,                       this has a weight limit of    lbs so be aware  ours came on time and was easy to assemble  however the cable that plugs to the wall was extremely damaged  we decided to repair it ourselves  but keep this in mind when purchasing  otherwise it has done well for the price point     
1965,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  i m so happy i bought it at the time of purchase  i was agnostic about ifit but thought i d give it a trial run   it s terrific  the video  instructor led walks  runs and hikes are fantastic  and i love how i can schedule workouts  great accountability it s reliable and affordable and can handle more than a walking pace for a good amount of time i really have nothing bad to say about it  except that i wish i bought it sooner      
1966,5.0,                       we had a     budget for a treadmill  we shopped around at we believed this was the best value for the money  we were not disappointed  assembly was not hard  be sure follow instructions and do not to tighten bolts when the directions say so  it is easy to use  preprogrammed workouts  and it runs smooth  it s a little noisy  but it doesnt bother me and i don t notice when i listen to music  i would recommend to a friend      
1967,1.0,                       after about    days of consistent use this developed a very loud squeal that makes it basically useless  i was so disappointed that light use has already meant i need to get a service technician to come out  i wasn t too upset as i purchased the   year warranty for service and maintenance until i actually tried to use it  i ve sent countless emails to amazon and i was told they d have someone at nordic track call me but no one ever does  sent email after email and nothing  poor product and even worse warranty  don t waste your money      
1968,5.0,                       i have had the product for a few months and am very happy with it  it seems very sturdy   the touch screen is very clear and easy to use   the ifit workouts keep me from getting bored unlike some reviews that i have read  i find the machine to be pretty quiet  i also dont mind not having any fans built in i tried a few other machines out at a local store that cost more money and i didnt think they were as good as this one      
1969,1.0,                       bought it  had it put together by professional  it worked for a couple of months  started making this loud winding sound  i called they mailed me a new motor  they expected me to install  still making the horrible noise  now i can t get any responses  huge useless treadmill sitting in my house      
1970,5.0,                       i m a regular runner that was looking for an affordable but quality treadmill for the house when i m not beating the streets  i did a little research  and this one just kept coming up for my needs  this is exactly that  no issues  runs smoothly and quietly  has the speeds that i need to jog and run at a fast pace  my wife loves it as well  fyi   you do not need to sign up for the ifit  i never did  and never will  i will say you will need more than one person to put this together  took about an hour and a half to do  it s not light weight  overall a win for the price point      
1971,5.0,                       had no problems putting together  great price  use every day  add lost   lb in   week     
1972,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this treadmill a few months ago  it is even so much more than i anticipated  it is extremely quiet  i get on it very early each morning in the room next to my sleeping kids and it never wakes him up  i am constantly finding new features and still have more to explore  i was not expecting all the features for the price  i highly recommend it      
1973,5.0,                       extremely dissatisfied  just found out the service technician can not come and service the machine for another eight weeks  thats may   th      days ago i put in the service request   this is a joke only   technician on long island   i do not recommend buying from a company that can not provide adequate service for their products   i only use the machine in the colder weather  so its a very light use machine with less than     miles on it   nordictrac  gets no stars   machine is still under original manufacturer warranty update  service technician called today and cancelled the may   th appointment as he received a call from icon warranty company that the parts are not available and do not know when they will be available      
1974,4.0,                       great treadmill for the price  the only thing i didn t like was how they tried to push signing up online with the    signs that say you have to  just hold down the ifit button and it starts up no problem without registration  overall its sturdy and works amazing for me and im  ft    lbs     
1975,5.0,                       came packaged nicely  fairly easy to put together  good instructions   probably took me like an hour and half to assemble  please note you do not need a credit card despite what the instructions say to get stated  once you turn on the power  hold down the ifit button for    or so seconds and you will be able to use without a credit cards  comes with pre programmed workouts you can use or you can manually control your workouts      
1976,1.0,                       ur product   service is horrible  u left the broken up box on the side of my home   once put together  the apps don t work   y all answer to the problem is to keep sending me registration notices until the warranty runs out   this has been the worst   i will never do business with nordic track again  my loyalty to y all has cost me   never again     
1977,5.0,                       easy to assemble  packing was greatwe use it as intended  mounted a    inch tv in front so we can stream the workout to it     
1978,5.0,                       i have already lost   lbs in the first   days of using it so you can burn     calories in about    minutes each day i had trouble assembling it but i undid the bottom screws  so that the handle was moveable then i put he console on and tightened every bolt  this is the only way it would fit so do not tighten the bottom all the way until you have secured the top console      
1979,1.0,                       do not buy this product unless you want to decide to put this machine inside the home i mean inside  not garage  this machine broke down   months after i bought and i qas told that its not covered unless its moved inside the home from garage  i need to disassemble this machine and put it inside the home so they send me      parts for coverage very very disappointed      
1980,5.0,                       this machine was easy to assemble with minimal tools  the machine is pretty quiet  and fits my needs perfectly  getting healthy  not marathon running  pros  large variety of workouts on ifit  found a few trainers i like and have been going through their videos  incline is smooth with its transitions  feel like some gym machines are rough adjusting incline  nice screen large deckcons  unable to throw workout from machine to tv and keep it controlling the machine fan is not adjustable on my model at least  t   s  i am short so no fan for me      
1981,1.0,                       extremely unhappy   doesn t function properly   returning the item furthermore  spent many hours on hold and then finally speaking with nordictrack customer service who admitted that all these machines are having major issues   ours simply doesn t even work   all the machine is designed to do is get you to sign up for an ifit subscription   no thanks   i thought nordictrack was a quality company but i must say i am disappointed both with the machine and with the way they handled themselves   return to sender      
1982,4.0,                       i ve had this for about   months and haven t had any issues   i dont have any issues using it and didn t have to keep my subscription to the ifit or whatever that program is   so for those saying you can t use it without that subscription are doing something wrong   i like the preset programs that come with it   i do think it s a bit loud   but could be because i have it in my office room with wood floors that could be  amplifying   the sound   overall   i m quite happy with my purchase      
1983,4.0,                       this is not a bad treadmill for your house  it gets the job done  the first one we ordered came broken and the company promptly replaced it which we appreciated  they also brought it into the basement for us which was nice  my wife put it together but she is good at that  you should be able to put it together the instructions seemed fairly straight forward      
1984,1.0,                       could not assemble the product do to base not constructed properly  have been asking for a replacement partfor over a month with no luck   not sure when i will bet the part and be able to use the treadmill  very disappointing  after   and     month still not working  getting the proper replacement parts has been a nightmare       
1985,4.0,                       this treadmill is good for the price  remember  it s not commercial grade and therefore won t respond the same as a        treadmill  pretty simple to assemble     to   hours to complete folds very easily  ifit is super annoying  i couldn t bypass it and therefore had to register with my cc  but  i canceled my membership within    minutes of signing up and has zero issues  i will have ifit for the next month  then it will auto cancel overall  it s a      treadmill and you get what you pay for  not bad for walking light jogging just got it today so still haven t broken it in      
1986,5.0,                       this is compact size it fits in any room  the incline goes up to    so there s always room to improve  i have bad knees in the shock absorbers really help  i m able to walk on this for    minutes to an hour  even the kids love it     
1987,3.0,                       this treadmill doesn t read your heart rate accurately  when taking mine during a two mile jog i will get       bpm  which i know is false  i will then have to retake two to three times to get an actual believable hear rate reading  both my wife and i have experienced this issue  and it s rather frustrating considering the cost of this unit      
1988,1.0,                       bad experience with this product  the belt tore within   months with very light usage  tried calling nordictrac customer service but they haven t been able to replace the part for over   months now it has been a very frustrating experience     first  for the fact that the treadmill got into this condition within a year and a half of very light usage    second  that after placing the repair order   it has now been   months and no closer to getting the treadmill fixed expensive piece of junk lying in the house   unable to use      
1989,5.0,                       so worth the wait  my husband assembled it solo so it took him   hrs  as great as any commercial treadmill at the gym and the small screen doesn t matter  you can clearly see speed  incline  time and we use the pelaton app anyway  great buy and great deal      
1990,5.0,                       this is an amazing treadmill  i was really skeptical at first  but after my first ifit workout  i was blown away  the only thing negative  i can say is that the assembly was not so simple  if you re in the market for a treadmill  i highly recommend this one      
1991,1.0,                       broke after a week  belt motor is no longer working  returning it for a refund return process is the worse have to dissemble and box it  box were already thrown out definitely will not be buying anything like this again from amazon      
1992,5.0,                       love how it folds up and comes down  settings for the    workouts are great and i can walk and jog on it  im over     lbs would recommend this and you dont need the subscription mentioned  i will say set up does need   people at some points but not terrible at all      
1993,5.0,                       im not athletic at all  but just needed something to keep me active  and this machine is great for that  have had this treadmill for a     months  and so far so good  i like the multiple incline levels  my husband is about    lbs and he uses it without and issue as well  i just have it open in our office  though it does fold ok  we just felt it was too much of a hassle to open and fold it  my husband and i assembled it together  but it took a couple hours as it is heavy      
1994,5.0,                       this unit replaced my older nordictrack that finally died after    years  it was fairly easy to assemble and has a lot of nice features making it easy to use  usually quality of similar items drops over time  but this one is as well built as my older model it replaced  looking forward to another long run with my nordictrack      
1995,3.0,                       i bought couple of months ago and it s stopping working yesterday for no reason  i unplugged outlet and try to reprogram couple times  it s finally back to work but worries me  the incline seems not to work  or moves up and down without me actually controlling it      
1996,4.0,                       the ifit requirement  or it seems like it is a requirement to turn on the treadmill   and when you navigate to the site  it asks for tons of personal information   i chose not to input my info and learned that if you depress the ifit  button  for    seconds  the treadmill starts working   felt like a scam      
1997,4.0,                       we bought this product about   months back and we like it so far set up is pretty straight forward  during the assembly  we noticed one of the parts  screw  was not correct for one of the steps and customer support helped resolving the issue by doing a video call and sent the right part later we use it regularly and works great      
1998,5.0,                       package arrived with a few holes in the box  but after opening  there was no damage   assembly took a couple of hours   assembly instructions were pretty straightforward   i must say that i was shocked at the quality of this treadmill at this price point   it works well  and is not too loud   i have used it at least   times a week since the purchase   i highly recommend for anyone looking to purchase a treadmill for home fitness      
1999,4.0,                       it came with a bad wire that we had to fix  luckily for us we have someone who works with electricity  it also squeaks when being used and it s slow in coming up  however  for the price it works well      
2000,5.0,                       speedy delivery  easy to assemble if you are inclined to take it on   definitely a two person job at times during assembly   good deck   quiet   so far so good   back on the treadmill      
2001,4.0,                       not nearly as great as my exp      after    years it gave up the ghost  i need amazon to contact me  the delivery guys crushed my culvert  not happy  how on earth do you actually reach a person at amazon      
2002,1.0,                       this quit working   month after we bought it  it was barely even used  do not buy this junk and the company want more then it worth to send part and i have tear it apart and fix it  we are thoughing in the dump     
2003,5.0,                       we ve really enjoyed our nordictrack treadmill so far  just right for our space and needs  great value as far as i m concerned  controls are big and easy to use  shelf works well for holding phone  ipad or even laptop for watching media  we have had to adjust the belt a couple of times as it gets off center  but the adjustment is easy enough with tool provided  recommended      
2004,4.0,                       i really like this treadmill  it is very good for the price  the assembly would be just about impossible for one person to complete on their own  also  the labels on the treadmill claim that it cannot be used until you sign up for a membership  however  this is easily avoidable by holding down the power button for    seconds      
2005,5.0,                       now that home gyms seem to be a thing now  we decided to purchase a nordictrack treadmill  i searched various products and found that the t series was the best value for the price  it arrived on time  was easy to assemble and decided to place it in our garage  my wife loves it and uses it everyday  happy wife  happy life      
2006,5.0,                       this treadmill exceeded our expectations  it is well worth the price paid for it  we bought it in the midst of the pandemic when the gyms were closed  when compared to our parent s treadmill  not a nordictrack   the shocks when running at a faster pace absorb your weight better  we are glad to have purchased this  totally worth the price      
2007,4.0,                       this is an excellent treadmill for the price  the only reason i did not give it   stars is that it feels under powered at a    and by that i mean it feels like its struggling and the belt does not move in one smooth motion its kind of  jerky    the other slight issue i have is the incline says it goes to a     grade but the    is more like a normal   or   on other treadmills      
2008,5.0,                       purchased the assembly too  joseph and alessio helped to put on the treadmill  it was great and fast      
2009,4.0,                       the treadmill was relatively easy to assemble after i watched a u tube video on assembly  the only adjustment i had to make was to align the tread  it does everything i want a treadmill to do      
2010,5.0,                       putting it together is far easier with   people  some mismatch of holes that took a second person to help out but got it together put     miles on it a day for about a week and no issues thus far      
2011,5.0,                       i like the ability to switch speeds at the push of a button   i alternate between low speed and high speed intervals   being able to push a single button and go from low to high speed is great   on other treadmills you have to press the   or   signs to ramp up speed which is terrible   i tried the ifit option and it is great  syncs with the treadmill   makes running fun being able to follow someones instruction at a cool location   i guess this is sort of like pelaton without the price tag      
2012,3.0,                       product works almost fine   the quick speed numbers are off   so each number increases the speed by     miles instead of   being  mph    being  mph  etc     i emailed w  customer service   they responded asking for a video of the problem and no one responded after that   i followed up at least   times   luckily the product functions  but buyer be ware   they also tried to sell me their service warranty package  lol      
2013,4.0,                       my only negative comment is that the treadmill arrived with a crack on the base  other than that it has been great  it arrived promptly  wasn t overly hard to put together  i was able to override the  ifit  feature easily and it works great  i ve been using it for almost two months now with no problems      
2014,5.0,                       before buying a treadmill i did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews  i kept going back and forth and finally settled on this on  i am so happy with this purchase  the quality is great  delivery and set up were no problem  this treadmill is sturdy and not too loud i have been using this daily and have been satisfied      
2015,5.0,                       this treadmill is easy to put together and use  and has been great for my home gym during the pandemic  the     screen comes with a lot of great programs and the equipments itself seems very sturdy my only issue is that it is difficult to use it without ifit  and the internet connection in my garage is a little choppy  so sometimes i have to play around with the wifi just to get started  presumably this wouldnt be an issue if your internet connection is solid other than that we are very pleased with the product     
2016,2.0,                       purchased in july and a month ago the screen stopped within   months of purchase  the only way we can get it to stop is taking off the little strap off  the on and off button does not work and neither do the arrows  we have to manually push the           to increase the speed  extremely disappointed      
2017,2.0,                       this is a not a plug in and go product  you have to register it  but also sign up for an ifit membership  of course  first month is free   and then they charge your credit card      for a full year  there is no way to go around this awful add on  my request to cancel it via e mail went unanswered  but they do call you and e mail you to further extend the warranty  i said no  but please cancel the ifit membership   i got transferred to another line that rang in vain for    minutes      
2018,4.0,                       added this to our home gym  the lack of bluetooth for audio is a huge disappointment and honestly it s       i reccomend anyone buy one with bluetooth audio at this point  this model should be retired and replaced with a newer version that includes bluetooth audio  it s so old it says  ipod  on it and i don t know anyone that uses an ipod anymore for anything let alone their treadmill  what it does great though is work with my ipad and ifit  ifit is awesome and i can t reccomend it enough      
2019,5.0,                       i m in love with my treadmill  i use to walk around my neighborhood to get my exercise  i got so tired of being chased by dogs  strange people approaching or following me and also the weather  the best thing my husband ever talked me into was purchasing this treadmill      
2020,4.0,                       due to covid i had to put the treadmill together myself  i ll be honest  i m not a screw driving and hammer guy   after       hour this thing was up and almost ready to go   to start you need to activate online with norder track  ifit    yup a account with debt info and everything   i didn t it and everything worked   i ve used it about    time and no problems so far   i m satisfied      
2021,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i ve been attempting to get technical assistance for two months  i keep getting the runaround and nobody will call me  i ve contacted amazon and they refused to help  i spent over      on this machine and now it s useless      
2022,5.0,                       really nice  sturdy  folds up nice and easy  doesn t take a ton of space  and overall good quality  had amazon assemble it  seemed easy enough for the guy  really good quality for the price  it s a good model if you want something sturdy that can take a beating  but don t want the high tech  giant treadmills with the computer screens that cost too much      
2023,5.0,                       great treadmill  this is my first experience with treadmills  so i don t have anything to compare it with  but it does everything we need  we can walk or run at different inclines and speeds  there are built in programs that we can use  but we could also connect to ifit to gain a bunch of others  for a fee   either way this was a great buy and is still being used      
2024,5.0,                       we aren t able to get outside and walk much so getting this treadmill helps a lot   this nordictrack treadmill was easy for one mechanically inclined person to put together   it runs smoothly and quietly   i m happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others       
2025,3.0,                       i like the treadmill but i was not impressed with ifit program and having to sign up for their program to get the machine to come on   it came with a   month trial of ifit  but i had to provide my credit card to get the  treadmill to work   i will be using the manual setting and not their workouts   people should have a choice for this feature or not      
2026,5.0,                       very sturdy and large treadmill but at the sane time very easy to fold and can fit easily in a spare bedroom      
2027,5.0,                       this seems like a quality treadmill  i am pleased to have boughten this item      
2028,2.0,                       my brand new machine arrived with a damaged motor  i spent about    minutes online trying to troubleshoot the issue on the nordic track website to no avail  then i called customer support  the menu to get to a human is long and cumbersome  if you do not have your model and serial number the electronic system hangs up on you  i reached a customer service rep only to be disconnected and have to dial in through the menu all over again  it took another hour of my time to sort through it with the mobile app allowing customer care to see the machine  circuit board  and motor to determine that it was an issue with a bad motor  customer care could really use some improvements      
2029,5.0,                       i like working out in the safety of my own home i didn t have to wait for the gyms to reopen it s easy for this   yr grandma to fold up and working out is much easier at home i pick and choose my times to work out and your more likely to continue working out because you are at home and don t have to get dressed to go out great machine good price easy to assemble easy to fold up or down great workout     
2030,5.0,                       excellent treadmill for the price  solid and works perfiect      
2031,5.0,                       took about and hour to assemble  probably faster with a second person  anyway  it looks great in my garage  i m impressed every time i walk by it      
2032,4.0,                       good treadmill  i don t know that the speed is accurate  had this treadmill for   months now  easily assembled  only down side is that i run pretty hard on this and it has developed a squeak      
2033,4.0,                       arrived on schedule   fairly easy to assemble   caution about the dimensions   they are not accurate as to the assembled unit as a whole   was longer than i thought it would be and did not fit in the spot i originally intended      
2034,5.0,                       this nordictrack treadmill t    is a fantastic replacement for my old proform treadmill   i had that one for    years   hopefully the nordictrack will last just as long   it s extremely quiet  and smooth   much quieter than i was expecting  i had some problems with the console  but after contact cs  they sent out a replacement for the console   great customer service   it took a little longer to resolve than i had hoped  but most likely due to the pandemic   all in all  if you re considering a treadmill  nordictrack is the way to go      
2035,5.0,                       the nordictrack treadmill is so easy to use  i love the electric incline and the quick start options for both speed and incline  all of my family members have been very pleased with our purchase  especially since my gym closed for   weeks due to covid        
2036,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill to help train for a race i am doing in a few months  i hate running outside in the cold and dark so i figured something on the cheap side would do  i wasn t expecting much out of the treadmill but it has surpassed my expectations   it s quite  runs well  connects to ifit  and is easy to use  definitely worth the money      
2037,1.0,                       i have no idea how the tredmill actually works  no where in the item description does it tell you that ifit is required to even turn on the tredmill  ifit is an additional      plus a year  which is also not disclosed  in fact ifit wont even give you a price for the subscription until you give them a credit card  it was a complete joke of a product  do not buy this piece of crap  i wouldnt even give it a   star except its forced upon me      
2038,1.0,                       i thought i would buy this for the convenience of rolling out of bed and doing cardio  spent a lot of time install it and just turned out some parts are missing  what a xxx   also there s scratch when unboxed  it will be so hard for us to disassemble   send it back  i am very unhappy with this purchase  ready to return for refund       
2039,5.0,                       find it somewhat difficult to figure out ifit and am still not using  had professionally put together but really didn t receive a thorough explanation  so glad we purchased  however  since we live in the northeast in the middle of a pandemic  the treadmill provides a way to stay fit      
2040,5.0,                       this is a career saver   i lacked time to go to the gym so i got the treadmill in order to fit work outs into my day   there are a multitude of programs  it was slightly easy to put together  i m not inclined to be talented in that way  and works incredibly well      
2041,5.0,                       great treadmill only con was that i received it scratched and it s brand new  customer service helped me out for the inconvenience thank you      
2042,1.0,                       i have not been able to use my nordictrack  when arrived the screen was shattered  i reported this immediately   registered my product as instructed   still have not received a replacement part  this is going on  months that i can t use something i m paying for  i ve left several emails with still no replacement part  i just want the replacement part so i can start using my nordictrack     
2043,4.0,                       excellent treadmill except few nuisances   belt tends to gradually track to the left thus requires regular adjustment  nevertheless  it s good practice to inspect the equipment often   no feature  specifically bluetooth  is available if not registered      
2044,1.0,                       arrived with the belt already very dirty  see picture  assembly quite difficult and requires a  lot  of different tools that are not included  some screws do not fit the holes requires a surge protector which is not includedonce assembled  you can t use the product  need to go online and activate it  which requires a credit card number   once credit card number given  account created  warranty info   co  but seems their website is broken  see screenshot  so i am here with a fully assembled treadmill  ifit with my credit card number and not able to use the product       
2045,5.0,                       you have to have a friend to help you assemble it  once assembled it folds up to make it very easy to closet up  i m    and love it  went     miles today  i live in michigan too cold outside  easy to use and a very nice piece of equipment  never had to cal support  my friend was very mechanically adept      
2046,4.0,                       i have been seaching for a reasonably priced treadmill at home and  thankfully  my patience paid off  have been using this for a few months now  both running and walking  and it does everything i want it to  the only drawback is that i wish the display would do both time and distance simultaneously instead of switching between the two  did not take long to assemble and i was able to do it alone following the enclosed directions  well worth it      
2047,5.0,                       really enjoying my nordic track treadmill  the functionality is very good and the controls are easy to work  this product is extremely sturdy and well made  assembly was not overly difficult and would likely count as your first workout   follow instructions to avoid rework       
2048,5.0,                       first off  delivery team were awesome  unit was placed where i asked  next assembly  clear instructions  all parts accounted for  appx    min  assembly time   registered unit  began a short workout unit was great      
2049,2.0,                       i ve only used it   times and when walking its so squeaky it s obnoxious  i wouldn t recommend      
2050,4.0,                       i am thrilled that the whole family has jumped on to use this treadmill  we originally purchased it just for the wife   i love the ifit features  the only problem we have had is that the running belt squeaks and customer support is impossible to reach we did not attempt to assemble it  we hired an amazon tech to do it and he was fantastic  he waited around until we were comfortable using all of the different features and he threw away all of the packing      
2051,4.0,                       takes   people to assemble  some bolts and screws areas are difficult to reach  one part  had   lefts  couldn t talk with anyone till registered  registration difficult  wouldn t hold purchased from  can t talk with anyone till registered  even amazon rep tried  finally after   days got registered  still waiting on my part  very noisy     
2052,4.0,                       we love it but had to register to ifit to use it but thought i read we didn t  belt is nice and tight  stops really quick l so something to get used to  we like all the different settings  definitely need two people to set up and took almost   hours from unpacking to cleanup      
2053,5.0,                       bought this treadmill after much review reading  i wanted one with plenty of walking space  incline  speed adjust  audio plug in  and a track recorder for a good product   it gave me all of that  you can go cheaper  but why      
2054,1.0,                        about     through the set up   it has you have person   hold the tredmill above your head while you spend     minutes trying to attach the hydraulic bar underneath   the bar was too long and i could not get it to adjust   it slipped and slit my hand  blood everywhere   wife getting tired  she does not want me to be crushed and die ifit  horrible idea design   should not exist in the first palce   second  it used bluetooth to activete the machine    but it says  looking for machine   mcfly  my bluetooth isn t even on    your app is telling me  im sending out a bluetooth signal  reality  bluetooth isn t on      gimick  scam  horrible      
2055,4.0,                       i read a lot of reviews before buying this and have not encountered any of the issues experienced by others  it was really easy to assemble and took less than two hours  it s not too loud  works really well  and is just what we were hoping for  it s easy to fold and move on our hardwood floor  the only thing that would make it better would be for the speaker volume to be louder      
2056,1.0,                       the sensors on this treadmill shocked us when our hands were wet at all    the purpose of a treadmill is to workout and sweat   this seemed dangerous    we returned it    took awhile to get a credit for it       
2057,1.0,                       the treadmill may be just fine  but a company that holds your product hostage until you give your credit card should be ashamed  i have long heard the name nordictrack and assumed it to be a reputable company  guess i was very wrong  i would return it if i didn t already spend the time to assemble it   when you first turn it on it is disabled  to enable it you must get an app      month  in order to activate  oh yes you can cancel before the month is over  you must enter your credit card to continue  amazon say you get a year free  you only get   month   i m sure the app gives additional features  let me choose then if i want them  don t force me      
2058,5.0,                       i have had this treadmill for about   months and have not had any problems   i use it about   times a week and my wife does almost as often  it is really heavy so it would be helpful to get delivered to the room that you will be setting it up in   my wife and i put it together in a little under       hours  it is not too difficult if you follow the directions i love the ifit program that comes with it for the first year   it has been really helpful in staying motivated   i wasn t sure if i would use it much   i plan on renewing the subscription after the year is up      
2059,4.0,                       pretty compact  decent  affordable and good looking  i enjoy it overall and of course having a treadmill at home is a game changer      
2060,5.0,                       not too bad to assemble  but a lot of floor assembly  making it a little difficult for my    year old husband   but  he did it  and we love the machine      
2061,5.0,                       very easy to use machine  my husband and i love how easy it is to use with the fit and switch to manual use  it doesn t take up a tonne of room and folding it is easy as well  it is a heavy machine though  you may need help lifting it if you are not used to lifting things      
2062,5.0,                       i liked the big screen and the ifit feature  even if you do not connect with ifit there are lot of workouts available  overall value for money and it works great  very easy to install but requires   person and some time but very much doable      
2063,2.0,                       this treadmill folds up nicely and is not loud  the cushion under the belt makes a smooth impact  occasionally it feels like the belt slips if i m not going at the same speed of the belt  has done it less now that i m used to the speeds  biggest complaint is the incline does not work  so i ended up wasting the ifit free trial since i couldn t try any of the paths      
2064,5.0,                       i like this treadmill as a replacement for my nordic trac      it was easy to assemble and i only walk on it as part on my daily routine  for    minutes i dislike the manual mode idle timeout that causes me to lose session totals  and hope to find a way to disable that excellent value      
2065,1.0,                       do not buy this product     absolutely horrible  putting it together was very difficult  the screws were not the right size and i was on the phone with nordic track for   hours  they sent me new pieces and i finally finished putting it together  used it for the first time and it something sparked and the system blew out  horrible service  horrible product      
2066,5.0,                       we are pleased with our nordictrak t  assembly was a bit longer than i had anticipated but it went well  the machine runs smoothly and quietly  the led works well which making adjustments easy  we are pleased we got it      
2067,3.0,                       i assembled the treadmill but cannot start it for the reason i have to download an app then subscribe for     per month which i don t want  i don t see other options  it took me a while more to start the machine than assemble and still didn t figure out  now  i have the machine assembled and ready to return      
2068,1.0,                       they force you to set up an ifit account in order to turn the treadmill on   you are required to provide credit card information in order to set up the account for the  free trial    after i activated my treadmill i was able to go into ifit and cancel my membership   this really should be illegal      
2069,4.0,                       this treadmill was a nightmare to assemble omg and then you call their help line and they put you on hold for trillion minutes  i was about to return it back      
2070,5.0,                       love this for walking and running great foe home gym     
2071,1.0,                       the treadmill comes with a sticker on the front that reads  your smart treadmill is currently locked   it will not start until you go to ifit com    at ifit com you have no other choice but to enter your address and credit card imformation and sign up for a     month membership   as well as having to download the app on your iphone to connect to the machine just to get it to turn on   i canceled the membership once the machine was able to turn on  but would have never bought this machine if i knew i had to provide my personal information and credit card number in order to get it to turn on      
2072,5.0,                       we purchased this treadmill when all the gyms closed and it has been great to have   it  was very easy to assemble and easy to use   it is very smooth walking on it and the incline works great   love that there are a lot of program options to use as well      
2073,5.0,                       we are very pleased with our purchase   and the guy who came to put together the treadmill was simply terrific   the delivery company texted me to confirm delivery date   time   paid the extra   to have it delivered into the house and into the correct room   guys were great   the guy who assembled the treadmill also texted me that day before and again the day of delivery letting me know he was on the way   honestly our experience was so good that shopping in a retail store just seems like too much trouble      
2074,1.0,                       we have purchased a lot of items through amazon and by far  this is the worse product ever purchased the mfg starts several hole for screws  but the stews are put it in at an angle  i would state cross threated but that assumes there was tread to start istead they use starter screws but when you use the ones that come in the package  they won t go it nothing lines up   if i could return it  i would  horrible         
2075,5.0,                       did my first workout this morning using the ifit app  it was awesome   the treadmill is great  feels secure  and good on my knees and hips  the jog was awesome on the app  i jogged through dresden  germany at christmas time  the guide was great   not sure if i m missing something  but i don t think you need the bigger screen on the treadmill  i have the    screen and it s good  the workout is on the app on my ipad  absolutely worth the price     
2076,5.0,                       love this nt treadmill after   months    had to get rid of a sunny treadmill within   months due to motor failure   nt is smooth and wide with an onboard stereo that plugs into your phone   the ifit programs are really good and synchronize seamlessly with the nordictrac treadmill   sometimes i wish i could go higher than      incline   but everything else is great so far   recommend and worth the extra bit of money      
2077,5.0,                       we have loved this treadmill so far   it s really quiet while either walking or jogging   even for the plus sized ppl in our family   the assembly went smoothly and the instructions were very self explanatory   it s a very substantial piece of equipment   nothing flimsy or wobbly about it  i did allot of research before purchasing and we are very satisfied and would recommend this one to anyone     
2078,5.0,                       the biggest problem we had was connecting to the nordic track as our wifi is poor  once we got connected we love it  we have below zero weather with lots of snow on the roads so walking for   months out of the year is tough  with the nordic track walker we can put in our   miles a day with ease  we are happier and healthier      
2079,4.0,                       i really enjoy the added feature of ifit walks and hikes      
2080,2.0,                       screen and incline broke after light use  not very sturdy      
2081,2.0,                       beware that while this is a great treadmill  it kept tripping my circuit breaker when turned on  i got the surge protector and arc filters that were supposed to stop this issue   but it didn t make a difference  i now have an electrician come in and re wire things to give me a    amp dedicated circuit for this treadmill  the only solution   and an expensive one at that      
2082,5.0,                       very heavy and very solid  it took two of us to assemble but well worth the effort   i went through three other cheap treadmills before getting this excellent one   i highly recommend it to any one serious about exercise      
2083,5.0,                       this has been great so far  it was a little time consuming to assemble but it was a treadmill that came in the mail after all so really not bad all things considered  very easy to use  very sturdy running platform  i like it a lot      
2084,5.0,                       i paid for installation and it was worth it   got on right away to try it out and i am very happy   as others have stated speakers are not the best but i am content with them for normal volume   cant beat it for the price      
2085,4.0,                       so  look up  how to bypass if it nordictrack t   s   you re welcome        
2086,3.0,                       you cannot use this treadmill unless you activate it with a bluetooth device that is connected to the internet  though creating and signing up for a free demo membership with ifit  personally i find this to be completely unacceptable  the only reason i gave it   stars  is because the treadmill itself  once activated work great      
2087,4.0,                       decent price for the quality of the product  seriously though    i m an engineer in the navy and i m having difficulty putting it together    some of the parts don t exactly fit so i had to replace them with my own nuts and bolts  not sure if that s an issue with how it was built or an issue with the parts i was sent      
2088,5.0,                       i have only had it a couple of days and i love it   it is well made  quiet  and exactly what i needed  i run     days per week and really try to get outside as much as possible but i needed something for bad weather days  i have walked and run on this every day since purchasing   it took my husband and i about     hours to assemble but it wasn t hard   i bypassed the ifit easily as well  so far i am enjoying this purchase  for the price it is a great machine      
2089,5.0,                       i had a service assemble the nordictrack   it works great   is quiet and sturdy   would buy again      
2090,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill for the cost  i wanted something simple and don t need a lot of bells and whistles  this treadmill fits the bill  simple and easy to use i did not put it together myself  so i am not sure how hard it is      
2091,5.0,                       needed a home treadmill to keep up exeecise routine and this has definitely met my expectations  kind of a pain to assemble but i considered it a bonus workout  biggest issue was a few screw holes were not drilled big enough   assembled now and has worked great      
2092,5.0,                       assembly was a b      my husband is super handy and mechanically gifted and it took over   hours with that being said  i just did my first ifit run and i love it  love everything about it so far  totally worth it  glad i went with this and not a sole in similar price range  i just couldn t get over the antiquated console and grips  glad i decided on this one  update  still love after using consistently for several weeks      
2093,5.0,                       this machine is my second nordictrack treadmill  last one lasted     years  and the third nordictrack device in my workout room  elliptical and bike    the screen has gotten really nice and the  live  workouts are perfect for following along at whatever pace you need   the folding and unfolding of this treadmill is very easy for anyone to do as there is a piston that slows the unfolding down so all you have to do is start it coming down and it does it nice and gently      
2094,1.0,                       takes long time to start  when you hold handle your foot is to forward to walk comfortably   what a mistake i did  i badly write bad reviews  this a bad one   avoid   did dummy designers even get on this and try it it is comfortable to use or not      
2095,5.0,                       love this treadmill  using it everyday since delivery      
2096,5.0,                       this treadmill is everything i  hoped for in size  reliability and function  i do not fold it up but i know i could do it easily   the ifit training membership has been fun and motivating   now my daughter and husband use the treadmill at home instead of the gym on a daily basis   i am getting my workout in after work and on rainy days   nordictrack delivers      
2097,5.0,                       the nordictrack t series    s treadmill was my first ever treadmill purchase and i am pleasantly surprised with how well it works and the relatively quiet operation   having the treadmill in the home allows me to go for a walk or jog even on the snowiest of days   my daughter and wife both have  jumped on   pun intended  and have created their own excercise regime on this unit   it really was a good purchase and does what it needs to do   the price was well below some of those other fancy machines cost and i would recommend to all      
2098,4.0,                       easy to assemble  all the way thru step    without help   did need assistance to hold up the deck while installing the piston that supports the raising and lowering for storage   quiet  with lots of the bells and whistles i was looking for     
2099,5.0,                       we purchased the    si and are super happy with it  we hate putting things together  but it was more manageable than we expected  and got it done in a few hours of taking it super slow  my husband hates workout classes  so he doesn t use the ifit component  but i absolutely love it and find it incredibly motivating  there are so many to chose from  that there s really something for everyone it folds up easily  and works great  so i consider it a successful quarantine purchase      
2100,1.0,                       cheap quality super tough to assemble  forces you to register with ifit and give out lot of info to them  just turn off the ifit button and use it if you dont want to pay for the subscription   also the console base is off   inches you need to push the pillars together with lot of force i would rate it a zero for ease of assembly       
2101,5.0,                       we researched treadmills for a while and then decided on this one   we like that it has a wider track to walk run on and that it can hold up to     lbs   i have not been able to find another treadmill that does what this does for anywhere near the price      
2102,1.0,                       first ordered and it was undeliverable after   weeks  purchased another received after   weeks  however its now missing a main long metal piece that the screens sits on  spoke with support and they will deliver it     weeks  so far bad experience  hopefully item works      
2103,2.0,                       ordered this as a christmas gift for my parents and it started to malfunction after just   months   the most concerning and extremely dangerous thing was that the treadmill started to skip speeds while they were using it   my father  hit the speed setting of   and the treadmill jumped to a speed of     causing him to fall and get hurt   i ve been trying to contact nordic track for some time now unsuccessfully     
2104,5.0,                       absolutely love the treadmill  very easy to assemble and had no issues staring it up and using it right away  you can by pass the ifit activation by holding down the ifit button for a few seconds otherwise you get a    day free trial with     dollars a month after      
2105,3.0,                       we purchased this treadmill in october         months ago  and use it lightly   maybe   to   times per month  it is easy to use  looks nice  etc   but in recent weeks  there is a loud squeaking noise when i walk in it that is very annoyingl  i m going to call the manufacturer and see if it s an easy fix      
2106,3.0,                       i would like to give this item a   star or   star but over half of the features do not work correctly  but if you are looking for a machine that does just the basics this is a good buy  the things wrong with my machine is the speed buttons do not work correctly  for example  mph shows as     mph on the screen  the heart rate monitor is way off  also adjusting the belt is a pain in the neck  there are no notches or labeling and it is in a very awkward spot to adjust  making it an inexact science to tighten or loosen the belt because you could tighten one side of the belt more than the other      
2107,5.0,                       we use the treadmill for walking and running  we are an older couple that want to be active  the treadmill is very sturdy and works well to our satisfaction  completely happy with the purchase  the treadmill was assembled by tech support  the tech was finished early so assembly must be fairly easy     
2108,5.0,                       this treadmill comes with a lot of pieces  as expected  if you are planning to put it together yourself   my boyfriend said it was pretty straightforward  though   too overwhelming for me   once it was assembled it was ready for me   it is great  it feels sturdy and does not shake when i run   the treadmill is quiet and does not bother my sleeping daughter in the morning   ifit is great  too   never thought i would enjoy having a screen on my treadmill   but  it helps with my motivation   lots of workouts to choose from      
2109,1.0,                       treadmill arrived broken  delivery was confusing  i received inconsistent delivery notifications and the delivery days kept changing  not a good experience   very disappointed      
2110,5.0,                       so after a week of extensive research on  best at home treadmills for first time buyers   this is the one i chose  for the price and delivery convenience it is amazing  it will take a couple of hours to put together tho as there are quite a but of screws and wires to thread      
2111,5.0,                       got into running this summer and didn t want snow or ice to disrupt my training this winter  i ve been running on this when the weather prevents me from going outside now for two months  i wanted a basic treadmill  no led touchscreens or other bells   whistles  and this fit the bill  it was easy enough to put together with a little help and has worked great  no problems what so ever  my only complaint is that it only reports your speed in mph  whereas minute per mile would be preferred      
2112,4.0,                       what s not to like  my gym has been closed for six months with no end in sight  i was afraid i would not be able to get a treadmill but amazon came through again  it s been a life saver it did take a little extra effort to set it up  i did mine in the driveway as you need a lot of room to spread things out      
2113,5.0,                       i have been using this treadmill     times a week and absolutely love it   the belt and motor are strong enough turn effortlessly under my    lb frame beating down on it with every step   it s easy to assemble  folds up nicely for convenience  and looks great   awesome product for the price        
2114,1.0,                       do not buy  i only got on it twice before the motor controller went out  it took weeks to get a replacement part  now i gotta figure out how to replace it      
2115,5.0,                       super easy to follow directions for assembly  took about   hours in total to assemble but was very easy  the directions will say you can t operate without activating ifit  just press and hold the ifit button for    seconds and you can use manually  i ve been running on this every day for   weeks now without any issue      
2116,5.0,                       works great  hard to build but not any harder than i would expect it to be  the only down side is the ifit membership you have to start to get it to work  but its cheap and well worth it in my opinion  my whole family uses it and we love it      
2117,4.0,                          speed and incline settings  and deck width are great  only real issue is black dust on floor coming from the right rear of the treadmill  submitted a maintenence qwery  and a followup  online with the nordictrack customer service and haven t heard anything from them in five weeks      
2118,1.0,                       the order delivery experience is horrific  you will deal will heavy and bulky items dept side of amazon  you will lose your appetite you shall be hearing baby stories like  the truck broke down   you know   just dont  your order won t arrive for months and it will cost you hours of back and forth      
2119,5.0,                       it is a good treadmill  it takes about an hour to set up  you will need two people for this   we are using the treadmill now since   month and had no issues  this is a good quality product with a nice design      
2120,1.0,                       ifit makes it impossible to use this product without signing up with your credit card for a    days free trial but good luck cancelling it after    days as you can not get a in touch with them on the phone or on their extremely difficult and non functional website what a shame  i am returning an installed treadmill just to avoid ifit      
2121,5.0,                       we ve had the treadmill for several weeks and it is working well  we are only using this walk on and are not running on it  it is noisier than we expected  especially when adjusting the height  the package was really heavy and the assembly took time and patience      
2122,5.0,                       great treadmill for the price i paid for it  it s a ton quieter than my old pro form treadmill  i like the preset speeds on the right of the control panel where you can hit the presets      and the treadmill will automatically take you to that speed in miles per hour  i did try out the ifit and personally didn t care for it  i prefer streaming the peloton app on my tv for their treadmill classes and then control my treadmill manually  also a plus are the large cup holders where i can put my water  phone  tv remote  etc      
2123,5.0,                       this is perfect for me  it is sturdy and well made  the belt is plenty wide and long enough  i just walk on it with an incline so i am not sure about running but it fits my need perfectly  you don t have to buy the monthly subscription to get it to work even though it says you do  you just have to hold the ifit button down for like    seconds and it activates the treadmill  it is really heavy so it was worth the extra fee to have someone bring it upstairs for me  i highly recommend this      
2124,5.0,                       very happy with this purchase  the amazon team delivered and setup  i like the ability to change the speed to the tenth by pushing number rather than having to adjust by the arrow keys  the training app i use   requires constant switching of speeds between     and     or     etc so this feature makes the transitioning much easier      
2125,1.0,                       do not buy from norditrackworse purchase ever  stopped working    days later  support does not pick up phone  bought an extended warranty and they say  sorry can t help you  when called   i feel like such a sucker      
2126,3.0,                       why so much assembling  never put one together before but goodness i did almost all of it and by myself  i couldn t complete it because i didn t get all the bolts i need    contacted norditrak today but no response yet  hope i enjoy it as much as i think i will     
2127,3.0,                       the pulse bars do not work  when i called the company the woman who answered the phone stated  they never work  you can try to get a reading by taking   readings and select the third reading as your heart rate   when i do that my rate is about     so that isn t accurate either  when she heard the horrible noise the motor made randomly she ordered a new motor shipped to us  we call a repair person per her instructions when it arrived  his response to the pulse issue was  oh they never work on any treadmill   not even the expensive ones  the motor was quiet when he was here so he didn t replace the motor we like the nordic track other than the pulse meter not working so will just do without it      
2128,5.0,                       great treadmill  for the price  you probably would not find better one  took me about    minutes to assemble but it runs really stable even at the max speed     
2129,1.0,                       do not buy if you are tall   i m      with long legs   my strides are long so i hit the plastic up front   i have to walk run away from the screen to accommodate my stride and then cannot reach the screen controls   since i have to walk away from the screeen the handrails are also too short and cannot be used   also the controls are very low for a tall person   you cannot set the time in manual mode to count down or enter youre weight for an accurate calorie count   definately disappointed for the price      
2130,4.0,                       works well and is longer than i thought it would be  it is heavy as hell to carry in by yourself and definitely requires two people for assembly  it serves its purpose as a treadmill  however the right cup holder arrived broken  only four stars for this reason      
2131,4.0,                       i have walked or run on this treadmill every day since i got it   it isn t quite as stable as the gym treadmills   it is also a bit loud but nothing a good pair of wireless earphones can t handle   for these two reasons  i gave it   stars instead of     for the money  it has been a great treadmill so far      
2132,5.0,                       i have had treadmill for   months and seems to be working well   i use it     times a week running   miles and has plenty of room on belt for running   it takes about an   hour to set up and you will need another person to help   the only draw back was i scheduled a date for delivery and waited around all day for the delivery but it was never delivered   i had to reschedule another delivery date so it was a waste of a day waiting around   i would recommend calling the morning of the delivery to make sure its on schedule      
2133,5.0,                       i decided to cancel my fitness membership and buy a treadmill  after few reviews i bought nordictrack t series and turned into a good decision  easy to assemble  comes with ifit that brings a lot of programs to exercise and size is just right for a home      
2134,5.0,                       good size and wide and long enough for most users easy self install  couple of hours but need two for some parts  one ofthe side bars under screen was hard to fit basic screen options variable speed and incline folds up for storage consspeaker volume very low heart rate sensor not very accurate      
2135,4.0,                       i am very happy with this purchase  i wanted a steady treadmill without spending a ton and i got exactly that   it s very durable and i can run with ease   i am not mechanically inclined and somehow i assembled this all by myself with ease    very pleased with my purchase      
2136,5.0,                       love this treadmill is a great deal  easy to assemble has a long tread so easy to run on for myself who is           lb haven t had any squeaky or other noises  would recommend this treadmill     
2137,5.0,                       amazon offered free assembly of the treadmill  that was a big timesaver   very solid product   the control screen is great and the audio sounds really good on both if it programs and phone plugged in   the belt is cushioned and very comfortable for walking and running   very happy with my purchase      
2138,5.0,                       this nordictrack t series treadmills     s     si     s     s     s models  hits the sweet spot between price and quality  a best value for our family as we walk and jog our way to better health  this treadmill has helped us exercise inside and away from the worry of covid    we also enjoyed the trial ifit app for experiencing a guided walk  jog  run or workout and possibly purchasing a years worth of membership for their special pricing of       a month we would purchase again      
2139,5.0,                       i did quite a bit of research before i decided to purchase a treadmill and i am happy with this one  it was easy to put together  took me about an hour or so and the workouts on ifit are great you can choose to opt out of the membership and still use your treadmill on manual  overall  pretty happy and satisfied with the machine i run about    miles a week on it and have had it for about   months now   no problems so far      
2140,1.0,                       issue with screws   they don t fit  first grounding screw   then in step     pulse crossbar to handrail screws are not proper   can t assemble it     
2141,5.0,                       its awesome  just fyi   when you finally get assembled the activate ifit on the screen wont go away until you either activate ifit which i didnt want  or you have to call nordictrack in order for them to allow you to operate treadmill  otherwise   great  easy to put together considering i am a    year old woman with no man to help    hours  so worth it      
2142,4.0,                       i ve had my treadmill for about   weeks now and i really like it  it s very sturdy  the belt is a good width and length  the only thing i might ask for would be more incline  this treadmill has a max incline of      but other than that i have absolutely no complaints  it runs great and is not very loud i would recommend having a second person with you when assembling it though      
2143,1.0,                       assembly takes quite a while  i was also missing some pieces  i emailed their customer service who have been absolutely no help and take a long time to return emails  otherwise it works great  get it if you don t care about customer service      
2144,2.0,                       i ve felt coerced by companies before  but this was by far the worst  you literally can t use the      product until you pay them more money  you realize this after you spending   hours screwing bolts into metal with a cheap tool  it s really sad to realize some execs just don t care plug in safety key and hold down the ifit button for   sec and then it works and never ever use ifit or buy nordictrack again because shame on them      
2145,5.0,                       received my treadmill last week  it was fairly easy to put together  but you do need   people  i ve used it practically every day and it s been great  the only negative thing   it s difficult to align the tread on the center of the ramp  the screw is hidden inside the ramp and it s hard to find it with the wrench  nordictrack should allow an opening for it so you can see it better      
2146,5.0,                       i really can t say enough good things about this product  i feel nordic track produces an outstanding treadmill in both its quality  and ease regarding use  i have bad knees  but the belt provides such a soft surface to either walk or jog on  juxtaposed to black top  that it makes jogging a pleasure again  i would also say that the ifit feature is an added benefit for motivation  as well as inspiration providing achievable goals      
2147,5.0,                       this is mine and my husband s first treadmill and we are so amazed by how easy it is to work and the quality of the machine for such a great price  i use it about   times per week i m in love with it  i was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews and getting it online but i say it was worth it      
2148,5.0,                       love this machine  it took my husband and i about    minutes to put together  easy to follow assembly  the ifit app is easy to navigate  the workouts are challenging  but it makes working out fun  the belt is very quiet while running  i love the     incline  it honestly feels like the     incline treadmills  i ve used at the gym  we purchased this machine due to the closures of fitness clubs caused by covid  i m glad i made this decision   i found my new gym with this gem  you will not be disappointed with this machine      
2149,5.0,                       this treadmill is great  my wife and i have had it for a few weeks  we both use it a few times a week as well as our german shepherd  the treadmill is simple to use and has great speed and incline options  also  my wife and i assembled it ourselves  it took us about two hours from unboxing to fully assembled  assembly does require two people  for certain steps  and i d like to note that we are inexperienced with assembling treadmills  we gambled by opting out of the  expert assembly  but it ended up being doable      
2150,5.0,                       this machine has been such a great addition for our family to use  fairly easy to assemble and the interface is very user friendly ifit has guided us through a harsh winter in the northern midwest by traveling virtually to the beaches of costa rica and the mountains of switzerland      
2151,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  and i love the ifit workouts  at first i was annoyed that i had to get the ifit trial subscription but am so glad i checked it out    after just one workout  i subscribed for a year  i bought this treadmill because my husband was terminally ill so i needed to run at home instead of the gym or outside   i even assembled it myself with no trouble because of the detailed  easy to follow instructions  it s quiet  long and wide enough to comfortably run on  and folds easily  highly recommend      
2152,3.0,                       i brought this treadmill assembled it and it did not come on after it was assembled  i am still  waiting on a refund  i will say that it is very nice  it looks so good but unfortunately it did not work      
2153,4.0,                       so i put this treadmill together myself  followed the directions to a t  couldn t get some of the screws to completely screw in  now  i believe  it wobbles when i m walking on it because the screws are not finished  it still works fine  the incline works well  other than being a little wiggly  it s ok      
2154,5.0,                       love  love my nordic track treadmill  i ve been using it every day  i can just jump on it whenever i have the time  my kids love the convenience of having it in the garage and they use it too  i also love  ifit   working out in different parts of the world with a whole bunch of trainers to choose from is amazing      
2155,4.0,                       my husband and i gave the treadmill to each other for christmas this year  took about an hour and a half to assemble and it meets our needs  would love to be able to use the ifit app with it but don t need the additional monthly expense as we are both retired and on a fixed income      
2156,5.0,                       first things first  the box is big and heavy  putting the item together is easy but you will definitely need two people  the machine itself is amazing  it runs smoothly and is fairly quiet  it comes with ifit feature which i totally enjoy  i m currently   lbs down  this treadmill is affordable and will help you reach your fitness goals      
2157,1.0,                       after reading the reviews  i erroneously chose to ignore the bad reviews  nordictrack is selling an inferior product and cannot back it up   the product arrived defective and remained put of order in spite of several attempts by nordictrack to correct the problem  the electrical and mechanical system  the heart of the threadmill  were not in working order  norditract shipped the parts the first time and they arrived defective  then  after insisting on a technician to come and fix it   they shipped the parts again but the technician never showed up even after contacting me once and promising he was going to track the parts and he was going to set up a time once the parts arrived   i finally called amazin to return it and they tried to charge me a restocking fee      
2158,5.0,                       the best purchase i have ever made  i had been shopping for treadmills for over a month  was looking for something that was gym quality but under        this is an awesome treadmill for the price point  very heavy duty and doesn t shake when you run  you are able to bypass ifit without purchasing a membership by holding down the button for    seconds as others had mentioned  looking forward to getting back into running everyday delivery was also on time and drivers called    minutes before they arrived which was convenient  chose to assemble myself which took about an hour and a half nothing crazy      
2159,1.0,                       incline doesn t work out of the box  ticket open pending   hopefully they can fix it else not sure how to ship this treadmill back  another negative is that it requires    day subscription to ifit before first use  the units display is locked until subscription is activated  credit card info required   also if you dont cancel before    days its     a month automatically  as for putting it together there were some screws pre attached on step    page     that were almost impossible to take out in order to attach the pulse crowbar      
2160,5.0,                       my husband and i put this together in a few hours  it was pretty simple to put together and the directions were clear  my biggest concern was activating ifit  i looked at previous reviews and followed the directions to bypass the ifit registration by putting the safety clip on and holding down the ifit button until the home screen showed up  overall it s a great treadmill and we are very happy with our purchase      
2161,1.0,                       arrived damaged   belt and machine  also did not include instructions or pieces  screws  etc   to put the machine together      
2162,5.0,                       we bought this treadmill once the pandemic started to workout and i have been using it for almost     months now  i have no issues with with the treadmill at all  the noise issues that people complain is the usual noise that comes from any treadmill in this price range  the belt is wide enough for me to feel comfortable about it  i love this product and work out everyday  i wish this treadmill had bluetooth compatible speakers but thats just my pet peeve  gret product      
2163,5.0,                       purchased the nordictrack as my sports club closed due to covid   and having recently had spinal fusion surgery needed to continue my rehab   best exercise per my surgeon was walking    and walking   and walking    the nordictrack was initially purchased for my rehab however now everyone in the family is using it    i have cancelled my membership    love the produt     
2164,5.0,                       the installation is straight forward  but time consuming  about   hour if you are quick i like the interface of the app  looking forward to try more times  will report back in a month or a couple of months      
2165,1.0,                       i purchased this a few months ago  and placed it in my living room  after using this treadmill for approx     hours total  the control unit went bad piece of garbage      
2166,5.0,                       love  love  love this machine and ifit    assembly was only a bit challenging  but my daughter and i mastered it  love the professionalism quality and sturdiness of the machine      
2167,4.0,                       great as a mid tier treadmill  can t speak to assembley as amazon support handled it  really easy to fold up down  i docked stars as the mat has slipped to the side once already  it was easy to realign with provided instructions      
2168,5.0,                       the treadmill is a bit on the noisy side even after lubricating the belt  however ifit vidoes are really great and thats the only advantage of this machine  the price could be around     with the single ifit membership instead of      with   members      
2169,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          love this treadmill  works great        
2170,5.0,                       this treadmill is fantastic  i m a    lb woman and i run pretty hard on this machine at least once a day  and sometimes twice  it s as sturdy as anything at the gym   i would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a good cardio workout at home  assembly is not difficult  but goes much more quickly with a second person      
2171,1.0,                       this treadmill is poorly designed  for example  it has no cool down features after a pre set run  some of the buttons are packed so close together that they are easy to press if you are running and trying to adjust a setting  multiple times i have accidentally pressed a button only to have the entire treadmill immediately stop  i would not recommend this treadmill      
2172,3.0,                       missing crossbar part     hopefully  nordic will cooperate and send the piece that is missing  otherwise  amazon will be getting the product back  seems like it s a nice treadmill otherwise      
2173,5.0,                       i love everything about this  run six  miles every day     
2174,1.0,                       today is aug            when i click on the reviews  i have to skip down about    pages before i see a recent review that was written in        why are older reviews displayed first      
2175,5.0,                       i got this treadmill for my wife s working out it s perfect for beginners and intermediate work out i like itit was easy to be assembled following the included instructions      
2176,5.0,                           pounds and it works great  i didnt need the ifit app  serves its purpose my legs are feeling great  i run but mostly walk on incline    this whole covid thing has me hesitant about leaving home much  i rather stay my behind right here at home and get a awsome work out  oooohh yeeeaahh   great machine and affordable  be smart stay home wear a mask      
2177,1.0,                       not happy with my purchase at all  everything is all set up and ready to go i even had amazon them selves  send over a install team which did an amazing job  so i thought i was going to jump on this thing and start running but it wants me to sign up for something called a ifit  and it wants me to sign up with a credit card   well i do not want to sign up for anything else i just spent a tonna money on the machine and do not want to use my credit card  so the machine is basically a     pound paper weight  trying to send back right now     
2178,5.0,                       great treadmill  full size  incline with the push of a button  heart rate monitor  phone ledge  and plenty of different settings that run smoothly  very sturdy which i love but i can t move it by myself  doesn t fold up completely vertically but still doesn t take up too much room and it also has a locking mechanism for extra safety so when you put it away you know it won t fall down  i figure it will last me a very long time so no complaints        
2179,5.0,                       love this treadmill  i work long hours and have   kids so it makes it hard to get out and run at night or in the morning  this made it perfect so i could run in the morning without leaving my kids home alone  it s quiet  the speed and incline are more than enough since i m not training for a marathon just trying to stay in shape      
2180,5.0,                       i wanted a good  middle of the road treadmill for my home  not the most expensive but not the cheapest   after researching  i chose this model and have been very pleased  i find it very easy to use  i like the layout of the function buttons   and it is a good size for the home  i did not assemble it myself but paid the extra charge and thus far have had no issues  the service man who came to assemble the treadmill was great and very professional      
2181,5.0,                       love this treadmill  the price was great  my brother and i took a couple hours to put it all together but once it was all together it works pretty good  it probably would be worth it to just pay someone to do it  connects to an app it you d like it to  shows a track so you know how many laps you ve done  it s not a state of the art treadmill  but it would be a great addition to any home gym      
2182,4.0,                       this product came in so many pieces most of which had to get forced together  seemed very cheaply designed  pretty disappointed since nordictrack is a great name brand  overall once it was done it looks fine  but definitely glad we got it on sale and didn t pay full price      
2183,5.0,                       we own an    year old elliptical by nordictrack that is still working just fine after heavy use  so  we decided to add the treadmill to out family workout area  everyone uses it  and it seems to be as sturdy and as well made as we ve come to expect from this company   we are considering  adding the rowing machine or bike to our workout equipment in the future  our opinion is we don t think you can go wrong with this purchase      
2184,5.0,                       we are very happy with this treadmill  i wasn t sure about spending the money for the ifit subscription but i m glad i did  they have so many workouts from beginners to experts      
2185,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill  easy to put together and works like a charm  the speed and incline is awesome and i love a good run  i would suggest this to any of my family and friends  we didn t need one with a tv  worth the        
2186,5.0,                       just started using it and am thrilled   easy to assemble and use  we look forward to years of enjoying a workout in our own home      
2187,5.0,                       this treadmill handles the day to day running that my family and i do  easy to fold and very durable construction  the monitor is easy to use as well     
2188,4.0,                       good and fast replacement of damaged items   ordering was easy   instructions fairly easy but confusing in two or three places   operation simple but easy   ifit not really worth the effort and especially the poor reviews on that part of the product   major issue trying to belt to stay in center of track   keep following directions for moving belt but still no success keeping it in center   moving process requires turning a key  but just feels like it keeps getting looser      
2189,1.0,                       arrived damaged  an hour into setup and the setuo guys  who were awesome  showed me the monitor panel was damaged  so they took it apart and carried it away  so disappointing     
2190,5.0,                       every since i have purchased my treadmill  it has been the best thing that i have ordered   it does well the only thing that i question is the fact that when i am walking it has a squeaking sound on it and i do not how to stop it from doing this      
2191,5.0,                       it is a good treadmill  what i do not like is that you have to buy a membership in order to activate the treadmill  i don t want a membership to anything  all i want to do is walk  i tried to cancel the membership but still got charged       how do i get the money back  a big pain in the neck      
2192,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          whoever drilled the screw holes in manufacturing drilled them too small you literally cannot put this together putting a screw in is easy unless it s manufactured like dirt which this is     
2193,5.0,                       i love my new treadmill  i arrived  the guys carried it into my room and in no time at all it was up and running   it s sturdy  quiet and easy to use   i m very pleased and would highly recommend     
2194,5.0,                       putting it together was a little more daunting than the videos that i watched  getting some of the screws started in the holes were very difficult because metal slag was left in those holes  i had to use a cheater bar crank some of those screws down to drop them past the slag so be prepared for that  unless you want a monthly bill they prepare to go to youtube and learn how to bypass so you can actually start the treadmill      
2195,1.0,                       be ready to have this product digitally held hostage while you are forced to sign up for a free trial of ifits personal trainer program  after you do that you can download the app an unlock your treadmill  if you do end up buying one of the products related to this scheme to bilk unsavvy people out of their money  then make sure you go back and cancel the membership because with the personal training add on its around      a month  luckily i canceled it before this could happen  however  people should be aware that this is going to happen if you buy this product      
2196,5.0,                       this is my first treadmill and i don t know why i waited so long  i ve been using it for   month now and it is everything i expected and more  i use the ifit app with it and quite frankly i wouldn t want it any other way   it makes working out much more challenging and fun  for the money i don t think you will find a better treadmill  my research was extensive  it took about   hours to assemble by myself and i took my time  i am very pleased with my purchase      
2197,1.0,                       i would never recommend to buy this through amazon   within   years stopped working     
2198,5.0,                       got this for walking during inclimate weather  fairly quiet for the price  and handles my needs well  i only walk  so i can t speak for running  but the motor handles    mph at an     incline well  i am       and the deck is long enough for my strides      
2199,3.0,                       on my goodness  it took so long to assemble  the treadmill is great but it took two of us a long time to put it together  had i known how hard it would be i would have purchased a different company  i have always really liked the brand but l still have the groundwork that we were never able to get screwed in  we are both good at working together and always get things done quickly with very little frustration but not this time  i usually don t give bad reviews but this about did me in     
2200,4.0,                       knocked it down to   stars only because of the ifit app   the treadmill works beautifully as expected and i like the bluetooth capability  but i do feel very  limited  to having to use ifit as my workout application   it is frustrating having to logon to ifit every single time i want to use the treadmill    i am not allowed to use it in manual mode without selecting  manual  through the ifit app   the technicians at ifit are extremely slow    week    to respond to emails and it was impossible to reach them by phone or online chat      
2201,4.0,                       this is a really great home treadmill  it seems pretty well made and it is super easy to use  besides myself  my german shepard love running on it too  regarding the ifit feature  if you do not want to use it  you can easily turn it off and you do not have to worry about it  if you have a small budget but want a study reliable treadmill  go for this model  i highly recommend it      
2202,4.0,                       after got it assembled it has provided the exercise we were looking for  it can be tied with ifit  separate monthly fee  for workouts  i am pretty impressed at this point      
2203,5.0,                       i have been using this     days week   even if i don t make it to the gym for boxing lessons or lifting weights  this has helped me with my goals   i do have the ifit membership  it s fun to have and helps you push yourself even more      
2204,3.0,                       good machine  you need to have a good open space for it as it is huge mine came with a broken cover  watch our carefully and remove all plastics before starting the assembly  returning it is a pain  lucky me that i buy it in amazon and they gave me a credit back for the broken cover     
2205,5.0,                       it has been great running on this treadmill for a couple months now  can t imagine without this    i could lose some weight and stay active and refreshed  so far so great      
2206,4.0,                       not a fancy tech treadmill but also not a basic cheap one  had it for   months now so far so good  assembly was not too difficult     
2207,5.0,                       we ve had the treadmill for about a month  we love it  my husband and i both like to incline walk and or run and the treadmill is very smooth  the ifit membership is free for the first year and we love it  not sure we ll resubscribe when it expires because it s pretty pricey but for now the classes are amazing  we ordered the setup as well and it was a breeze  the guy came right on time and put it together in under   hours  highly recommended        
2208,5.0,                       i regret not paying for the expert assembly  but i did it  it was hard and nothing was forgotten or damaged i  the process  but you need way more tools then a simple phillips head and wrench  you need multiplesized bits   do not use power tools  and ratchets  there are some frustrating angles and some agility if you re doing it by yourself can seem to get the full ifit access so i don t think that was worth it  and it doesn t have a great app but   stars for the treadmill part      
2209,1.0,                       nordic track has the worst customer service i have ever experienced   the machine does not work   i have called customer service   times  the wait time is over an hour  the third call was an hour and forty minutes  then the call drops  my husband called twice  never an answer for him either  i have emailed nordic track twice  no response  so here sits a non working treadmill  no help to remidy the situation i m at my wit s end   if you don t mind spending hours upon hours on the phone then buy a nordic track  my suggestion is to with another company        
2210,1.0,                       did not even work as expected for a week and the nordic trak support team wasn t giving feasible options to have the issue fixed  finally decided to return the product     
2211,4.0,                       pain to assemble and takes a long time to get even with prime but my son trains on it daily  she s heavy and wheels work like garbage for moving it around  plastics are cheap and not sturdy  but mechanics seem solid and works hard  which is the important part      
2212,1.0,                       purchased one year and two days ago   very lightly used for walking at a slight incline   it s no longer keeping speed and trying to get support through website isn t coming easy   i would not recommend purchasing this product   a friend of mine who purchased the same model is also encountering issues with the treadmill malfunctioning      
2213,4.0,                       it says you need to have at least   people to assemble  but i was able to do it on my own  i m not bragging  i m just saying it s easy to assemble  it s squeaks a little bit  but not enough to bother me  the speakers worked great but not loud enoung  overall  i recommend this product      
2214,5.0,                       this treadmill is exactly what i was looking for  it works perfectly   i did need someone else to help with the assembly since it would be too difficult for one person to hold parts and attach them  but the instructions were great  it took about an hour to assemble  and i used it that day with no issues  i actually picked this particular treadmill for the weight rating and it has been great every day that i ve used it      
2215,1.0,                       the treadmill arrived on time and was set up   then the person setting it up informs me that i can t use it until i sign up for ifit   and to sign up for ifit i need to go on my computer and and give them my credit card number   they tell me that i have one  free  month of ifit   it doesn t matter that i don t want and don t use it   after the month they started billing my credit card monthly  even though i don t want ifit and am not using it   they continue billing after i told them stop   i still have not been able to have them stop billing me   pretty shady and deceitful practices      
2216,2.0,                       this product is great in theory  but was missing several key components  the box was opened prior to shipping to me to inspect it and several key items were missing  all of the hardware  the assembly instructions  and the safety magnet for the treadmill to run  amazon did not want to replace any of the missing parts  but rather push me off to go purchase them on my own  which i did and still have to do   days later      
2217,1.0,                       product itself would not function after several hour assembly and using all u tube videos to assist  a real nightmare    customer support non exsistent      
2218,4.0,                       this treadmill is very stable and quiet   it is a   person job to assemble  but is easy to operate   very little vibration  even for an xxl like me just put on a video  i use doctor who  put on your headphones  and go      
2219,5.0,                       i will keep this review very simple likesturdyinstructions on how to assemble it are okeasy to useso far so gooddidn t likeshipping box show some significant damage  but no cosmetic damage to the treadmill      
2220,5.0,                       love the treadmill  we use it everyday  it is exactly as advertised and we love the ifit programs assembly was not  easy   as it took a lot of time and   people for some parts  but it was very straightforward and the instructions were super clear  so while it was time consuming  it was not confusing at all   very thorough instructions and parts identified clearly overall we re thrilled with this treadmill      
2221,2.0,                       it s a solid treadmill   fairly well built   a bit louder than my liking  but you get what you pay for   one issue i can confirm  i ve seen other comments on this as well   the heartrate sensor grips are useless   the heart rate jumps around all over the place between     and     bpm   doesn t come close to matching my very accurate chest strap monitor   why even include this feature if it doesn t work      
2222,5.0,                       easy to assemble      hours  quality product      
2223,5.0,                       so far so good  we placed this in the garage on uneven concrete  purchased workout foam squares to go underneath to eliminate wobbly and any excess noise  we used amazon assembly  worth this      the guys were prompt  courteous  knew exactly what they were doing  assembled it in    minutes      
2224,1.0,                       this is the biggest scam company of all time  after spending   hours to assemble  i went through all the activation steps  including registering an account and giving them my credit card info   but the machine still won t activate  of course  their customer support team is not working      and can t help you on the weekends spend your money elsewhere      
2225,5.0,                       we have had no problems  it s plenty fast enough for us and the incline is more than enough to give a good work out  between my wife and i we put     miles a day on it  during the time we ve had it we have put     miles on it  very pleased with purchase      
2226,5.0,                       this is about as close to gym quality as you can get without spending an additional  k   if you want to spend another  k  i promise that machine will be quieter  faster  and more durable   however  if you want to walk   job   run reasonable distances  i am very impressed with this   i have my own heart rate monitor  wireless headphones  etc so i haven t even tried the extra features on this machine        
2227,5.0,                       it is quite and very adjustable  i use it   days a week one hour each day love it     
2228,4.0,                       simple enough to put together  though i definitely recommend using two people    don t be a hero   my big problem   i bought this for my wife and i   i m well under the max weight capacity   but i am a heavy runner   when i jog on this treadmill   the belt has a very brief but noticeable pause on occasion   which alters my running gait pattern and puts me at risk of a knee injury     
2229,5.0,                       we were looking for a fold able treadmill that offered incline and fairly decent speeds for an affordable price  this nordictrack is exactly what we were looking for  it s a no frills treadmill that works great and does what we need      
2230,5.0,                       somewhat difficult to put together      
2231,5.0,                       great treadmill and awesome classes and trainers      
2232,5.0,                       this was delivered and installed around the pittsburg pa area and the service was excellent   based on reviews  some other areas have had poor service  but that wasn t the case here   some other reviews were negative due to the ifit requirement   the treadmill is usable if you just bypasses the ifit by holding down the ifit button for about    seconds   it works great after without the feature of the workouts   no registering at all      
2233,5.0,                       no complaints  perfect for what we need   daily cardio   my husband assembled  it and while it was not his favorite task  he got it done  we both work out daily on it  great shock absorption  he s a fast runner and we are not experiencing any vibration      
2234,5.0,                       update  so far so good  wasnt too happy with shipping  thought pilot shipping may have broken it bc they sent   delivery guy to carry the huge heavy box  thankfully it wasn t broken  amazon assembly was quick  fast  though the guy changed the time last minute  otherwise tho  he was great    of us have used the treadmill and it s really great so far      
2235,5.0,                       running in the heat of arizona is tough  we bought this so we could run year round  the assembly instructions were remarkably complete and accurate and i had the treadmill up and running in about an hour  i signed up for the free month of ifit account and after the very first workout  signed up for the year  working out with a trainer right on the screen makes running on this a much more pleasant experience that i actually look forward to  i would highly recommend the nordictrack t series treamill model    s for anyone who wants to get a good consistent workout without the worries of weather      
2236,5.0,                       had to call company during assembly as some screws that were sent did not fit  after a long wait online  they finally put us through to someone who said   wow this has never happened before we will send out new screws   one week later we got the replacement and it still was wrong size  not impressed with that  but the treadmill itself is great  i would recommend but maybe get the next size up      
2237,5.0,                       we bought this treadmill as soon as the stay at home orders were announced   we wanted it just to make it through the time that we could not go to the gym   however  my wife and i love it so much that we may never go back to the gym   i m not a handy type but i was able to put the device together myself   i feel that it is as good a the treadmills at the gym   my wife loves the ifit trainers   she already has her favorites that she follows   we are glad that we decided on the larger screen   it make a difference      
2238,1.0,                       level of difficulty to assemble makes this unbuyable unless you are going to pay for assembly that is coming from someone that worked   years as a handy man and can typically take things apart  fix and get reassembled      
2239,5.0,                       treadmill is great  my problem was with the delivery  they changed the delivery day  i contact amazon  they said someone from pilot will call to schedule the delivery  but in the comments they lied saying they contacted me  but they didn t      
2240,4.0,                       i bought this trad meal and had hard time to put the crossbar screws  call nordictrack customer service  after waiting about twenty mints some one answered  i told him my problem not a signaled question he said i will transfer you to customer service department  and waited about    mts finally giveup i was so mad with nordictrack  hope fully we like the product have not use enough to review the product  finally i have to order installment service  usually these kind of assemble can do my self     
2241,3.0,                       unable to test product as it was delivered in a shredded box  belt slashed  parts broken      
2242,5.0,                       two pre drilled holes were too small for         inch screws  really frustrating   ended up buying   inch screws  after that  no problem  excellent treadmill   quiet   need a ratchet wrench  otherwise  too much grief        
2243,5.0,                       great price and a great warranty to go with it  takes about an hour to assemble and very sturdy      
2244,4.0,                       arrived and had amazon assemble it   only draw back is that the pulse monitor is erratic and inaccurate  went out and bought a o  monitor and a fitbit versa to ensure my pulse wasn t reaching     bpm  before i got started good   that was one of the important features that i bought this model      
2245,1.0,                       we installed it and turned it on but it just wouldn t move  it was marking the time and the speed as if we were on it but nothing was happening as of moving  we called amazon they were very nice and they will have someone come in to box it and return it for us  i am not sure if we will buy again nordic  make sure to always buy the insurance      
2246,3.0,                       bought this to replace older commercial grade nordictrack treadmill  works ok but treadmill doesn t seem as powerful as previous one  not bad for the price  will probably upgrade to a better quality nordictrack      
2247,5.0,                       i purchased the install and glad that i did  the guys were great  but it did take them about    mins from start to finish  it was     and worth every penny  i do like the ifit option doing workouts with trainers as they hike around the world      
2248,1.0,                       this treadmill was    hours passed its factory warranty  i contacted nordictrac and explained the safety issue with the torn belt that flipped during running  this is dangerous and must be defective  they would not honor the warranty plus the warranty starts of the date of purchase not the time you actually receive the treadmill  then they try to upsell an extended warranty package  i had a proform treadmill for    years before this one   never a problem  still worked when i decided to buy this one  i replaced the track and belt  x   buy proform     not nordictrac   see my photos     
2249,5.0,                       the treadmill was very easy to put together  it took me about    minutes  the ifit program is awesome  never really liked treadmillls because they are boring  but the trainers available keep you very engaged  overall for the price it was definitely worth it      
2250,4.0,                       i am novice with treadmills  but my first purchase of this product is definitely upto my expectation and i would recommend everyone to to buy this product  the ease of use including free ifit registration for   year is great  the product is sturdy  the initial boot up may take a little time  but thats about it      
2251,4.0,                       it works  given that it is a nordic track i expected better quality  it makes a whirring noise but it s not noticeably loud  sometimes it shuts off randomly in the middle of a workout and i have to play with the cord to get it to come back on      
2252,1.0,                       i loved this treadmill for the two weeks that it worked week    the welds on the frame broke while my wife was running  it became dangerous to run on nordictrac pretty much told me there was nothing they could do without it being a giant hassle luckily i can still return through amazon      
2253,5.0,                       my husband uses this tread mill every day he absolutely loves it  we have it in a corner of our dinning room folded up so did doesn t take up alot of room  as far as assembling this we paid to have it professionally done so glad we did  would recommend this product     
2254,4.0,                       use it for exercise and fitness  has simple  standard usefulness  did not appreciate the tactics nordictrack used to coerce the customer for joining its membership  probably unethical     
2255,5.0,                       love it  worth the money      
2256,5.0,                       we bought the nordictrack to help us get back into shape   it has far surpassed our hopes  the nordictrack easily can be put up to allow for easy movement around it  we enjoy our purchase very much  and appreciate the boost to our health      
2257,5.0,                       great for home use   large and sturdy   i had it assembled by amazon   i have had it for about a year now and it still works great   it gets lots of use      
2258,5.0,                       the only thing that is disappointing is that you have to subscribe to a monthly fee to use the workout programs other than that i am very pleased with the treadmill     
2259,5.0,                       i got tired of paying high gym fees and waiting for a treadmill to get open  this treadmill solved the problem it made possible for me to work out when ever i wanted  recouping the cost was pretty fast  in gas and fees      
2260,5.0,                       this nordictrack t series    s treadmill is a beautifully engineered machine  it provides great functionality at a very reasonable price  it is all you will need to get a great cardiovascular workout as well as toning your muscles  i highly recommend this machine      
2261,5.0,                       i do say  at first i was a bit disappointed in the size   however  the performance helps allay my concern in that area  it is all i expected and for a good price      
2262,2.0,                       it took quite some time for my husband to assemble it  and it worked well  however  every time we use it  there is black dust coming off from the running pad  it scattered around the tread mill  especially at the end  and also on the shoe  i do not know whether the black dust is toxic or not and i am worried that we breath in the black dust  i contacted the amazon technical support and he has no idea about the black dust and he is very nice to offer refund or replacement even though the return window has passed  however  it is impossible for us to put the current back to the original box and i had to give up   i am planning to give a call to the manufacture      
2263,1.0,                       used this   times and it was fine   went to turn it on today and it just starts going up  then going down  then going up  then going down   when i push the buttons they just beep and nothing happens   have to turn it off or unplug it to make it stop      
2264,5.0,                       best for walking and moderate running   perfect gor me        
2265,5.0,                       this is a great buy  perfect for your home i m every single category      
2266,5.0,                       we are gym rats  this treadmill is as good as any treadmill we have used at a gym  it s quiet and sturdy  the treadmill was better quality than we anticipated  the speaker system is a bonus      
2267,1.0,                       unsatisfied  customer service is horrible  still waiting    weeks now  upon delivery all the screws for the motor housing were broken  no biggie   if i could get any support  sent   emails  including one to amazon  nothing  its usable but god awfully loud because the motor house bounces with every step  also the actual track sticks on occasion  which is horrible when you re running or walking  don t waste your money or time        
2268,5.0,                       so far the unit works great  took about an hour or so to assemble and another half hour to understand the console functionality and to bypass the ifit app crap      
2269,5.0,                       this semi compact treadmill fitted well in our small apartment  it works very well and was very easy to assemble  the price is affordable  we are very satisfied with our purchase      
2270,4.0,                       i ve had the treadmill for a couple months now and it works great for home use  i use it about     times a week and haven t had any issues so far  max of    incline is perfect  it s simple and easy to use  doesn t feel cheap even though it s a base model      
2271,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill  i have been using it for several months now  i walk  i run  and i use the incline  have absolutely no complaints  everything works great  this is definitely the best treadmill i have owned so far      
2272,5.0,                       delivery and assembly on time   after reading reviews  learned how to start without signing up with ifit   hold the ifit button for    seconds    only had it for three days and it works great      
2273,5.0,                       it s exactly as pictured   it also arrived faster  about a month  than promised  it has quite a few features for your workout or you just do it yourself manually   i cannot comment on the assembly as i had amazon technician do it i am very pleased with it      
2274,1.0,                       i tried get help fixing my wifi issue  no success  due to covid i kept otherwise definitely would have returned it i did purchase extended warranty  it is already squeaking  it is good for small people and height for handle is low as i am  ft    lb  if you are looking for to buy    make sure you check all needs not just a name      
2275,4.0,                       really pleased with this product  purchased it to have some fitness going in pandemic era  so far  liking it  it has the basic functionality anyone would like  assembly was easy  instructions was clear  took around   hrs for me but that is because i am little slow  only reason i have not provided   star because of the ifit subscription  it is actually not needed and little annoying that machine will not start until you subscribe to ifit  will request nordictrack to make it optional going forward     
2276,5.0,                       so far so good  three months in and it s been great  will update it i experience any issues that the manufacturer will not sort out      
2277,5.0,                       this is a great machine  easy to setup and runs flawlessly  i didn t think having the bigger screen would make a difference but was i amazed  you feel like you are right there at every workout  love this machine and will buy ahaib      
2278,1.0,                          was delivered outside of initial time window  left in the rain  even with an awning and a tarp set out    tries to scam you by locking you out unless you subscribe    aside from that  a decent machine  so far      
2279,5.0,                       loved this treadmill   still great a year later   no regrets      
2280,1.0,                       i m pissed  this was delivered today  hubby spent three hours assembling it  a huge red sticker is on the treadmill basically stating you have to activate it through i fit  the treadmill won t work unless you pay       aonth to use i fit  it s such anrip off scam      
2281,5.0,                       it s a bit bigger than i thought but that s actually a plus my gf never uses treadmills because they hurt her knees  but she d able to use this for hours with no pain      
2282,1.0,                       never seen a workout treadmill where you have to activate with an account and credit card info to start using the ifit program locks the treadmill and will require you to activate through their website with required info  and then enroll you in a    days free trial  and then download their app to unlock the the treadmill what a scam  now i have to call them to cancel my membership  which is the only way to cancel what a way to ruin a simple product with predatory scammy software and gimmicks      
2283,4.0,                       this is a solid treadmill with many excellent features   the assembly instructions were very good and the assembly went well   i have used it several times so far and enjoy the exercise   the only issue i have found so far is with leveling the unit so it does not wiggly when you are running without holding the arms      
2284,5.0,                       i had looked at many treadmills over the course of several weeks when i decided this would be the best value for me  assembled easily and works great  i use it for fast walk  level   w  incline   only been two days but so far   so good      
2285,5.0,                       treadmill was easy to assemble  i did it mostly by myself  had to have my son help with the heavy part   i gave only   stars for easy to fold  bc i haven t actually folded  it yet   easy to operate it and runs smoothly  i use it to walk with an incline and not run   just right for me  i would recommend this model     
2286,3.0,                       arrived earlier than expected  it arrived somewhat damaged  but nothing that affected the utility of the treadmill  have ran on it a couple times and so far it s working well  i hope it lasts  i d say for what you pay  it s pretty good      
2287,4.0,                       overall our experience with nordic is very good   we have an old ski machine still working excellent hope our treadmill gives us the same service   even our dog katie likes to walk on the nordictrack     
2288,5.0,                       this treadmill is a good value for the money  based upon comparative treadmills in this price range   it does not have bells and whistles  but it does not need them  it delivers a well run machine   its features are enough  and it feels sturdy to run on   i am a runner who is busy  and this machine has delivered   i do not regret this purchase at all  and use it several times a week  with no problems   i highly recommend it      
2289,3.0,                       this treadmill is a scam   it went together just fine  not too bad  powered up and you cannot use the treadmill unless you purchase nordictracks      ifit program    absolute garbage   i bought a treadmill not a richard simmons workout tape   beside that the panel was broken when i got it out of the box        
2290,5.0,                       running at home for my very own comfort  has ipod copado le  stereo and ifit sync and aux     
2291,4.0,                       some screw holes don t match up  also  you do not have to buy or enter any info for ifit  just hold the ifit button for    secs and it bypasses the ifit activation other than that it s solid and good      
2292,5.0,                       sucks having to wait almost two weeks for delivery but once i received i was super excited to get it together  first hurdle  lugging it down the steps to my basement  assembly wasn t horrible but i could have used an additional set of hands  as for set up  i knew what i was getting into based on the reviews here so i m not going to be all up in arms like the rest of the bunch    but it was simple  the   free year of ifit is perfect and i will use it and renew when it s up because i love ifit      
2293,5.0,                       setting up wasn t the easiest  the main parts were not lining up completely  my boyfriend had to force the control board into the side pieces to mount it properly  haven t had any issues so far with using it  very quiet and efficient  love how it lowers on its own      
2294,1.0,                       the give you   month of free i fit  i was going to use this after my surgery and let my wife run on it now  but before you even test the machine they make you activate this   month this is crap   i bought one with out the screen and they still make you sign up   stay away form nodictrack they just want all your money      
2295,4.0,                       the only thing i don t like about this machine is that you have to subscribe to the ifit program to use all it s features   we press the speed   height and walk    but we can t adjust anything else per person s needs  weight  but we don t really care this time    we will use it till it breaks   get something better next time      
2296,1.0,                       terrible choice  locks you in to having to purchase the app for programs   need to use phone  extremely difficult for something that should be easy  makes me not want to work out      
2297,5.0,                       i absolutely love this treadmill i recieved it june  th and its easy to use if set up properly  just make sure to hold the ifit button down at least    secs after sticking in the safety key to bypass that ifit set up and enjoy       
2298,5.0,                       this is my second nordic trac treadmill  i had my old nordic trac for     years of dependable daily service  it was time to step up  i wanted something that provided a video display and the ability to access ifit  trainers  since i would only buy nordic trac  i purchased the    si  it is of the same or better quality as my previous treadmill  my wife and i love our    si  being able to use it with the ifit trainers is a lot of fun  the quality of the nordic trac is second to none and my wife and i are very happy with our purchase and highly recommend it      
2299,5.0,                       i don t usually write reviews but i felt that i needed to let buyers know what to expect and what happened with my order  i recommend that you have another person to help put it together  it did take   hrs to put together but the instructions were clear  the only problem as you can see from my picture is the shipping company cracked the cover  they might want to change shipping companies  i m not going to worry about getting it fixed as it s only cosmetic  i m giving it   stars because the treadmill does everything i wanted      
2300,5.0,                       when the delivery guys came  they were very friendly and careful with the box   not a single dent on the box   the assembly took about          it was very easy to assemble with two people    i love this treadmill   it s not as bulky as my last nordictrack     
2301,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill to go with my peloton app and i couldn t love it more  i am short and about     and it feels very sturdy and supportive even on a full out run   hoping to enjoy this for years to come      
2302,4.0,                       good   packaging was good  it survived through shipping carriers   overall build quality looks great   easy to use bad   misleading ifit subscription information   no options for configuration  at this price point it shouldn t be dependent on pricy subscription  and i should be able to set my workout settings   software is really basic      
2303,1.0,                       i bought this machine trying to save a bit of money  it was very difficult to assemble because some screws did not fit properly  i have had this for a few days and the display is not showing any stats  time or anything  it just lights up  i m returning this asap      
2304,5.0,                       great treadmill   definitely worth the investment  i had amazon services assemble it and they did in under an hour  love that i can rest my tablet on the panel to watch tv while i run walk      
2305,5.0,                       i ve had the nordictrack t series treadmill for almost a year and we love it  i ve had no issues at all delivery went well as they brought it to my basement   we got the expert assembly and it went very well  i bypassed the ifit set up and we ve had no issues using the machine all in all  i would recommend this treadmill      
2306,5.0,                       this purchase was a no brainer   easy to use and quite effective for workouts  loving not having to go to the gym for my workouts      
2307,4.0,                       i needed a treadmill to workout at home on days i can t make it to the gym and didn t want to spend a lot of money on  i saw this and had to have it  it does great going uphill and speed  warm up is a bit slow but over all it s a     out        
2308,5.0,                       this was my first large treadmill purchase and i was a bit reluctant to purchase such a beast of equipment online without first trying it in a store  the product is heavy but my husband and i were able to assemble it ourselves with the help of clear instructions provided  it is a very sturdy treadmill and the functions are very good  i love the ifit integration but for those who don t want it there is an option to override that and use it manually as well      
2309,5.0,                       i studied all of the reviews on so many treadmills an i am so happy i bought this one  it is durable and works great  if you are on the fence go for this one       
2310,1.0,                       after spending way too much money and an hour putting it together this thing will not work until you go through a long registration process  which includes giving them your credit card info for a reoccurring charge i don t want i ve never heard of such a thing  the treadmill literally wont budge without giving nordictrack all your information  it just annoyingly beeps back at you while saying go to their website to register  and give up your credit card info  their customer service is a joke terrible company      
2311,4.0,                       my gym closed  so i am trying to achieve a six pack at age    with my nordic track  t series treadmill  i have made huge strides toward my goal thanks to this treadmill  i love the ease with which you can change inclines speeds quickly for hiit training and all of the helpful data on calories burned  pulse  and distance walked run  etc  i plan to cancel my gym subscription thanks to this wonderful piece of equipment      
2312,5.0,                       i have been on it  everyday since i received it      
2313,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          very happy with this treadmill so far  great quality at a good price      
2314,5.0,                       perfect treadmill for peloton tread app workouts  for the price and the ability to jump to speeds inclines you can t beat it   put it together in about    minutes with one other person seems like most negative reviews are about ifit  as others have said  you can completely bypass this by holding the ifit button for       seconds after you power it on  make sure emergency stop magnet is attached   i never created an account or anything and have had no issues      
2315,5.0,                       works like a charm   a little noisy but i m a heavier set individual as well  for the price i d recommend to anyone looking for a nice treadmill  i also bought some oil  but haven t had to use it  no unusual sounds or squeaks coming from machine like i have read in some reviews      
2316,5.0,                       the machine is very solid and sturdy though the assembly work took some time  the belt size is comfortably wide and long enough  i am enjoying it      
2317,5.0,                       this is my first nordictrack and by far the best out of all my prior treadmills  it took a awhile for delivery  but understandable due to covid  setting up was fairly easy  i love the ifit workouts and how it automatically adjusts to speed and incline definitely a good buy      
2318,1.0,                       crappy product  crappy parts  within   months it stoped working   the kept sending me parts   times through the mail  the techs didnt know why when they sent them to fix  when you call icon or fintech who provides help services   they will not pick up your call  fyi  good luck      
2319,1.0,                       the treadmill worked fine for us  until it completely and suddenly failed   after waiting for phone customer service to pick up over    minutes  i hung up and began calling gym equipment repair companies   we feel ripped off by icon nordic track   the fancy features were never important or used   we wanted to walk and or run and be able to set and track the speed  time  etc   i am told when the screen fails  it will cost almost        and when the electronic board fails  it will cost as much as the machine   this one is now junk to us and so is the manufacturer   not for serious exercisers      
2320,5.0,                       so far so good  used this item for a couple of months and seems to be working fine      
2321,5.0,                       easy to assemble but would recommend   people  the treadmill is used everyday and has given us everything we need  we are not experienced runners and aren t training for anything in particular   sturdy and well put together  easy to fold and move if necessary   definitely doesn t have everything a treadmill at the gym has but we use a few different apps to get pre made workouts which is great  would definitely recommend this treadmill   great functionality at a great price      
2322,3.0,                       holes in several parts were not drilled threaded properly  making assembly difficult   the instructions point to a support website that has been down   and the  must create an account and give a credit card number in order to unlock the treadmill  feature is annoying    i paid a few hundred bucks for this and spent an evening assembling it     just let me turn the thing on and not sign up for some monthly fee that i now need to cancel for working out it is good      
2323,5.0,                       the ifit exercise videos work perfectly with the treadmill   assembly required the help of another person  but all the parts matched the instructions   machine works well     
2324,5.0,                       i absolutely love my new treadmill  i purchased at the beginning of march and between my father and i we have certainly gotten use of it  due to covid    no one was allowed in the house so we had to put it together ourselves  i m no mrs  fixit but we got it all put together and it s safe  we love it      
2325,1.0,                       then treated me like cr p when i tried to get a replacement part  nordictrack is a joke  don t buy the lie you have to sign up for ifit  either  just hold the ifit button for     seconds to override the  lock       
2326,1.0,                       the machine can t be assembled  the screws don t fit are not aligned properly due to a manufacturing issue  nordicktrack customer service is basically nonexistent  they will only answer via email and take a very long time to do so  luckily  thanks to amazon i was able to return the machine      
2327,5.0,                       i liked this machine a lot  it is a good size to fit in our bedroom and easily foldable when we are done with it      
2328,3.0,                       nordic track customer service gets an extreme negative rating   the treadmill would not operate unless you call nordic track to activate their fitness program   totally frustrating   had to google videos on how to bypass the activation key   horrible experience   the unit would get a   in terms of ease in assembly    a beast to assemble   the machine itself is nice   we are crossing fingers that there will never be a need to contract nordic track      
2329,4.0,                       have had this treadmill for about three weeks  really like it  we were able to put it together in two in a half hours  some of the holes for the screws seemed to be little small but it s holding up okay  the screen and legs are a little wobbly but it s okay  i didn t need to add my credit card for the ifit but i did have to make an account to get the machine going and have to go on there every time to turn the treadmill on  but it tracks each time i work out  overall worth the money      
2330,4.0,                       assembly was straightforward and it works great  my only complaint is the setup to use it  we were not able to figure out the work around that others mention in their reviews so this tacked on additional time  we ve since cancelled the subscription and are still happy with the treadmill      
2331,4.0,                       i love having my nordictrack available when i want to work out   it has all the features i want and is well made     i am proud of my decision to purchase this machine both for the product as well as for taking care of myself      
2332,5.0,                       absolutely love this treadmill  it folds easy and assembly didn t take long  if you hold the ifit button down you don t have to register it  i can walk or run and it runs smooth  don t spend thousands of dollars  give this a try      
2333,4.0,                       love my treadmill  wide enough belt to walk or run comfortably and safely  it was a bear to assemble  had to hire a pro  added cost  been using for several weeks daily and really enjoy it  sturdy  just what i wanted  looking forward to good cardio workouts      
2334,4.0,                       good price  works      
2335,2.0,                       it  take a  long time to assemble and it  has major flaw with console design  it does  not  mechanically  fit on the handles  the console mounting  bracket is  designed too short  about     we  had to pull the handles to make bracket  fit  and still it did not land on handles correctly  i m concerned that in  the future it  will  pop out due to vibration as it is under intense pressure i  expected a better quality for more than a      treadmill     
2336,5.0,                       the treadmill combined with the training program changed my life and my wife s life also  i have been running the last    years and i never ran consistently in a treadmill  i hate it  until i buy my nordictrack  i am leaving in a place with very cold weather and i am keeping my shape while having fun running around the world with different trainers through the app  my wife never ran in her life and started because of the treadmill  i think i will run a marathon with her      
2337,5.0,                       excellent machine  my wife said it is the best she ever ran on  very smooth  easy to operate and she loves running in the different cities  feels like she is right there with the ifit      
2338,1.0,                       i will not rate the treadmill for quality until i have used it for a while but it did arrive with a broken motor cover  assembly tech said it is cosmetic and it would not affect the function of treadmill i decided to proceed with the assembly and it appears to be ok  disappointing they don t package better for shipping purpose     
2339,1.0,                       poor alignment of belt and horrible customer support  the belt is not aligned properly between the front and rear rollers  it also slips to one side when i start running  i ve adjusted the screws but no gains  nordictrack has a bad customer support  they kept me on hold for    mins after listening to the above mentioned issue  i dropped the call after      
2340,5.0,                       this threadmill is great and works perfectly for our family  we use it everyday and love it  it is a great value for the money paid for the product  it is great at tracking all the things a threadmill is supposed to track and reports at the end of the workout      
2341,5.0,                       very pleased with this treadmill   a little difficult to assemble  very heavy   but sturdy   this thing feels like it is extremely well made   works flawlessly and is quiet   i d absolutely buy it again      
2342,5.0,                       arrived on time  put it together in less then an hour  bypassed the ifit sign up easily by putting the magnetic key on and holding the ifit button on the machine until it started up  so far i m loving this machine      
2343,5.0,                       ordered the product  and it was delivered directly to the house  deliver went great   product was set up in a breeze  no issues what so ever   works greatly for what we are looking for   would highly recommend      
2344,5.0,                       smooth and quiet  not fancy but good quality for running and walking  you do not need to purchase the ifit app to use it      
2345,1.0,                       delivered broken  parts fell out of non user serviceable area right out of the box   customer support was great on the phone  but no follow up for in home repair after two weeks   nordic track is also unable to find the bundled nodic track care warranty i purchased from aamazon and associate it to the account   they can t seem to figure out which department should fix this      
2346,5.0,                       first i want to say that it does not require ifit to run  i ve been using mine for a week now and it s not registered with ifit yet  this treadmill is amazing so far  i usually do about   miles a day on it and it s holding up pretty well to that      
2347,2.0,                       it works well and was pretty easy to put together  but it showed up with the plastics all busted up  the box looks almost perfect on the outside so it doesn t appear to have been damaged during shipping  i would have returned it if it didn t weigh more than i do      
2348,5.0,                       the treadmill is great easy to uses and exactly what the wife wanted and worked like a champ  also love that it sync with cell phone and can get live updates and workouts what control the treadmill     
2349,5.0,                       we bought our nordictrack about   months ago and have loved it  it is very simple to use  the built in workouts that are great at bringing some variety to your workout  it is very easy to fold  not as easy to move but the does have wheels you can tilt the unit on to relocate the unit  just be sure to be strategic about where you locate the unit in your space very satisfied with our purchase      
2350,4.0,                       i bought this to replace a    year old treadmill that gave up the ghost  the wider belt is great as i  wander  a little as i walk  very smooth operation  my only complaint is the gigantic console  way to big for an in home unit  it could be     the size and still get all the controls on it comfortably  assembly was not a problem as i m mechanically minded  just take your time  read twice and do it once  took me about       hours to assemble      
2351,5.0,                       we use this for fast walking  i am      and weigh    lbs and find it very comfortable  my wife is a lot shorter than me and finds it works great for her too  i prefer a high incline and this treadmill performs better than i expected  feels more like a gym treadmill than a home treadmill i like the ability to change the speed by tenths  we did not sign up for the online or application and are very happy with the built in functionality      
2352,5.0,                       i ve been using this for several months now  i was nervous to buy something like this online and some negative reviews made me even more nervous it actually works great and does what i need it to do  we had it professionally assembled and haven t had any issues with it  happy with my purchase      
2353,3.0,                       did not work for me as it kept setting off my breaker box in both the living room and guest bedroom   we bought a belkin surge protector to see if it would help and it didn t   ended up returning it   amazon was great about the return      
2354,1.0,                       unable to still use the product  poor customer services from amazon and manufacturing  also needs surge protector to use at home  never pre warned  better buy from brickwall shops than amazon      
2355,4.0,                       after a few weeks its working ok except for one problem  the    speed buttons seem preset so if i push   it doesn t go   mph but a lot faster because the speeds are preset  nearly fell off when i tried to go from   to   and   and it went to about   mph instead  need to read manual to reset      
2356,1.0,                       i have sent in three request for customer due to a horrible squeak from the time i turned it on   i have yet to hear back from any of the requests   it has been over a month   to throw salt into the wound  they consistently have been sending offers to extend my service plan   i am sure they will respond very quick to take my money    do not purchase a nordic track      
2357,5.0,                       this has been a great purchase   our family of   uses it all the time   the ifit interface is great and we enjoy it more than we thought we would   i would prefer bluetooth integration to so we can listen to the trainer without having the volume blaring into other rooms      
2358,5.0,                       great piece of equipment   will be great during the winter months   love the ifit      
2359,3.0,                       is a good system but the design is kind of weird  i m     and i have to hunch to get to the grip pulse or the arms it has speakers and an aux in  but it does not have a fan      
2360,5.0,                       great product for the price  assembly is moderate but doable  need time and patience  helpful reviews on amazon esp  bypassing ifit setup  love the product so far   sturdy for the home gym      
2361,1.0,                       there was no message that we had to purchase ifit activation  this is total fraud  i don t want to give out my credit card  i held the ifit button number of times for    to   minute but it does not work  if i don t find any solution here  i will return  my equipment back      
2362,5.0,                       actually don t mind working out now with ifit and this treadmill  took me like an hour to put together because i was second guessing myself  but it s pretty easy   just needs an ipad and clip on fan and you are good to go      
2363,3.0,                       to maximize its use definitely need to subscribe to ifit  it s a bit on the noisy side  also  it looses stability once the speed goes up to    it makes me wonder if at any point it may tilt and i will end up falling  i guess for the price paid  this is what is worth      
2364,1.0,                       this is a horrible experience putting in together   screws don t match the holes   customer service is terrible   don t buy      
2365,5.0,                       the men who delivered the treadmill were polite and were willing to put it anywhere i wanted  i assembled the unit but they were also willing to unpack and dispose of the shipping materials  all that for         the unit is quite  smooth  and does all i need  i walk outside most of the time but this is for the bad weather days      
2366,5.0,                       this was an awesome purchase and the ifit for a year included was very useful  very quiet  make sure you find a level location in your house my only notes are when putting this together does require a second person but only for a few steps so keep that in mind or have a stool or chair ready to assist you  the fan doesn t reach you very well when running unless you are fairly close to the console so you don t get much air during sprints      
2367,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love this treadmill  who need the gym anymore when you could have your gym at home  this treadmill feels like the commercial ones they have at the gyms  easy to assemble  easy to fold  the treadmill is not as small as i thought  it does take space but other than that i love it      
2368,4.0,                       great for indoor cardio workout   but expect to spend a while on setup  it took two adults eight hours to assemble   over all a great purchase      
2369,5.0,                       great value for the price  i have been using it for two weeks  it took two people about   hours to assemble  it wasn t too difficult  some of the screws did not go in as easy as they should  but we were still able to get it assembled  treadmillnis easy to use and somewhat quiet  we are happy with this purchase  watch the prices  as they seem to fluctuate quite often  and amazon will not adjust their prices     they will tell you to refuse a delivery rather than offering an adjustment      
2370,5.0,                       this was heavy to carry and set up wasn t that easy but once assembled i love this machine  no frills but still a great value  better than the planet fitness treadmill i was used to before starting a home gym  note  i do not use ifit so cannot speak on that feature      
2371,5.0,                       much bigger and heavier than i thought  completely worth it  love the ifit      
2372,5.0,                       i am  extremely pleased with this treadmill   after total reconstructive foot surgery  i was skeptical to use it   however  the wideness of the belt   walking comfort immediately put me at ease and the free delivery   assembly was just   icing on the cake  i highly recommend this product      
2373,5.0,                       i am pleased with this treadmill  it is strong and sturdy without being too big and bulky      
2374,3.0,                       you will have to build this from step zero  took me about two hours to fully assemble the machine  and i would ve rather paid to have it done  do yourself a favor and purchase a treadmill that s already set up      
2375,5.0,                       this treadmill is fantastic  my kids love it for jogging and i like being able to speed up my walk and increase the incline with a push of the button  it s also a quiet machine so i don t wake anyone up in the early morning      
2376,1.0,                       there is a crack in base of the treadmill that i noticed as soon as i opened it  either the delivery people broke it or the quality of this treadmill is horrible for it to crack while it s in a box with foam protection  save your money not worth the high price      
2377,5.0,                       i ordered this back in january when my old treadmill died  it works great and appreciated the option to purchase assembly  it is exactly what i needed  nothing fancy  just functional      
2378,4.0,                       bought this for my mom who is a senior citizen  she normally goes for walks around town but since covid she has been afraid to go out  i bought this and placed it in her garage and she loves it  she doesn t use the ifit but listens to her music podcast or favorite youtube s  perfect for her and the current situation  she has bad shoulders so folding it up is a big no  but being in the garage  it doesn t matter  would recommend to any one in a similar situation      
2379,5.0,                       love this treadmill  had a nordictrack years ago and it lasted    years  i literally burned out the engine  i hope this one lasts just as long  so happy with my purchase  also my daughter and i were able to assemble it in about   hours      
2380,2.0,                       just over a year after receipt and warranty expired the power board needs to be replaced  replacement part is      plus the cost of a service technician  i opened a case with nordictrack tech support and received very fast automated response that someone would contact me as soon as possible    follow ups later and still no response from nordictrack     
2381,5.0,                       three hours to assemble was my first workout on the nordictrack   it s been working great for myself and my wife  daily at    to    minutes each      
2382,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          not sure if they are all like this but the fan is extremely loud on this treadmill  it was like this new  you can hear it on the other side of the house and one floor down when it is running  this video is the fan on the lowest setting      
2383,5.0,                       we love this machine  we had it professionally assembled and have been using it constantly since day one  may  rd   we are both gym rats and since the shutdown we have been stuck in  so glad we purchased this  we may never go back to the gym  we also traveled a lot before the shutdown and are now doing it with awesome trainers  thank you i fit  because of these programs we are staying fit  staying it and staying safe      
2384,5.0,                       i bought this on cyber monday  and it was a great value  so far i m loving this compared to my last treadmill  it runs smoothly and is comfortable for running or jogging  the incline is smooth as well  the only negative i ve seen so far is the fold up option is really awkward and sticks out  i don t feel safe with anyone walking around it while it s folded  so i always leave it down  mine did come with a crack on the plastic along the side of the running belt that i assume occurred during shipping  but amazon was great about replacing the whole machine  however  i did have to wait about two extra weeks to get the delivery scheduled      
2385,5.0,                       works really well  stable  you need an aux plug to play music and it took some time and   people to assemble  but otherwise no complaints  very happy with the purchase      
2386,4.0,                       we are really enjoying our treadmill and it s exactly what we needed for the living room  the other day i was thinking about the pros to walking on a treadmill vs  walking in the neighborhood  it s great not to have to look both ways or stop for cars on streets without lights  it s also nice to watch sports while engaging in a sport at the same time by running on the treadmill      
2387,3.0,                       delivery left the product damaged  as the wooden support beam that was taped to the treadmill left an imprint on the belt  additionally  the belt is position too far to the left  is not centered  and i worry that this will degrade over time in such a way as to destroy the belt  assembly will at times require two people  but can mostly be done by one person aside from the condition of the belt  the treadmill has been great      
2388,5.0,                       i ve had my treadmill for about a year   i use it nearly daily and love it   i used ifit for a month and throughly enjoyed it   it was super easy to cancel   dont let the reviews about this product being a  scam  deter you      
2389,5.0,                       i love my new treadmill  it does everything it s supposed to do  seamlessly  amazon sent three installers who did a fantastic job  my treadmill was delivered  put together and ready to use within thirty minutes  thank you      
2390,5.0,                       i have been using it for   months now and love it  it was easy to start using it once you by pass the i fit set up  i really love walking and it s great that i can do it in my home and different speeds and inclines and not have to go out in the winter weather      
2391,4.0,                       basic nordictrack  works well for the casual home runner  pushes the ifit app way too hard and i have trouble with the programming  but that doesn t affect me too much  we use it in our garage  no trouble with the breaker tripping as other have commented  the noise level is average for a treadmill      
2392,5.0,                       everything about this product has been great  the delivery was easy and setup was easy as well i have used it everyday and it works great  feels very substantial      
2393,4.0,                       no confidence in heart rate monitor   there should be more instructions for getting it going  especially with the ifit program   once i got it going i m pretty happy with it i use it for walking   the ifit app does make it more interesting than it would be without it  after all treadmills are about the most boring thing in the world      
2394,4.0,                       love the big screen for ifit to work   the tread deck is long and wide enough for running  though i would prefer longer tread deck   installation is easy but the parts do not fit together well   instructions are clear   overall a decent treadmill      
2395,5.0,                       easy to assemble and the quality is outstanding  if you want to bi pass the ifit required subscription option just hold down the ifit button for       seconds and your good to go  otherwise the treadmill won t work  besides this little issue the treadmill is amazing      
2396,5.0,                       first treadmill that i ve purchased but it works well  putting it together took some time but wasn t too bad  it s hard to move around just because it s so heavy  even with the wheels it s difficult to push to where you want it  we should have thought about where we wanted it beforehand so the delivery guys could have put it there the machine is easy to use though and works well  lots of nice features      
2397,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  i ve used it almost everyday since the day i revived it  it s perfect for those with a small living space  it cam fold up and be placed in the corner or a closet  it goes up to a speed of   mph and an incline of     i love that it includes a year with ifit  the only negative comment is that it will take a few people to put together      
2398,1.0,                       i can t even give a decent review  my brand new machine wont work  i watched in horror as the   delivery guys dropped my treadmill not once but three times  i asked well what happens when i get this together and it won t work they were not even concerned and just said   oh just return it if it doesn t work      
2399,5.0,                       this is my  st treadmill  after searching for one that will fit my needs i have found the perfect one  read many reviews  this was easy to assemble  my husband and i put it together  took like    minutes  easy to use and fits perfectly in the space i had for it  i got a free    day trial for the ifit coach app that pairs with the treadmill and it s so cool  i decided to keep the membership  well worth the    highly recommend      
2400,5.0,                       i was able to put this treadmill together by myself  the only part i needed help with was the hydrolics  i love thisntreamill  works great and not super loud      
2401,5.0,                       definitely have them bring it in and install it  it s almost    lbs  you can bypass the ifit by holding the blue button for    seconds      
2402,5.0,                       love this new treadmill   it s so much easier to exercise when there s a hot french guy on the screen walking in front of me and telling me all about the views by the river seine   lol     
2403,1.0,                       do not buy this product   sadly i been away for work and i m no longer able to return this product  the only way to use this product is to download register to ifit  which is a monthly subscription once you download the app  you have to have bluetooth enable on your device for the treadmill to connect if it wasn t for having to have a monthly subscription to ifit  i would recommend this product  but having to spend over      for this machine then      a month just to use it  both worth it      
2404,2.0,                       just a heads up   you have to sign up for the online fitness program  extra cost   to register the product with nordictrack   i bought the treadmill with  free  professional assembly  only to be emailed after purchase  this now wasn t available   the  very sorry  email just doesn t cut it   had to go on line to find the way to get the unit to work in manual mode   the advertised    workouts are supplied by third party and have a monthly subscription  they dont advertise that      
2405,1.0,                       do not buy this treadmill  i ve had it for less than   months and although i read you can use it without ifit and i have been able to for the last   months  the tablet updated and now we can t even get to the settings of the tablet because the table is stuck on a  sign up or log in  screen  not to mention i ve been on hold trying to get to customer service and when they answer i am sent to the ifit team  when i don t want to use the product      
2406,5.0,                       i absolutely love this treadmill  it is exactly what i need  and i haven t even tapped into its full potential yet   i have only adjusted the incline and speed manually  so far  but will be exploring the other features soon  my son loves using it for running to stay fit   wasn t difficult to assemble and was ready to use in a short amount of time   it is very reasonably priced  so you don t have to spend a lot of money to get a great product      
2407,5.0,                       i use the treadmill daily to walk   i have arthritis in my knees so running is out of the question   the walking surface is nice and wide and the floor belt has  give  so that is is easy on my knees   i went from walking    minutes outside to    minutes on the treadmill with little no knee pain   it is super easy to use and very sturdy   this is my first nordic trac purchase  and i would definitely buy again      
2408,1.0,                       do more research and don t buy this one  didn t realize doesn t have fan built in  after using   months started squeaking so bad and don t know how to fix it  during walking belt is so slippery   feels so uneasy under the feet that i have to hold on to handles all the time  i had few different and less expensive treadmills and never experienced such feel while walking   i dont feel is made right  and is so expensive every day i hate this thing in my living room  i want to return it asap  don t feel safe on it      
2409,4.0,                       overall a solid dependable treadmill      
2410,5.0,                       our treadmill arrived with a few bumps and bruises from shipping but amazon was very helpful in resolving the matter   i am not pleased that you had to sign up for an online service to access the treadmill  but we are very pleased with its performance   i think we will love it   we love how it easily folds up to make more space since we live in a small house      
2411,5.0,                       the delivery was very smooth  i did setup myself in   hour  very easy  i loved the ifit application  the new embedded tablet makes easy to use with or without ifit  i did not receive the activation code but via great ifit chat support i got it next day  in summary very innovative design  easy to use and setup      
2412,5.0,                       awesome    power incline  quiet  sturdy and professional quality   like the ones at the gym  great value well worth the money  amazon furnished free assembly and with purchased extended warranty i m good for   years  only paid        delivery to room of choice  great amazon service      
2413,5.0,                       this is a high quality treadmill    i m so pleased   the price was great and the auto incline is amazing    definitely money well spent       
2414,4.0,                       my husband and i enjoy using the treadmill  i like that the incline goes up to    and it s not a manual adjustment like other treadmills  it s easy to use and folds up easily too  if you are going to put the treadmill together yourself  it takes a few hours  it is heavy and a pain to bring in the house  especially with smaller door openings of an older house  the delivery was timely but the box was damaged in multiple places  the treadmill was fine  thank goodness      
2415,5.0,                       easy to operate  comfortable tread  love the flex select  i am just starting so am running in manual for a walking pace only  i find it quieter than expected  smooth operation from start to stop  great machine for my needs     
2416,1.0,                       after about   months of use the treadmill doesn t fold properly  it has been around   months now of trying to contact the company and get a replacement part under warranty but he customer service is not responsive  keep saying the part is back ordered for the last   months      
2417,1.0,                       received with a damaged screen  replacement screen came after one month but the treadmill still does not work      
2418,3.0,                       all is good  but for two items       the treadmill can be started without going to ifit com and starting a trial membership       the delivery came to the wrong house  so i had to get help  load the box into my suv  hanging out the back  and almost break my back unloading it  plus marking up the hatch doorway of my suv  i figure amazon owes me at least        for completing their delivery without any aid from them      
2419,5.0,                       i waited a while to write a review to give this an accurate review  i use this daily  sometimes twice a day  racking up several miles  i absolutely love this piece of equipment and plan to purchase more nordictrack equipment   this piece is good for someone interested in putting in some miles without major incline  love the ifit option as well  very happy with purchase      
2420,2.0,                    nos lo quedamos porque era muy complicado desmontarlo  necesitas pagar una aplicacion mensualmente para poder desbloquear la cinta         
2421,5.0,                       great quality treadmill and with the ifit training programs and fitness professional it allows me to explore the world while achieving my goals      
2422,5.0,                       love my nordictrac  the ifit membership is amazing and i ll be continuing it after the year is up      
2423,4.0,                       this treadmill is perfect for my training and has everything i need   the only thing keeping me from rating it   stars is the delivery process   it was delivered on time and the delivery team told my husband that that it came apart and could easily be carried in the house by us   not true   it was crazy heavy and took four people to move out of the garage      
2424,5.0,                       this treadmill is a charm  easy to assemble  ease to use just select a workout and done one thing i will like to have is the machine remember my settings  if i don t want to login and go straight to run  it must stay ready to do do that one you do it another suggestion is to put a down counter to start  so you re ready to run      
2425,5.0,                       this is the first treadmill i have ever purchased and i have to say that i am very pleased with it  this is a great piece of equipment for someone who wants versatility in a exercise machine because many of the built in programs offer training of the machine as well  great for beginners and experienced runners  it s very sturdy and not difficult to fold up and move as it has to wheels on the front for it to be moved  overall i am extremely pleased      
2426,5.0,                       the ifit app is easily bypassed  assembly was easy and took about   hours  you will need a second set of hands  it is also pretty heavy but the family has enjoyed it so far with no complaints      
2427,5.0,                       we are very satisfied with this treadmill  once we figured out how to adjust the belt properly we ve been using it everyday  compared to our old one  this one is very quiet and stable  the built in programs and features are simple to use      
2428,1.0,                       recent purchase july      extremely disappointed with nordictrack  the electric incline gets stick on high almost everyday  i have to disassemble the belt cover plate to remove the incline sensor manually for the incline to return to zero  what a waste of time  i would not recommend anyone to buy this p o s      
2429,5.0,                       i really like this treadmill  it s very easy to use  first we didn t figured out  after a while it s very easy to use  my family loves it  very easy assembling      
2430,5.0,                       treadmill was pretty easy to set up if you carefully follow the instructions  no worn out or missing parts  equipment is sturdy and folds up rather easily  was able to move it across the room with carpet without much of a fuss although it is still a bit bulky when it is folded up  we have had the this unit for several months and it works great  the only issue we had was with the heart monitor which does not seem accurate at all  since i have a fitbit  we can let this slide and did not even attempt to fix it  we are very happy with this purchase      
2431,1.0,                       this item came in a badly damaged box positioned on my porch crushing my hedges  the box was so damaged that the item inside had many cracked and scratched pieces  the motor housing is cracked      
2432,4.0,                       it appears to be a quality machine  assembly wasn t simple but not overly difficult  folds easy  may update after the free month with ifit expires to see haw that plays out     
2433,4.0,                       this did take a long to assemble but worth it   the only complaint i have is that the pulse sensor is not accurate    i was on the treadmill for over an hour using steep incline and it read my pulse as   bpm        
2434,5.0,                       this was a replacement treadmill   i am happy with the purchase  back on my routine   working well nice features   do not use the subscription servcxe for ifit      
2435,5.0,                       i love the new nordictrack  the treadmill itself is outstanding  however i really enjoy the way it works with the ifit app  that app really sold me on using the treadmill and how seamlessly the speed and inclines are controlled via the training programs on ifit  i also think it makes a lot of sense to purchase the extended warranty   for      and a   year peace of mind  i don t really see any downside      
2436,5.0,                       great treadmill  just heavy to carry upstairs so you probably want to opt for professional assembly      
2437,4.0,                       i just wanted to thank the delivery guys  andre and elisha  who were so awesome  they delivered the treadmill  lugged it upstairs  assembled it and showed us how to use it  they had a great attitude  they did a difficult job with a smile  they set it up facing one way and we needed it facing the other way  it was our mistake  but they did not complain one bit  we haven t used the product yet  but i just wanted to thank these two great guys      
2438,5.0,                       kind of loud but gets the job done     
2439,3.0,                       set up wasn t too hard  did come with a lot of parts  after setting up i noticed that i was missing the part that holds the treadmill up  i called them to get it shipped and i ve been waiting a month and a half now for that same part  overall the machine works great but be careful for missing parts in the shipment because you ll end up waiting forever for them      
2440,4.0,                       love this machine  the only downsize was that when i received the product there was a hugh crack but fixable  the programs on there are awesome       it keeps my healthy lifestyle fun     
2441,5.0,                       this is evan better than i thought  i love the ifit trainers  i fly through the workouts without evan realizing the time it goes so fast  the trainers talking about their location was worth it alone  i am so happy with this purchase      
2442,5.0,                       we love our nordic track treadmill   it isn t too big or bulky in our room   the ability to choose places all over the world to work out is amazing   i also like the fact that if the trainer is going at a faster or slower speed or level of difficulty  we can adjust it to our own preferences and still enjoy the scenery   the trainers are very interesting with facts about the places they are traveling to   definitely a great purchase for us      
2443,5.0,                       this is a heavy duty treadmill  you re not buying some treadmill that won t be able to handle regular use and ends up breaking on you in a year or two  you can just see in the build quality that this treadmill isn t going anywhere  this treadmill has all of the bells and whistles to customize your workout or to use the pre programed workout options      
2444,1.0,                       assembling the treadmill is a nightmare and none of the parts fit well  there was paint on the screw threads at the super heavy base  which made it impossible to tighten the thick screws using a wrench  with barely any space to maneuver  the pulse bar on the top doesn t fit right  it s been three days and we are still assembling it      
2445,2.0,                       don t know if i would buy this model again   the jury s out  you must activate by signing up for ifit to even unlock the treadmill to operate      
2446,5.0,                       i use the treadmill for walking only  as i am older and walk    min  daily  works great for me and is very quiet  the speed and incline selections are very adequate  assembly was pretty easy  with a little help from my wife  everything fit together as it should  no problems  works great for me      
2447,5.0,                       i love being able to follow the i fit trainers  it s virtual  but better than nothing at all to see during my hikes  i did find the assembly rather difficult  and have one piece of trim that is still separate from the treadmill  it doesn t affect the use of the machine  but is a bit annoying  the machine is very quiet  which my wife appreciates      
2448,3.0,                       it s nice  was very difficult for me to put together  still a little wobbly on the arms      
2449,1.0,                       just beware and read the reviews carefully  as the negative reviews are very  accurate  i have lost complete confidence in nordictrack equipment  now i have to start the long and painful process to rid of this useless  noise making  subpar equipment  beware  beware  and beware      
2450,4.0,                       we love our new treadmill   my husband and i are both walkers and for us  this is the perfect machine  especially for the price   the only complaints we have  if you can call them that   are that the machine is a bit loud and it lacks a  pause  button   the crews that delivered our machine and then put it together were fantastic   highly recommend      
2451,1.0,                       i had to return it before assemble it because the pieces was broken      
2452,3.0,                       today i assembled it and it s so complicated directions actually they should have done better with assembly instructions  product should be good as it s good brand  let s see how it goes      
2453,5.0,                       i highly recommend the nordictrack treadmill with the icon fitness app  you can run through central park or along the cape of south africa  they also have such a large variety of workouts that i am never bored  the best part is that many of the workouts are not just running or hiking  they have crossfit and hiit videos that are on and off the treadmill  it is now my official home gym      
2454,4.0,                       took about    minutes to put together  very solid for a      treadmill  have had no problems in the first    days  good deal for the price      
2455,3.0,                       it arrived broken  the assembler noticed the screen is cracked when he unpacked and assembled it  i have been on hold four separate times since yesterday for over forty five minutes each call trying to make contact with nordic track to report that the treadmill arrived broken      
2456,3.0,                       the parts  screws  are not numbered the directions are not clear and straight forward  it was very hard to put this together      
2457,5.0,                       just got it yesterday  put it together myself with some help from my husband  it runs very smoothly   if you don t want to sign up for the ifit  just put the key in and hold the ifit button for    seconds and it will start      
2458,1.0,                       don t wast your money  you have to activate ifit in order to use it  did not say anywhere on the product about it      
2459,4.0,                       the electronics are much more accurate than our last treadmill   this treadmill will not get hard use as we are in our    s   so far the unit has been easy to use and it is very stable   we like it      
2460,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill for the price   it has all the normal features and is big enough to run on  it is also great for bigger guys  i am  ft inch and     pounds  i use it every day except sunday and it runs smoothly   the adjustable pads are nice and the mantince is simple   i would recommend this for anyone      
2461,5.0,                       we looked at more expensive units but we are very happy with this model  connecting with ifit helps make the workouts fly by      
2462,5.0,                       i use this to get some exercise when i can t get outside  you can chose many per programed exercises or manually set your own  at resent  seems well built and performing as expected      
2463,1.0,                       box came destroyed  put together with what parts were there and not broken    very disappointed for the amount it cost      
2464,5.0,                       it is nice looking and works well   but   it is very heavy and a pain to put together   the  ifit  option  significant monthly fee  is confusing and turned on by default   i had to call to customer service for instructions on how to turn off the  ifit  before i could even turn on the treadmill at all      
2465,5.0,                       absolutely love our treadmill   got this at the perfect time  when the world came to an end and it became a scary place to go out and about   the free year of ifit totally makes the purchase of this machine even better   get to run in places i will no longer get to visit  due to the end of the world   the entire family is using it   hoping to get at least   years of use out of this  until the world slowing gets back to normal      
2466,5.0,                       it has easy instructions to follow for assembly  i was able to do it by myself  it folds up very easily and has a hydraulic function when unfolding that makes it super easy  it is very sturdy when jogging on it  excellent      
2467,4.0,                       overall  i love the treadmill  it provides all of the amenities i need for working out in my home   i will say  i could never have put this together on my own but a friend did it over the course of several hours   i also wish the product was easier to use without the ifit login and connection to wifi   i do not have a problem with doing that  but i feel that it should be easier to use without      
2468,4.0,                       great for intermediate runners and those wanting to keep active during winter  would be best for lighter runners as the belt motor can slip when heavier runners step  over    lbs   setup and operation of the machine are both very easy and required only common tools  heart rate sensors and distance tracking can be spotty  but give a fairly accurate reading under most circumstances  overall this is a good machine that serves it s purpose with the added feature of mobility and storage space      
2469,1.0,                       i purchased the item and after taking hours to set it up the dash board not reading anything correct if i press speed   it shows me        i tried to call them but no help     
2470,5.0,                       this is one of the best purchases we made on amazon  the machine was delivered on time  it has been running great for us during the pandemic  we also enjoy the ifit and plan to extend our ifit contract  we happy with everything      
2471,5.0,                       very durable so far really like it  bot the easiest to assemble though     
2472,5.0,                       we received our treadmill in a broken box  it s been used a couple of times and it s great treadmill overall  it took   persons to set up  i did not need to activate the ifit like other reviews stated  incline is great  i wish i could use the programs w o the ifit though and it doesn t power off on its own nor does it have a power on off button on the screen      
2473,5.0,                       easy to assemble but needs another pair of hands to help  the ifit was easy to use and whole setup was very clear and done under   hours      
2474,5.0,                       excellent machine is quieter than the one i used to own previously to this one well constructed and easy to assemble      
2475,5.0,                       this is my second treadmill the first treadmill i received arrived damaged i had to return it it seem to work ok now i have the new one it s been assembled and i ve only used it twice so i don t know about the durability of the motor or the belt or any of the other parts      
2476,5.0,                       this treadmill has all the basic features you d expect from any quality machine   what i like most is the thought put into a great virtual fitness app that helps free my mind during vigorous training  grinds    there are plenty of professional ifit coaches with their varying personalities  area sites  and different types of workout intensities to choose from  from casual walks all the way to actual marathon level training    in this machine  i get nordictrack s full package and at a very reasonable price      
2477,5.0,                       this is perfect for my use   it s sturdy   it does not have a ton of electronic features  but that is not what i was looking for   you do not need to purchase or register the product through a  rd party software   simply hold that the button for    seconds and boom  the treadmill starts   i note that the rails on the side of the belt are not all that sturdy and are somewhat narrow   i would recommend this product for the price point      
2478,4.0,                       nordictrack is good for basic exercise  when using the ifit application it may take longer time for the inclines  other than the slow incline  i like to have the nordictrack at home  anytime during the day i can enjoy  the ifit application is a great addition and very motivating  there was no problem in the order  folding or assembly  it s not occupying a huge space  i highly recommend this for people who are interested in keep going with routine exercises      
2479,5.0,                       love my nordictrack  assembly was easy a couple of directions you need a  nd person to help  ifit not something i need  nor pay extra for  but overall was a great purchase      
2480,5.0,                       this treadmill has been great since the pandemic started  i ve logged a little over     miles walking while working and running since we ve got it  it is quiet enough when set to walk that my wife doesn t wake up and we live in a studio  the overall support has been good on the knees and shins so far and i would highly recommend      
2481,5.0,                       we have owned a couple treadmills in the past that were more money   this nordic track is as nice or nicer than the other ones   very solid  doesn t move  and  pretty quiet   getting it up stairs to our second floor was a bear   trust me you will need help  but after we got it there assembly was easy   the only thing that really doesn t work very well are the hand grips that are suppose to show your heart beats  which to me is no big deal   overall we are very happy with this machine      
2482,1.0,                       got it today and as i being to assemble it  i notice that the right side of the belt is broken   see pictures  i m not sure if parts can be replaced  and the panel holes did not align very well      
2483,1.0,                       i must like nordic track because this is my forth one in a row since        if i had known about this scam i would have not bought this one   i m eighty years old so i won t have a chance to switch brands   i feel like taking it to the dump along with the old one  if you experiment you will find you can beat the scammers by holding down the ifit button until it activates without the scammers  i am amazed nordic track allows their customers to be abused like this      
2484,5.0,                       i give the product five stars  but the shipping leaves something to be desired  i have pictures of the shipping box and it is not a pretty sight  pretty damaged and beat up for sure it was only a miracle the unit itself was not damaged      
2485,1.0,                       asked to have product delivered to  nd floor  you did not inform me you refuse to perform request i m insulted by your not informing me of denial of service  will consider returning product    searching alt item very insulted  pure treatment     
2486,5.0,                       we like everything about our new nordic track treadmill   we are getting healthier every day we use it   my husband has even been able to play golf with his buddies again      
2487,1.0,                       i have been trying to this treadmill to work since      this  am  i ve registered it and it ask for proof of purchase  after that they want a copy of the purchase   after all that they want you to buy a service contract  if you don t purchase on from them you can t get an activation code  all we want is to be able to turn the machine on   set the speed and exocise    we don t need any of their programs  we don t want any of their crap             
2488,1.0,                       product came damaged   wasted lots of time on the phone trying to replace   still on hold           
2489,5.0,                       i am not a long time runner  it took me time to build up to   miles  and this treadmill has been excellent for me to maintain and increase that distance during the cold weather so i don t have to  start over  in the spring  assembly was long but not too difficult to do solo  i am very happy with this treadmill after spending time evaluating different models for purchase     
2490,5.0,                       this is a very sturdy product  one of the people who uses it is almost     lbs and it works lovely for them  it also tracks your heart rate well  the display is bright and clear  it also has an easy to use on off switch  the only downside is it is time consuming for one person to put together alone  over all though a fantastic product  it s also easy to use for people new to working out      
2491,1.0,                       i just spent a couple hours on the phone with my bank and amazon  seems as though no one knew anything about the equal pay promotion that both companies attached their name too  and was literally a button on the item i purchased on the amazon page  extremely frustrated with amazon  a complete meltdown in efficiency and competency  i am now without the large amount of money this thing cost  the small amount each month was manageable  really frustrated with a lack of answers and accountability  really didn t want to post anything because it felt like a private matter since it involved my financial situation  but the frustration too real      
2492,5.0,                       i have been using the treadmill since it came to my home  it had a squeak in the rear idler roller  called customer service and they sent me a new one right a way  they were very good about the new part under warranty  installed it right a way and this one also has a very small speak only once in a while guess we will live with that      
2493,5.0,                       this was easier to assemble than i expected after reading the reviews  it did take   people towards the end  but the instructions were spot on  i did have to sign up for ifit to start the treadmill  but i did not have to enter a card number  my subscription will automatically end after    days  it s simple  runs well  not noisy and i m very pleased  just what i wanted      
2494,1.0,                       originally purchased this for my wife  however  incorrect parts were shipped and we are unable to assemble this product  manufacturer is slow to respond to emails and still has not offered a solution to getting this fixed  buyer beware      
2495,1.0,                       tomorrow will be  yrs to the day that this treadmill was delivered  today while running on it  it just died      
2496,5.0,                       i use this treadmill for indoor walking exercise   it is great   i love the size and ease of the machin     
2497,5.0,                       a great professional treadmill in the market  for a good price  with a very wide running area  and many essential features  it was pretty easy to assemble and it s easy to flod     
2498,4.0,                       directions confused me a little but wasnt to bad took us   hours to assemble  definitely need two people for assembly  dont love ifit  if you pause the video it changes the settings and doesnt go back to the height and speed you started with  it s also a little expensive  but i love the treadmill so glad this is the one i purchased  love the flex select  it s not to loud simple easy controls  the heart monitor in the handles doesnt work very well for me      
2499,5.0,                       great treadmill  got an amazon guy to assemble it  having great time using it  never better  exactly what i needed      
2500,2.0,                       the plastic materials seem very cheap i assembled it and the left side sits flush with no issues  the right side does not sit flush  i check the wires and and they are not on the way screwing it to the plastics are a pain  you need to use full force  but no power tools can be used for such an expensive machine  i expect better materials      
2501,5.0,                       i could not be happier with the purchase of this nordic track treadmill  there are some brutal winters where i live and this helps me to move without braving the weather   the ifit software makes it more interesting to do a longer workout inside without getting bored      
2502,5.0,                       great price  lot of treadmill for the money very detailed instructions  reasonably simple to assemble   heavy duty   prompt delivery     
2503,5.0,                       the quality of materials feel sturdy and well made  it is very easy to put together  and easy to use  you can use with the ifit or easily use it as a manual treadmill  as a regular treadmill it is the best i ve used based on the shocks system  incline abilities  and durability without creating a massive footprint      
2504,4.0,                       the belt is too thin   so thin  it is akin to walking on metal which hurts my feet even though i wear professional sneakers with orthotics  what is the solution   replace the original belt with the thickest belt possible  george shackleton     
2505,5.0,                       came in   day shipping  assembly was a pain in the butt but only took about a half hour   works excellent and seems to be a great machine  held the ifit button for about    seconds to activate the machine without ifit       
2506,1.0,                       arrived damaged  amazon sent email stating new treadmill would delivered and damaged would be picked up same day   new delivered however  drivers knew nothing about picking up the damaged product     so amazon reschedule a second pick up time  driver shows up a week later and states he just realized this is a  two  man job and would need to reschedule  now amazon is saying   nd     issiah  the person who completed assembly was amazing  just need a strait answer as to when the damaged machine will be removed from my home      
2507,5.0,                       bought this because of the pandemic   it took about   hours to put together with a little help   wish i would have bought it earlier in the year   i use it to follow ifit on my    inch tablet   both the treadmill and ifit are a perfect  match for me   need to buy an extended warranty next just in case      
2508,3.0,                       delivery package completely destroyed  but luckily after assembly  it works fine  assembly was a bit rough and took two people quite an effort  bolts and parts are a bit rough and lots of roughing it out and forcing parts and bolts to fit together  belt needed adjusting and lubing after assembly      
2509,5.0,                       we bought this product for the health benefits  we are getting older and staying healthy is very difficult  this machine makes a big difference in our efforts      
2510,5.0,                       this treadmill is great and it serves all my needs for exercise  i m very glad i asked two very smart people to help me assemble it  assembly isn t trivial  but now that it s put together  it works great      
2511,5.0,                       absolutely love my nordictrack     so quiet  smooth  handles have great hold  love the   side compartments as my amazon fire fits in one and my water bottle in the other   just fine  incline is quiet and love how it s just the  touch of a button      
2512,1.0,                       only had it one month and the incline does not work   panel on left has    numbers which when you press only make noise and machine does not elevate      
2513,5.0,                       easy to assemble and setup  had to search a bit online to figure out how to power up the first time and bypass a fitness subscription  have been very pleased for the     months we ve had it  get s daily use and have had no issues      
2514,1.0,                       waste of money and time  does not work  amazon should take it off their site      
2515,5.0,                       the directions were horrible and there were no directions for those pieces i don t know when they were supposed to go on it doesn t say i guess i was supposed to guess my second thing i m really pissed that i was forced and fraudulently made to purchase fit in order to turn on my machine that really pissed me off the machine is nice but the fact that they hide those secret things from you when you purchase it they did not say anything about that     
2516,5.0,                       occasionally need to tighten belt  wide for larger folks   and recommend getting a good pad for the floor  folds and rolls easily  and if you don t want the ifit you must cancel it      
2517,5.0,                       better than chinese treadmill i lost a lot of money and superfit treadmill and amazon couldn t refund me my          
2518,4.0,                       the ifit app charges you at the end go the month for a years service   fortunately they will back out the charge if you call   the machine itself is excellent even more so if you need or can use the apps   at    years old im happy with doing   miles at   mph  with     elevation every other day   we overbought but do like the product      
2519,5.0,                       i ve been using this treadmill for over three years now and have been very happy with it  i use it primarily for walking but it has lots of higher speeds for running as well  i haven t used ifit or any of the special programs features  i just get on it and walk  it s very easy to fold and unfold  no complaints      
2520,3.0,                       all the program modes seem to be meant to work with an ifit device  otherwise  they can t be customized the treadmill works best just on manual  i wish i could customize the display to just show time    not alternate with an arbitrary  pretend distance       
2521,4.0,                       the treadmill is perfect in every way except you have to use the app to start the machine each and every time     
2522,5.0,                       we bought this treadmill to upgrade an ancient one that we ve had for years  it is so much nicer and easier to operate  very pleased with our purchase      
2523,1.0,                       the machine looks good but it arrived without the crossbar  when we contacted nordictrac they said it s backordered which means we are not alone   we wanted to avoid shipping the product back and asked for an estimate of the part delivery and they said it was unknown      
2524,1.0,                       so i can t say i ve been able to use the machine as i am waiting on nordic track to send a replacement part that i had to jump through hoops to get  unfortunately i wasn t offered expert assembly through amazon because of covid so i am currently struggling to put it together myself  i ll update once i get the replacement part      
2525,5.0,                       great product  does exactly what i need it to do   i never am bored and i love using it  motivation      
2526,5.0,                       i purchased the nordictrack treadmill from amazon and am really very happy with it  wasn t that difficult to assemble it and its been running perfectly  its pretty sturdy and does not wobble when i run which is good  easy to fold and store as well  one of the rear part was damaged when arrived but nordictrack sent me a replacement part pretty fast  definitely recommend this       
2527,5.0,                       product is great problem is i bought this item twice before and my money was refunded to me they said damaged during shipping third time i paid      more than original and it was shipped through amazon originally     
2528,5.0,                       the nordic track does not take up a lot of space  i paid for the assembly which took less than   hours  i paid for the extra large screen  i am pleased with the nordic track and my workout regime  this is a great product for me  it is much more cost effective and personally satisfying than going to the gym      
2529,5.0,                       my wife loves this treadmill  the integrated screen and ability to walk anywhere in the world virtually  let s her enjoy walking and learn about  where  she is walking      
2530,5.0,                       this took two of us to realistically put together  it is heavy but once it s together it works seamlessly  we love it for both walking up an incline and running      
2531,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill   sturdy but comfortable for all users in our family   i am very pleased with the operation of the unit   belt runs very smoothly and noise level is very minimal   the wifi connectivity is easy and good quality   this unit is easy to use and was really very easy to assemble   great value in this product      
2532,2.0,                       the treadmill works ok but overtime i go to use it i have to navigate around the constant request to connect to wifi   i do not want to use ifit and i should  t be continually badgered to sign up for it  i called nordictrack and spent    minutes only to find out that this lovely feature can not be turned off      
2533,5.0,                       i do not like being forced to give away my personal information in order to use treadmill  that was not a classy move  functionally it works great for me     lbs  and family members who are around          
2534,5.0,                       love this thing   amazon even provided free set up   great price for the product   it not that loud  easy to fold up and it in lines and you can run on it   it s a decent priced treadmill for the house      
2535,5.0,                       nordic track unavailable  on hold for hours  needed  belt adjustment  screws were stripped   again nordic track live person impossible to reach     
2536,1.0,                       don t buy  damaged after   months     
2537,3.0,                       makes a lot of noise  the belt adjustment screw was stripped so i can t center the belt      
2538,1.0,                       everything  i think  works on this treadmill except for the treadmill will not move at all   josh was a great person to deal with but unfortunately took a while to get to him   we were sent a replacement cable and when assembled    again     treadmill still will not work   no one was able to help us and it was suggested that we return it      
2539,5.0,                       the treadmill is very nice   but some of the plastic parts don t line up perfectly and was a bit of a pain to assemble  other than that it s super stable and the screen is pretty nice  very nice purchase      
2540,5.0,                       ok  so i love this treadmill  it s lovely  has loads of options  and it works well  but it was a nightmare to assemble  you will need at least two people    i promise  it s not for the faint of heart      
2541,5.0,                       the best unit we bought so far      
2542,1.0,                       treadmill received was damaged  both rails broken and motor not running  manufacture is not responsive spent hour on hold and call disconnected      
2543,5.0,                       solid workout platform  use while taking  great courses  classes mostly and like the ifit programs  helps in recovery from cervical vertebrae surgery  overall satisfied  cats like pad it s on  divots on floor      
2544,4.0,                       treadmill screen came broken due to the delivery people  the box was completely broken up and half opened  immediately called amazon customer service and they offered to replace or refund      amazon also connected me with nordictrack and they shipped me a free replacement screen  still waiting on the replacement screen  but so far i love the treadmill  my husband had no issues assembling      
2545,5.0,                       this thing is awesome  with the ifit app it moves on its owne  i have it for   days now and used it with the app   times a day with no problems      
2546,5.0,                       great piece of equipment     
2547,5.0,                       paid to have professional assembled and well worth that cost   i have had treadmill for about   months and it works great   noise is minimum and does not disturb other family members when i am working out early in the morning   wish the speakers on the treadmill were better quality but i typically use my headphones to my phone so not a deal breaker for me      
2548,2.0,                       disappointingly poor quality  a hassle to assemble  incline decline is very slow  consider buying a different  better  model the treadmill comes disassembled  and takes a minimum of an hour to assemble with two people also  upon turning on  it wouldn t allow me to use manual mode  i m not paying for ifit   had to scour forums just to find that in order to reset it  you have to hold down the blue ifit button for    seconds      
2549,5.0,                       extremely happy with my purchase  i bought additional service to deliver this to a room of my choice  once delivered it took me about   hours to assemble  you will need ifit account to activate your treadmill  since then i have been using it regularly and it has not disappointed me a bit  will definitely recommend it      
2550,5.0,                       love this treadmill   at first i was frustrated with setting up the ifit morning part as i just wanted to run on my treadmill   but after i set up the ifit part i m so glad i did   during this quarantine i ve been running in croatia   hawaii  egypt  etc  and learning about new places as i do it   the treadmill works great and is easy to use and set up  this was an excellent purchase  no regrets      
2551,1.0,                       this treadmill comes with a free year of ifit  yet when i go to enter the code  it says it s invalid  when i call customer support  i get an automatic message saying that i need to register the treadmill and wait a whole hour before i can even talk to anyone  this is ridiculous      
2552,5.0,                       day     love it l smooth  pretty quiet   so happy i m losing weight while watching tv   down     calories so far             
2553,5.0,                       assembly is a little wonky toward the end  i was missing a bolt  but really great treatmill  supports regular web browsing youtubing      
2554,5.0,                       great treadmill  don t need ifit membership to activate  i was hesitant to purchase the treadmill because of the ifit membership horror stories  press the ifit button for    seconds and it will use manual mode instead      
2555,5.0,                       i have used this treadmill for the last   months and really enjoyed it  i had been reluctant to buy a treadmill before and used rowing and elliptical machines being afraid of hurting my knees  turned out flexselect  cushioning works really nice  so that i have had no problems with my joints  do not worry about ifit membership   you can cancel it at any time      
2556,3.0,                       i just received my treadmill today          i m a little leery as it s loud af and it seems rather rickety  this is clearly a base model  i m apprehensive about it lasting very long  but we shall see  i m going to give this equipment the benefit of the doubt and rate it a   star and adjust after giving time for use to see if it holds up well      
2557,5.0,                       love it   highly recommend for moms with kids and distance learning  great for the whole family on rainy and cold days      
2558,1.0,                       received a defective machine   worked with icon who handles nordictrack s tech and customer service inquiries   that turned out to be a disaster   upon icon finally admitting that they would not be able to timely service our machine  we turned to amazon   thankful for amazon s customer service  although it took speaking with the right supervisor  we were able to get the machine returned for a full refund      
2559,4.0,                       it took   hours for my husband and i to assemble the machine   it is very heavy   make sure you have two very strong persons to assemble   i can t figure out where the search bar is for the workout library  it would make it a lot easier to  sort thru specific workouts  the machine is very big  so make sure you have plenty of room      
2560,5.0,                       this is a great product  i wanted a treadmill without a lot of bells and whistles  i have used it everyday since i received the treadmill and i haven t been disappointed   it was very easy to bypass the ifit product by pressing the ifit button until the screen lights up   the delivery went seamlessly  the set up arranged through amazon was great with no problems   this treadmill is very quiet  would recommend this product to anyone      
2561,1.0,                       i ordered this to walk at an incline and spent the time assembling the treadmill and it seems to work fine but will not incline at all  requested service online   days ago without any response  currently still on hold for    minutes without speaking with a person     
2562,5.0,                       very nice treadmill  i got it with installation  the installer was awesome  the treadmill is a gem  now i walk  jog at my own timing in from a tv at my pace      
2563,1.0,                       not a good experience     
2564,1.0,                       we paid for installation but the unit had a defective part   we received a new part but heard nothing more from either the manifacturer or the installer as was promosed    the works but cannot be moved out of the way   be careful      
2565,1.0,                       does not work  nordictrack has now sent us two parts to install ourselves  it seems the second set of parts they sent us are not the correct ones  we have had it now for a couple weeks  very disappointed      
2566,5.0,                       great piece of equipment   it s very well made  i  bought this model as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loved it   now everyone at the house is using it  it was also very easy to assemble      
2567,4.0,                       we looked into treadmills for a while before deciding on this one  it has been great  it gets the job done and we haven t had any issues  the belt does tend to slip over to one side  but it is not grinding on anything  so it s fine  i saw a lot of reviews saying that you can t use this without signing up for the ifit program  which is not true  we used the program for the free trial  and have bypassed it since good for the money      
2568,1.0,                       the wrong screw was sent for the ground wire  once assembled we discovered that the base was bent as the treadmill did not clear the handrail when folded  the new base has been on back order for over   weeks  we disassembled it and are returning it      
2569,5.0,                       this product is amazing  we had belonged to the gym  but were not going or getting sick from germs now we get up and work out on our schedule  play music  shower and ready to go recommend highly     
2570,4.0,                       had it for   weeks  so far very good  sturdy and relatively quiet on carpet with a heavy exercise mat and overweight users  kids can t turn it on  but don t lose the magnet  folding feature doesn t really help us because it s not compact enough  safer for the little ones just to leave it out  but good product so far      
2571,5.0,                       arrived quickly and great product  i m not great with assembling stuff like this  so i had my brother in law do it  i love it       
2572,5.0,                       lightweight but seems sturdy  folds easily and love the hydraulic unfolding  straightforward control panel and functions  good value for the money  i personally dont use the ifit feature as i think its overpriced  highly recommended if you re shopping for quality  price  and ease of use      
2573,1.0,                       absolutely do not buy this product if you re concerned about being able to store the track out of the way  the hydraulic kickstands on these treadmills are defective  they do not fit which is why i m sure there s a discounted price  buyer beware      
2574,3.0,                       i made the mistake of purchasing this treadmill online  had i purchased it in a store i would have had the option of including installation  now  i have a box on the floor and no way of using it      
2575,5.0,                       did a lot of research and decided on this one   i was very concerned about the quality considering the price   assembly was a bit arduous but overall simple   the quality of the individual parts is impressive as well     will wait to see how it performs a year from now and enter an update      
2576,5.0,                       my son and i like it very much and we are on it almost every day   like i said it is a strong machine and i hope it can last for a long time      
2577,1.0,                       the treadmill could not be activated until we signed up for an ifit monthly program  we actually had to give them our credit card number before we could even use the device  this is absolute bs      
2578,5.0,                       this is a perfect size quiet and really well made my husband put it together in about    minutes the hardest part was the  unlock  code  i got    year warranty but hope ii don t need it  this s a great product for under       not sure i will need the gym to open or at least i will keep working out at home when i cant get there  surprisingly high quality for the money      
2579,5.0,                       easy to assemble and comfortable for running  have not used the ifit system for any runs yet but for quick     mile runs i have liked it so far  really like the way it folds and unfolds  light weight to lift and fold      
2580,5.0,                       works as described   works well     
2581,5.0,                       press the ifit button for    seconds to unlock without membership i m     and put it together myself  would recommend having a second person but can be done on your own      
2582,5.0,                       smooth action  easy on the feet   i use it barefoot   had a problem with one of the parts   considering the covid situation the problem was remedied in a timely manner      
2583,1.0,                       even though i like how you can unfold it i find the other problems with it our weigh the good in the product  the work out hurts my knees and back and everyone in the house can hear it when i use it  the assembly was very difficult by one person and moving it to another room is so difficult that it has to be assembled in the room you are going to use it in      
2584,5.0,                       we love  love  love our nordic track treadmill     use it every day  was delivered quickly  was easy to assemble and works perfectly         
2585,4.0,                       thanks to the other reviews for explaining how to get the treadmill going without using ifit  i am only interested in using it for basic walking indoors  for that  it s great  i can t speak to ifit because i didn t sign up for that      
2586,5.0,                       just been installed  it s better than expected  runs smooth  one touch of incline even while running  great workout settings  pulse detector  quite motor  large belt for safety   etc  i highly recommend  if any problem occurs  i ll update      
2587,2.0,                       the belt skips and struggles when my foot lands  in             
2588,4.0,                       we love this treadmill  only two things we ve noticed   sometimes the wifi disconnects  so we can t finish our workout  and the screen is small  however  that was purely our choice in screen size model  we plan to buy another one when this one has exhausted its life and will definitely pay extra for a larger screen  we love that you can travel the world  and the coaches are super great        
2589,5.0,                       i love this machine   i use it every morning and i don t have to force myself   the workouts are fun and there are so many choices that anyone can benefit from using it   i m hoping for the bike next       
2590,5.0,                       i received free installation on this so i can not comment on the ease of assembly once assembled the treadmill is easy to use and easy to fold and move  which is nice for saving space   the treadmill is great for most runners   if you are looking for a treadmill and don t need to run at a pace under a   minute mile this is a good choice      
2591,1.0,                       set it all up step by step like in the book  smells burnt and won t start over    seconds     
2592,5.0,                       love this treadmill  i use it   days a week  the large screen is awesome with the virtual training  i just wish it had a fan for my excruciating runs  although i have gotten used to it  the price was great for an awesome treadmill  delivery was fast with no product damage      
2593,5.0,                       my wife uses it daily and i run on it a few times a week  so far it s stood up to the use with no issues assembly was a breeze  if you ve ever put equipment together you shouldn t have any issue although there are a few points that will require   people for the price and how it s run so far i couldn t be happier      
2594,5.0,                       it is well built  it is sturdy  with a solid feel on the tread area which is both wide enough and long enough making it easy to walk comfortably   it is easty to set controls for both speed and incline  lastly  the adjustment to change the flex of the track is easy to adjust for individual comfort      
2595,5.0,                       this product is advertised appropriately   nice middle grade machine that connect to bluetooth to enable programed work outs with the treadmill      
2596,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  i bought my first nordictrack treadmill almost    years ago and used it many times a week  i got my money s worth and then some so i went with nordictrack again  so happy i did  my wife who is usually on an elliptical now uses my treadmill almost every day  the ifit sessions are awesome  we can run and see sights all over the world  this is a great piece of equipment      
2597,1.0,                       the treadmill worked fine the first year but after    months the middle of the treadmill sags and will need to be replaced  save your money  from nordic track  the bottom of the treadmill is cracked  made of plastic  this is causing the treadmill to sag  not durable       
2598,5.0,                       this treadmill works great  is not loud  i would recommend it  it works by itself no need to buy ifit membership  but i have to say the ifit membership is fun i will take advantage of the free month      
2599,4.0,                       the treadmill functions great  very sturdy  i do wish there was a way to keep running stats without subscribing to ifit  the screen is very old school  but i opted for the less expensive treadmill so gave up that feature  assembly was quite a production  taking two of us a about two hours to put it together      
2600,4.0,                       touch screen is not that responsive  do not like the fact that the free ifit is not free until you give them your credit card number     
2601,5.0,                       easy to assemble  but for less problems read two steps ahead before assembling a step   to get the treadmill to work i had to enter through an app my residental address  i ve deleted the app  but still getting paper postal mail      
2602,5.0,                       i ve been using this treadmill for two weeks   so far i love it  it s exactly what i was looking for  it s very sturdy with a wide belt  tracks my miles   time    that s really all i need  i didn t want to pay more for a big screen   a bunch of features i will never use  so this is perfect  my husband   i put it together in under two hours   i m glad i didn t pay for the professional install  because it was actually really easy to assemble  it arrived very well packaged   all of the parts were there  i don t have any complaints  but i will update if i experience any issues as i build up my mileage   train for a half marathon      
2603,5.0,                       my husband and i use this daily to run at high speeds  the one touch controls are a feature i never knew i needed until now  the ifit app is amazing because you select the work out and it will control the treadmill for you so you can have a hands free run or walk  plus  you get to see beautiful views from all over the world  the treadmill took no time for my husband to install and is worth every penny imho      
2604,1.0,                       after putting the unit together only to figure out that the frame is bent   called tech support and they will only repair the unit not replace it   i am told it can take weeks to repair   i would like to return  but how do you return such a big item   by the way we purchase the extra warranty that said they would replace it      
2605,5.0,                       i am so glad i caught such an amazing deal on this treadmill  it was definitely worth every penny  it arrived quickly and i had a professional assemble it  i have   complaints so far      
2606,4.0,                       ehh not too bad  low expectations  hate the fact i had to register with ifit  seems unethical to require to use it      
2607,5.0,                       exceptional for the cost   i m very pleased with this purchase      
2608,5.0,                       i have started my home gym and i picked this treadmill and it didn t disappoint exactly what we wanted  definitely recommend       
2609,3.0,                       treadmill is easy to use  bypass ifit by holding ifit button down for    seconds for manual use  takes   people to set up  delivery guys dropped one side of the box when delivered  looked at my ring video  had the treadmill only for   days and console controls  stop button   up speed button didn t work  might be faulty equipment or due to being dropped      
2610,1.0,                       worst treadmill ever    the incline doesn t calibrate  too much screeching from the machine  need to return it  called cust serv many times  no response at all       
2611,1.0,                       honestly i had the worst experience purchasing a treadmill through amazon  i had purchased assembly through amazon which was scheduled a week after i received the equipment   but the technician never showed up to install  and it was beyond painful to schedule service  i finally got the unit assembled   weeks after having it in my possession  and the treadmill itself is very shaky when running on it      
2612,1.0,                       unit arrived with a cracked motor cover and the incline motor appears to be seized up  contacted support and replacement parts are on the way  thus far not impressed  final outcome pending      
2613,5.0,                       great treadmill   this is the real deal  especially for its price   it is spacious and comfortable to use   the interactive ifit program is a plus   didn t think i would like that feature as much as i do  you can t go wrong if you are looking for a machine that is gym quality for your home      
2614,4.0,                       started using the treadmill regularly  very sturdy and quiet  for a treadmill   yes it ll need   persons to assemble  especially the handle and screen  ifit is good to have  too only issue so far is i need to adjust the bell once a month  probably due to my kids running too fast        
2615,5.0,                       i love my treadmill so far  i didn t have a problem to turn it on  i saw the bad reviews because of it  after set i place the key in and hold it down for    second and it was activated  it has been a week and im satisfied so far  will come again after a month or so      
2616,5.0,                       have owned several treadmills and this was the best treadmill i ve had and by far the cheapest  very durable and very easy to assemble      
2617,1.0,                       everything with this order was wrong  i am very unhappy with the machine  bluetooth doesn t workservices for assembly was not obtained and i was afraid to issue a return cause it s heavy and i couldn t put it in a package to returned     
2618,5.0,                       easy to assemble   took a little over an hour with two people  got it for an awesome price  great for at home workouts      
2619,5.0,                       i didn t assemble it  so i can t speak to that  but  it s light weight  works well  has the functions i need and comes at a great price  it s an excellent basic treadmill  i use it every day  my only slight  super slight  criticism is that if you pause it and leave for more than   min it resets  but  that s incredibly minor given the rest      
2620,5.0,                       wonderful product for the price  we use it mostly for walking and it is just what we needed for the long winter      
2621,5.0,                       this is my first treadmill  it fulfilled all my expectation and ease of use  only concern i had was the ifit subscription  user should be given an option to use without it  i found it online on how to bypass  from the treadmill perspective  it is great product and it keeps me active  i would recommend this      
2622,1.0,                       this damn thing makes you activate it with a credit card before you can use it  and of course the first month is frrm so you can forget to cancel and tehy can milk you for       shame on you nordic track i ve had half of dozen of these throughout the years and never and bs like this      
2623,5.0,                       it took some time to assemble but the instructions were easy to follow   i m very happy with the product and would      recommend      
2624,1.0,                       i got this during the beginning of the covid scare  and the belt is already ripping  only a few months in   poor quality     
2625,5.0,                       i finally was able to save up to get this and get m so happy i did  it wasn t too hard to assemble  and it s very easy to use  i am really satisfied with my purchase      
2626,5.0,                       this nordic track treadmill is exactly what i needed   good quality  sturdy   simple to use  affordable  perfect for an older person like me to just walk on days that are too hot  cold or rainy  which is most of time in my area   i did have to hire someone to assemble it for a cost of        well worth it   i use it everyday and love it      
2627,4.0,                       great product  dont particularly like the fact that i had to register with the manufacturer and give my credit card number for a subscription service that i didn t need  of course  i can opt out of the subscription within    days but dont like the process of giving my cc number before i could use my purchase      
2628,4.0,                       this treadmill was delivered on time as originally scheduled  it took two people a few hours to put together  i would have paid for assembly if it had been available at the time of purchase   the treadmill serves its purpose and i did buy the   year year maintenance plan      
2629,5.0,                       love this nordi track  assembly was easy  its very good  i ve had it for few months and no complains  the best buy ever   i do suggest you buy the extended warranty      
2630,1.0,                       though the surface is even and i have screwed properly  noise is very big when i run  i don t know how to fix the noise  i would appreciate if somebody helps me in fixing noise issue      
2631,4.0,                       just know that all you have to do to activate it is hold the bluetooth button for   seconds  no need to sign up for their service or put in your credit card like they make it to seem  great treadmill but i don t like the deceptful tactics they use to try to get you to pay for their service      
2632,4.0,                       pay for the professional assembly and save   hours of your life     
2633,4.0,                       it works  deck is quiet  basic folding treadmill  display is annoyingly bright the f you like to run in the dark  for just over      delivered it s great      
2634,5.0,                       since covid and the gyms being closed  i had to bring the  gym to me  i m excited to be able to run indoors this winter  i ditched the gym membership  and am working out from home  i am still learning how to stay dedicated to a home workout routine      
2635,5.0,                       i am really impressed with the options available with this unit  operates a lot quieter than my previous treadmill  the assembly can be challenging for a person not as equipped but can be accomplished  i am using this unit at least     times a week      
2636,3.0,                       at low speeds  the belt is a little jerky  meaning it slows down  and speeds up causing a slight stumble    at higher speeds  above  mph  its great      
2637,1.0,                       the requirement for pairing and activating before you can use the treadmill is ridiculous   you should be able to turn it on and use it with out that crap   if it wouldn t have been such a pain in the ass  i would have returned it on principal      
2638,5.0,                       cumbersome to put together   be sure to have someone to help because i really don t think you can do it by yourself   once together  it s great   quieter than my past treadmills  would recommend      
2639,1.0,                       ifit bypass didn t work  and canceling membership is impossible to reach the customer service      
2640,5.0,                       this tredmill is amazing and the year free ifit program is so motivating to use the tredmill everyday  money well spent  the people that delivered the tredmill were very kind and took care of the product and even opened the box to show there was no damage      
2641,4.0,                       nice treadmill display not the greatest  pretty quiet  good treadmill for the price   do yourself a favor  pay someone to put it together i put mine together and it sucked but got it done      
2642,1.0,                       totally bogus  the treadmill comes  locked  and you can only activate it by signing up for a  free  subscription membership  i think this practice is illegal product tying  and is pretty despicable   sa e yourself some trouble  hold the ifit button for    seconds  it unlocks the treadmill without registration  the treadmill itself is pretty good      
2643,5.0,                       really love this treadmill  using ifit is great and i make up my own workout and with ipad plugged in on sirius xm radio it is a great experience     
2644,5.0,                       we are very happy with this product   we were nervous that the quality might be subpar given the price   however  nordictrack has not disappointed   we love the features and it has very little bounce when running at a decent clip      
2645,5.0,                       this is exactly what we wanted   we didn t need or want all the bells and whistles like ifit  we just want to walk  this machine works great for us      
2646,5.0,                       very large  u will need a large area to use it  i bought for my husband  so it will work well for larger men as well as women  very nice treadmill      
2647,1.0,                       purchased on november  th and stopped working december  th  treadmill doesn t move and screen goes in and out  amazon of course made the return easy  nordic track wanted to send me some mother board to replace  don t think i should have to do anything to a brand new machine so just returning  it did do the job when it was operating      
2648,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  it s so easy to fold  it s amazing for working out      
2649,5.0,                       excellent budget friendly treadmill  my wife uses it everyday  i will once the rains start coming      
2650,5.0,                       treadmill is pretty quiet  i use it in room next to the baby sleeping without ever waking her up   side panel numbers for speed elevation are quick and easy for intervals   the compact design and fold up is great to push it out of the way when not in use   ifit workouts are such a motivator   i never thought i would be using it so much  really enjoy  traveling the world  with each workout      
2651,5.0,                       i am a very good runner  this treadmill is for professionals and non professional runners great product  very strong  solid  and comfortable treadmill  easy to install   cup holders are large   easy to fold and safe   overall   stars and my recommendation is to purchase   years service plan      
2652,4.0,                       it is so heavy and thanks for the delivery staff  they are helpful and arrived on time  the assemble is ok by using  user s manual step by step one hint is never tighten the screws so hard of both  uprights  steps      till you  put on the pulse cross bar step     it is great gift   happy thanksgiving      
2653,5.0,                       i love it  i have some hard time to unfold because it needs some strength  other than that it is a great product     
2654,5.0,                       this a great treadmill once you get it together  took about   hours to assemble  use it every day      
2655,5.0,                       i just got it into my home  the workers who brought it in were friendly and good service  it looks really good  glad i got it  thank you for the delivery      
2656,5.0,                       very easy to use  i opted for ifit membership and the variety of walks  runs  climbs with pro trainers that link up effortlessly to my tablet and take control of the speed and inclines      
2657,5.0,                       i purchased nordictrack    s   months ago  after my   months use  i feel it was a very good purchase  the package came in perfect shape and it was easy to set up  this treadmill is sturdy and does its job very well  it does help me to keep doing my exercises especially during this uncertain time where we cannot go to a gym  it is working perfectly and and have absolutely no issues till now      
2658,5.0,                       love the treadmill  has great variety  i prefer just hopping on for a    minute run  but my wife loves the online class videos and the fact that the machine adjusts incline and speed based on what is happening in the video  assembly took some time  but other than that its a fantastic machine  folds up easily and can be moved with wheels attached to the base      
2659,5.0,                       the problem you will face is the product comes with several warnings   this will not turn on until you register i fit   but they don t give you the i fit    day free trial card code to activate the service   the machine works without the i fit service  but good luck getting it activated if you do want the service      
2660,5.0,                       i love it   it wasn t that bad putting together   my wife and i had it together in about an hour or so   just make sure you have a good socket set and a good cordless screwdriver      
2661,4.0,                       sturdy good treadmill and simple speed control  incline control  analog stereo amplify  and option  not included  to add ifit feature   large keys for easy control   it is perfect in meeting my needs   when it is in use  it occasionally makes a scratching sound  otherwise it would have earned   stars      
2662,5.0,                       i love my nordictrack and the ifit option that gives me the ability to walk  hike and run with trainers all over the world it was easy to assemble and get up and running with the work at home for the past few months  the nordictrack treadmill has been my outlet to working out  and also  traveling virtually  around the world i cannot say enough good about this machine      
2663,5.0,                       the tread mill is very user friendly i use it most every day i have had no problem with it and assembly with the instructions was very easy      
2664,5.0,                       i use this machine every other day  minimum  i walk    mile each time and have no difficulties so far  i ve had it for around   months  i have gone as far as   degrees and     mph no issues  i like it very much and am looking forward to using the i fit daily starting in may  i hope      
2665,5.0,                       love this treadmill   i work out   days a week   its smooth and love the cushion adjustment on the belt  which was the number one reason i bought this treadmill  pleased with my purchase      
2666,5.0,                       the installation was a bit intimidating but after getting some help we managed putting it all together  i really love the tread mill there are some cool functions with the icon fitness where you can follow a trainer and the treadmill will automatically speed up or slow down  i had to reach out to spare parts about a broken panel and they were very quick to get me the new parts highly suggest this product     
2667,4.0,                       use for at home physical therapy exercises  assembly needs two people  well worth the price  almost professional quality level machine      
2668,5.0,                       i wanted a good treadmill to help with my new home workouts   i didn t want to spend a ton of money and i didn t have a lot of space   this treadmill is perfect for walking  light running  incline  etc   shipping and delivery were perfect      
2669,5.0,                       i would have given it more stars for easy to assemble but as senior citizens it was difficult to be on our knees etc for assembly      
2670,5.0,                       bought it two months ago and it s getting used everyday  so far it has been great  easy to operate and solid frame      
2671,5.0,                       love this treadmill  it s a perfect replacement for not being able to go to the gym  very comparable to the one there but an even smoother walk      
2672,5.0,                       like the ifit feature works for our needs     
2673,5.0,                       this seem to be a great treadmill  it s fairly easy to assemble  my wife loves it      
2674,5.0,                       love it  works great no problems at all      
2675,4.0,                       works great  i am    lbs and it holds up well and is comfortable to run on  i ve only had it up to     for small intervals but still runs like a champ  only fault i ve found is at lower levels     there is a persistent low level squeak but that is unnoticeable when wearing headphones and moving up to level          
2676,5.0,                       this treadmill was perfect for me  i love the  ifit capabilities and mirror to my     tv which is great for my workouts  great size for my workout room  kids love it too      
2677,2.0,                       ordered two   both damaged   returned both    nordic keeps on hold forever   amazon great in both returns   will not order again     
2678,4.0,                       so far so good  did come slightly damaged  part of the plastic on the bottom was broken and the cup holder was cracked whre it screwed in but i didn t bother return it      
2679,2.0,                       i think it could be a good product  but it is stuck on an incline   support person was nice  but did not have the part in stock that might fix it   we have been stuck with uphill for about   months now      
2680,5.0,                       i liked the screen and fitness videos options   awesome bluetooth speaker to listen to my own music or even take phone calls while walking   great impact absorption too      
2681,4.0,                       great investment  simple but efficient model        
2682,4.0,                       i didn t like that i had to subscribe to ifit to activate the treadmill so it would work   but  i just found out you can cancel it if you don t actually use that feature   at my age  that s way more than i need        
2683,5.0,                       we were limited on space in our workout room so went with this smaller treadmill than others  the smaller size doesn t limit the speed or durability of the machine  my wife was worried that she wouldn t be able to run on it but the length is perfect for her and i ve been able to do so as well  we have no regrets so far  it fits the space  holds up well  and gives you a good workout  would buy again      
2684,4.0,                       treadmill seems to be well built   i hope it last    years like our last treadmill   the only dislike is the arms on the side are a little short   adding another foot to the length would be nice      
2685,1.0,                          customer care response time slow  and requires registration even during assembly   nordictrack insists that activation available only via ift   this is not true   nordictrack implies that device foldss to    degrees   it wiil not will likely return product      
2686,5.0,                       great treadmill for the price   lots of built in options or easy to just use manually      
2687,5.0,                       very easy to assemble  great addition to my home gym      
2688,5.0,                       i was looking for a treadmill that was sturdy and could give me the flexibility of running or walking incline   this does exactly that   i wasn t looking for fancy on line video types   the amazon directed installation was great   it was delivered per the schedule and the installation company was professional      
2689,5.0,                       easy to assemble  safe  i have used it every day since i bought it and every time i like it more  the best investment i have made for my health and my body  excellent quality in every detail of the equipment      
2690,5.0,                       i debated on different treadmills for months and finally decided on this one and i m not disappointed at all  there are lots of youtube assembly videos to help you set up the machine and once it folds up  it takes up very little room  the ifit is my absolute favorite   it motivates and challenges me and the workouts are so fun and easy to follow along with      
2691,1.0,                       it arrived damaged and since then sitting in my gym room  tried scheduling pick up but no help yet      
2692,5.0,                       easy to fold  a bit more challenging to unfold  other than that love this treadmill       
2693,5.0,                       it took me some time between       hours to assemble with some help from my husband   it wasn t difficult to assemble  just took some time   i didn t want to move too fast and risk missing a wire  screw  etc it works great   i ve jogged  ran  and full on sprinted on it with no issues at all once assembled  it is too wide to fit through a doorway in my house though   so keep that in mind when assembling it      
2694,5.0,                       overall works well  haven t had any issues  ran lots of miles on it      
2695,4.0,                       i don t know much about treadmills  first time buyer but i enjoy it for my walks and runs  it does bounce quite a bit and when it folds it isn t very skinny but works well      
2696,5.0,                       this machine was the best investments   norditrac really did an awesome job on this treadmill  having this home equipment at the height of the covid    pandemic was a game changer  we work out at our convenience and in the safety of our home  i recommend everyone to make this purchase if you can ayou will not regret it  thank you norditrac and amazon  stay safe and godbless     
2697,5.0,                       smaller size perfect with our other equipment  plenty of features  very quiet      
2698,2.0,                       i liked the price  the plug for ipod  cell phone doesn t work  folding it doesn t save more space and it s difficult to move around when vacuuming  the speakers don t sound good      
2699,5.0,                       treadmill  everything works fine with this we have had no problems we use it every day     
2700,5.0,                       it s been such an amazing way to  get away  and  see the world  while stuck in the pandemic  wayyyy better than we had anticipated it being  the ifit app is also pretty wonderful as well with all of the offerings that they give      
2701,2.0,                       writing this review exactly one year after purchasing  went to run on it today and it s completely dead  so do yourself a favor and spend a little more for a nicer quality treadmill that lasts longer than a year      
2702,5.0,                       i find this treadmill easy to use  and i now look forward to exercise   it s a great de stressor  time flies while on the machine   i come home from work  and immediately get on the treadmill   i ve travelled all over the world on the treadmill  right in my own basement      
2703,5.0,                       love this treadmill and ifit i do jog walk intervals at low inclines  the speed and incline it offers is more than i ll ever use the ifit capabity subscription  and built in screen  is life changing   i ll never be able to go on a treadmill again without it  so amazing additionally  the flexselect cushioning eliminates the pain i would get in my legs jogging on hard surface streets outdoors      
2704,4.0,                       the system requires you to go the ifit to activate  bad move because it requires a credit card      once the free period is up the charges start unless you cancel  to get around ifit   turn you machine on and hold the ifit button until the screen changes  then you are home free  frustrating that nordictrack does not include this information in the manual      
2705,5.0,                       works as intended and is stable     
2706,5.0,                       i purchased this treadmill before i knew i would be at home every day for   months  thank goodness i did  it has become an important part of my daily routine  i use it to walk and jog    minutes to   hour a day  i have not had a single complaint or concern  i also recommend the ifit   it helped me at least  pretend  i was travelling  it works well with my tablet through the bluetooth connection      
2707,4.0,                       excellent product for the price   the delivery service was weeks late   workers were lazy and unprofessional   for  room of service delivery  they complained   left all the trash      
2708,1.0,                       the treadmill never worked due the safety key is not working and i paid for the assembly service and i don t know who to call  sent message to my service after registering item and nothing yet      
2709,5.0,                       for various reasons we had not been regularly using our gym membership and decided that a nordictrack treadmill would better suit our schedule   fortunately the treadmill arrived just weeks before social distancing mandated the closing of our gym   between two people in our household we ve used it between one and two hours every day to help maintain our fitness   very happy with purchase and value for the money      
2710,5.0,                       the treadmill has a large belt  give you a good support for a comfortable run  soft on your knew set up is not difficult as many said  not that many pieces to put together i love the treadmill      
2711,5.0,                       omg this was my first ever purchase i love it so much  i can t  wait till my next purchase  with ia a rower     
2712,5.0,                       this treadmill is very light  was easy to assemble and works great  i did not want to spend a lot on a treadmill    didn t need all the bells and whistles of fancy oversize screens  bluetooth  etc  i just wanted something that i could run on so this works great at a very reasonable price      
2713,5.0,                       i have researched many treadmills before settling on the nordictrack t series  the main selling point for me was the large display and relatively compact size  i opted for the unit to be assembled by amazon this way the process was painless  i truly enjoy this unit and love ifit  the large display makes you feel like you are part of the action      
2714,4.0,                       it s perfect for what i was looking for  very sturdy and runs smoothly   thanks to previous reviews  bypass ifit by holding down the button for    seconds and you can get right into working out   i ve used it every day since it arrived and no complaints so far     
2715,5.0,                       i ve had this about   months now and i love it  best investment i ve made in a long time      
2716,5.0,                       great product for the money  has good incline capabilities and beautiful screen quality  it has a nice range of speeds as well      
2717,5.0,                       love this product  it works great and was pretty simple instructions to put together  heavy so two people are a must  i am over    lbs and it is very sturdy      
2718,5.0,                       we were looking for an easy to use treadmill that gave us simplistic features such ability to select target mph on keypad vs  an up and down button  calorie count  easy to setup  etc   this treadmill provides all of that   the shipping process took forever but was of no fault to the product team   use it everyday      
2719,2.0,                       can t do anything without activating the ifit  yes there s a trial   month of ifit  but what happens after  i won t be able to use it unless i pay for a program   that s just stupid      
2720,5.0,                       it s heavy but not too hard to fold  not too hard to put together and it s a great treadmill for the price      
2721,1.0,                       purchased my treadmill in may of      and it s already broken  control panel doesn t work properly  can not adjust the speed  treadmill also squeaks very loud when walking   i ve had other brands that lasted years  would not recommend this product      
2722,4.0,                       had assembled but was not tightened well so had that redone by another professional through nordictrack  but overall enjoy workouts with trainers on screen through i fit     
2723,5.0,                       well put together  took about       hours to assemble  directions bery good      
2724,5.0,                       the only thing i didn t like is that the set up program force you to go online and subscribe in their online services     so you need to figure it out how to not go through that path to startup for the first time      
2725,5.0,                       the treadmill is great   both my wife and i are using almost every day and we both love it   the convenience  and safety in the covid epidemic  is just perfect for us   great exercise is just a flight of steps away   wish i had done this year s ago   the nordictrak is a wonderful addition to our life      
2726,5.0,                       this was the best investment i ve made it s a great treadmill floss up perfectly nice clear screen and the speakers ar great so you can listen to music while following the trainer or just jam to the music they have the shock support really helps with my knees and my fiance loves it      no regrets great buy         
2727,1.0,                       while the treadmill looks fancy and sturdy  the speed and mileage on the screen do not match the rate at which the belt is moving and amazon and nordic track were of no help on this issue  do not purchase this if you are a runner and like to track your pace and or mileage      
2728,4.0,                       i liked all facets of this nordic track    my other machine lasted almost    yrs   the only agravatingthing was in getting the machine to be made operational by registering online    ended up after multiple efforts in calling customer service and having them activate the machine   assembly very easy  easier with   people      
2729,5.0,                       i am really enjoying this treadmill and the ifit platform  so much variety on the sessions you can use on ifit      
2730,4.0,                       i weigh     pounds and at   mph and higher  the belt sticks to the treadmill making it unsafe to run on   ive tried lengthening my stride and minimizing impact as much as possible and it still sticks and stops the motor when my feet land   do not buy updatei was able to tighten the main belt and now it runs really well   also  nordictrac reached out and sent lubrication to avoid sticking in the future   feeling much better about the purchase now      
2731,1.0,                       don t buy  i had to order a replacement and it had problems too      
2732,5.0,                       this treadmill is top quality  use it for winter time walking to get some aerobic exercise  was a little  difficult to put together but eventually i got it done      
2733,2.0,                       extremely difficult to put together   like assembling an ikea dresser       parts including screws   several screws did not fit and we had to replace them at our local hardware store   took us a full night to unpack all the parts  then three nights to assemble   i expect more from nordic track   i expect more from an      purchase      
2734,5.0,                       treadmill in itself nice but shipping time not good  took a month to get it to me      
2735,5.0,                       works as advertised  very impressed and no issues so far after a few months   in regards to exterior build and run quality  feels very similar to the commercial treadmills that i ve used in various gyms      
2736,5.0,                       assembling the product was a bit challenging but the youtube videos really helped  it would have been helpful if nordic track could provide all the instruments   screw driver  spanner etc  for setting up the machine   the treadmill has all the basic features required  no complaints  a must have for all who are looking for a good tread mill at home      
2737,5.0,                       bought this for family member with a joint disease  they like it     
2738,5.0,                       so far so good  we have had this treadmill for about two months and it works fine     
2739,5.0,                       this treadmill does everything that it advertises   it is terrific for me because i have lupus and cannot go out in the sun  so this is a way to be able to exercise inside   i have paid for gym memberships many times  but it was getting to the gym that hindered me   now that we have this in our home  i can keep a regulated routine   my husband also loves this  he walks about   miles every other day   we live in swfl  so the heat can become unbearable   he is able to walk around his schedule   most importantly is the quality of this treadmill   this treadmill is nicer than most at the gyms that i have been to  and for the membership fees  you can easily have your own in your home   i highly recommend this   i would have the expert assembly done  after reading the reviews we decided to have this assembled professionally  and it was completed in a very timely manner   thank you  amazon  nordictrack  and icon health and fitness      
2740,4.0,                       stupid thing tried selling me a subscription   hold down the blue ifit logo for    seconds and you ll bypass it   it s a one time deal      
2741,4.0,                       overall product is decent  however  package came absolutely destroyed i m surprised item came intact  fairly large crack in plast and some minor damage to the powder coat on the risers  nsd was horrible to work with regarding item delivery  third party logistic company ship right solutions were decent to work with  not sure who was the primary cause of the damage      
2742,4.0,                       just the size  bought for my personal use and it is serving the purpose very well  no major complaint so far  i just signed a   year maint  contract and will request soon for a tech to come and explain me all the features  instruction manual could have been explaining all features in more details      
2743,5.0,                       the treadmill is great and an amazing value  the installation was a little grueling but straight forward  i was missing the bolt to hold the treadmill in the upright position but luckily had a replacement part handy  for the price  it is worth every penny  smooth and quiet      
2744,3.0,                       there are two significant strips cross the walking belt      
2745,1.0,                       box was left out in the rain   soaking wet      
2746,4.0,                       the treadmill is excellent for home use  except for the weight of the equipment  rest is really nice  one suggestion to everyone purchasing is  if someone lives below your house  make sure of using a rubber mat or something below the treadmill to reduce the vibration noise from the treadmill     
2747,5.0,                       i like having the built in   in video screen and the   year ifit training  assembly is a little annoying  one basic connection required four screws of three different sizes   you tube videos were essential to support assembly  compared to competitors  the    i is a little smaller and a little slower but that was perfect for me      
2748,5.0,                       great for home use   i got the tread mill for myself for christmas   i have enjoyed it   it lift up and down great  the incline and speed changes are smooth      
2749,5.0,                       we have had this nordic track     s treadmill for   weeks now   we love it   we use it daily and between my husband and i we put on about   miles a day and it s only been   weeks but it s holding up nice  no weird noises or shaking coming from the treadmill  the monitor is very bright and the programs installed are just fine   nothing fancy   the speed goes up to    mph   we use it for walking and light jogging so this is perfect for us   gym quality for an amazing price   we re so glad we purchased this      
2750,1.0,                       unit is ok  customer service is horrible  notified of missing part since installation  no response or part  i made up part and got machine working      
2751,3.0,                       amazing for running  has a spot for your drink  has a spot for your phone too  solid when running at higher speeds is extremely off on calories burned and the heart rate handles are usually very off as well  got a fitbit versa to fix that      
2752,4.0,                       i like how easy it is use and how it keeps track of things like your calories burned  distance  and you can even check your heart rate  i ve been using this treadmill constantly especially since it gets dark after work  its just a great alternative when i can t go out for a run      
2753,5.0,                       great treadmill for home use  long enough for a good stride and love the incline functionality  one downside is that it only goes up to   mph      
2754,1.0,                       very hard to install and activate  must have i pad or something else to active  no instruction and no customer service no answer phone  very frustrate  not recommend      
2755,5.0,                       easy to set up by myself less than three hours  works great  ifit app is awesome  it s like it comes with trainers all over the world      
2756,5.0,                       good treadmill  i by passed the ifit cause i knew i wouldn t use it      
2757,3.0,                       have to give a credit card   to activate machine to turn on  yes you can cancel in a month if ifit program is nothing you wanted just to get tredmill to work  need a large room for it to fit      
2758,1.0,                       i read the warnings about customer service  i really liked this treadmill and decided to order it   after set up i needed assistance   the customer service provided is just awful   i will be returning the treadmill      
2759,5.0,                       great video programs that help me get back to running  highly recommended      
2760,5.0,                       after reading many reviews on different treadmills i decided to purchase this one  it s been about a week so far no regrets  i weigh     lbs this thing holds me it doesn t shake it s solid  great purchase      
2761,4.0,                       i really do like my treadmill   i used the    day trail of ifit which i really liked but i am not paying     a month for  treadmill works great  i wish it had more setting though   speakers work great just not really loud      
2762,5.0,                       easy to put together  great delivery  absolutely no complaints here  wonderful purchase        
2763,5.0,                       this treadmill is awesome  it s a good investment for busy people who would rather workout at home and not go to the gym  it s the same quality as what they have at the gyms  it is also easy to use and can easily be folded and stored when not in use      
2764,5.0,                       the only thing i d like better is if the hand rails were a little longer      
2765,5.0,                       we ve had this since march  and has been a very good purchase   the assembly wasn t hard  and working around the ifit program wasn t that tough to do   it is made to seem more required than it is   the only thing i would knock is that when mine folds up  it brushes up against one of the arms on the console   over time  that might create a little wear  but it s a minor problem      
2766,5.0,                       impeccable build quality   very quiet  feels stable at all speeds and inclines      
2767,5.0,                       nice value for the        
2768,4.0,                       i use this for walking everyday and try to increase my time each week  it is a great product  pretty easy to assemble and easy to operate  wish it were a little quieter  just a little  overall a good machine at a good price      
2769,5.0,                       love it  best at home treadmill  you don t have to sign up for the ifit program even though it says too  turn your treadmill on and hold the button till the treadmill beeps   no subscription required  i ve had   knee surgeries  so running on concrete or gym treadmills really bothers me  but this has great shock absorbing   so if you have knee pain i would       recommend it      
2770,4.0,                       it was just hard to put together  other than that i love it so much      
2771,5.0,                       the treadmill was not difficult to put together  it does require   people to move into place as well as install some components  the ifit program is very enjoyable  i like streaming it to my ipad pro  i was able to buy a year of ifit after the initial purchase for a discount  highly recommend     
2772,1.0,                       awful  activation and registration are insane features  just wanted a treadmill  not a subscription and   hours on the phone just use the thing  effing scam     
2773,1.0,                       really   you have to give your credit card info to activate the treadmill   what a horrible practice   the workaround other users posted did not work for me   parts were also missing      
2774,5.0,                       excellent treadmill  easy to assemble and very sturdy  i love the ifit app   lots of trails and workout presets       
2775,1.0,                       the item received was not the same model as the advertised one  the heart rate is also not working     
2776,5.0,                       this treadmill is a great product and exceeded my expectations  it s easy to use and has many functions to help you meet your fitness goals  delivery was fast and assembly took my about     to   hours  i did put it together by myself and the parts are quite heavy so i would recommend a partner to help assemble to machine  overall i am very pleased with my purchase and is worth the price      
2777,5.0,                       this is the first time i have ever purchased a treadmill online and was skeptical about choosing the right one i m glad i choose this model as it was fairly easy to follow the assembly instructions and get it running i recommend buying the ifit membership as well  i m a happy camper with this investment and look forward toreaching my fitness goals      
2778,4.0,                       great value  quick ship  assembly instructions were ok  not great      
2779,5.0,                       this treadmill works great for running and walking   i have logged well over     miles with no issues   this is the most sturdy treadmill i have owned that is a fold up   i would have no problem recommending this to walkers and joggers      
2780,5.0,                       works really well  easy to unbox and assemble  no need to pay for someone else to do it      
2781,5.0,                       while this took some patience to out together it was totally doable  i m used to running on commercial grade treadmills at the gym and use them to their full capacity  so far it s been great to me  it easily transition between speeds and inclines  not shaky at all  so happy with my purchase      
2782,5.0,                       i love everything about this treadmill  it s right up there with the treadmills at gyms   very solid and sturdy  smooth running  and easy as pie to fold up when needed  it s a joy to exercise on this treadmill and such a great way to lose those inches and pounds      
2783,2.0,                       incline broke after two months and now it s stuck at half height      
2784,5.0,                       great product  great price  awesome treadmill  definitely recommend        
2785,1.0,                       horrible quality and customer services   didn t last a year and now amazon said i had to deal with the manufacturer            for nothing   no answer   no one can help      
2786,4.0,                       this has been just great for the family  easy to use and works perfectly  just wish the videos were subtitles or captioned  as most of the family are deaf      
2787,5.0,                       love this treadmill  i am a woman over    and was able to uncrate and assemble all but console  which takes two people  everything was there for easy assembly and it was up and operational in a couple hours  i was so pleased with how quiet it is and how smooth the incline function performs      
2788,5.0,                       works well for running  the only downside is the app you have to download to get the treadmill to work  not happy with the app  but overall satisfied with the treadmill      
2789,4.0,                       well it s very good for a home excercise  expected it to be quieter though but it s not a big deal     
2790,5.0,                       love it    high end model as its the mid tier version and was a great price and love it  been doing it everyday with the ifit      
2791,5.0,                       very good treadmill   works great  my only issue was getting the   year free subscription of ifit to work for the secondary user  it took a couple of hours working with ifit online  but it all works great now      
2792,1.0,                       after   years it has quit working and will not turn on   huge regret in purchasing     
2793,1.0,                       wrong parts in the box  not match the front screen on the frame  the screen is too small and could not compete the assembly  i have wait min  days to contact and explain the problems of my treadmill      
2794,1.0,                       ordered the treadmill that included assembly  sheduled the assembly only for no one to show up for the scheduled time  scheduled a second time only to receive an email canceling appointment with no reason the day before appointment  called day of appointment was transferred to another department only to be told i would have to find a provider in my area myself to assemble the treadmill   if you cannot provide for assembly do not include it  very unhappy  will be limiting my amazon purchases  if purchasing at all from amazon      
2795,5.0,                       this works great especially because i m not twig size and running on this treadmill gives me confidence that i won t step through the bottom lol     
2796,5.0,                       love this treadmill   easy to assemble if you follow the instructions exactly  works great  i m currently running intervals and changing speed and incline is simple  easy to bypass ifit  just turn on treadmill and hold down ifit botton for    seconds       
2797,1.0,                       i bought it for      in august       the machine was defective from day      months later  the incline is still not working  i was told by amazon not to say anything about nordictrack customer service  but be warned  this model is not the sturdiest  and   months later  it s not yet fixed      
2798,5.0,                       came in damaged and called customer service  they couldn t have been nicer  shipped me damaged parts the next day and was good to go  highly recommend      
2799,5.0,                       purchased this treadmill three months back and have been using it  assembly instructions are very good and it took about   hours   i have researched so many models and ended up purchasing this  overall the quality of this treadmill is best  the product comes with extended warranty when you register it in online  i am very happy with this treadmill and will recommend it       
2800,1.0,                       got this treadmill about   months ago  i used it often in august  hardly used it last month  and just began using it again and it is already broken the max speed i ve used was not even fast  speed        
2801,1.0,                       product arrives locked unable to use product without purchasing additional services   a rip off   i gave my mom wife a     pound door stop   happy holiday      
2802,3.0,                       love most things about it  except the hr monitor is so inaccurate  constantly reads at about about       bpm when actual is      also the so called ifit membership is really just a teaser membership with a few programs  seems disingenuous to claim that it s a free membership when it is nothing more than a sample      
2803,5.0,                       great treadmill for a very reasonable price  my husband is very handy so it wasn t long to assemble      
2804,1.0,                       my husband had to reweld part of the right arm at the bottom to be able to use it  it would not lie flat due to a poor weld    did not want to call customer support because it would have been a hassle   works perfect now  perhaps the defect is why we were able to get such a great deal on it        tax       
2805,3.0,                       you can not reach the control panel without kicking or jamming your toe into motor housing  other than this drawback it runs smooth      
2806,5.0,                       i have had this item for a little over a month now  i run about   miles   days a week and haven t had any issues  very please with this so far      
2807,5.0,                       this unit has all of the features we need and is from a well known company with a great reputation  my wife says that it is perfect for her      
2808,4.0,                       solid treadmill  it does seem like the tread keeps shifting to the right  but my husband has been able to adjust  the incline is everything      
2809,1.0,                       the product was delivered broken      
2810,5.0,                       happy with purchase  sturdy and quality      
2811,5.0,                       i am very happy with this  i m an orange theory member for   years  this is a covid purchase  i am so happy with it   i did get the ifit app and i have done a lot of different class  i really like it and very happy with it      
2812,5.0,                       great piece of exercise equipment   sturdy construction and easy to set up and use     
2813,5.0,                       i was a little worried about the assembly given the weight and size of it before buying  but it turned out to be nothing  with help of my    year old son  i was able to assemble it in two hours without any issue   i have been using this treadmill for over a month now and no complain at all  it s not fancy  but functions very well  overall a great buy      
2814,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill because my otf studio closed  again  and i needed something kind of similar  i haven t had it long  but i m loving it  the ifit is the key  it s amazing and the way they control the tread with spead and incline is really awesome  highly recommend      
2815,5.0,                       was a seamless assembly  has a really sturdy commercial grade feel to it  lots of money saved and very convenient now that we have this unit  nordictrack is definitely my preference from here on end  thanks      
2816,3.0,                       easy to fold and assemble but the band moves sideways as you are using it and you babe to pay monthly to use the machine     
2817,1.0,                       this was the second nordictrack t series treadmill i bought  the same model  this time i bought it from amazon  not from sears  the treadmill lasted only a year and a half  the nordictrack did not even honor the   year parts warranty it advertised on this site at the time i bought it  will not buy a nordictrack treadmill again      
2818,5.0,                       i am very pleased with this nordic track t series  it is sturdy and i really like the workouts that are downloaded  i will buy one again      
2819,1.0,                       horrible directions  impossible to assemble with screws that don t fit and cheap components  can t even finish assembly after three hours because parts are missing  then you are duped into signing up for a membership you didn t ask for  then when i plug it in my breaker trips so i can t even use the damn thing  horrible experience      
2820,4.0,                       i think i like it  i ve had it a month  i jog at     mph for    minutes or so each workout  it developed a really annoying squeaking noise but i think i figured out a fix  otherwise it runs well  speakers work well  time will tell  i hope i made the right choice      
2821,5.0,                       if you don t connect to ifit you can t enter your weight for exact calories burned  a bit of a bummer  overall however a great home treadmill      
2822,5.0,                       nice treadmill for the money  it is great for running  or walking at an incline  great value for the price  only issue i had is the snap screws that hold the cover over the motor was broken when i received it  its not a major deal  as it is secure without the snap screws      
2823,4.0,                       this is my first treadmill  the size is good for me  the overall performance is also good      
2824,5.0,                       the product itself is a great for workout  only thing i don t like is monthly subscription  but i am not sure if any treadmill without subscription      
2825,5.0,                       i ve been using treadmills both at the gym and at home for quite some time now and this is one of the best purchases i ve made  you can t beat this price for what you get out of it      
2826,4.0,                       great machine and the absolute worst directions  definitely need your own tools  the one tool that comes with it doesn t suffice  it s ridiculously lacking to put it all together but once done  great      
2827,5.0,                       great design and easy to use  high quality product for family      
2828,5.0,                       it s a great treadmill for a smaller space  folds up really easily  bit of pain to assemble by yourself but definitely easy with   people  great for when i want a quick run  the track visual on the screen keeps my focused      
2829,5.0,                       cool i love this bought for mom but i m definitely going to use it too   i want one too     
2830,1.0,                       it s extremely annoying that this treadmill forces you to enter a credit card to subscribe to the ifit membership to activate the machine  otherwise the machine is locked and cannot be used  and it s extremely unintuitive to cancel the membership  this is totally fraud and scam  if you buy this machine  remember to cancel the membership immediately after activation  otherwise they charge your credit card every month with  your authorization       
2831,5.0,                       set up of this treadmill was fairly easy  really easy to use  very straight forward  only issue i had was it did not come with a code for the year free ifit membership  i called ifit and they sent me a code immediately  no questions asked  been using it daily for   months now and it has been great      
2832,5.0,                       the incline sucks  there is not much  other then that  its ok of a mechine      
2833,5.0,                       only problem with assembly was the grounding strap and customer service helped me with that      
2834,5.0,                       does what it says it will do  happy with purchase over first month  great for low frills  low impact daily walking      
2835,4.0,                       great treadmill so far  very quiet and works nicely for what i needed wanted  would recommend this one      
2836,5.0,                       very pleased with this product  assembly was somewhat easy  it runs well and folds easily     
2837,4.0,                       i m very happy with the product and it s quality  we paid for the expert assembly which only took them about    minutes so we probably could have figured it out on our own but it was convenient  the only reason i did not give   stars is because the delivery men who dropped it off were extremely rude and unprofessional  other than that initial interaction  we are completely satisfied with the product      
2838,5.0,                       this was the best purchase i have made  my gym closed down and i am an avid runner  so trying to pick the right machine was tough  despite some bad reviews  the treadmill is quiet and so easy to fold up  we paid for the assembly  best decision  the assembly man was so helpful and only took an hour to put it together  he knew how to override the nordic track activation  so it work right away  i highly recommend this treadmill      
2839,4.0,                       a little disappointed in the beginning when received a damage product but the new delivery was ok and the product works great  just take care of yours carriers and the quality and customer satisfaction will get better      
2840,5.0,                       very sturdy and high performance treadmill  i would definitely recommend it      
2841,1.0,                       nowhere on this description does it tell you that you have to assemble the entire machine yourself    i have a   year old  i m a working mom  i m overweight and exhausted and you expect me to assemble this machine by myself          i wish i had never bought this    buyer beware      
2842,5.0,                       it s working just fine so far  i did not do the assembly but i watched the pro do it  definitely need to know what you re doing     
2843,5.0,                       the treadmill has worked out great  the workouts online are challenging and the screen on the treadmill makes it really enjoyable to follow  the trainers are engaged and really keep you motivated  if your looking for a solid workout at home this is the way to go      
2844,5.0,                       i wanted a treadmill at home so that i would exercise more consistently  it arrived quickly after purchase  and the assembly that i purchased through amazon went smoothly  this treadmill is exactly as advertised in the listing  it has all the features that i need and is the right size for my space  it seems durable and has worked well so far  i look forward to using it for years to come      
2845,3.0,                       enjoying the treadmill but the belt keeps sliding over  it doesn t keep me from using it   but it is a little noisy      
2846,4.0,                       this is a high quality and robust platform for serious exercise  is a great trendmill  super smooth   i really love it      
2847,4.0,                       perfect for home workout  but the heart rate monitor does not work  which is a bit frustrating its easy to fold but not very easy to move      
2848,1.0,                       can t say enough bad things about the assembly process   i am fairly mechanically inclined  but whether it is bolts not threading properly  impossible angles to tighten bolts  or needing to push the uprights together to get the cross bar to fit   this is not an easy to assemble product   would not recommend   our box did have a fair amount of damage upon delivery  but everything inside looked fine  maybe something bent that we didn t notice  i m not sure   either way has been a terrible experience to assemble      
2849,5.0,                       very stable  doesnt wobble or shake  and handles a     pound man running on it very well  mine came intact   with no tears in the box  and nothing broken inside like some other customers had      
2850,5.0,                       fantastic   i ve owned for about three months and it s still working great   setup took a few hours  but went well following the directions   not super loud when being used  quiet enough to use in our basement without hearing it upstairs   tons of pre programmed routes which keep the workout interesting      
2851,5.0,                       speed is great  incline is great  have been using it everyday since i got it and i love it     
2852,5.0,                       perfect  great value for money   paid extra for specific room delivery   guys were nice and respectful of house   product great value for money   performs as well or better than significantly more expensive similar items      
2853,3.0,                       our nordictrack came early which was great   while taking it out of the box our brand new treadmill didn t look vary brand new   digs and scraps  disappointed  not sure if it happened before placed in the box or durning shipping      
2854,5.0,                       three men fought to get it up the stairs  one turn    i strongly suggest you open the box and carry up the individual contents   i got damage to my stair walls from the box      
2855,4.0,                       treadmill works great and fulfills its intended purpose  only complaint i have is that there was one piece missing from the box upon delivery  i paid to have someone assemble the treadmill  and assembly couldn t be completed because there was a piece missing      
2856,4.0,                       this is a fantastic  affordable treadmill  i absolutely love it and it s well worth the price  my only complaint about it is the screen is very small  would be absolutely perfect if it had at least a     screen or bigger      
2857,5.0,                       love it      
2858,4.0,                       says the treadmill is weighted for    lbs or less  i am     right now and it the platform and motor seem to struggled making the rotation just when i walk  i tried running on   speed and continuously had to rebalance myself because the belt and motor would do the same thing  does anyone have this issue  how did you fix it  or is it unfixable     
2859,5.0,                       i like it but not enough to use it  what a waste of money      
2860,4.0,                       great treadmill    i really like the different inclines  my brother put it together and was impressed with how well the instructions were written  he put it together in about   hours by himself  great price as well  i would definitely buy again if needed but it is a sturdy machine      
2861,5.0,                       so happy we bought this for our home and the family  easy to ensemble  makes you want to walk every day  so many extra features  too  fan  speakers  large screen   i know we will continue to get lots of use with this fantastic treadmill  it s heavy duty  and made to last      
2862,5.0,                       see above stars     
2863,5.0,                       omg i was so surprised by this treadmill  it is the same quality as those at my health club  i absolutely will recommend it to others      
2864,5.0,                       gr  product   a bit difficult to assemble  but  worth it   not noisy at all   as sturdy as a commercial grade product     
2865,5.0,                       nice unit  for all ages  incline is a nice function     
2866,5.0,                       i love my new nordictrak   it has everything i wanted in a treadmill   i highly recommend it       
2867,3.0,                       the monitor is to small  the motion of the view is way too slow  i expect running to be the same as running outside with the surrounding  the motion moves every   seconds  even at level         
2868,5.0,                       simple but perfect treadmill for basement gym  the only complaint is i wish it truly folded it half and not make a tight v shape  but still worth   stars      
2869,5.0,                       best purchase i ve made all year      not one glitch with the machine so far  even though the ifit is a great feature i don t use it at all  so i hope i have no issues to cxl it        
2870,2.0,                       i disliked the fact that the first time i got this the box and treadmill were beat to hell  just put the replacement together and the frame is bent so it is cracked and warbles all over  i m sure it would be a good treadmill if i ever got one that wasn t damaged  will be returning this for a second time and won t be purchasing another anything like this again      
2871,5.0,                       very pleased with this purchase  it arrived well protected in the shipping box  now that it s assembled we have put it to use and will continue to do so      
2872,5.0,                       this is an awesome treadmill  quiet  easy to use the control panel  fan is a nice bonus  the bluetooth feature is great  it s very durable and it gets used daily we paid for the assembly and the technician was awesome      
2873,3.0,                       if you buy it   pay to have it assembled  also   you just can t turn it on and use it  it is locked  you have to go online and register  a lot of work   the product itself is sturdy and great quality  set up is a pain      
2874,3.0,                       the motor cover came cracked on the left side  the installer this morning said the part can be exchanged and he showed me how to change the cover  i would appreciate a new motor cover before i rate the product  thank you  wayne lachance     
2875,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it does its job but it shakes even if im my speed is at   incline       
2876,4.0,                       this is a good treadmill for the price  nice to have the incline and speed range it does  the handles are a little short to reach and rely on for any sustained stability  but overall this is a good machine      
2877,5.0,                       before purchasing i was worried that for such a good price  the quality would be worse than the expensive treadmills you see at the gym  but i was wrong  it has worked very well for us and allows us to do everything that we need it to do  have only had it for a few months but so far  so good  makes it easy to exercise during the winter when it s cold outside  plus all the ice and snow  so we re happy with it      
2878,5.0,                       had this for     months and this tread mill is very easy to use and having nice features to connect with ifit apps  i recommend this product      
2879,1.0,                       no stars deserved here  the machine comes  locked down  and you re unable to use it until you activate an ifit com membership w  a credit card on file   free    day cancellation   trying to get a workout in  but i can t find my wallet        
2880,5.0,                       great treadmill machine  very happy with it        
2881,5.0,                       i have had this now for three months  the only negative thing i have noticed is that the belt tends to slide to the right side of the running platform  i tried adjusting the balance pegs on the bottom of the treadmill to no effect  it might possibly be due to the way i am running  but i am not sure pros are that the treadmill has had no issues  is responsive  and works well all around  would highly recommend      
2882,5.0,                       it sits next to my desk and is easy to get up and use for short walks several times a day or one long walk when it is cold or raining outside   as an older user  i love the ease of setting the speed exactly how i need it to be  my only warning is not to play with the various presets until you are sure what they do      
2883,5.0,                       lots of parts  it took a while to get it together  by the way  it shows that we should have   wheels in the front  they were not included in the package  we definitely need to them  so we can be able to move the machine  it s really hard without these wheels  please send them  other than that it s a great machine  it s larger than i envisioned  but i am enjoying it  all we need are the   front wheels  thanks     
2884,3.0,                       neighbor thought i was getting some when i was just running  it needs a tune up every   months     
2885,5.0,                       this treadmill is awesome  we ve been using it and it s very sturdy  totally worth the spend        
2886,5.0,                       very sturdy  gym quality and easy to use   surprisingly easy to lift to fold      
2887,4.0,                       treadmill is great  luckily  i ve read reviews before registering to ifit  thank you amazon i pressed the ifit icon by the screen just for      and turned on the treadmill avoiding registration  not happy with nordictrack s strategy to enforce the user to register to ifit      
2888,5.0,                       overall great treadmill   the membership is a bit pricey   transition of speed and or elevation is smooth  most importantly  the service department is quick to respond and are helpful      
2889,5.0,                       the box came damaged   the instructions weren t we very vague   only tried the ifit once but overall it is a good product     
2890,5.0,                       i live in georgia  what is not to like   i now exercise every day  in a cool house   the assembly was difficult  but i am a retired grandmother  who assembled the treadmill all by myself      
2891,5.0,                       it will take two people to assemble but wasn t too difficult   folds up nicely to save space   my wife likes the ifit subscription and it was easy to log in and set to not auto renew if i decide to not keep the subscription   was on backorder but shipped fast as soon as it was available   overall pretty decent machine      
2892,5.0,                       i had someone put it together and i was glad i did   he does them often and finished quickly   it works really well and i feel it was a good choice      
2893,5.0,                       love this treadmill  my   year old son and i put it together  holds up to the running i do  seems very durable      
2894,5.0,                       using this product to run about     miles per day  good product  so  able to activate ifit features without providing credit card  it was optional       
2895,1.0,                       this new product doesnt work  app keeps crashing and this treadmill doesnt work without app    loss of time and money never ever going to buy anything norditrack      
2896,5.0,                       i love this treadmill   it s very sturdy and easy to use   i m not one for all the bells and whistles and it s just what i wanted   the price was excellent and my husband even put it together ourselves   i highly recommend      
2897,5.0,                       this treadmill is great  my wife and i wanted a solid machine that had loads of options  and would be sturdy with my big ass running on it also  it s as close to an in gym unit i ve ever used  very satisfied      
2898,5.0,                       aside from the horribly damaged packaging  the treadmill itself is awesome  not too difficult to assemble  easy to fold  it is however very heavy so you might want to assemble it where you plan to keep it  this is money well spent      
2899,5.0,                       this is an excellent treadmill one of the best i have had definitely worth it for the price     
2900,5.0,                       the whole family loves it  daddy looked on youtube on how to assemble it and found it took only    minutes  so  everyone is happy      
2901,5.0,                       sturdy and great for running with a smooth automatic incline so my run is good  the ifit bluetooth button makes for an extremely nice connection with my smartphone or tablet      
2902,4.0,                       difficult to assemble   but a quality machine      
2903,5.0,                       great treadmill  but would never order from this seller again    ever      
2904,1.0,                       terrible purchase  treadmill worked for about   months then incline failed  customer service tried sending a bunch of wires to fix incline issue  i simply wanted the treadmill replaced  too difficult and time consuming to re wire a treadmill not something i should have to worry about with such a new item  would not recommend this treadmill      
2905,5.0,                       high quality treadmill   great buy for the price   can handle a lot of weight and pounding   gym quality      
2906,4.0,                       nice treadmill for the money  tread moves to   side so we work it over as we use it to prevent wear and tear  adjusted it with wrench but still favors one side  built in work out app is very odd  you don t press the button to use it  you press the adjacent button according to directions  good built in speakers  overall happy with purchase     
2907,4.0,                       its a good purchase  i use it  x a wk   an hour each use  it has a good control for speed and incline  though i hear noises in some areas i step on when its about    minutes running    i have applied lubricants to no avail   assembly was quick and easy     
2908,5.0,                       delivery was fast with prime as usual  easy to set up you will want a small adjustable wrench or a socket to tighten some of the bolts  had it up in about an hour  the interactive workouts are amazing  so far so good and excited we went with this product     
2909,5.0,                       reviews of all treadmills caused concerns regarding consistency and quality  this one worked great right out of the box  no hassle ifit activation without requiring a cc      
2910,5.0,                       so happy with this treadmill  can t believe its price  fantastic features for every day routines  it folds so easy  and unfolds even easier   have it in second floor and the difference with our old treadmill is huge  less noise downstairs      
2911,4.0,                       only thing i didn t like  was the speed  as a beginner  speed   is very slow but speed   is just a tad too fast  as i use it that won t be an issue      
2912,4.0,                       after our assembly appointment was cancelled i ended up assembling  instructions were easy to follow and it only took me about two hours  needed help for the last step  so far works well  only negatives are that the belt seems to shift with each use and i m always having to correct and it seems to lag a bit on lower speeds and isn t very smooth until i get to    mph      
2913,5.0,                       the nordictrack reputation is why i selected this treadmill  i am happy that i chose this piece of exercise equipment  i use it all the time  my husband and daughter also use it      
2914,5.0,                       love this treadmill   i opted for the ifit subscription which allows the treadmill to incline decline with the app workout it is quiet enough that i can hear the tv or the app coach      
2915,5.0,                       straightforward to assemble with a second person sturdy construction very quiet when in use a great investment         
2916,5.0,                       great piece of equipment  i ve had it for about a month now with no complaints really  setup wasn t that bad and has some good speakers and training programs on it  do wish the speakers were a little louder though  stomping around on it does kinda drown out the sound a little but not too much      
2917,2.0,                       i am seriously thinking about returning this thing  after assemble the whole thing  with the worse instructions ever  i go to the website to start the machine because has like   warning labels saying it won t start until you go to the website  you go to the website and says  ready to start a    day free trial   and you must put your cc info for payment  is this even legal      
2918,4.0,                       the machine is great  best treadmill i have purchased to date   it is quiet  solid and pretty easy to assemble  even by yourself   the ifit connection to so many different routines is fantastic      
2919,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill  it took about     hours to put together   the instructions were easily understood with the minor exception on wiring of the screen panel   over all a high quality product from nordictrack and came in very handy   we use this treadmill on daily basis and been very happy with it      
2920,5.0,                       this is the second nordictrack i have owned  they are all very high quality  definitely like all of the features with the ifit      
2921,5.0,                       i use it for walking and running  only had it for   month and really enjoy it this far   it is def long enough and wide enough   i was a little worried about those thing    i am     lbs   my husband is around     and he also walks on it occasionally   youtube directions on how to assemble if needed   def recommend     
2922,4.0,                       this treadmill is pretty solid for the price  its basic and gets the job done for some home cardio  only cons for me  pulse bar doesnt seem to work well and the console does not rise when using incline  other than that pretty good buy for the price      
2923,5.0,                       im not much for writing reviews but i read alot before i bought this one so want to pass on some help  i like this treadmill  it feels like a gym quality treadmill  transitions on incline and speed are smooth  it has quick buttons for speed and incline  i like that too      
2924,5.0,                       it was hard to stay motivated due to covid     however  i started running again when the machine arrived  i also started hiking  in less than   months  i lost  lbs   that s what i gained due to lockdown   best purchase ever      
2925,1.0,                       this was not easy to maneuver and was def   not space saving      
2926,5.0,                       we love it  perfect treadmill for our home and the quick breaks we take from work and school at home  easy to put together  just took time and two people working well together      
2927,1.0,                       it has a defective belt  without the belt  the machine will not be doing it s job  i decided to return the machine and not purchase from this company after the seller failed to offer a better solution      
2928,3.0,                       i use this everyday  but it s noisy   was extremely challenging to assemble  i thought in      they would have succeeded in reducing the noise      
2929,3.0,                       ifit system is sometimes slow or gets held up during a workout which is very annoying      
2930,5.0,                       great treadmill   very quiet and awesome value      
2931,5.0,                       i love this machine  great quality  easy to use  never get bored with ifit      
2932,4.0,                       the quality is not the best  not sure if it was the  professional  set up  not professional at all  but the belt looks like it s shredding     
2933,3.0,                       hit or miss on whether or not it ll turn on    definitely cheaply made  you re basically just paying for the logo and marketing materials      
2934,4.0,                       just starting out with the treadmill  so not too many comments  it is what i expected in terms of sturdiness and features  delivery was much longer than expected  ordered january   with estimated delivery january     actually delivered january         
2935,5.0,                       was just as advertised  pleasantly pleased     
2936,5.0,                       love how the treadmill functions and the ease of use  morivates me to get up n go everyday  the aux feature is great and the speakers r loud enough to hear even im running full throttle      
2937,5.0,                       it took me about   hours to put together with no help   yeah i know what the instructions say   takes   people  if you take your time the instructions are very well written and the parts are laid out in blister packs      
2938,5.0,                       it s been really a great machine and have used it almost every day     
2939,5.0,                       love it  cardio is the best way to lose weight  running makes me feel better and healthy  this treadmill is easy to handle and fit my rhythm  size is perfect for home place      
2940,5.0,                       we ve had the treadmill for about a month  and it s been great   used by four people  for a mix of walking  jogging  and interval training   overall  a great buy a bit of a pain to put together  but not too terrible      
2941,1.0,                       missing pieces  cracked panels  a second class product     
2942,5.0,                       my husband and i     and    years old  respectively  use the nordictrack for walking everyday   it is perfect for us   it is very quiet   we purchased the assembly and that went really well with the company who assembled the treadmill   he was very knowledgeable and helpful   all around  this was a great purchase for us      
2943,5.0,                       the machine is outstanding  the programs are all great  even if you do not need ifit  the manual setting is good enough  i love the length of the machine  it is extremely easy for tall and heavy person as they have enough room if you purchase the   feet length  totally satisfied by the purchase      
2944,5.0,                       has some great work outs for me to get back on the exercise train     minutes flies by  easy to use and start up  i wont be storing mine anytime soon but i appreciate the feature      
2945,5.0,                       the ifit app is great and the build in screen makes is very easy to get moving  this is a very well build treadmill and was easy to put together  i can go for a run on it no problem and it gets up to a decent incline  this by far has been my best quarantine purchase yet  my wife and i fight over who get to go on it first after putting the kids to bed      
2946,5.0,                       love it  i ve had it since september and haven t had any issues  i can run both long and short distances along with walk inside during the colder months  it s been a great addition to my gym  it took some time to assemble  but the directions are easy to follow

2949,5.0,                       excellent product  makes walking a pleasure in any type of weather      
2950,3.0,                       it s nice easy to use  but installation took a long time and the belt keeps shifting no mater how many times you re arrange it      
2951,5.0,                       the instruction say to have help putting together  i assembled it by myself and was fairly simple  i was quite surprised and thankful  overall it looks good and feels good  my wife tried some of the workouts and loved them  definitely did not make a mistake with this purchase      
2952,5.0,                       i bought this to be able to safely continue to exercise during this time of covid   it arrived as scheduled and took about an hour to assemble   it has been used everyday without any issues   i love the ifit programs that really help you stay focused   i love this treadmill

2955,4.0,                       not a big fan of the volune being max volume evertime i turn it on and it has a fake     apps  button that i m not sure of the purpose but all in all it works well and does what i need it to do     
2956,4.0,                       very noisy on any setting  easy to put together just give yourself time and   people required to make it go easier  read and follow instructions  nice machine quality for the price  has alot of great features  nice wide belt for walking or running  good investment      
2957,5.0,                       this is a birthday present for our son  he s got it set up with ease and it works great      
2958,5.0,                       i love this machine  it was not super easy to set up  if that s not in your wheelhouse id recommend having someone do it for you  we had a couple of glitches with set up but customer service was very attentive and worked hard to get us set  i love the ifit training membership and think it s worth every penny      
2959,5.0,                       i love working out on my nordictrack treadmill  it gives me a lot of different options for my  workout    it is so good for me physically because i can  personalize  my workout needs

2962,5.0,                       it took me awhile  but i was able to assemble on my own and it was so easy to set up for use  it s a great treadmill  so far so good  i bought this to replace one that cost twice this much and it absolutely measures up      
2963,5.0,                       home use for wife and my self  we live in a cold climate needed to walk  health clubs closed due to covid      
2964,5.0,                       great treadmill for the price   i m     lbs and getting back in to running to get back in shape  and it works great with the pounding that i give it for five miles   would definitely buy again      
2965,5.0,                       i purchased this treadmill to use at home because the gym shut down due to covid  it was relatively straightforward to put together  it has the basic options that any treadmill has but carries the reliability of a nordic track  the only thing i regret is not buying it sooner  i m spending more time on the treadmill now then i was at the gym  great purchase      
2966,5.0,                       bought this treadmill at the beginning of quarantine and have not once regretted this big purchase  took about    minutes to assemble but directions were very clear  treadmill works great and has different speeds and inclines to choose from  i also purchased an ifit package which is amazing and like having your own personal trainer  i love my treadmill      
2967,5.0,                       my wife s treadmill broke and couldn t find a repair shop and she walks   miles a day minimum and amazon beat everyone with in    miles     
2968,1.0,                       can t get it put together because nordictrack qc missed an  unflush  weld  bolt won t go in to fully secure left arm    giving a single star for now until nordictrack sends us a replacement arm       
2969,5.0,                       really great treadmill  it has a cool feature where it will slowly come down on it s own  when going from the folded position to the ready to use position  sorta like those self closing drawers  so it doesn t slam down  works really great  not too tough to put it together      
2970,5.0,                       was concerned when it arrived box was in bad shape  decided to keep and take a chance that no parts was missing  put together and everything was there  i don t need that ifit stuff  just using for walking      
2971,1.0,                       this machine is a scam to force people to buy ifit memberships  it is unusable without an ifit membership and no where does it say that  never buy this     
2972,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  easy to use  it has wheels  so you can easily move around  oh  and you can fold up and when you put it down  it lowers very slowly to the ground    so no worry about it smashing into floor now  no excuse for not walking     
2973,1.0,                       very hard to know as cannot get any technical support after trying for   months  very disappointed as this is usually a great product  but without support even after buying an additional year hard to know      
2974,5.0,                       i was looking for a gym quality treadmill no longer wanting to go to a gym during this time  thorough research bought me to nordictrack t series  received the item and have used it regularly ever sincere    sturdy and well made   very happy with this purchase      
2975,1.0,                       it forces you to buy a subscription before you can use the treadmill at all  you are literally held hostage for a credit card number  otherwise you cannot use this product you thought you already purchased  what a sleazy  unethical company  do not support them      
2976,5.0,                       works great and is exactly what we wanted      
2977,5.0,                       amazing treadmill  it feels professional like the ones at the gym  absolutely the best purchase  no need for the gym anymore  this is so much more convenient  amazon installation  was perfect as well      
2978,5.0,                       just like the ones at a gym  excellent machine  i am pleased and impressed  also the set up service available is awesome  if i had to do it myself  well  i would still be waiting to use it      
2979,5.0,                       this was a gift to my husband and he is really using and liking the performance of this treadmill   he recommends it to all      
2980,5.0,                       terrific treadmill   i cannot wait to get home after work to exercise on my treadmill  it was easy to assemble and once i m done working out it easily folds away   this was a great buy   i don t need to join a gym or waste time driving to a gym either      
2981,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill in april  it was very easy to install  with help from my kids  we completed the assembly in two hours  it has been running very well  i use for endurance and interval training  it is a simple treadmill but well serves the purpose of exercising  the best way to use this machine is to combine it with some streamed fitness app      
2982,4.0,                       work fine     
2983,5.0,                       this was everything and more than i expected  sturdy  quiet and filled with options  i put it together myself and didn t have a problem  some of the instructions are a little off but if you have a strong attention to detail it s practically common sense  amazing purchase       
2984,5.0,                       i was pleasantly surprised by the sturdiness of the product  it feels and looks like a treadmill from a professional gym   i use it almost every day and it runs very well   it was well worth paying a little extra   i even got the   year maintenance plan to protect my investment because i plan on using it for a long while      
2985,5.0,                       the assembly process was tedious  once it was assembled  it was easy to turn on and off  i enjoyed the bluetooth  feature and the ifit program is easy to follow and what a motivating app      
2986,5.0,                       item is as described by the seller      
2987,5.0,                       had in issue with them sending me   of the same part and took about   weeks to get the new part  also some of the bolts to assemble it weren t the same size so i had to go to the store to get the right size  overall  the assembled products is nice      
2988,5.0,                       assembly was easy and took about   hours to complete  i needed help from a second person for about       min to place large pieces  hold screen steady while putting the screws etc  we are using treadmill every day and absolutely loving it  you need to register to ifit to start using the treadmill but it didn t require credit card information at all  highly recommended product      
2989,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill especially for the price  i have used it almost daily for walking and running and it has been great  i like that you can press a single button to go to the speed you want rather then an up and down arrow  that works well for switching between running and walking      
2990,5.0,                       great machine and quality build    superior to other tredmills that cost more good selection of programs so i don t use the ifit sub  just hold the ifit button down to unlock the machine  plenty of speed and incline for the average joe      
2991,1.0,                       requiring me to sign up for ifit   don t remember reading that at all      
2992,5.0,                       this treadmill is sturdy and works well for my wife and i  my daughter had already bought one and recommended it to us  we also used the inside delivery and they carrie  it to the basement    very easy  putting together is easy if you follow the directions      
2993,5.0,                       this is a replacement for my sole treadmill that died  it s a great piece of equipment with a decent belt width  smooth and quiet motor  would definitely recommend if your in the market for a treadmill      
2994,5.0,                       i absolutely love this treadmill       
2995,5.0,                       i really like this treadmill   the free year of ifit is also nice   getting more exercise in is awesome  this makes it so much easier  a quality product      
2996,1.0,                       the treadmill was delivered with missing parts   the nordictrack customer service is worthless   my husband and i are rational  educated people and cannot get the customer service system to allow us to speak to a person about the missing parts   so it s just sitting  un usable  in our home gym and we re out a few grand      
2997,5.0,                       working out     
2998,1.0,                       after    months of very light use i turned on the machine and the display flickers and nothing happens  i have reset the machine a dozen times to no avail  i have been online for an hour waiting to chat with someone from nordik track    extremely unhappy  i wish i had never bought this      
2999,5.0,                       my family and i have been using this machine for over a month now and it is excellent  no problems at all  the interface is intuitive  the pre programmed workouts are varied and useful  the machine is solidly built and should serve us for years to come  recommended      
3000,5.0,                       i wanted needed a basic treadmill to avoid having to run outside in subzeroweather and to stop killing myself on the ice   the     does everything i had hoped for  it s quiet  seems plenty smooth and sturdy  and has more bells and whistles than i wanted   i have even doubled the distance that i run in the total comfort of my home while watching tv   that s important during nfl playoff time      
3001,5.0,                       i am very happy   if i had to say one bad thing   incline only goes to a    but other than that it s great   i d recommend the work out app that goes with the nordic track   online trainers  when they adjust speed and incline the machine adjusts automatically with them   i paid for installer thru amazon   he was very polite and friendly      
3002,4.0,                       i really love my nordictrack t series treadmill  it was fairly easy to assemble for a novice and great to use  i love the fact that it has access to personal training and the monitor is big and has great graphics      
3003,5.0,                       we get a great workout every day  especially during this covid    confinement era  i love the tilt ability and the ability to make micro adjustments to how fast i want to go  it s solid and sturdy  was easy to assemble and easy to update the software  no issues at all      
3004,5.0,                       i m loving my new treadmill  you can by pass ifit  press and hold the button until it beeps      
3005,5.0,                       this is a sturdy product   holds     lbs with no issues  running or walking   it wasn t too difficult to put together  it is easier with a second set of hands for assembling  we have had it for going on   mths and no issues to complain about      
3006,4.0,                       even though most features don t work without subscription we still love this treadmill  we were able to bypass the required subscription      
3007,4.0,                       speed and incline are not accurate  may need a tech to come out      
3008,5.0,                       it s a two person job to assemble  other than that it s not super loud      
3009,1.0,                       came unassembled  no idea how to put it together      
3010,5.0,                       i did the assembly myself as it would have taken weeks to get a person  it was straightforward and simple to put together  solid treadmill  i use it on inclement weather days      
3011,5.0,                       very happy with this product assembly was easy and it works great       
3012,5.0,                       great treadmill for home use   bought it for myself but my husband uses it too   i like the size of the walking surface and the workout options are plenty      
3013,5.0,                       works great  easy to set up  i have to create my own workouts  the automatic ones don t seem to offer much diversity and i haven t figured out how to adjust them or even if they can be adjusted  the idea seems to be to get you to purchase another electronic trainer device that allows for adjustment and has a variety of choices  the speed control doesn t do much for me  when i push    it starts at     miles per hour  i end up using the manual adjustment which works fine  i m almost afraid to push the other numbers for fear of what might happen  that said  all the basic functionality works fine  i ve got an alexa  but not an mp  player  so i let her play music and haven t tried the on board speakers  i start my workout at     miles per hour and   incline  after the first song i go to   mph and   degree incline  after each succeeding song  i go up two degrees until i reach ten  i stay there through    songs at   mph  and then come down to         and so on  it takes about an hour  it s easy to vary speed and incline to build an interesting workout  my songs vary in length from   minutes to   minutes  so using them to time my workout gives me some variety  when i was building up  i d drop back to less incline until i caught my breath  increased speed for a song  and then increased incline again  i m doing manually what fancy workouts would do  i have issues with balance so i tend to hold onto the handles  i m very happy with the system  it folds up easily and comes back down easily once you figure out that you have to lift a little  push with your foot and then drop the bed  it s cushioned on shocks so it lifts and lowers pretty much by itself      
3014,3.0,                       i like that it is easy to fold and has large drink holder  i think the motor is a bit loud so i wear headphones to block out the noise      
3015,5.0,                       this treadmill is everything i ve been wanting  it also only took my husband and i   hour to assemble ourselves  love the different settings you can use on it for the type of workout you want to do      
3016,4.0,                       treadmill is fine  but paid extra for delivery into room of choice  delivery guys tore up my walls and ripped handrail off wall  they should know whether or not to remove the railing  horrible      
3017,4.0,                       thus far the machine has worked as promised  having access to ifit for walks  runs and additional work out is a plus the integrated touch pad has great resolution the     motor runs smoothly with quick response to integrated workouts      
3018,1.0,                       the protected film tore the finish on the panelthe incline never worked and still does notthe handle was ripped and torncan t get any help from amazon  installed took time who want to uninstall and ship backwait the shipping tool   months with wrong date notifications     
3019,5.0,                       way cheaper than buying from nordictrack direct   easy assembly  works as promised   ifit is terrific and a great motivator      
3020,5.0,                       because of a previous review on this  i was able to bypass the forced signup with ifitness  without having to deal with that  i was able to focus on the product itself which is exactly what i was looking for      
3021,5.0,                       got this shipped to my wife and she assembled it all by herself  it works well and she loves it      
3022,5.0,                       this is an excellent treadmill and great for those that don t need the  overly advanced  workouts with higher speeds and steep inclines   the    mph speed and     incline is perfect for our uses   also  we use it with the ifit app which makes the workouts more fun and less stressful for programming workouts      
3023,5.0,                       super awesome  i love it   the ifit thing is very cool   i m still getting used to it   there are so many good coaches to choose from   i m definitely having a lot of fun while training for my ultra       
3024,5.0,                       before deciding on the t series  i did my research and spent time comparing different treadmills   i wanted something strong enough to do my daily run but foldable for ease of cleaning   and  it paid off   i have been with it two months and we use it almost everyday   no complaints   very happy with my purchase      
3025,5.0,                       i ve been using this treadmill for about   weeks now and haven t had any issues with it  i was able to bypass the option to register my treadmill and avoid the monthly fees      
3026,5.0,                       had the professional setup which was done in no time   treadmill is easy to use with just enough options   only negative is i had to use the ifit option to activate the treadmill      
3027,5.0,                       great machine   quiet and smooth  little hard to get some of the screws in   other then that easy to assemble  very happy with this purchase      
3028,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  it runs great and is very sturdy  it some time to put together  but we go the job done  it s a little difficult to get to just a manual run  but besides that it is great  i would recommend this product to others      
3029,5.0,                       the delivery people were the best  so grateful for them and great treadmill      
3030,5.0,                       like the wide belt and hand bars  sturdy construction and easy read graphics is as good or better than most professional gyms   great product for the price   you do not need the ifit to get a great workout      
3031,5.0,                       i have had the treadmill for two months now and i have to say i like the treadmill  it is sturdy and the overall quality is very good  i can easily fold it and save space  i used to go to high end gyms and i was a regular user of treadmills there and i feel this one is as good as those  i highly recommend this product      
3032,5.0,                       product took approximately      hrs to assemble but instructions were pretty clear  we ve only had it for   weeks now but have used it everyday and we re very happy with it  we were able to put in manual mode fir use instead of signing up and paying for the ifit monthly  overall very happy with this treadmill      
3033,5.0,                       my only wish is that the heartbeat monitor does not work well unless you stop what you are doing   other than that  it is a fine treadmill and have had no issues      
3034,4.0,                       i haven t used the pre programed workouts so far  just set my speed and angle for the workout i want the heart rate monitor works erratically if at all      
3035,1.0,                       purchased this with  expert assembly   but was quickly prompted after my purchase that no assembler would be coming out to my location  through email  i live    minutes outside of bellingham washington  it is not unreasonable to assume that they could get someone to my house to assemble  very dissapointed right now  and will review the actual product when if i get it assembled      
3036,5.0,                       it is really a good treadmill i am using it for last   months and love it it came with   year family ifit membership      
3037,5.0,                       excellent treadmill  we are getting excellent usage of it  it works as well for our fitness as ones we have used in health clubs      
3038,5.0,                       i got this device near two months ago so that myself and my family could do some good workout indoor during the covid    pandemic related stay home period  it came with a really well thought manual and instruction explaining the steps required to assemble the device in a very clear way  i am very satisfied with the product      
3039,5.0,                       satisfied with this purchase so far  super functional and responsive treadmill  worth it      
3040,5.0,                       i couldn t be happier with this purchase  originally  i was looking at multiple options and ultimately settled on this one  i m so glad i did  while it took a little bit to assemble  the instructions were easy to follow and i have used it almost every day since purchasing  i highly recommend      
3041,4.0,                       it is a reliable product for a home gym but the assembly is not very easy  the quality of speaker sound is poor and having to download the app to start the product for the first time is a bad idea      
3042,5.0,                       i am in love with this treadmill  im on it every morning      
3043,5.0,                       we absolutely love this treadmill    use it for great walk run interval training  as well as my daughters daily walk  assembly was easy as well due to the very clear instructions that came with the tread      
3044,1.0,                       product came doa  dead motor after troubleshooting with bordeaux thru video camera   took me hours to put it together  very disappointed     
3045,5.0,                       love it     it took us   hr to assemble   but it worth it     everything works perfectly it came early  thanks amazon you are the best     
3046,2.0,                       very nice piece of equipment  professional quality  well build and easy to use   thank you     
3047,4.0,                       i really like this treadmill  the only thing is that it does not give you the heart rate  also  it s really heavy  i like it because of the app  ifit      
3048,5.0,                       i love my treadmill    it s so easy to use  i use it almost everyday and have not had problems  user friendly      
3049,1.0,                       honestly worst purchase i have made in a while i do not recommend anyone getting it  the actual item falls apart continuously we ordered parts   times and the nordic support line was horrible  amazon service chat was the most amazing help with the issue  but would not recommend this item or brand to anyone      
3050,5.0,                       love this treadmill  use it daily and enjoy the free ifit membership  too      
3051,2.0,                       this equipment is pretty good   but after   month of usage about   times a week   the incline got stuck i been waiting for   half month to get it part replaced   i purchase the warranty thru amazon   is pretty disappointing that is taking this long    next time i m going to continue buying electronic from best buy       
3052,5.0,                       this was a great addition to my home gym  initially i felt that the treadmill width was insufficient from first sight due to commercial grade machines that i am used to working out on at the ymca  the size  speed  and display are amazing  go get you one  no quarantine    for me and my wife  lol excellent product  thanks nordictrack     
3053,5.0,                       excellent treadmill   paid under   k but works better than ones twice the price   read complaints about the incline taking long to operate and the unit having to calibrate every time but that is not the case with mine   the heart rate monitor is not perfect but neither is the one at my gym which costs over   k      
3054,5.0,                       very useful  do not pay fees to use it   press the power button for    seconds and you can start using it   it did not work for us the first time we tried this but it did the second time   do not pay the fees to use it       
3055,5.0,                       great product plus the month free training with personal trainers from great product around the world to keep you motivated is awesome      
3056,5.0,                       i do love this machine  it is a wonderful workout machine the descriptions are right on target i love this      
3057,5.0,                       this product came through and was exactly as described  i have enjoyed using the product in the first month so far and am excited to continue to use this and the ifit capabilities to enhance my workouts great product and happy with value received for price paid      
3058,5.0,                       i have really enjoyed having a machine in my home  i was not disappointed   it does everything the bigger  more expensive treadmills do  i highly recommend      
3059,5.0,                       easy assembly and easy folding when needed but most importantly   connect via bluetooth to your phone tablet so you can use ifit  amazing app that can control your treadmill so you can use guides on your work outs  yesterday i ran in cost rica        
3060,2.0,                       although the shape of the treadmill seems to be in excellent condition  it was missing all of the hardware  screws  washers  bolts  as well as the key to start the treadmill     
3061,5.0,                       i love that i have a way to workout without leaving my house  it s very quiet and i can run on it in the morning with out waking up my kids  i even recommended to a friend of mine who also purchased  what i like is that i m not super small and this supports my weight without feeling like it will give out      
3062,5.0,                       bit heavy but worth for a person with     lb running over it  needed two person for lifting it  assemble manual could have been better but we had lot of videos  like this treadmill      
3063,5.0,                       treadmill was damaged in shipment  contacted amazon  and nordic track  nordic track sent new replacement parts free of charge   very nice treadmill  i like the big display       
3064,5.0,                       everything is great  my only complaint is that some plastic pieces were left on the screen when i took off the plastic covering     
3065,5.0,                       solid treadmill with lots of options     
3066,4.0,                       the product came damaged from one side i was able to reach out to nordic trac and am waiting for the replacement part to see what is being sent also  i notice that the belt doesn t always work well  it keeps slipping in between causing me to lose my balance shrinking at times     
3067,5.0,                       we are using it for   months now and it is performing well  easy to use  the cushion is good  easily foldable  and fits our needs  definitely recommended      
3068,5.0,                       it is quiet and day to use     
3069,5.0,                       looks steady and quiet  regular use for family        mins running daily assembly service is good  efficient  polite guys     
3070,5.0,                       great piece of equipment for what i need it for use it everyday   meets all requirements  so far free assembly and the interest free purchase played a big part of the purchase      
3071,3.0,                       item arrived two days later than  scheduled delivery date  and activation isn t really intuitive      
3072,5.0,                       just what we needed  we re mature adults and it provides a very adequate workout  good quality  fairly easy assembly     
3073,1.0,                       do not buy this product if you expect them to deliver inside of your house   if you can t lift a     pound item yourself  even though you pay for delivery inside front door  buy from someplace else      
3074,5.0,                       this is a very good product  seems you are really at the gymas per the lock down  all the family members are using it on a daily basisvery good product     
3075,1.0,                       never rated anything before  be aware it will not turn on until it s activated  activation requires you to enter you credit card number and keep it on file with this company why   otherwise product appears fine      
3076,5.0,                       pros very solid and well built love the variety of different settings pretty quiet cons super super heavythe packaging of this treadmill was extremely poor  luckily  mine wasn t damaged during delivery      
3077,5.0,                       i  love the ease of set up and the different features included  this is a terrific treadmill to add to your home gym and it comes at a great price      
3078,5.0,                       we love this treadmill  we really liked the delivery and installation by amazon  it s nice to have a quiet  effective treadmill      
3079,5.0,                       daily walking by by wife and self   this is our second treadmill from nordic track  sturdy reliable piece of equipment there warranty for service and repair is     i will buy another one when this one dies          
3080,5.0,                       programs are fun to keep you motivated but the ifit account isn t necessary  easy access buttons on the side for speed and incline  very satisfied with my purchase  would recommend        
3081,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  i use it every morning for fasted cardio  enjoying the free ifit membership included      
3082,4.0,                       the treadmill itself is great  very good quality and high performing  however  the assembly of it was extremely difficult  it definitely requires at least   people to assemble and took about   days  additionally  some of the parts didn t fit snug as if they were bent before packaging      
3083,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill  i didn t think i would like use the ifit app  but i actually really like the different workouts and trainers  it really helps motivate and keep you going instead of staring at a wall      
3084,2.0,                       the day has finally come and delivery was at     am  excited as we just unboxed our treadmill but the belt is not smooth  not a pleasant view at the moment  we have not started assembly yet but we hope that the belt flattens over time and does not stay that way  i ll post an update as soon as it s assembled      
3085,5.0,                       this is a terrific buy for the price     
3086,5.0,                       love love love this treadmill and the ifit app  easy to assemble  took about an hour      
3087,1.0,                       the stupidest thing these guys did on this machine was this ifit thing  no some of us do have our workout  no we don t want yours  how do you get rid off ifit      
3088,1.0,                       i was trying to assembly this product right now  what a trash product  the screw provided is too big and some part of it is so hard to dissemble  the reason i gave it one star is that there is no lower rating   please get away from this product  do not deceive by the review  my finger got bleed twice     
3089,5.0,                       this product is great   it arrived in time  was relatively easy to assemble and quality is like a treadmill you would see in a gym   we have used it multiple times with no issues and are really enjoying it   would purchase again  highly recommend      
3090,2.0,                       not user friendly     
3091,1.0,                       we assembled it and it wouldn t turn on  called nordictrack and it apparently has a faulty controller panel   i will dismantle and return   several hours for nothing   very frustrating      
3092,5.0,                       for the price  this is a pretty good treadmill to do a walk jog   i ve been using it for couple months now for at least     times a week and no problem yet   though i do hear a little  clicking  sounds every step  very annoying  and can t figure out where it s coming from but don t seem to have a problem with the machine itself      
3093,5.0,                       first treadmill purchase   very happy with this purchase   didn t know what to think about the ifit until i tried it   it s actually pretty fun to use and it has a large variety to choose from which makes it fun   i like the auto elevation when running through different terrain   i ve only had it for a few months but i would recommend this treadmill      
3094,5.0,                       great product for a great price  used for two years with no issues at all  used primarily for running but it does offer    workout apps  ipod and ifit compatibility  incline options  folds up easily and can be rolled out of the way when done  very happy with purchase      
3095,5.0,                       this is my first treadmill for home use and i am very pleased with this treadmill  i use it for days that i cannot run outside  rain or snow  and it works very well functionality wise it is a basic models  but for indoor running it is fine      
3096,5.0,                       bought for wife for christmas  easy to assemble but   people make it easier  wife has used it twice and says it is very similar to the expensive ones at the gym     
3097,5.0,                       it s just what i ve been thinking of     
3098,2.0,                       it is now far under a year old and the treadmill sticks making running impossible  i have followed directions with routinely cleaning and applying oil i tightened the belts and looked at all other possible damages  the treadmill no longer can support running do not purchase      
3099,5.0,                       this treadmill works great  no complaints so far  i ve had it for about   months and use it     times a week      
3100,5.0,                       great treadmill  it s like bringing the gym home     
3101,5.0,                       it was simple to assemble  just minor issues that were easily fixable  it s not very loud  it s great for working out especially if your not big on running  it is a great product  it makes running easy and enjoyable not to mention you can hook up your phone to it and enjoy your playlist      
3102,5.0,                       package made it easy for unpacking and assembly great planning n t  thanks     
3103,5.0,                       i love this treadmill      
3104,5.0,                       we did a lot of research before making this purchase  it s been a few months and it s been wonderful  it folds so easily and it s not too loud      
3105,5.0,                       everything is good so far  my husband is     and     pounds and use it  it works perfectly  very happy with our purchase      
3106,5.0,                       excellent treadmill only thing you must contact ifit with your credit card to even turn treadmill on then if you do not want ifit you must call them back cancel or it continues monthly charge on your credit card  besides that great treadmill easy to operate smooth track easy to fold and unfold  just a great treadmill      
3107,5.0,                       i put this together all by myself  but i don t recommend it    it is very heavy and a bit tedious   i found some of the screws didn t quite fit the holes that were drilled for them   and  yes  i did read the instructions   in the end  it works great  and i love it      
3108,5.0,                       great treadmill for price  putting together was a little cumbersome   time consuming but i would say typical for a treadmill assembly      
3109,2.0,                       this equipment was shipped without the front handle bar  called at it took almost   weeks to receive the part  reflects poorly on quality control with a main part missing  the start and the shut down is rather abrupt and not smooth  other than that it is a basic functional treadmill      
3110,5.0,                       silent  does not take up much space and supports enough weight  my husband has a strong footprint when he runs and they have a good system for that      
3111,3.0,                       so far so good considering the treadmill arrived with a broken panel  i immediately registered the product and entered a service request however  it s been a month with no contact from nordictrack  luckily i completed assembly and am using it with the broken panel otherwise it would just be sitting for a month  the biggest complaint is the screen is very dim and not backlit however  i m not sure if this is because of the damage or just the design  i ll update once fixed      
3112,5.0,                       love having the thread i ll and it has come in very useful to stay active and fight the battle of the bulge consider having a professional assemble it  i don t think i would have managed it on my own      
3113,5.0,                       easy to use and provides a great workout      
3114,5.0,                       i got this machine last year and have put in the corner of my living room  it works great so far with all the speed controls and elevation   the width of the machine is perfect for an adult and is neither too small nor too wide  the machine is foldable which helps to save space       
3115,1.0,                       love spending a couple hours to put a treadmill together only to get an invalid ifit code for a web app i don t even want and is not related to my treadmill    so i can t even use the treadmill    awesome        
3116,2.0,                       the plastic panel on the front track block your running  easily to step on it and fall      
3117,1.0,                       box arrived half destroyed  no surprise  the console and screen were damaged and broken into several pieces   not that this mattered because the mounting bar for the console was missing anyway  what a shame      
3118,5.0,                       good solid product at a reasonable price   my only issue was having to sign up for the online classes to get the product started   i cancelled right away  so it cost me nothing and once you initialize the treadmill  you don t need the online classes to control anything   you can do it manually yourself everything is easy to control   supports my     lbs   it is heavy and difficult to get upstairs      
3119,5.0,                       i love this machine  i use it in the summer when it s too hot to go outside here in the desert  i love the ifit membership and the workouts and do not regret it for a second      
3120,5.0,                       for      this is a great treadmill  only issue i had was it got delivered damaged  but i called the amazon and they were able to connect me with the manufacturer and they sent the part to me that night and got it in a week  overall   stars from me  great product      
3121,4.0,                       it has a damage  deep scratch   the delivery guys pulled with the straps it has and the box was ripped off and i thought they might know that this will not impact the product whereas it has deep scratches and found some small black piece and not sure from where it got broken     
3122,1.0,                       used the treadmill and within   min the band started folding  i went ahead and opened the treadmill to adjust the band  and noticed it was ripped  after the band was straightened out  a   min after use it started folding again      
3123,5.0,                       easy to use and very quick delivery    have been using it for couple of months and works great  no issues and easy to fold  requires two to assemble and took us around    mins     hr  quality of the belt is great and feels good  my wife uses it for an hour effortlessly  great purchase overall       
3124,1.0,                       the treadmill arrived with a small crack  i didn t mind i was like whatever it works  but one of the sensors is damage or something cause every time i touch the sensor the treadmill turns off  it s so annoying  is also making noise when i run and not the normar noise a treadmill makes  this sounds like the treadmill       
3125,5.0,                       i love it  i only use it to walk  but it seems sturdy enough to run on as well  very nicely made and not huge  i used the expert assembly and they was great also      
3126,5.0,                       the machine is very quiet and easy to use  it is also very easy to fold up and folds down slowly so that it doesn t slam on the ground  overall  i am very pleased in the quality for the price i paid      
3127,3.0,                       glad i found out how to unlock without subscribing to the online service      
3128,5.0,                       yes   after doing some research  we finally found this gem and so glad we did  it works amazing  i am not a professional runner or anything  just needed something to lose weight and this treadmill is definitely helping      
3129,4.0,                       you are going to need   people  a set of wrenches  a screwdriver and about     hours of free time to assemble this treadmill with the pieces they provide  it also says not to use a power tool but you will most likely need a power drill to screw in some pieces  treadmill is nice  but the assembly is not fun      
3130,4.0,                       love the treadmill came on time  however it was noted for free assembly and that never happened  i was suppose to receive a call back regarding assembly and never heard back  with two people and   hours it wasn t that hard to figure out though      
3131,5.0,                       easy to assemble and i love do my working out i this treadmill      
3132,4.0,                       i use this every morning and love it but wish it would work without internet     
3133,1.0,                       step   is a pain in the ass can t get the damn screws in      
3134,1.0,                       this thing took   minute to start running everyday  stupid ifit i just want to run not be apart of you ifit      
3135,5.0,                       treadmill is reliable and easy to use assembly is a bit much  haven t folded it yet so i have no comments in that area      
3136,5.0,                       super product  would highly recommend for the price     
3137,5.0,                       nice unit   assembly was straightforward   i assembled it by hand since i didn t have the drill bit for it  so it took a little longer   works well  runs well and seems to be built strong enough for our walking and running needs   my wife loves it   very happy with the treadmill      
3138,5.0,                       i like it a lot it has incline just a bit strange not your normal incline but good over all     
3139,3.0,                       i got the treadmill and it works fine  the only issue is that it arrived a little damaged shown in images   seemingly due to it being possibly dropped   and i m worried that it will worsen and affect the functionality of the treadmill  it would be nice to have an amazon worker come repair it      
3140,5.0,                       we ordered this treadmill several months ago and we have been extremely pleased with it  it s durable  easy to use  and includes most of the functionality you would find on a gym quality treadmill  it s also relatively quiet  we would definitely recommend for anyone purchasing for their home      
3141,5.0,                       i think this is the best buy i made yet  its very sturdy and doesnt shake or make noise when used  i had amazon put it together for me  so far i am very happy with the treadmill     
3142,5.0,                       meet specification as sold and is great for running and walking on  it does everything it says it will and is much more stable and reliable than i had imagined for the price  couldn t be more happy with the purchase      
3143,5.0,                       this is even better than i expected  i have had nordic track equipment in the past  which is why i chose this unit   it is rock solid  quiet and a joy to use  can t go wrong with this unit      
3144,3.0,                       it s much heavier than expected  would be difficult to move  and will need   people to move it  also  assembly was quite time consuming  took almost   hours for   people to assemble it  machine itself is pretty good  but quite difficult in assembly and moving      
3145,5.0,                       easy to move around in our basement we took so much time to finalize this but worth the money  it s keeping us active as the outdoors weather isn t comfortable towalk in this chicago weather     
3146,5.0,                       we love this treadmill   with wfh situation due to covid   it s giving us the required cardio exercise  it was easy to assemble and quick to setup with ifit  exercise are fun because we get to work out and view various countries  definitely recommended       
3147,5.0,                       machine is easy to program   exceeds my expectations      
3148,5.0,                       excellent treadmill beginners will love it      
3149,5.0,                       i use the treadmill for intense power walking  it s perfect for that  no problems  i use it     days a week  i ve had it for about   months  delivery was fine and setup went well      
3150,5.0,                       my family loves this treadmill  it s durable  high quality  very easy to operate  and very solid  it is very comfortable to walk and or run on  it is easy to fold up and bring back down  i would recommend this product over and over for anyone in the market for a home family treadmill      
3151,3.0,                       product was great while it worked  but after    months  the motor is starting to go causing the tread to slip  it s had pretty consistent use  say     days a week  but it s been used exclusively for walking  no running at all  even for the price  i d expect it to last longer      
3152,5.0,                       great treadmill for the price  easy to assemble by one person  have been running at       mph without problem      
3153,4.0,                       good treadmill   i have another nordictrack treadmill that still runs that  over    years old without maintenance do hoping this one is as good   came with small damage to the front which doesn t impact how it works otherwise i would rate a       
3154,1.0,                       this had to of literally fallen out of the delivery truck before it got to my house     look at the pictures of the box and the plug in is bent     there are literally shoe prints all over this  it almost looks like it was intentional smh worst      i ever spent      amazon said they will send a new one but i m super leery about that         
3155,5.0,                       i love this treadmill   i use it everyday   the controls on the machine are nice   but i find it much more motivating subscribing to the ifit trainer app   so many phenomenal workouts and trainers at all levels to keep you going      
3156,5.0,                       my family love this treadmill  we all use it daily  i had amazon send someone to put together and that was the best choice ever  the gentlemen were kind and super fast and clean      
3157,3.0,                       it s too narrow     
3158,3.0,                       not sure what to say on this looks ok but many cracks on the front shield once it was out of the box    front shield covering      
3159,5.0,                       comfortable enough for someone      easy to fold and use assemble might take a while with only one person but its manageable  overall great treadmill      
3160,5.0,                       really like this treadmill  i ve used it weekly for about   months without any complaints  really easy to fold up and move when needed  i don t use ifit so i don t know if that s worth while  finding instructions to avoid using ifit was a little hard but the are available      
3161,5.0,                       did take a while to setup  we used a video to help in setting up but overall it was easy to assemble with   of us  other then that i absolutely love this machine  it s easy to turn on and i love all the programs on it  i use it everyday and am very happy with this product      
3162,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  i had some trouble assembling it  it took roughly   hours   the trick of holding the ifit button to start the treadmill didn t work for me  i signed up for the ifit program and promptly cancelled  no problem and the treadmill still works great      
3163,5.0,                       very upset delivered with big scratch  resolved by amazon   put it together in about an hour  reasonable price nice tread   i used it this morning very happy     
3164,5.0,                       i am so happy with the purchase of this treadmill  it is almost as if i am using a commercial grade treadmill without having spent a fortune      
3165,5.0,                       my husband got me this as a gift  such a great treadmill  price is amazing  easy to assemble  very easy to operate  i love it          
3166,5.0,                       love my nordic track   i use it for walking every day and running a couple days a week   my daughter and son in law also come over to use it   i would recommend this model      
3167,2.0,                       do not recommend     
3168,5.0,                       treadmill works great  adjusts easily through all speeds and inclines  everything works smoothly  took a little skill to assemble  but all went well  we re very happy with it  it was a great solution for winter workouts here in icy maine      
3169,4.0,                       working perfectly although the guy that assembled it forgot to install a pair of covers in the bottom of the treadmill  is making a strange noise but i think i will put some lubricant and see what happens      
3170,5.0,                       have not had this very long  but so far so good   the only frustrating thing was getting started   the treadmill seemed to be forcing me to pay for ifitness to unlock the console  but then i just looked at the questions on amazon and found the solution   completely unlocked and working great      
3171,5.0,                       just an all around great treadmill   i looked at buying at least   others but this one was the best decision for me   i can walk and run using incline and that was very important to me   seems like a solid machine      
3172,5.0,                       i love the one year subscription to ifit  included  that provides access to a variety of professionally  guided exercise programs that are both fun and challenging   now  i look forward to jumping on my treadmill each day to see what new location and challenge awaits me      
3173,5.0,                       its the best machine just hold the ifit batten for    second s it will start to work with no activationits a bit to big so it cant bee moved from one room to another  it don t fit the door  so make sure to  assemble it in the place you want it to be     
3174,4.0,                       it is over     pounds and difficult to get upstairs   it also took   of us over   hours to assemble  some of the screw holes were not fully ground out and it took a lot of strength to force the screws in  i do love using it  it s easy and has a lot of options      
3175,4.0,                       it s a great treadmill but the assembly process is not optimized and some problems you can t even solve yourself  the screen on mine wouldn t work and i had to wiggle the cord to get it to work and it still doesn t work properly  screen cuts out if you do not press the buttons gingerly      
3176,5.0,                       burnt rubber smell on high speeds and upon inspection  i noticed a styrofoam piece inside the motor assembly is otherwise  no issues with the treadmill itself      
3177,5.0,                       so this machine is about half the price of a typical treadmill  but it was amazons choice so i said ok that s good enough for me  install was simple  did it by myself   used   heavy duty zip ties to hold up base during the end part of install  took about   hours  will update review if anything abnormal occurs  i can feel my calories shivering in fear      
3178,5.0,                       it has served its purpose  i have health problems  my blood pressure is not controlled  so when it s high i just jump on the treadmill and it goes down    so i am so glad i purchased this machine   and it was affordable        
3179,1.0,                       if i had looked closer at the one sentence that is buried beneath everything else in the description of this machine  then i never would have purchased it in the first place as it requires an additional     a month just to be able to use it      
3180,5.0,                       so far i have    miles on it in   days  belt came very loose out of the box  im    lbs and when i lean on the handles they wobble a little but other then that its been great      
3181,4.0,                       product came nicely boxed and very easy to assemble  i actually did it by myself with no problems and worked the first time i turned it on  very nice  the only down side  on this model there is no blue tooth ability      
3182,2.0,                       the pre programmed workout button never worked  does nothing when you hit it      
3183,5.0,                       regarding assembly  it really helped that i watched a couple of youtube videos showing the assembly process  i really liked amazon s  delivery to a room  service      
3184,5.0,                       great product just a bit heavy to fold      
3185,5.0,                       this is a fantastic treadmill worth every penny  it is easy to use  easy to fold  and does a great job  it runs really smoothly and when i thought i was having a technical issue  turns out i wasn t   the customer service team was really wonderful and quick to respond      
3186,5.0,                       product is good  sturdy   belt had to be tightened  husband is using it and he weighs          
3187,1.0,                       horrible support  no response  no phone support  dont buy it  motor broke down  and no one answer the phone and still no response in email  will never buy this nordictrak product again      
3188,1.0,                       the belt is already shredding after   month of use  black dust everywhere      
3189,4.0,                       works great  a lot bigger than i expected but packs the punch needed without going to a gym  the only drawback is the cup holder  my water falls off after i drink it and it becomes lighter  and the power button  wish you could customize the settings a little more than having so many workouts already programmed      
3190,5.0,                       solid product  easy to assemble and easy to use  only downside is you have to sign up for the company s monthly training to activate the machine and it s a little difficult to find the cancelation for it so you don t get charged after the first month      
3191,1.0,                       did not receive all parts for the treadmill very difficult to work with customer service     
3192,5.0,                       takes a while to put together ofcourse but great product so far  took a lot longer to receive than expected  definitely more than   days      
3193,4.0,                       this is a great treadmill for our living room  a little loud at times but nothing unexpected  took awhile to assemble but i was doing it by myself  workouts are great      
3194,3.0,                       b      
3195,5.0,                       easy to assemble   love my treadmill     
3196,1.0,                       one use  stuck on incline  already sending a new motherboard  what a waste of money  very disappointed in nordictrack and amazon      
3197,4.0,                       using this for the ability to walk exercise during the new england winter and inclement weather  totally enjoy the choices of fitness instructors  locations and the ability to create workouts in areas all over the globe      
3198,5.0,                       i use treadmill for walking back into shape after a year of sitting  easy to read screen  quiet  paid for assembly  well worth it to insure best working condition  very satisfied      
3199,4.0,                       also  dang hard to assemble     
3200,5.0,                       i did add a     clip on fan   i walk       min    days a week      
3201,5.0,                       we are so happy with our treadmill and it s so nice and fun to workout on  great screen and so many choices     
3202,2.0,                       not to difficult to assemble   worked well the first few times  but then it started to squeak when ever i jump on the treadmill  even if it s off and i jump on it  it squeaks   if i can get this fixed  i would give this   stars  but in till then  i will leave this as a    that squeak is loud and annoying      
3203,5.0,                       love this treadmill  simple to use great screen and love the ifit app  highly recommend this machine  i also paid the extra money for the setup   delivery of machine and setup was right on schedule   for me it was completely worth the extra money   installer was done in a couple of hours and i was ready to go      
3204,5.0,                       easy to use and has safety precautions      
3205,5.0,                       very heavy box  directions were easy to follow  recommends two people to build  but i did it myself  it does take a bit of time though   treadmill is very quiet  runs perfectly  very happy     
3206,5.0,                       very good quality all around  recommended        
3207,3.0,                       the ifit scam is complete b s       all you have to do to activate the treadmill is hold down the ifit button for    seconds   don t let these sell outs fool you   shame on nordictrack        
3208,5.0,                       a bit difficult to assemble around   hours     
3209,5.0,                       easy to assemble  need a friend to help hold some pieces   fold up is easy   works very well     
3210,5.0,                       i use different treadmills  being at the gym  this is built sturdy and is not loud at all  it has the ability to change speeds at the press of a button  this is a good name and a good treadmill  it checked all the boxes     
3211,1.0,                       the worst treadmill  i m         lbs and couldn t even walk on it without it slipping  wasted       hours putting it together      
3212,3.0,                       this product is okay for the price but is really really loud and feels cheap overall  i weigh under     lbs and i m afraid to go too fast  the belt does not secure down as tight as you want it to be  and we had it professionally assembled   the front cover on the belt also extends far out to under the front handle bar so if you take long strides you clip the plastic on your forward step      
3213,5.0,                       loce     
3214,5.0,                       this treadmill is perfect for my home office  folds easily and super convenient  great addition to a home gym        
3215,5.0,                       loving this thing   putting it together wasn t hard   you do need a socket wrench and screw driver     
3216,5.0,                       several of us use our nordic track regularly  now that we are stuck in the house  it s sturdy  fairly quiet  and has all the functions of the treadmills at the gym  it s been an amazing purchase so far      
3217,4.0,                       just purchased the    s  thought the screen would show the ifit  it doesn t  have to have a tablet or phone to watch the videos  hopefully is works good  starting to use it tonight      
3218,5.0,                       i normally would be working out at a gym   with the covid    stay in place restrictions  i wanted to keep in shape and thus invested in the nordic treadmill   it is in my garage and use it regularly   it pretty much has all the features that i am used to and thus don t miss the gym      
3219,3.0,                       it was one heck of a job to assemble it with the worst instructions  it took   hours to assemble  the item is too delicate made by simple plastic  initially it is locked and we cant unlock it unti take a subscription of     month   it is a scam      
3220,1.0,                       worked great for a year until the belt developed a split where it s seamed together and rolled over itself  had to replace the belt and was out of warranty  belt was a pain to replace  wouldn t buy this model again      
3221,5.0,                       good for price but needed repair immediately   received         and with repairman s backlog will not be repaired until              
3222,5.0,                       product arrived in great shape  not even carton damage   delivered fast took about     hours to assemble   i was able to assemble myself using the enclosed instructions i use this treadmill daily for   mile runs and occasional    milers   incline is smooth and works great to randomize hills      
3223,4.0,                       love this treadmill for the variety of workouts it provides     
3224,2.0,                       well i had the thing put together but it turned out the display was to small for the rest of the unit  thankfully i received a refund     
3225,5.0,                       it was a bit hard for me to assemble but i d just come back to it later and it worked out i pretty much like everything about it      
3226,5.0,                       this was a great addition to my life  i hand a lung surgery and i need to walk everyday  i believe i made the right choice  at    years old i did need some help to get the unit inside but nordic track was pretty to put together  i am very happy on my choice     
3227,5.0,                       gets the job done   incline is not so high but perfect to get the job done  easy to assemble took about an houryou dont have to get the trainer program to use the treadmill   just hold the fit button for    seconds and it will allow you to by pass that       
3228,5.0,                       i love it   very sturdy and easy to assemble   great for running or just walking on a incline   i m seeing results already if you re looking for a great workout from home   this is the one      
3229,4.0,                       nordic track t    was easy to assemble and has good features such as built in fan and good size display  required for a home treadmill as well as the bluetooth functionality  the ifit membership is a very good feature and helps motivate while working out      
3230,1.0,                       i love norditrack except that i didn t really get a chance to use the treadmill because some of the parts came broken  it looked used as well  the screws was inside a ziplock  we only unboxed it and did not bother to assemble it      
3231,3.0,                       arrived with damage to lcd display and motor cover   registered product online   contacted company twice  haven t even acknowledged my issues   treadmill works but unhappy with the support and not standing by product   i likely will not by nordictrack again           
3232,5.0,                       love this treadmill   the app is key  it pushes you to work hard but is entertaining  love this treadmill        
3233,1.0,                       we purchased our unit back in january  and it stopped working less than two months later  amazon will not help you after    days  and nordictrack s customer service is the very definition of the word  worthless   the sad part is  when it did work  it was a decent treadmill  but not      for two months of service before breaking down and unable to get the manufacturer to repair even though it s still under warranty good      
3234,4.0,                       this was a great purchase for an entry level treadmill  it was easy to install and when folded up takes up very little space     
3235,5.0,                       very happy with this treadmill  it s all that i expected and more  i had another treadmill made by nordictrack and it last far longer than i expected  well built and reliable treadmills      
3236,5.0,                       i have had this treadmill for two weeks now and i am very satisfied  also not to bad to put together  i did it myself but was creative  normally it would take two people to put together      
3237,5.0,                       i ve had this treadmill for a few months and i m super satisfied  i m        lbs and feel like this treadmill is a good fit      
3238,5.0,                       its one of the great purchases when you cant go to fitness centers due to pandemic  very easy to assemble and operate  took me less than   hours to assemble highly recommend to everyone to buy this and stay fit n healthy while during this pandemic     
3239,4.0,                       i ve been enjoying this treadmill so far  it s fun and easy to use  i ve never tried to fold it and i had it professionally assembled  so i can t comment on those things  my fitness level is beginner  so it works fine for me and meets my expectations      
3240,4.0,                       nice treadmill so far  fairly easy to put together and does the trick for getting a good cardio session in      
3241,4.0,                       we love the nordictrack treadmill  it is very well built and easy to use only thing after we had it all set up and using it  was we had to adjust the running belt because it kept moving  minor adjustment and works fine      
3242,1.0,                       parts came broke  and the delivery time take forever  assembly take hours     
3243,5.0,                       assembly was kind of hard    person job  overall the treadmill console is basically a tablet and works great  very advance     
3244,5.0,                       the treadmill is very easy to use and pretty quiet  wish i would have gotten it sooner      
3245,5.0,                       works great  easy to use      
3246,5.0,                       great mid priced treadmill for the beginner to moderate user   easy to assemble      
3247,5.0,                       the package showed up i damaged but when i looked at the assembly i chickened out and paid to have it put together probably overreacted  but it is up and running perfectly      
3248,5.0,                       i love how easy it is to use  i just jump on everyday and start running  normally  i d drive to the gym  x week  with my new machine  i won t be needing to renew my gym membership after businesses start opening  not only convenient  but i m getting in a lot more exercising      
3249,4.0,                       my wife and i purchased this about two months before the covid lockdown and it has been wonderful to have a reliable machine in the house   we use it     times per week   we each put about     miles per run and it offers the speed  incline and features we need      
3250,5.0,                       love it  a little noisy but doesn t bother me  so much easier to workout at home instead of driving to gym     
3251,5.0,                       i use mine to  walk  usually around     for   to   miles   or   days a week  i don t use the incline and i don t use ifit  so i couldn t tell you about running or hard work outs  just that it works perfect for what i needed  it for         
3252,5.0,                       instructions are not      clear  but easy to assemble  so far working great and good quality      
3253,5.0,                       i ve been using the treadmill since january and it s worth penny  i run everyday and have had zero issues  the plastic film that covers the buttons have kind of bubbled on the most commonly used ones but it doesn t bother me      
3254,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  i ve had it for two weeks and have only put about    miles on it so far  but i really like it so far   i like the suspension of the track and i love the ifit option   it really helps me train and i really enjoy the different options it gives you   my only regret is not going with a bigger screen   we only have the   inch screen  and it is just too small      
3255,1.0,                       this product arrived so incredibly damaged   box was destroyed  as was the treadmill   refused to accept the item from the truck  so disappointed      
3256,5.0,                       happy with quality     
3257,5.0,                       so happy we bought this treadmill   we had one years ago that was like working out on cement   this one cushion so comfortable love the screen so much quieter than old one  perfect for our family      
3258,5.0,                       i purchased this treadmill to have a machine that i could use for walking   running in my garage   it was easy to assemble and is super sturdy   i use it nearly everyday and have been very pleased with its versatility   highly recommend if you are looking for an affordable treadmill      
3259,5.0,                       great product  just a little too much plastic in the front of the track   the plastic in the front of the track makes running difficult when getting used to this treadmill      
3260,4.0,                       the treadmill is great as i use it for running   the addition of ifit is an extra added bonus   i had no idea how big this thing was and putting it together took me two days but assembly was easy   it takes a little effort to fold     
3261,5.0,                       this treadmill makes almost no noise and runs very smoothly  my whole family uses it and finds it excellent  i will recommend highly      
3262,5.0,                       i bought this treadmill as a gift for my daughter  she loves it uses it all the time  convenient and quiet      
3263,4.0,                       the brand name and the quality worth the money spent on this treadmill  the amazon delivery team was on time and worked professionally      
3264,5.0,                       this machines works super well  i recommend it to any one  i am a runner and it s very sturdy and balancex      
3265,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          love my treadmill  the only thing is the screen buttons are hard to pushed and i have to push on them really hard in order to start the machine   my buddy loves working out with me  lol      
3266,5.0,                       pleasantly surprised about how sturdy it is  it works great and you don t need to pay any membership as i read in other reviews  the length of the band is great for tall people  i don t miss the gym thanks to this treadmill     
3267,5.0,                       bought this recently for the family and everyone loves it  took a little while to assemble but overall it s working great and does the job  sturdy and wide enough      
3268,5.0,                       a sturdy treadmill with a     display and a great price makes this treadmill so popular  the material quality is very good  one year of free ifit family subscription is an added bonus  my wife and i love this treadmill  it is easy to fold and unfold  highly recommended      
3269,5.0,                       this treadmill was very easy to assemble   i thought it was going to be hard   i love it      
3270,1.0,                       i bought this product thinking i was getting a nice treadmill for my at home gym  little did i know you need to buy a    dollar a month subscription to use the treadmill  i will be returning  gym memberships aren t even this much      
3271,1.0,                       worst thing you can get  find another seller because this one is strictly for use of the  ifit   something you have to buy   i wish i could send mine back but i can t at this point  find something else non ifit dependent and not on amazon     
3272,5.0,                       i have used  other treadmills before  but this is the best  quiet  easy to fold for storage  and easy to use   makes working out enjoyable and hassle free      
3273,5.0,                       i ve had this treadmill for about   months now and it is still working well  it is pretty quiet and easy to use and fold up  if you are looking for a good quality treadmill  but relatively inexpensive  i would recommend this one      
3274,5.0,                       easy to set up and works great  getting the results i want using it      
3275,5.0,                       just a heads up you have to use the myfit app in order for it to work  the app has work outs that will help if you re starting out      
3276,1.0,                       ordered the product bundle with a   year subscription of ifit and the treadmill   this treadmill will not work with ifit without a module that plugs into the treadmill   the activation code is useless without it   amazon just wants to point fingers at ifit   completely baffled why amazon would sell a bundle that will not work as sold      
3277,5.0,                       putting together was rough but it s a tremendous treadmill for the price  sturdy  quiet  lot of features      
3278,4.0,                       we ve had it for a few months and it seems to work great  no complaints  it s not the fanciest  but it gets the job done      
3279,5.0,                       very impressed how easy it was to put together and how i can fold it and have it out of the way when i am done running  so far i haven t had any issues  i also love that a year membership was included with this treadmill  definitely recommend      
3280,5.0,                       great treadmill in times of covid  the delivery was fast for an apartment  just put a mat under it once assembled  used thumbtack for assembly  so far no issues  i ve been using it for interval running and walking in manual mode  incline works wonderfully      
3281,5.0,                       great machine   i love it     
3282,5.0,                       absolutely love this   having the training videos has taken someone who hates exercise to someone who wakes up early now and is excited to get on the treadmill  would definitely recommend  set up was pretty easy  did it by myself  definitely would help to have another person at some points      
3283,5.0,                       easy to fold relatively easy to assemble excellent product and my girlfriend loves it      
3284,5.0,                       easy to put together   i did bypass the ifit option via other advice   love the way it unfolds slowly to avoid injury   we have had it for   months now and getting lots of usage      
3285,5.0,                       i love my new nordictrack treadmill  i was worried about having to put it together but the directions were clear  no issues at all  the run is smooth and i love the ifit membership that came with it  it makes you feel like you re not running and before you know it  you work out is complete      
3286,5.0,                       nice treadmill   very heavy      
3287,5.0,                       works great     
3288,5.0,                       it was a major pain to assemble  and the guy who was supposed to bring it into the room  said he couldnt get it up one stair by himself  understandable  so we had to figure out how to get it in the house ourselves  is a very nice machine once you figure out how to put it together      
3289,5.0,                       so far so good      
3290,5.0,                       it works as expected     
3291,5.0,                       great treadmill for a home workout  if you dont care about the inbuilt screen and if you use your device for entertainment or ifit  this is the treadmill for you  this one fit into my budget  easy to assemble once you read all the instructions  gets the job done once installed      
3292,5.0,                       full size treadmill   excellent quality   modest price   i am very happy with it i did hire someone  through amazon  to set it up for me   he did a great job     
3293,5.0,                       walking   days a week  an hour each day      mph      incline  burning     calories every day   keeps this    yr old man fit      
3294,5.0,                       we really like this  especially paired with the ifit program      
3295,5.0,                       it s perfect for me  using it a lot now due to the cold weather   my wife and daughter are also using it and no problems   i ll follow up in the spring to see if this is still the case      
3296,4.0,                       love this treadmill   i am a just a walker but it is sturdy   better than some hotel gym equipment      
3297,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          display stopped working within a couple of months  waiting for the circuit board to be replaced  they wont send technician to replace the circuit board and asking me to replace it  kind of strange  let us see how it goes      
3298,5.0,                       so love this     
3299,5.0,                       works great      
3300,5.0,                       treadmill works well and fairly easy to assemble with two people  using the treadmill beats walking outside in the hot humid day      
3301,4.0,                       i like almost everything about the treadmill except the belt keeps moving to the left side      
3302,4.0,                       i did not like that i was forced to sign up for ifit in order to activate the tredmil  i do like the tredmill overall though  especially since it can operate without ifit  following initial setup       
3303,5.0,                       excellent investment in my health      
3304,5.0,                       great machine  best purchase ever  it took about an hour to assemble  but it was easy task  very steady machine and long and wide enough to run and jog  i jog     days a week for an hour and the machine works perfectly      
3305,5.0,                       wonderful product  the whole family uses it  very sturdy  would buy again      
3306,1.0,                       it arrived with a crack  it s too heavy to deal with the return and covid    situation  i don t know what i should do now     
3307,5.0,                       it runs smooth  folding and unfolding setup is nice  all the information you need is on the display at one time  incline and and speed controls are easy to adjust  just a nice machine for the price  i am very happy with the purchase      
3308,5.0,                       we got this item and put it together   its missing the piece needed to fold it in an upright position  so far ifit and the treadmill are great let s see if they return my request for the missing piece connie     
3309,5.0,                       love the treadmill  easy set up and a smooth run  i m a big guy about      incline works very well      
3310,4.0,                       i love the features  i e   display panel is easy to read  and treadmill is extremely simple to operate   really pleased with this product      
3311,1.0,                       it s frustrating that you cannot just turn on treadmill and use it   they try to get your credit card information  and force you to sign up online for virtual running classes      
3312,5.0,                       i love this machine  i love that it is ifit equipped and can t say enough about it  i am just starting my running and this is perfect  thanks nordic track        
3313,5.0,                       very happy with my purchase  it s a bit bigger than i anticipated but it s a very nice treadmill      
3314,3.0,                       this thing is sooooo slow to start up  the screen freezes a lot too  i wouldnt recommend     
3315,5.0,                       made myself a delicious cocktail and put together my nordic track in about   hours  the challenges are it s super heavy and not exactly a one man job  the pros are that it s worked perfectly since i put it together and i ve had no trouble thus far  fingers crossed it will continue to work      
3316,5.0,                       overall i m thrilled with this purchase  it s very solid and intuitive to use  would highly recommend it if i had to find something  my only beef is that the speedometer reads a good bit slower than the actual speed  looking for a way to correct this      
3317,4.0,                       we have had this for awhile now and grtting good use out of it  we also have a s    bike  live the ifit app and how it adjusts the speed and height  wish would have invested in a bigger screen but using an ipad so it works well      
3318,4.0,                       i like the treadmill for walking  everything else on it is a toatl mystery      
3319,4.0,                       pros    good treadmill with this price range   different trainer workout by ifit boosts your workoutcons    treadmill gets power off  drip off   whenever you pause and resume your workout  this is bit annoying    feel bit discomfort with widenfront panel  getting disturbed with walking fast      
3320,5.0,                       very easy to us machine  holding up great and easy on the knees  great price for the flexibility of incline and speed  would like if it offered more built in training options  there s not really much in the way of interval training  but still overall no regrets      
3321,5.0,                       i love this thread mill  my husband got this as a gift  as i learn more about its function  i love it more  it s easy to operate      
3322,3.0,                       big  heavy a little loud  just got it  so we ll see   the pcice dropped a few days after purchase        and amazon refuses to do a price adjustment which is ridiculous  so try to buy it on sale      
3323,5.0,                       easy to assemble and a great value for the money      
3324,5.0,                       great treadmill for running  slightly under powered but good enough for slower distance training      
3325,5.0,                       was shopping for a long time reading lots of reviews and finally placed the order with high hopes  so far its great and i am very pleased with the purchase      
3326,5.0,                       belco pro installation team is awesome  the treadmill was installed perfectly and we received the guidance to activate it through ifit which we could not figure out initially  could not be happier with installation  great service  very fast and friendly staff      
3327,1.0,                       used it twice and the incline stopped working and won t go down      
3328,5.0,                       we love our new treadmill   my wife and i use it daily and we especially enjoy the ifit application that syncs perfectly with the treadmill   especially now it s wonderful to have our own treadmill and we re walking running around the world with the i fit app      
3329,5.0,                       it was exciting putting it all together  it was so easy to assemble  it truly is great for working out  easy to fit into a corner  easy to fold and tuck it away for another day  definitely recommend this treadmill  don t believe me buy it and see for yourself      
3330,5.0,                       i really enjoy this machine  i have been on it every day since april   th  i used my last treadmill until it died  i tried an elliptical but i did not like that  i have put well over     miles on this treadmill  it is also keeping me sane with our current situation with this virus      
3331,5.0,                       this is a very good product for the price  pretty solid  just make sure to watch a installation video if you are doing self installation  there are two things that you have to know ahead to make the installation go smoothly      
3332,1.0,                       can t use the machine  since it was delivered with a missing part and not able to get that part from the source although called them many times      
3333,4.0,                       best shipping and so far an awesome machine     
3334,5.0,                       i am             lbs   treadmill is high quality and the price is right   used   times a week for    minutes for   months    no issues everything works as intended  and treadmill is sturdy and large enough to handle my big body      
3335,5.0,                       this treadmill arrived exactly on the day it was promised and packaging in good condition  setup was easy  i did it single handedly until the last step where i did have some help  i use it every day and couldn t be happier with the model and the ifit program      
3336,1.0,                       waste   hours to unpack and assemble  then found out a bolt hole on the left arm has bad thread  so all my effort wasted  because i m not able to continue  i sincerely hope they could do a better qc job  i can t give a comprehensive review since i simply can t use it      
3337,1.0,                       found empty bag of chips inside the boxalso hard to assemble as tools mot provided to tighten the bolts     
3338,4.0,                       this is a great place to hang towels or other items like winter coats     
3339,5.0,                       other than the shipping box looking not entirely promising for the product to be in good shape  very easy to assemble  folds nicely  looks great      
3340,5.0,                       it was easy to order  came quickly  easy to put together  and works fantastic  i love the ifit component  but i also use it manually  it s sturdy  quiet  and a generally nice looking piece of equipment  i am very happy with it      
3341,4.0,                       good treadmill for the pricemissing and incorrect parts shipped

3343,5.0,                       i love nordictrack products  this treadmill is amazing   i so glad i  purchased it      
3344,5.0,                       great unit  well built too   good thing because the cardboard box packaging was badly broken  too heavy to be shipped in cardboard      
3345,5.0,                       amazing product  you won t regret your purchase if you buy this treadmill  you need   people to assemble and the directions were easy to follow      
3346,5.0,                       i did not expect to purchase a fitness app in  order to use the treadmill   i love the screen  and built in heart and pulse monitor      
3347,1.0,                       you have to unlocked if wanna used without a subscription   no instruction to how unlocked it and i call the customer service they never answer  so i return it     
3348,5.0,                       great treadmill for the price  i m          lbs  and i have no problem running on the treadmill with the long belt and cushion      
3349,5.0,                       my husband loves this treadmill  does not make too much noise     
3350,5.0,                       very easy to use and love the videos  set up was easy and it folds up nice so it doesn t take up too much space when we aren t using it      
3351,4.0,                       my wife and i walk run on this thing regularly  my only complaint is my gait is wider than most so i end up with my foot on the side sometimes      
3352,5.0,                       great  exactly what we wanted      
3353,1.0,                       it came to me broken  took   weeks to get a new motor then had to install it myself despite the parts and labor warranty  i had a great nordic track treadmill before  not impressed with this one      
3354,4.0,                       excellent workout  i would have liked to keep the ifit but for the price      
3355,5.0,                       the nordictrack t   s is a great treadmill  it s incline is only to    but that s enough for a hard incline workout  the machine is quiet and smooth  the delivery process was fast  husband and i assembled in a couple of hours  loving the ifit that comes with it free for a year      
3356,5.0,                       great for working out     
3357,1.0,                       i bought this treadmill to work with the ifit app   the app doesn t work   you can t get anyone in service to answer the phone   complete con job      
3358,5.0,                       liked it s quiet running  and smooth transitions      
3359,5.0,                       really a sturdy treadmill and seems to encourage active exercising by user for maxing their workouts   it is heavier than previous machine i owned but i think it will last  what do you expect from nordictrack      
3360,5.0,                       great treadmill  works great      
3361,5.0,                       i love my new treadmill  i needed a way to keep up my winter running and this is it  great machine for the price  and i love the ifit membership  i am having a great time running around the world with various trainers  so happy        
3362,5.0,                       i  would like to suggest everyone to buy assembly with this it took us so long to assemble  very nice great treadmill with all inclusive features      
3363,3.0,                       the product itself is good but the assembly instruction is very hard to follow   i would suggest to pay for the assembly and no assemble by yourself   the company s service is very good      
3364,5.0,                       nice treadmill  however i think it could be a little longer in the front     
3365,1.0,                       of course i get it yesterday  simple assembly  and then it doesn t work   i have a flashing red light on the circuit board that sometimes also stays steady and i can t manually move the walking belt with my hands   trash product if i ve ever seen one        
3366,5.0,                       i m so glad i purchased the nordictrack   it folds easy and i am able to move it where i need to   it was easy to assemble probably a   star if i had another set of hands but i was able to assemble this one by myself   i ve used it for multiple months with no issues   i would definitely purchase a nordictrack again      
3367,5.0,                       overall  a great treadmill   comes with a subscription to ifit with lots of workouts   most of the workouts are not as challenging as i like but i can put it in manual mode   i wish there was more incline but it works well and is a solid treadmill      
3368,5.0,                       works great for me since i m unable to leave the house to exercise  baby sitting grandchildren      using the nordic trak i find that i am actually exercising more and burning more calories      
3369,1.0,                       this supposed new in the box nordictrack treadmill was shipped without assembly manuals nor any assembly hardware     
3370,5.0,                       like the one touch speed and inclines  easy fold and hydraulic assist is smooth  very happy so far      
3371,1.0,                       just so everyone knows  you pay        dollars for this treadmill and then to get it to start you have to give them a credit card  what a bunch of bull      
3372,5.0,                       great treadmill   sturdy and quiet  feels just like a commercial treadmill from the gym  bought this when it was on sale during black friday weekend   delivery was fast and it was pretty easy to assemble   taking everything out from the box was pain in the ass though haha      
3373,5.0,                       very nice and rugged treadmill  medium noise level  at higher speeds  a good buy  nice dash board  with a blue tooth  it would have been classy      
3374,5.0,                       love this treadmill well worth the money     
3375,5.0,                       purchase this as a gift for the wifey and she loves it  uses it every day      
3376,5.0,                       have had it for   months  run on it a few times a week  belt makes a noise but everything has been working fine      
3377,5.0,                       love this treadmill      
3378,4.0,                       i bought this on prime day about   months  it has worked great for my needs      mph and about     incline  it goes to    or      i don t use coach      
3379,5.0,                       i love this treadmill      
3380,5.0,                       great product  solid performance      
3381,5.0,                       this treadmill works great  the only drawback is the heart rate monitor does not work properly  it was easy to put together  i would suggest you use a cordless drill and a ratchet set to put together much easier that way      
3382,5.0,                       easy and quick assembly fold up is easy due to the locking strut opening up or lowering is amazing because the strut also acts like a shock absorber that catches the deck and slowly lowers it  no more straining or dropping      
3383,5.0,                       i love it   easy to use      
3384,5.0,                       works and looks great     
3385,4.0,                       was not easy to assemble in that it was difficult to get everything aligned so that screws would fit easily     
3386,4.0,                       product is as described and works great  package is very heavy and make sure you get delivery to specific room in home option selected  it took me a day to assemble but it works well and going great as of now      
3387,5.0,                       this is a very nice treadmill   it is very sturdy and is quitter than my old nordic track it went together with no problems   the i fit was easy to override      
3388,1.0,                       too complicated     
3389,5.0,                       i bought this for extreme temps outside only but i use it all the time now      
3390,5.0,                       love it   definitely a good buy       
3391,5.0,                       i am totally in love with this purchase  easy assembly and a comfortable grip  very easy and intuitive to use and for short and long run  no noise and smooth use      
3392,5.0,                       so far it s really good and built for precision     
3393,5.0,                       great treadmill for the price  especially if you do not need the built in screen   has a good lowering mechanism so you don t have to worry about it slamming down on anything      
3394,5.0,                       this is the second nordic track treadmill i ve owned   it was easy to assemble and easier to fold than my last one   the controls are a lot better as well   i give it   stars      
3395,5.0,                       i love my treadmill  quality is great  has many workouts available on it      
3396,4.0,                       this treadmill seems very sturdy and built well  it gives my wife and i everything we need to keep from having to do our daily  k in the heat  we really like the way it folds up and is easy to lower      
3397,1.0,                       free assembly was part of the purchase but evidently there was a mix up and assembly wasn t available till the following week  i put it together myself  be careful with this one  make sure you ask about assembly before purchase even though it is offered as free v     
3398,5.0,                       when taking off the plastic  which you have to  it took off the coating also   box was damaged but item was okay      
3399,5.0,                       i love my nordictrack  i bought to use during bad weather but find myself using it all the time  i have even started using in the mornings before work  i have not tested the folding feature as it stays upright in my home gym  overall very pleased with this purchase       
3400,5.0,                       good purchase for those not willing to drop   k  on a new treadmill   the only difference is the screen is smaller and not as interactive   the travesty is not being able to download the ifit app on the kindle  otherwise it s great      
3401,2.0,                       many factory defects  weld spillage in screw holes made screws almost impossible to screw some screw heads were abnormal shaped defective  the sects made assembly very difficult  poor welding  almost returned due to factory defects      
3402,5.0,                       i have had this for a month and i use it every day  i saw on some of the reviews that it buffers to much  i found that if you do the three minute warm up before each workout it doesn t buffer  i love this treadmill  not the easiest to put together but well worth it      
3403,5.0,                       love this treadmill  purchased ifit  as a runner never thought i needed this  but the motivation and easy workouts make running and walking fun      
3404,5.0,                       when i ordered this treadmill from amazon  they let me choose the delivery date and time slot   everything went as planned   they called me the day before delivery and then about half an hour before delivery  and they were right on time   two men delivered it and they put it in my office exactly where i asked  so delivery was great   and the package was in pristine condition my husband put this together in one afternoon   he only occasionally asked someone to hold this or that  but it s pretty much a one man job   you have to know it must have been easy  because he s not one with mechanical aptitude   instruction sheets tend to fluster him  but he had no trouble with this machine this is set to be my husband s treadmill   he s not interested in the bells and whistles   he just wants to run   his only complaint is that the display does not show time and distance together   it toggles back and forth constantly i like the treadmill because this sits in my office and it s not as loud as some of the other treadmills we ve had here in the past   yes  i ve walked on it  too  running isn t for me    i don t care to use the ifit app or anything like that  so i can t tell you how that goes  but the treadmill runs fine   the belt doesn t slip and there s plenty of cushioning with each step      
3405,4.0,                       it is pretty simple and that is fine with me  didn t care for the ifit membership  directions for assembly were a little tricky  but we figured it out   if you just want a tread mill that you can get on and do your own thing this could be for you      
3406,4.0,                       cons  the calorie counter is soooo wrong  it reads more than double what you actually burn  when you increase the incline  the top of the treadmill doesn t move up so it s hard to hold on if you re used to that  the preinstalled programs suck pros  everything else is great  i paid to have it put together  so i can t speak to that part of it      
3407,5.0,                       had nordic track previously    years moved several times  still worked great this one is even better     
3408,1.0,                       in order to get this working  you need a subscription to fitbit which i refuse to do  so our new treadmill is sitting since we got it put together and really kick myself for buying it  if it wasn t so big and i could return it  i would      
3409,5.0,                       i love this treadmill   works great and ifit feature is great  makes workouts much more fun  definitely recommend  need   people to put to together and is heavy  but worth it in the end      
3410,1.0,                       i purchased this product in mar     and register the product the company site  but  i didn t use much until recently  and latelyi used the this product lightly but regularly       min every morning  for last   month and  i recently noticed regular noise while i was running   and  i inspected the product  and found the knobs under the cover that screws can be tighten against were all broken but one   i believed  the  loose cover made noise  however  even without cover  the noise continued  with further inspection  i found the the plastic cover behind the motor was cracked as well imagine how uncomfortable it will be to make the cracking sound under you while running  i stopped running because of the noise well  i submitted the support request on their designated site  but no response   i called their customer service on friday         only receiving the message  no agent is available for the training for the better service    it sounds joking  not durable product  no customer support please do not even consider the product      
3411,4.0,                       instructions could have been clearer during assembly  need   people to assemble      
3412,5.0,                       i find the plastic piece at the front of the track too far back  it is not comfortable for me to hold the heart monitor and walk simultaneously   i need to move my hands about   inches back to the middle of the side rails      
3413,5.0,                       awesome treadmill  it is just right for my husband and i for running on a daily basis  we re happy we spent a little more for the quality product we got      
3414,5.0,                       we love our new nordictrack t series treadmill  it s well built we use it everyday for running and it s so confortable on your knees since it has shock absorbers on it  for anyone looking for a treadmill hands down buy a nordic track      
3415,1.0,                       i m disappointed with this product  the arm rest was defective  i am still waiting for it to be replaced  will take another   weeks since    other people are waiting for this same part  thus  i have not even been able to assemble this treadmill      
3416,4.0,                       the treadmill works as advertised  it seems sturdy and was pretty easy to put together  you will need help  it is heavy  the only thing i don t like is the requirement to sign up for ifit in order too start it up and use it  if that wasn t required i would give it   stars after   month of use i cancelled the service but if i forgot it would have started to cost me and i don t like that      
3417,5.0,                       love this treadmill  so easy to fold and unfold  and the ifit app make it fun to use      
3418,1.0,                       treadmill plastic was broken on the side posing a safety hazard  when you are getting on off the treadmill on the side boards the plastic will slide off  as will you    need to figure out who to contact to address      
3419,5.0,                       it works great  i was not happy the foot of the treadmill was cracked when it got here  amazon made it right and we figured out a way to fix it      
3420,1.0,                       the screws for the base are too big for the holes made  cannot put product together to even use   so unless i make adjustments to the holes this product is worthless and now i m out      as i would be expected to pack this up and deliver to a ups store     
3421,5.0,                       it s the bomb           
3422,5.0,                       i like the fold  different inclines  speeds  and quiet motor of this treadmill      
3423,5.0,                       very steady  and works well even after   months of twice daily workouts      
3424,5.0,                       recommended very quiet for using any time  attention to the design details  perfect and easy break down for easy storage while not in use and still ready to go in a flash      
3425,5.0,                       perfect for walking  running  screen is a bit small  but that is the only downside      
3426,2.0,                       the poduct is good and works effectively  however  the plastic structure on the display panel was broken  i looked if that was broken as part of delivery but i could not find any plastic pieces as well  looks like the damaged piece was shipped     
3427,5.0,                       love this compact treadmill      
3428,1.0,                       total garbage  the display almost never works  i guess i ll have to get it serviced but am dreading the hassle and have maybe used it    times      
3429,5.0,                       i am very pleased with this product  for home use  it is of excellent quality  it wasn t difficult to assemble  just a little time consuming but instructions were easy to follow  great value  i would highly recommend this item      
3430,4.0,                       keeps me fit        
3431,5.0,                       love it     
3432,5.0,                       great and easy to set up treadmill  awesome value  i love it      
3433,5.0,                       quiet  easy to use  love this treadmill  shipping sucked  assuming because i live in a rural area  but it took almost   weeks to receive     
3434,5.0,                       like it all     
3435,5.0,                       its sturdy and wasy to use      
3436,4.0,                       very happy with my purchase  great treadmill for a great price  my only complaint is the assembly and instructions were extremely difficult to follow  definitely a two person job      
3437,5.0,                       needed a new treadmill since gyms were closed due to pandemic  great price for this treadmill  and it has all the same features as ones that cost much more  my wife and i use it daily and love it      
3438,5.0,                       i really like this treadmill   i have used many treadmills over the years and this one is by far the best i have used      
3439,4.0,                       great purchase    shipping company is garbage     
3440,3.0,                       not bad  but you get what you pay for  only issue is the track  at low speeds  when you step on the track  it hesitates      
3441,5.0,                       great price and it works well      
3442,4.0,                       i ve had my treadmill for   months now  i do love it  it came with a pretty damaged box which was the evident cause of a crack in a non functional piece  only there for looks   that same plastic piece that was cracked is apparently also put on via   sided tape and it often pops up on one side   this doesn t affect the function of the treadmill but it does get on my nerves  apparently not enough to simply apply another piece though  i opted to leave it alone  the damage   so i can t speak to customer service  my husband put it together in roughly an hour but he s blessed with a bright mind and alot of common sense  i did have to help hold some heavy parts while he bolted them together  that said   it s a   person job to put it together   it is louder than i would like   my husband can t sleep in the next room while i m on it  i don t have any trouble hearing my show or music which i stream on my tablet   that leads me to mention the terrible speakers  they are just that    terrible honestly   they are absolutely shameful  i will never make any attempt to use them again   if that s an important feature to you  keep looking  this is not the treadmill for you   it serves no function here  max volume is not even remotely audible to any degree of clarity while the treadmill is running  even at a slow pace   this is  in my opinion   the biggest negative on this treadmill   back to the positive    i walk and run and the transition between speeds is both easy and smooth   the incline is fantastic albeit slow  there are lots of programs but i m a simple girl but a bit of a control freak so i tend to stay in manual mode   the machine is moveable with its   wheels but it s very large   very heavy   and quite cumbersome to move in and out of rooms  it is quite easy  however  to lift it and lower it for the space saving feature  the price was great for the features  and at the end of the day   i get my cardio in every day in the comfort of my home and it didn t break the bank   all in all  i m satisfied with the purchase   good luck to you      
3443,4.0,                       i absolutely love my treadmill   it is perfect for running in it daily and the ifit program has been amazing   it motivates me every day      
3444,5.0,                       purchased on sale   works great   a little loud at higher speeds and inclines   the whole family is enjoying the treadmill      
3445,1.0,                       the console gave out after   years     dollars to replace counting tech visit  part replacement  installation junk      
3446,5.0,                       so far i m very happy  time will tell if this review holds up as i ve only had it for a couple of days  the package and parts were not damaged as reported by other reviewers which came as a great relief      
3447,5.0,                       value buy     
3448,1.0,                       returning  all of the screws and bolts didn t want to fit right      
3449,5.0,                       very useful and easy to use but came with defects doesnt incline or decline right now  i bought it on sep   th and since then waiting for parts to arrive so they can fix it other than that it looks good to me      
3450,5.0,                       this is a great product for working out in your home gym   the product cam on time and was really easy to setup   took about an hour from the time i unboxed the treadmill until it was setup   i would definitly recommend it      
3451,5.0,                       really enjoying this treadmill  there are many workouts to choose from and go with the pace of the trainer or the machine will allow you to set your own pace  running on the treadmill with a pretty nature trail as my backdrop is one of the best parts of my day      
3452,5.0,                       this treadmill is the best item i ve bought on amazon  not only that the two men that came to put the treadmill together worked together efficiently and on time  they finished before the hour was done and everything was setup perfectly not a screw out of place  thank you       
3453,4.0,                       i love the treadmill but it took almost a month to deliver     
3454,5.0,                       this is a great treadmill for the price  the screen is great  the fan is great   i love the runs and workouts   i set it up by myself  but it would ve been a lot easier with a second person  overall  i m very satisfied with this machine      
3455,5.0,                       we are very happy with the treadmill and using it everyday  performance is awesome  we asked someone to install it and it took about     hours to install the treadmill  very good equipment for the home gym      
3456,5.0,                       this was for my wife who likes a treadmill  she has just started using it but likes it much better than her previous treadmill  we thought the price was very fair and chose it based upon  reviews   in addition  the two men who assembled and took it upstairs were excellent  we are very satisfied      
3457,5.0,                       i love this  makes working out at home so easy     
3458,4.0,                       this treadmill is great  exactly what we needed  it s not too loud  assembly took a little longer than expected  and easy to use  i don t love the preprogrammed workouts which is why i didn t give it   stars  they re not bad  just not what i wanted      
3459,5.0,                       it has not yet been assembled   the deliverers left without our notice  we tried to assemble it to no avail  we are not enjoying the treadmill  can you send someone to come build it up  we need someone pls  or we return it      
3460,4.0,                       all works good  pulled a muscle getting it up the stairs  get some help as it is bulky as well as heavy      
3461,5.0,                       hardest part of the assembly was step   fishing the wire through the upright     
3462,5.0,                       i ordered this for walking at home  i have had it for a little over a month now and i love it  the assembly process was a little time consuming  the instructions were easy to follow for the most part  once assembled the treadmill is easy to move around as needed      
3463,5.0,                       surprised by how great the interactive workouts are  i can be anywhere in the world as the treadmill adjusts height to match the terrain on screen  it seems well built but please get a treadmill mat to protect your floors  definitely a two person build      
3464,5.0,                       absolutely the best investment i ve made in exercise equipment      
3465,5.0,                       i payed to have assembled so can t say how hard it was to put together but if was assembled quickly on the same day it arrived  only thing missing is a drink holder   i should have noticed before i bought it  my oversight      
3466,4.0,                       installation was mostly as documented  except for quite a few screws didn t work  we had to stay with few of the original decoy screws due to this  but  once done  it is working like a breeze      
3467,5.0,                       the machine is a solid purchase  arrived quickly and was not difficult to assemble  seems to be well made and meets all our needs for the equipment that supports a good indoor run  we have been using it for three months now      
3468,5.0,                       wide belt great for a comfortable work out  the treadmill is quite and definitely comparable to any gym treadmill      
3469,5.0,                       great product for great price  i was able to attach a desk tray

3485,1.0,                       most disappointing purchase ever  was factory sealed but missing several parts including a main handrail  bought it in sept and the handrail is still on back order    months later  wrote and called customer service  they haven t offered any resolution or compensation      
3486,1.0,                       dont buy    had someone come put it together and the screen did not work i tried so many times to have someone come look at it or get a new one and nothing  the tredmill works but the screen does not  waste of money

3496,5.0,                       the treadmill has been great  but the delivery company  pilot  left the package on the sidewalk down the stairs from my house  easily    feet from my front porch left me by myself to hulk the thing up   flights of stairs  threw my shoulder out trying to lift the thing alone   they just plopped it on the ground like trash to be collected      
3497,5.0,                       works as advertised     
3498,3.0,                       it makes a loud screaming pitch that i can t seem to fix  still waiting on nordictrack to get back to me  very frustrated about this

3500,5.0,                       treadmill works great  it has incline and has workouts preprogrammed in and with a monthly subscription to add  great for cardio  the only issue is adjusting the belt to the proper tension  but overall a great product      
3501,5.0,                       very pleased w this treadmill  ifit scam is a little annoying  but machine is worth the annoyance

3505,5.0,                       absolutely perfect for the house  very satisfied      
3506,1.0,                       totally a scam  u have to register ifit and be changed     to use this    very disappointed      
3507,5.0,                       got this to upgrade from a gold s gym treadmill that was noisy and kept breaking down  i ve had it for about   weeks and have not a single problem   i use it everyday as does my wife so it gets lots of use   she loves the ifit options   great treadmill      
3508,5.0,                       great treadmill  didn t get enough use out of it      
3509,5.0,                       this is a professional treadmill  better than expected  i m very happy with my purchase and what a great price      
3510,1.0,                       i was on this machine when it suddenly broke down stopped running and i was thrown backwards onto the floor i sent it back for a refund and here it is   weeks later and still no refund       
3511,5.0,                       awesome product use it with ifit personal trainer but so heavey to move     
3512,5.0,                       i didn t realize how big and heavy it was  but i love using it with the ifit app      
3513,5.0,                       good quality equipment and easy to assemble   best with two people   assembly instructions easy to follow and understand  runs quietly and control panel simple and intuitive   once assembled  it operated as expected with no little hick ups to have to deal with  good piece of exercise equipment      
3514,5.0,                       i m going to update this once i have had it for longer  but super happy thus far assembly  it took me a solid hour to put it together  it was simple  but you do need two people  at one point  one person needs to hold up the base while another attaches the piece that allows the treadmill to fold and unfold      
3515,1.0,                       product delivered  next day took   hours to assemble only to discover the mother board disconnected  tablet shelve broken  and screen shattered  hope to have this resolved as quickly as it took to take my payment      
3516,5.0,                       the treadmill runs very nice  i feel it is durable      
3517,5.0,                       better than i thought it would be  fairly easy to assemble  just follow the direction and you ll do fine      
3518,5.0,                       i love my tredmill  it s not too loud and i can choose from several built in workouts when i don t have my own plan  it s so easy to operate and very sturdy  do not try to assemble by yourself  i used the amazon assembly service and it was safe  easy and quick      
3519,4.0,                       box was received damaged  cosmetic damage to machine  called and replacement part was quickly sent out  great for working out  runs smoothly  overall great for the price      
3520,3.0,                       after receiving and completing assembly the incline function doesn t work   i registered the product with nordic track and submitted a request for help   if they can t help i will be return this product  i hope i don t have to figure out how to return it      
3521,5.0,                       easy to use  great workout  no maintenance needed  took a good while to set up lol but love this treadmill     
3522,1.0,                       you can not turn on this product unless you pay a month fee don t buy it          
3523,5.0,                       this is my first treadmill and i must say i really enjoy using it   especially now that i am home   i love all the settings that it has and the capability to customize your own workout  i think i am ready to up the game by adding on the fit subscription that it came with      
3524,5.0,                       the machine itself is great what i didn t like is that you have to sign up for a membership costing so much money every month just to use it if you don t sign up for that membership you can t use your treadmill it remains locked     
3525,5.0,                       pleased with the purchase  enjoying my free year of ifit     
3526,5.0,                       fast shipping  great treadmill  love it      
3527,5.0,                       excellent quality treadmill that i ve been using pretty regularly for the last few weeks   assembly is a bit involved and really will require two people but other than that it is great product   highly recommend      
3528,5.0,                       good treadmill for the money   i m not overly impressed with the one year free ifit   it s not the entire subscription   many items are locked but it s a good overview   the treadmill works great for what i bought it for      
3529,5.0,                       my family and i are impressed by this treadmill   the instruction was easily read  so putting it together was easy the treadmill setting makes it easy to adjust the workout modes   i will recommend this product to anyone

3531,5.0,                       was super easy to assemble  between two people   works great with or without the subscription  it is a bit loud so setup away from people sleeping  doing the job i needed it to do  easy folding      
3532,1.0,                       relatively easy to assemble and store  however  the worst part is activation experience and forced registration to their ifit platform  unless you are looking for a treadmill that comes with extra workouts and fitness tips  i would avoid this brand      
3533,5.0,                       great pricegreat for small place doesn t take to much space

3540,5.0,                       this is a great machine for this price point  i like the wider track than some of the others in the same range  the directions for assembly were clear and easy  not fancy with the interface  but i don t need fancy  very happy with it after months      
3541,5.0,                       love the treadmill and the ifit is awesome

3544,1.0,                       heart rate monitor on t   s is giving incorrect readings  i compared with fitbit and apple watch and it was way off  when i spoke to nordictrack support they said its provided to give you a number not accurate number just a number     
3545,5.0,                       i m very happy with my purchase  the quality is fantastic  which you would expect from norditrack  my husband put it together and had no issues at all      
3546,5.0,                       a      
3547,1.0,                       i ordered and it came damaged  you keep calling the number that is provided in the amazon product info no one picks up the phone  it s so frustrating and also this is not easy to install or lift it s very heavy      
3548,5.0,                       my treadmill is perfect   not too big and not too small  it s sturdy and while i mostly walk on it i can jog on it   the amazon assembly was super convenient too      
3549,5.0,                       it s budget friendly  it has the foldable frame  it comes with one month ifit membership  easy to assemble it has speed and incline   mph and      its great option for someone looking to start workout at home for a modest price      
3550,1.0,                       unit will no operate  nordictrack will no answer phone  fill out work order on line  never respond  i have sent     four requests  even chat does not get a response  will be returning      
3551,1.0,                       followed assembly instructions  all good upto setup     big issue on step    under console rod that goes between the two side handle bars is short in length  such a big manufacturing defect      
3552,3.0,                       i hope you are an expert at putting together a treadmill  when they say free expert assembly they mean you  treadmill is nice but you won t get it assembled  might as well buy it from nordictrack directly      
3553,5.0,                       excellent value for a brand name like nordictrack  very easy to fold up and simple to use  the ifit subscription is easily cancelled if your not interested in the extra trainer      
3554,5.0,                       the best thing i ve ever done for myself     
3555,4.0,                       decent treadmill    need two people to assemble  has basic functions    sound quality is not great      
3556,5.0,                       this is actually my  nd nordic track  i waited almost a week to review it because i wanted to be sure it was working correctly the first one arrived promptly and was assembled correctly however  while the machine worked well and i loved it  the belt kept sliding to one side and it left a fine black dust on everything  my husband readjusted the belt with the tool provided but the next day it went back again  i was afraid the belt was degrading and would eventually break  also every time i used it i had to sweep and dust the room  kudos to amazon  truly an amazing company  one word to them and promptly  the same day  another machine was on it s way and both times the shipping and assembly costs were refunded within hours not days  all through the process  amazon kept in touch to assure me that things were going smoothly and i would be satisfied  and i am  i m not a fitness guru  i m just a senior citizen trying to stay in shape   the extra programs are great but honestly i don t use them  i adjust the speed and incline to my own tolerance not a preset program  best thing is the cushioning  my old treadmill did not have it  feels like you are walking on a cloud     
3557,5.0,                       amazing product   could not be happier   screen is a great size for viewing ifit programs   operates smoothly  folds easily  and keeps you engaged and entertained      
3558,5.0,                       from the moment we assembled our treadmill till today  i am loving it  great guide to assemble and a wonderful free year full of amazing trainers from ifit  very steady  nice sound and screen resolution  i m very pleased with my purchase      
3559,5.0,                       awesome tredmill  great price for a great treadmill  i lost    pounds since i received it a couple months ago  i don t have to go to the gym during these crazy times      
3560,1.0,                       do not buy  save your money and get something that works  the parts that were sent in the package don t even go together  the top screen display is at least     inches too small to fit on the base frame to connect them together      
3561,4.0,                       great treadmill  it does everything i need it to  it only gots to   mph so when my husband got on it he complained about that  assembly was easy but you do need   people for the fold up aspect rod instillation but otherwise i did everything else by myself      
3562,5.0,                       this was easy to assemble  i like that i can fold it up and out of the way  it s sturdy and i really enjoy using it      
3563,5.0,                       great for running  free ifit only includes daily run      
3564,1.0,                       the treadmill has not worked since the day it was delivered   what should i do      
3565,5.0,                       love the product  having trouble sinking the app on  phone and device     
3566,4.0,                       exactly what i expected  works great  although i wish the speakers were bluetooth instead of connecting with an aux cord      
3567,4.0,                       some of the throw away screws were difficult to remove  too tight installation  machine works well and has met my expectations      
3568,5.0,                       we are very happy with our nordictrack product and its working properly      
3569,5.0,                       sturdy and i love it     
3570,5.0,                       i love this machine  it s super easy to use and the screen quality is amazing  super clear picture  in this time of non travel it is so cool to have these trainers and guides to take you all over the world virtually     
3571,5.0,                       it has all the features needed for a home workout      
3572,1.0,                       it was broke when i receive it and no one has fixed it yet  i been in contact with a customer service rep name zachary and he has help at all  very frustrating     i paid too much money for this  to be going though this      
3573,5.0,                       great product and great delivery service      
3574,5.0,                       has worked good had one problem with the incline motor not staying calibrated but when they were contact they sent a new motor right our and so far it seams to have fixed the problem but it maybe to early to really tell      
3575,5.0,                       i ve had this treadmill for a few months now  and it is working out really well  it is much quieter than my old one  it was a really solid deal for a good price      
3576,3.0,                       it feels like it stalls a bit on the lower speeds  it doesn t feel smooth in speeds under     higher speed or incline feels ok      
3577,5.0,                       this treadmill is great  has a lot of different workout programs  has plenty of running room  definitely worth the money  great product from nordictrack     
3578,1.0,                       took a week for it to arrive  when it did  the console was completely busted  could not be used whatsoever  and amazon refused to replace the item      
3579,5.0,                       needed something to stay active over winter with covid still hanging around  this treadmill was easy to assemble and has more features than any of the comparable treadmills i checked out  would buy again      
3580,5.0,                       surpassed my expectations  great machine      
3581,5.0,                       use it everyday  i get great workouts on this machine everyday  holding up very well     
3582,1.0,                       do not buy  motor issue   trips braker right awayhold time for support is over    minuseless    its been almost a month and still i have a useless productgetting it returned     
3583,5.0,                       great piece of machinery      
3584,5.0,                       this machine is amazing     im so happy about this purchase    i m actually motivated to work out and guided along the way with the ifit program       
3585,5.0,                       like the quiet operation  decent display and speakers for mp  player  use it almost every day for walking  plenty of speed and incline      
3586,5.0,                       this machine works great  i do interval workouts  and it changes settings very quickly  if it had a  pause  feature it would be perfect      
3587,5.0,                       runs great  teamed up with my son to easily have this put together in about    minutes      
3588,5.0,                       n t  is the best      
3589,5.0,                       great product but people who are not great at assembly might want to have it assembled  and if need to be carried you will need two people product is not light     
3590,4.0,                       i works just great  the i fit thing is fine if you want to pay a subscription each month which i don t  there are plenty of options for workouts so not a big deal      
3591,5.0,                       great treadmill   just hold the ifit button down for    to    seconds after assembly with the red safety button attached it will come straight on   no membership needed          
3592,5.0,                       works as expected and meets my expectations and more  to get around from signing up if the ifit just hold the ifit blue button until the screen turns on and displays numbers and you are good from there      
3593,5.0,                       i love my treadmill the ifit trainers r great i ve already lost   lbs im so thankful god it my treadmill      
3594,1.0,                       i was so excited about this treadmill because it arrived super fast but then it came with a different size handrail that does not fit this treadmill and have been waiting over a month to receive this part  ridiculous      
3595,5.0,                       worth every penny for the price range i was in  i don t use the app but love the mechanical incline option and the multiple levels of speed and incline      great workout      
3596,1.0,                    no funciona el ifit coach ready   ni las especificaciones son correctas en la informaci n ni el detalle del producto en las fotografias son las que ponen  servicio al cliente ejemplar  servicio de compra deja de desear para una empresa como amazon  fraude se le podria llamar        
3597,5.0,                       nordictrack has an impeccable reputation and it is still in tact with this product  i did not personally assemble this one  but i have in the past  i am thoroughly enjoying my treadmill      
3598,5.0,                       instructions are clear  don t waste your money on assembling  there s a youtube video that guides you  if you get stuck  a two person job mostly  i m a woman and my son barley helped me      
3599,5.0,                       i didn t know what to expect as it s our first home treadmill  it s super quiet  folds up nicely and more than enough for our workouts  definitely recommend      
3600,1.0,                       if i could get it to work then i would be glad to share my experience  so far it has been a nightmare  i will still have to go to gym since my      tred mill doesn t work      
3601,5.0,                       great for the money  been using the heck outta it and zero issues so far        
3602,5.0,                       i was so please with the norditrak    it was not too hard putting it together    but you got be careful it might be a little tricky    but i m pleased      
3603,5.0,                       overall great product for the money on cyber monday  wish it was a bit quieter but couldn t be happier      
3604,5.0,                       took a bit of time to install but definitely was worth it  used   times so far and it seems sturdy for a    lb man  i didn t have the ifit issue everyone else is talking about  set up worked without activating ifit      
3605,1.0,                       came missing a part and nordic track is taking their sweet time sending a replacement going on a month now      for a glorified space taker and paper weight     
3606,5.0,                       good machine  fair price  on time delivery  everything seems to be fine      
3607,1.0,                       extremely hardt to install  noisy  very heavy and big  ifit is a migraine hedache        
3608,1.0,                       the parts are faulty and don t fit together correctly  horrible      
3609,4.0,                       the installer did a job correctly and efficiently   but manufactures start up instructions and registration site did not work    the installer gave me the book and showed on the frt page to start go to a sight that would not function  he followed instructions by the book  don t trust all manuals     
3610,5.0,                       i love the ease of use and the smooth ride throughout my run    a few more weeks and i ll have my beyonce bod

3616,3.0,                       i use it daily and it works well in general  heart sensor doesn t function correctly  but you get a great after sale service to fix any issues  excellent price compering to others

3623,5.0,                       this was a great purchase  i feel like the price was fair for the value of the product  assembly did take some time  but it was well worth it in the end      
3624,1.0,                       love the treadmill  don t like that it quit working in january and  can get no product support   i have contacted them   times  and all they did was sent the part to fix it   service tech will not contact me and nordic track seems to have no answer for me   disgusted      
3625,5.0,                       difficult to assemble by myself  but it s doable  works great  bypassed the ifit nonsense thanks to the previous purchasers instructions

3629,5.0,                    me parece un equipo super bueno  lo unico que no me gusta es esa marca que trae la banda   del resto es todo de calidad  y deberian tener un servicio para armarla         
3630,5.0,                       my wife runs the chicago marathon every year  this is the treadmill she uses to train  we recently moved and it was very easy to disassemble and carry it to put it in the truck and to our new place  great product      
3631,1.0,                       came in pieces  mostly plastic  returned     
3632,5.0,                       i am still in love with this treadmill  the workouts  with their automatically changing pace   elevation  have stayed fresh and keep me coming back for more during the cold winter months      
3633,5.0,                       i ve had the treadmill for about     months now  i am very happy with it   the price was fantastic and the cost to have amazon assemble was reasonable and well worth it      
3634,1.0,                       treadmill arrived damaged   attempted to contact support via email  online chat and phone  was unable to even speak or communicate with a representative   attempting to activate product online to even see if it was operational required a credit card number  and attempting to activate by phone resulted in repeated disconnects after    minute wait times      
3635,5.0,                       definitely need   people to carry and assemble this  good quality and value  the shock observers are great for the knees

3638,5.0,                       love it  good price and great quality     
3639,2.0,                       this is taking over a month now to get delivered   we keep rescheduling with xpo logistics and it keeps getting  lost   very frustrating      
3640,5.0,                       other than trying to get it upstairs it was easy to put together and is great     
3641,5.0,                       i was looking for a good treadmill and i found it  its quite and easy to use  i would recommend this to anyone looking for a treadmill      
3642,5.0,                       love the treadmill plus the ifit program      
3643,5.0,                       when the product arrived  the cover on the front was damaged  after registering the machine  i emailed the company for help  it was so easy to get it replaced  very happy with my machine and the service      
3644,1.0,                       the activation process is a scam  even after i register  there is no place on the website telling me how to activate  i will never buy anything from nordic again  a low tech company trying to mimic high tec      
3645,5.0,                       walk it out     
3646,4.0,                       works well and is heavy duty  electronic displays are a little complicated if you want to use fancy workouts  which i don t    a bargain for the price      
3647,5.0,                       great machine for the money it s just as good as using the machines at planet fitness  i highly recommend i only paid         
3648,2.0,                       the product had come with a missing pulse crossbar  contacted nordictrack and have to wait to receive the item before i can completely assemble      
3649,5.0,                       i was concerned about buying a treadmill on the lower end of prices  but this was a great buy  we have been using it for a couple months now with no issues  i assembled it myself without any difficulty  there are two points where having a second person would help a lot  but if you re handy with ropes you can figure it out      
3650,5.0,                       love the product to workout  assembly was difficult as the instructions were not well written or user friendly  i wish i had paid the fee for the assembly      
3651,5.0,                       the assembly took a few hours  but other than that i love my machine  lots of options for different types of workouts  i have truly enjoyed my machine and would recommend it to all my friends      
3652,5.0,                       great machine  i assembled it with the help of my husband  it is doable but difficult      
3653,1.0,                       can t turn the darn thing on  keeps asking me to activate an if it account  which i did  technology crap      
3654,5.0,                       it was not that hard to assemble it  for one person it took     hrs  also have been using it since   months and looks sturdy  it does not wobble as we run on it like some other machines  i am happy with it      
3655,4.0,                       great value treadmill   excellent for working out   treadmill is reliable  sturdy  and easy to use   if you don t need all the bells and whistles  this is a great product to get your run on without breaking the bank      
3656,5.0,                       it took about    minutes to assemble but i did have help by someone who had put one together before  all the pieces are labeled and requires minimal tools  it s a very good quality treadmill      
3657,5.0,                       it s exactly what i expected   it was delivered as scheduled and placed in the room of my choice   the free assembly is amazing   he put everything together pretty quickly   told me to hold down the button for ifit to disarm it   everything works great   it was delivered one day and assembled the next      
3658,4.0,                       good treadmill especially for the price   you can use it without the subscription   i also purchased a   yr extended warranty just in case but no issues so far      
3659,5.0,                       by far  this is the best purchase i ve made in a long time  it runs smooth  the screen is clear and it easily folds up to take up less space  i put this together pretty quickly and only required help occasionally from my teenager      
3660,1.0,                       this treadmill will not work it s a scam  to get you info and credit card     
3661,4.0,                       great product  easy to use and very convenient if you cant get to the gym or catch the sun while parks are still open  the treadmill is very interactive and challenging  i love the ifit coach and maps  the treadmill elevation moves with the terrain on maps     
3662,4.0,                       likes   easy to use  less noise levels  lots of options for work outsdislikes   installation can take     hours by following instructions     
3663,5.0,                       treadmill seems to work as advertised  everything goes smoothly  we ll see how well it holds up over time  but so far very satisfied      
3664,5.0,                       extremely happy with the product and delivery services super easy to assemble  just follow the directions to the letter  my wife and i put it together in less then a hour

3666,5.0,                       we needed to get in shape as we have gotten older and busier   not finding time for an external gym   especially as one of us works from home  this treadmill was a perfect value so now we jump on it every day      
3667,5.0,                       liked all the features  easy to use   will be using it more as the weather turns colder and will recommend it to friends  thank you      
3668,4.0,                       moderately easy to set up   i actually did it without help despite recommendation for   person setup   i recommend getting a second person   have had no trouble with using   it is my opinion that the speakers don t get loud enough to overcome the noise made from running on it   get a bluetooth capable speaker      
3669,5.0,                       i like the size and durability   at    i feel a great deal more stable on this unit as compared to my previous treadmill      
3670,1.0,                       this product took two days to put together and then did not work   after speaking to tech department and receiving two different parts it still is not working      
3671,4.0,                       totally enjoy capabilities of the product   and especially the ifit training programs   have to also commend customer support and how they promptly and thoroughly responded in every aspect     
3672,1.0,                       the unit we were sold was unable to be assembled  have complained to nordicktrack twice only to be told i need replacement parts that are not available as a result of covid      
3673,5.0,                       it s good for the price  my wife loves it      
3674,5.0,                       i bought this for myself as a christmas present  it was a lot bigger than expected and very sturdy  i love this treadmill it s exactly what i was looking for and the price was great      
3675,5.0,                       everything worked out great        from delivery to set up     thanks amazon    i love the treadmill           
3676,5.0,                       easy to put together  has been great so far  great price for the functionality and quality  display screen is small and options for display are lacking but still great for price point      
3677,2.0,                       incline function does not work and will return it here shortly   do not recommend going through the hassle of assembly just to have the incline not working   move on to next next treadmill manufacturer      
3678,5.0,                       assembled myself and very easy to follow instructions  product is excellent

3680,5.0,                       the instructions were excellent  and it went smoothly   the treadmill works as advertised  and i have no complaints      
3681,1.0,                       it came broken      
3682,1.0,                       you have to sign up for ifit just to activate the treadmill  you have to give them your credit card information and sign up for it   just to simply turn on the treadmill  and then you can t cancel without calling a number and talking to someone what a joke     
3683,4.0,                       love the treadmill  did not like ifit requirements to give credit card info for a service we do not want  finally got the treadmill activated  but our first call got nothing as they were in  training    once activated  loved the treadmill      
3684,5.0,                       as a clydesdale class runner  over     lbs   i was looking for a solid treadmill that would handle my oversized body   this handles my pounding stride with ease   love it      
3685,1.0,                       lemon   very disappointed in the product tread belt kept moving to the right evan after i replaced the bolts   i followed the instructions but it still kept slipping to the right      
3686,5.0,                       this has been a nice treadmill with easy to assemble and works just perfect   highly recommended     
3687,5.0,                       the folding capability is great  the system allows it to unfold at a controllable slow speed  for the price you can t beat the quality  it has speeds and inclines up to    and a nicer cushioned base      
3688,5.0,                       easy to put together  use and become addicted to  combine this with ifit workouts and you can do anything      
3689,5.0,                       it s been almost   months and now and it s been amazing  i almost use it twice a day for walking and light running it s one of the best investments i ve made  took us   hours to set up  was really easy too      
3690,1.0,                       i got thia treadmill and was unable to use  you need to get an account on ifit to unlock  after setting up an account still didn t work  tried to call and they were closed  i m sending this pos back      
3691,5.0,                       treadmill was just as expected works great      
3692,4.0,                       good over a month now since we have been using  it and no problems so far  i would say heart monitor is not the best   cuz i would be running and feeling my heart pounding in my chest  but i grab on to the sensor it would read   bpm  rest of the machine is excellent      
3693,5.0,                       nice entry level tread mill  although it started giving some squeaky sounds after using it for an year     
3694,3.0,                       overall the product is okay  but have noticed the running belts  make sudden pauses fraction of a second  which make me feel that i am going to fall     
3695,4.0,                       read the other reviews about ifit      
3696,2.0,                       trying to get support on the phone was a joke      
3697,4.0,                       nice equipment however it is a little noisy other than that i enjoy using the ifit trial    assembly wasn t bad the removal of packaging was the most work     
3698,5.0,                       nice for walking  i would have given all five stars but the ifit workouts are not motivating  i would rather use my own music and have more options of different trail runs or cardio programmed runs instead of the ifit workouts with a personal trainer      
3699,1.0,                       do not purchase this treadmill  at least from amazon  the unit that i received was defective  the incline feature does not work even after receiving and replacing a new incline motor      
3700,5.0,                       could have hit   star  assembly  but the ifit thing work around is not discussed by seller  if i hadn t read other buyer s reviews  i would have been spoofed into a ifit subscription      
3701,5.0,                       i love how quickly and easy it is to lower the running platform and starting a workout it folds up easy and saves space well  i would defenitly recommend it to anyone      
3702,5.0,                       i love it   great on my knees and i like the ifit  price was really reasonable and i had the free assembly  they delivered to what ever my needs were and it was a pleasant and positive experience      
3703,5.0,                       i love my treadmill  it works really well and it feels like i have my own personal gym that i have always wanted      
3704,5.0,                       this treadmill is excellent for sub    mile per hour or    degree limit   both of which i or my wife will not need to exceed  build  is super solid   easy to put together   wonderful to use       
3705,5.0,                       i put on the delivery to leave it on the front porch  but left it outside my driveway  delivery driver almost left it outside the street  but the product is work great     
3706,5.0,                       i love my treadmill     
3707,5.0,                       easy to maneuver  doesn t take a lot of room in the garage   i find it really easy to change speeds and incline  the price was good for a home workout      
3708,4.0,                       i bought the treadmill a year ago and still working great      
3709,1.0,                       the treadmill trips the circuit breakerit never did on my last treadmilli am not sure if my is defective   or this is by designsorry i bought this treadmill     
3710,1.0,                       not a very good product  if it breaks down   months from the purchase date     
3711,4.0,                       nordic track has a diversity of treadmills to pick from  so i didn t need to buy something with all the bells and whistles that i won t use   it s reliable  easy to use and set up      
3712,2.0,                       too large for home  too noisy front display is unnecessarily big and cumbersome  also  it feels unsteady not solid they also try to force owner to buy special services      
3713,1.0,                       they have this ifit built in  the machine won t work unless you sign up for their membership   i paid for the treadmill and it should work without that membership  very dishonest      
3714,5.0,                       i can t believe i got this for         on a daily deal  immediately after the complimentary expert assembly  i got on for a test run  this machine runs smooth and fairly quiet  we re talking quieter than a vacuum cleaner  probably as loud as an idling newer model automobile  the bells and whistles are all within reach and it appears to be able to withstand my purposes of running to get back into shape  i used to run regularly  now  i plan on jumping on the treadmill to run at regular intervals again  i m confident this machine will take the miles  i also want to add the review of this model on treadmillreviews net is very misleading and unfairly discouraging for runners shopping for this treadmill  that review site states that this machine is not designed for runners  in my estimation  a   time marathon runner and a   time half marathon runner  along with countless other charity runs  they are wrong  the top speed is    mph  that equals a   minute mile  that  in and of itself  is fast enough  to not only compete in an elite marathon event  but it s good enough to win  come on now  you have the presence of mind to say this machine is not designed for runners  i totally disagree  you will be running once the speed gets up to around   mph    i guess the top   speeds are for really fast walkers update  about one month into ownership i experienced a motor failure  this was apparently due to amazon selling an older model  i called nordictrack and was immediately sent a new motor which was fairly easy to install   note  take a picture of the wired connections before taking the old motor out   since then this machine has performed flawlessly now for     months  i am loving the steady runs and my wife and kids hop on to get some exercise as well      
3715,5.0,                       great to use      
3716,5.0,                       great treadmill     
3717,5.0,                       have been using this every day since the purchase  it s quite  has enough elevation and speed degrees to keep your workout interesting      
3718,5.0,                       i love how you can fold the platform for easy storage   it s a great machine  easy to use   grateful for the exercise during the pandemic   lots of features and upgrades   a very high quality machine

3723,2.0,                       came with broke motor cover  after two weeks of use it started making all kind of noise  i m not sure how long it will be functional  i would not recommend it if you run over   mph     
3724,5.0,                       screen too small  too heavy to transport     
3725,4.0,                       easy to use and assemble  only complaint is the software was so out of date it took significant work to get it updated with nordic track  only complaint is it doesn t work at all if the internet is down      
3726,5.0,                       love it   easy to assemble  easy to unfold and fold  my teenager and   year old have been using it during quarantine too  we all really like it in our household      
3727,5.0,                       we finally purchased this for our small home gym  it was a great addition  i love the way it looks and it s easy to use  i do recommend you push the blue ifit button so you don t have to use your credit card to activate      
3728,5.0,                       i like everything about the nordic treadmill it was everything and more that i thought was gonna be a fun nominal machine     
3729,5.0,                       i spent some time deciding between this treadmill and the horizon t     after dealing with horizon s subpar customer service  i am glad i chose nordictrack      
3730,5.0,                       retired my previous treadmill of    years  this is quite the upgrade for us  has some great programs in it and i m really enjoying using it      
3731,4.0,                       a little difficult to assemble too      
3732,5.0,                       it s not a fast assembly but a solid product when done   my sons     and runs on it     
3733,5.0,                       my assembly technician was fast  courteous and tidy  a truly painless and pleasant experience  now  i workout  thank you        
3734,4.0,                       nice machine for that price     
3735,5.0,                       great value for the product   i really like the display and max speed levels on this treadmill   it is heavy  so expect to have at least   people to move it where you need it to be      
3736,5.0,                       alone i got assembly in     hours  easy  no additional tool required  as a treadmill  i like it a lot  is strong and seems as professional  good buy for a price  recommended      
3737,5.0,                       assembly easy enough though very heavy    need   people to lift   assembly needed   people  the track itself is very easy to operate      
3738,5.0,                       some of tge screws were too big for the holes      
3739,4.0,                       i like the treadmill for the most part  it is driven by either your cellphone or ipad in order to work      
3740,1.0,                       i bought this as a christmas gift  the box did have some damage when it arrived  however  not in this area  we went ahead and put it together  but i am highly disappointed with the way this looks  i know a few scratches should not matter  but it does  i would not have purchased this in the store without having received a break on the price  may send this back      
3741,5.0,                       i ve been wanting a treadmill in my home for a while now and the prices have always been out of reach   finally was able to purchase the nordictrack t     and it has been great   have had for over   months now and no issues with it at all   it works great      
3742,1.0,                       the main control panel stopped working after using it five times      
3743,5.0,                       great      
3744,4.0,                       this is a good sturdy treadmill for walking  even brisk walking  i don t need the high tech features that others offer  only improvements would be a larger motor   a cup holder for my water      
3745,3.0,                       installation was extremely hard      
3746,1.0,                       box is damaged with a lot of big holes  damaged left and right trays and missing right and left handrails

3749,4.0,                       assembly was a little complicated but everything else is amazing    it s so user friendly and is so quiet      
3750,5.0,                       it was a challenge to assemble alone but doable  you don t have to sign up for ifit to turn on  hold the  ifit  button down until the machine resets and you ll be good to go      
3751,5.0,                       excellent product  we upgraded from an old t si and this model is very quiet and capable of speedwork   intervals   the amazon delivery and installation was extremely easy to coordinate   very pleased      
3752,5.0,                       quality was great     
3753,5.0,                       i m a treadmill novice  but i bought this based on product reviews and price   two months later and i ve lost    lbs   the ifit programs are great and at     per month  they re well worth it      
3754,5.0,                       bought this for my son as he is a soccer player and is under quarantine  he runs   miles a day  and this machine has been a life saver for him  its well made  and he loves it  highly recommended

3757,5.0,                       we love this piece of equipment especially during the pandemic  it gives us a place to get a good workout when going to the gym has not been an option  good value      
3758,5.0,                       this product has been a wonderful addition   i love how it is easy to fold up when you are done so it takes up less space   i have no regrets   i was in the market for a treadmill to add convenience to my workout   would buy again

3764,1.0,                       product was delivered broken  had to get it replaced which took about an hour on the phone  new product was fine  nothing extraordinary  but was tainted by being broken on delivery      
3765,4.0,                       i really like the treadmill  but am disappointed that the base came damaged cracked  unfortunately i don t have the time to return it to be repaired so i will fix it myself      
3766,5.0,                       so happy with our decision  works great and is so quiet   easy to use     
3767,1.0,                       item arrived in a destroyed box and after putting    percent of it together realized the piece that turns machine on and off was broken off  returning immediately and will not get another     
3768,5.0,                       purchased this treadmill two weeks ago  it took me and my husband about two hours to set up  very quiet machine good for running and i use it typically every day  would recommend for anybody for indoor training      
3769,1.0,                       i bought a used one from amazon warehouse  one of the front leg stubs was broken off and missing  it was screwed in  those screws were snapped off in the base  i tried to buy a new model with the free installation  the system kept giving me trouble with the code  scheduling wouldn t work in the app  so i had to get on my computer to do everything  i ve been very unhappy with this process  i m debating buying the t     for the same price from a competitor  this was for my wife  she was so excited to get this for mother s day and was extremely disappointed when i told her it wouldn t work right  i would have already paid the extra      for a new model from amazon  but the code wouldn t work  i m fed up and totally don t need this      
3770,5.0,                       works great as long as i actually use it  haha

3777,3.0,                       you have to sign up for a free month to get it to run  have to give credit card info  etc   then cancel in less than    days or billed monthly      
3778,4.0,                       easy to assemble with two person     
3779,5.0,                       very well built and fantastic packaging for installation      
3780,4.0,                       the treadmill works great  it easily picks up speed and incline without delay  the only downside is that the fan is not working  but nordictrack is sending me a new replacement console      
3781,5.0,                       it was easy to assemble  from previous experience i had when i used to delivered and assembled this units      
3782,5.0,                       i ve only had this a couple of days but it was fairly easy to assemble  is really good quality and much quieter than my old one while i m running  i m very happy with it      
3783,1.0,                       piece of garbage  before i even used it the welds on the base snapped  wtf

3786,5.0,                    muy buen producto        
3787,5.0,                       i paid to have someone assemble it for me  i like it  i don t have any issues with it      
3788,5.0,                                
3789,5.0,                       after nearly four months of use we still love our nordictrack treadmill  great value  was easy to assemble  i would recommend this for anyone regardless of your fitness level or age      
3790,4.0,                       this was incredibly stressful to assemble  i do not recommend doing it on your own  the first order was damaged and nordictrack was going to take almost   weeks to correct  luckily amazon corrected within   hrs      
3791,5.0,                       it is a great treadmill   it works well and is steady  no shaking      
3792,5.0,                       had it assembled   works great      
3793,5.0,                       i love my nordic track  it has amazing features   easy to use   and it doesn t take up that much space   since i have been using it i have already lost some weight and i couldn t be happier with this product       
3794,1.0,                       received it super late and it broke down in a week     
3795,4.0,                       so far so good   definitely need at least two people if possible for putting it together  runs well  will update      
3796,1.0,                       buyer beware   you cannot use the treadmill bluetooth feature with your phone   if you think you can play your spotify through here you cant  theres also a ridiculous ifit account that you have to set up in order to actually use your       treadmill  dont forget to cancel because ifit will steal your money  absolutely  appalling      
3797,5.0,                       starting to get in better shape and wanted a reliable way to start  i am not a gym rat and this was affordable  use in my house whenever i have some free time  easy enough to put together and the icoach is a tremendous plus     
3798,4.0,                       so the tredmill was kinda hard to set up so if you can get the professional set up do it   you do not need ifit  if you sign up for the free membership keep an eye on it  at the end of the month it will cost you      for a year  if i wanted to pay that i would join a gym      
3799,2.0,                       assembly was not easy considering some of the tools didn t fit      
3800,1.0,                       plastic was cracked  broken when unpacked      
3801,1.0,                       after waiting   days to receive my nordic treadmill  i waited another   days to have it assembled only to find out it had been damaged in the factory  now i have a pile of junk laying in my kitchen floor that resembles a disassembled treadmill  amazon says they will exchange it but no communication as to when      
3802,5.0,                       love it     
3803,3.0,                       pretty much the headline   i m still exploring the various options  and it s working well  but damn the squeaking      
3804,5.0,                       it s been a litthe over    days since i bought this treadmill  so far it seems a grwat peoduct  sturdy and great for walking running  i would recommend      
3805,5.0,                       shipping company was great   product is awesome      
3806,5.0,                       works good     
3807,4.0,                       we love the speakers  space to hold phone or device  great machine but is a bit loud      
3808,5.0,                       hard to assemble for my wife  requires some tools that don t come with it      
3809,5.0,                       works well     
3810,5.0,                       this treadmill works great  i have done some of the programs from ifit and it s awesome that the treadmill automatically changes with the ifit program      
3811,5.0,                       easy to assemble and not bulky     
3812,1.0,                       warning aperantly they read the reviews carefully and they updated the software that trickholding ifit bottom for    sec does not work anymore     
3813,5.0,                       need big space  little noicy  but very good in general     
3814,5.0,                       perfect size  just what i needed  great  quality       
3815,4.0,                       i missed the added     protection that i didn t need or want  went through nordictrack for the ultimate protection  service calls are made to my home      
3816,1.0,                       we were surprised when we opened the box to find that we had to assemble the whole treadmill we don t know hot to get hold of anyone to help assemble this   we will be returning it      
3817,3.0,                       works fine  not a very high incline  the treadmill was delivered with scuff marks  pretty frustrating

3819,5.0,                       very heavey duty treadmill and we ll worth the money       
3820,4.0,                       some of the assembly was unnecessarily difficult given the tools and drilled holes  given the cost of the product  this was disappointing  once assembled  it works great  easy to use      
3821,5.0,                       really like the product  everything works great  we have no problem with it  simple to assemble and easy to fold up  everything is perfect so far for the first   months      
3822,5.0,                       product works great  assembly guy did a great job  haven t had any issues out of the product  im about     lbs i was heavier before we got it   and i run atleast     times a week on the device and my wife walks daily     
3823,5.0,                       used for walking and running  easy to use and fold  directions easy to follow and fairly quick assembly with two people      
3824,3.0,                       overall it isn t bad for the money  but the side hand rails need to be longer  also the heart rate monitor doesn t work

3934,3.0,                       you have to have an app to just be able to do a manual workout  they have failed to put simple controls on the treadmill so you are forced to buy the app that has a monthly bill attached to it

4130,5.0,                       sturdy easy to use   i don t fold up     
4131,5.0,                       easy to put together and use  i use treadmill every day and love it this is my third machine all of them nordic track

4133,5.0,                       wife loves it   says she can t tell the difference between the one at the gym      
4134,5.0,                       i really like this treadmill  great machine  very well built  highly recommend nordic track treadmills     
4135,5.0,                       it is a complex assembly so using amazon assembly service makes life easy      
4136,5.0,                       love the treadmill over all the belt slips a tiny bit at lowest setting but it is great overall      
4137,5.0,                       great for what i need  easy to assemble     
4138,4.0,                       can not connect head set to  aux in  will not  let me hear music are instructor  not even with blue tube  very upset     
4139,1.0,                       the trick others have posted about holding down the key for    seconds did not work   having to register with a subscription service just to use the product i paid for is despicable      
4140,3.0,                       the tredmill is alright but when you are walking the frame itself comes in your way  and also when you increase the speed to run it bounces to much its not steady  i rather spend a couple of more dollars and get a more better quality machine      
4141,4.0,                       it s a good treadmill  my only disappointment is that it s way to noisy and i wish it was a little smaller  takes up too much room      
4142,5.0,                       looks nice and sturdy  shock absorbers seems great makes bit more noise than i expected  but possible because i ve place it in my bedroom overall satisfied     
4143,5.0,                       i m having trouble setting the digital screen   that will come with time      
4144,4.0,                       great treadmill  sturdy and goes to    mph  assembly took a bit longer than expected and definitely needs   people      
4145,5.0,                       great product  gym quality performance      
4146,5.0,                       solid machine  easy to use   so far i love it      
4147,5.0,                       great unit  very quiet and very easy to use      
4148,5.0,                       the treadmill has been great   quiet motor and great workout selection       
4149,5.0,                       great product     
4150,5.0,                       it is exactly what we were looking for  easy to assemble and gets you moving  right size and well build  a good buy for the price we paid     
4151,5.0,                       should run more than i do  hehe  quiet  efficient  safe  cheap  well oiled  easy to maintain  i workout is pretty cool      
4152,2.0,                       noisy   not a smooth walk run     
4153,3.0,                       i m giving it three stars because it performs its primary function   you can run up to    mph and get an  incline up to     whatevers   if you weigh less than     lbs  great  and the price was pretty good  all extra features are garbage the heart rate monitor is absolutely useless  speakers are not loud enough to get any sound across when running above   mph  there s no built in cooling period after a run   this can probably be fixed with a       software upgrade by the manufacturer   calorie counter doesn t take a runner s weight into an account  the dashboard buttons are useless without the ifit subscription  you can still count time  distance  and speed  but that s pretty much it      
4154,3.0,                       there were various scratches on the unit and foot prints on the belt  looked almost like it was a floor model or something      
4155,5.0,                       i looked and looked   finally decided on this one instead of one of the huge commercial expensive units   it is definitely worth the   spent   so far i absolutely love it        
4156,5.0,                       love the controls that jump whole numbers  then the     for incrementalupaans downs  very sturdy   should have bought a long time ago   i especially love the ifit videos      
4157,4.0,                       good treadmill      
4158,5.0,                       the treadmill is great  the assembly was little complex but totally worth it  love working out on this   great purchase      
4159,5.0,                       great treadmill at a great price  folds up easy and doesn t take up a lot of space      
4160,5.0,                       easy to use     
4161,5.0,                       i love this treadmill   it s working perfectly       
4162,1.0,                       machine is ok  the ifit bs is not   to bypass registration  attach red safety button and hold down blue ifit button for about    seconds   this is a fraud waiting to happen  recommend you do not buy     
4163,5.0,                       i like my purchased treadmill from this brand  i am happy to purchase this product again      
4164,4.0,                       gave it   stars only because the pulse rate function doesn t seem to work correctly   other than that it is   stars      
4165,5.0,                       absolutely amazing  so motvating   defintely recommend      
4166,4.0,                       great product  love the hikes in the different parts of the world  really lifelike     
4167,5.0,                       great treadmill with plenty of features for a reasonable price  also loved the home assembly by a professional option      
4168,1.0,                       treadmill came broken  trying figure out how to get the broken piece replaced     
4169,5.0,                       we love our new treadmill   it took a little bit to assemble  but once assembled it is very sturdy and works great

4176,5.0,                       easy to assemble and love the the app best workout machine to have at home to get cardio done      
4177,1.0,                       the screws didn t fit at all  instructions were no help    the frame around motor was cracked      
4178,4.0,                       great product  my family uses it every day multiple times per day  we made a great choice      
4179,4.0,                       used it twice now  much quieter then the last nordictrack treadmill i had  seems sturdier too  my husband said it was not fun to put together

4184,4.0,                       love this treadmill  however  i tend to trip due to the lip at the front of the treadmill      
4185,5.0,                       this is as product is easy to setup and it worth the price for it  it has a great features of connecting the phone to the treadmill

4193,4.0,                       the treadmill itself is wonderful  very easy to use and is super quiet   the ifit portion could use more instructions on how to set up      
4194,5.0,                       part of my exercise routine     
4195,5.0,                       the only problem i have is the track squeaks when i walk at  mpg but doesn t do so when my son runs on it

4199,1.0,                       i m not a fan of this treadmill at all  it takes a lot of getting used to and the stand is wobbly      
4200,5.0,                       so far it has been great with no issues  well worth the price

4243,5.0,                       highly recommend and very satisfied with it  will need two people to put it together      
4244,1.0,                       machine came in broken so had to wait a whole week for a replacement  apperantly a representative forgot to tell the delivery team to pick up the old one when the new one came in  she wrote in the email that they ll do that  and i had to make another call to schedule a pickup  took me about a whole month to do all this  very annoyed      
4245,5.0,                       very sturdy and well made  arrived on time and did as others advised to bypass the ifit activation      
4246,1.0,                       didn t get to use  when arrived box was heavily damaged and treadmill had a tear in the belt  a functional piece of equipment      
4247,5.0,                       does what its supposed to      
4248,4.0,                       would give it a five star rating if the heart rate sensor monitor had a modicum of accuracy  it does not  readings go all over the place whether the treadmill is running or stopped      
4249,1.0,                       it was nowhere near as easy as it says it be  plus it s missing pieces

4253,5.0,                       great treadmill       
4254,2.0,                       box was damaged upon delivery  making it extremely hard to put together due to the fact that the base was smashed in       
4255,5.0,                       i love this  it was easy to assemble but definitely needed   people  just used it for my first workout and it ran very smooth and was super quiet  it is very sturdy   makes me think i m on a treadmill at the gym  well worth the price      
4256,4.0,                       it is a amazing treadmill it takes about    min to put together but a great product

4259,5.0,                       really easy to assemble  great quality      
4260,5.0,                       we love this treadmill  we also contacted customer service for a minor question and they were extremely quick to reply  great experience and product overall      
4261,1.0,                       not a single screw or part align with each other   waste of time  money and energy     
4262,5.0,                       love the treadmill  it s nicer than i expected and works perfectly  the delivery and assembly however were a nightmare  amazon uses outside parties to assemble  unbeknownst to me  i set up the delivery time and date  with three back up times and still i was screwed over until some super awesome sweet guy decided to be kind and help me out on his way home  so  treadmill  great buy  super happy with the purchase  delivery on time  assembly  sucked  until the nice dude came along  thanks  nice dude  you re the best

4266,5.0,                       this is the best treadmill we have ever owned      
4267,1.0,                       when i run at a low speed   even     it makes so much noise my entire house can hear it      
4268,5.0,                       it is a wonderful workout machine  we love it      
4269,5.0,                       great treadmill for the price  my wife and i love it and haven t had any issues      
4270,5.0,                       the treadmill is convenient to use  no issues so far     
4271,5.0,                       the exercise programs that s on the machine are excellent     
4272,5.0,                       i love this treadmill  i love working out in the comfort of my own garage      
4273,5.0,                       comfortable deck to walk on  easy to adjust speed and incline      
4274,5.0,                       the one thing we didn t like about the treadmill is that the arms are too short   when you hold on to the arms  your feet will hit the front of the treadmill   the same goes for holding on to the bars in front      
4275,4.0,                       the instructions warn  it takes two people to assemble  and that is correct   so far we love the unit   funny thing  when i used it  it didn t squeak but when my wife  who weighs     less used it  it did squeak   a call to customer service and the problem was quickly diagnosed and new parts sent   impressive we haven t had it long enough for me to love it  but i do like it      
4276,5.0,                       efficient in performance with nice technology add on  i love it      
4277,3.0,                       the item arrives fast  but the running belt is not parallel  hopefully  it s not a big deal      
4278,5.0,                       great quality for the price   workouts have been great so far  just what i was looking for       
4279,5.0,                       not seeing any problems     
4280,4.0,                       it s difficult to give this treadmill a   star review for one simple reason  ifit  ifit is a horrible program that is confusing and not intuitive in any way  it will fight you at every step  the treadmill is great  excellent quality  but the control panel is a complete joke  several times i have touched the wrong button and messed it up so that if you press the  mph button it goes     mph   and press the  mph button and you get       then after several minutes of trying to reset the unit it will go back to being able to press the  mph and getting  mph   but i still don t know why or how   and i was an it guy      i have had two ifit compatible units now and i will not spend another dime on anything associated with ifit      
4281,5.0,                       love this treadmill  definitely would recommend to anyone      
4282,5.0,                       absolutely love it so far   been in use daily for two months   purchased the assembly services  so we didn t have to do it   that was a wise decision      
4283,4.0,                       it takes some time and patience to put  together  but overall a good product   really heavy   set up where you wan the treadmill placed      
4284,5.0,                       my wife and kids love it  easy to put together within   hours      
4285,5.0,                       dislike no bluetootheasy to assemble in less than    mins     
4286,5.0,                       ifit is great  treadmill is well built  very happy with the purchase

4303,5.0,                       setup is very easy   there is almost perfect for use as daily treadmill   the arms could be a little longer   no problems after   months of daily use      
4304,5.0,                       me and my husband love it       
4305,5.0,                       really enjoy the treadmill  especially with the ifit membership      
4306,5.0,                       awesome for the cost      
4307,3.0,                       good for workout  but very poor assembly instructions and very hard to assemble     
4308,4.0,                       great device   took about an hour to assemble  but it s quite sturdy   one of the screws was a little deformed and i had to drill it a bit to get it to screw in   hence  the four star rating

4324,5.0,                       ease of set up

4571,2.0,                       this treadmill was such a disappointment   we thought we were getting a great deal on the black friday sale  based on the price and reviews of the treadmill   after putting it together  which didn t take too long  the first thing we noticed was that the control panel was much lower than our horizon treadmill we were replacing  the lower height made the view of an ipad or book an uncomfortable distance to read while walking  i m only         our major complaint was the inconsistent speed drag felt while walking at lower than   mph   we called nordictrack and they sent a lube kit which didn t work   my husband also tightened the tork adjustment with no luck so  we packed up the treadmill thinking we got a lemon and asked for a replacement   i do love amazon s return policy   the new treadmill was delivered today with a crack on the front panel   we will return and not try another one      
4572,4.0,                       fairly easy to put together but have yet to receive a contact regarding a question submitted a month ago      
4573,2.0,                       not worth the moneyholding handle bar so low that it is impossible to hold them while working outwould not recommend

4578,5.0,                       walking      
4579,5.0,                       i was happy to see that amazon now offers nordic track products since my experience with them through the years has been great  we are extremely happy with our t     s treadmill and found it the perfect product to help us improve our cardiac and general health  the system was delivered extremely quickly  needed two of us to easily set it up  but was assembled quickly  and it worked immediately  we found that we needed to place a surge protector in our electrical line from the wall to the nordic track to protect from surges and arcs that might trip the breaker  so we acquired an isobar premium surge suppressor and arc  noise filter available from amazon to supply the added protection and as suggested in the manual  great and inexpensive product from amazon  we continue to love nordic track and amazon

4599,4.0,                       nice treadmill     
4600,3.0,                        programs are great squeaks loudly after   weeks of daily running  no apparent solutions offered     
4601,5.0,                       i almost downgraded this machine for one reason   we have to use a package forwarding service because we live out of country  so  it s a bit of a crapshoot to buy things since a product might have a defect  shipping problems  etc  unfortunately  one other reason is when a manufacturer doesn t do a basic package check before a box is sealed and shipped  as was the case for us first the good     the machine is awesome  i did a pretty major search for treadmills w an incline and a few extra features that wouldn t break the bank  this definitely filled the bill   it was great to use my mp  player and have music loud enough to hear  but soft enough not to bring out the wrath of the neighbors  for me  any distraction while walking  such as tv or music  helps  while we haven t yet signed up for ifit  that s next  i have no doubt it will be another bennie   i was surprised at how basic the assembly was  i m totally useless at figuring out putting things together  but even someone as non mechanical as i am could do it  everything was labeled  listed in order  and placed on a sealed piece of cardboard that it made it nearly idiot proof  i say that because there s always that one person       the packing was very well done  a great deal of care and shipping materials were used to protect everything now  the not so good inside the box  there was a yellow sheet for lubrication instructions  it told us what to use  included applicator and lube  and how to do it  well  the sheet was the only thing included  while someone may say that we probably threw them out  nope  hubby broke down the entire package before we began  all parts separated so that we knew what they were  putting the waste aside  etc  etc   then  i went back over all of the packing material a second time before we boxed it all up for the garbage  yes  we really did that since it s too easy to misplace a part if you re not careful  while this is extremely annoying  i finally decided i didn t want to downgrade a   star machine over some packing wonk s one star check off performance      
4602,5.0,                       she wuv s it

4621,5.0,                       hard to assemble     
4622,1.0,                       hard to assemble     
4623,5.0,                       putting it together was something of a pain  delivery wasn t amazing either  the treadmill itself is wonderful  i am over     pounds and the belt doesn t catch

4628,1.0,                       don t buy  they will ship you a defective model that will not work  electric wiring is not working  when you call them  they will conveniently ship you the wire to re attach with a step by step detailed video  shocking     so it s a problem they consistently have  replacing wire is not easy    it s a very long process  they were very quick to tell us on the phone that we may have  pinched  the wire  that s why it s not working  we just got done replacing the electrical wiring that required us to in install the whole thing and it s still not working  it s a piece of crap  i will be returning this and gettin something else  don t waste your money

4686,3.0,                       we have been shopping around for treadmills and shocked by the prices  so on cyber monday when we see this treadmill for       we smiled at our good fortune and ordered it  still in process of building it but we were disappointed when we removed the track part and found this crack  hopefully that s our only problem

4688,4.0,                       i love love love this treadmill   it does have a squeeking noise at  mph that i am going to look into however other then that so far so good   i love the ease of putting it away when not in use and then a simple push on the foot symbol to bring it back down again   great for the ladies   it is a beast to put together  other reviews said   hours and i would agree with that   solid steel construction

4745,3.0,                       i was hoping the rise on it would actually be higher  when it s on     it feels like it s on a rise of   it makes a loud noise when it s on low      but i guess for the price it does the job  i was just hoping for a little bit of a better treadmill      
4746,5.0,                       great     
4747,5.0,                       love this treadmill      
4748,5.0,                       replaced a   year old sole   works perfectly after    hr assembly   you can do it with   person   be aware that it gets up to speed very quickly   as other reviewers noted  there is an occasional slow down that lasts a second or two   not enough to fall on your face  but it is noticeable      
4749,5.0,                       i love it

4755,5.0,                       i love it         
4756,4.0,                       warning  other reviews have stated that the delivery people will take the treadmill downstairs  this is not my experience  the company that delivered my treadmill only sent one person to do the job  he couldn t even get the package up the front steps because it was so heavy  and he refused to help get it down the stairs  if you are going to buy a heavy item from amazon  don t assume that the delivery people will deliver it anywhere besides the front door pros  easy to assemble  it took two people about     to   hours  hydraulic arm enables the bottom section of the treadmill to lift up  saving space if necessary cons  the belt moves inconsistently at speeds below    mph  it feels jittery  like it s having trouble moving  the build in speakers deliver low quality audio  and the max volume is not that great  it s difficult to hear podcasts or videos over the sound of the treadmill  music listeners shouldn t have any issues with volume  the build in software have an additional monthly charge  heartrate monitor is inaccurate      
4757,5.0,                       like everything  exercise     
4758,1.0,                       item is good but it s broken     
4759,5.0,                       good value for the money     
4760,4.0,                       the treadmill is amazing  very easy to put together  the only issue i had was the ifit  it is a pain in the ass trying to get it and understand it  the treadmill is somewhat quite and isn t as smooth as very one says  the box is very heavy for one person to move  i would rather have sent the money on a better treadmill      
4761,5.0,                       this rocks     
4762,4.0,                       so far so good     
4763,5.0,                       i love itworth the money     
4764,5.0,                       this is a very good treadmmill   the track is wider than some  which i like  and the length is good   several members of the family are using it and we all agree we made a good choice it has some bells and whistles  but so far i am just walking for exercise while i listen to audio  books     
4765,5.0,                       i was not sure about this  treadmill due to the reviews however it was easy to put together less than two hours   it works great   the incline is great at    no problem so far have been using it for a full month   i would suggest ordering lubrication to go with it because it should be put on right when you get it     
4766,5.0,                       ok     
4767,2.0,                       the product is broken     
4768,5.0,                       arrived in great condition and have no issues      
4769,5.0,                       love this treadmill   for the price  it s totally worth it  this replaced a cheapie gold s gym model from a big box store and my only regret is that i didn t do it sooner  this motor is powerful and much quieter than my old one   the pre programmed tracks are helpful  i do wish it had bluetooth  but for the price  using an adapter cord with my phone is no big deal      
4770,5.0,                       useful     
4771,5.0,                       love this machine  so happy i made the investment and purchased it

4773,5.0,                       excellent        
4774,5.0,                       it is a good instrument and whole family is enjoying it  thanks      
4775,4.0,                       the treadmill is nice  quieter than i expected  we did have a problem that turned out to be user error  the speed seemed to be a lot slower than the setting  turns out we had accidentally switched it to kilometers per hour   oops   also we scheduled a delivery date and time a week in advance and adjusted our schedules for it but the delivery was delayed by   whole days      
4776,4.0,                       i am not able to give a five star review as yet  it was just delivered yesterday   however  i will say that it seems fairly quiet and operates smoothly  it was delivered a day before it was scheduled to be delivered  all very nice  however  it was not as easy to put together as i had read in some reviews  one claiming to have ut it together by himself in an hour  no way   it definitely takes two people  i had a friend helping me who is one of those who can fix or build anything and it took us about   hours to put the treadmill together  it is a big treadmill  it is solidly built  i didn t like the fact that it did not come with the means to lubricate it  i just purchased lubricating packets  not sure if i am supposed to wait until i use the lubricant or go ahead and use it and worry about lubrication later  no biggee i guess  the incline works well and all and all it seems to be a good quality treadmill  will know more after a couple of weeks of use      
4777,5.0,                       i m still learning things with it but i enjoy walking on it     
4778,5.0,                       love it  replaced an old smaller unit  i like the programs built in     
4779,5.0,                       love it     
4780,4.0,                       had a bit of an issue with delivery  but amazon took care of that as they always do   treadmill it s self was fairly easy to put together took about an hour i purchased the ifit model to go with it  the model make it more interesting while you are walking      
4781,1.0,                       although the product information explicitly says expert assembly is included  the freight company delivering the treadmill says it is not  and all the deliverers will do is put it just inside my door  not cool      
4782,5.0,                       exercise     
4783,5.0,                       i love my treadmill     
4784,5.0,                       great product              
4785,5.0,                       love it     
4786,4.0,                       loud     
4787,5.0,                       works great      
4788,5.0,                       can t go wrong for the money  i had this together within an hour of delivery and started running  has great features and i would recommend to anyone  delivery went without a hitch as well         
4789,1.0,                       sadly i cannot recommend this treadmill due to the fact it arrived damaged   when we called nordic track  we purchased the extended warranty  rather than expedite a simple replacement part they said  back order  no idea when it will be available  call amazon to return   what     i put it together already  i m using a damaged treadmill that i paid      plus for  not good      
4790,5.0,                       absolutely great for the price  my only issue  if any  is with the sound system  it is really poor quality  i can get better quality from my android phone the customer service at nordic track is sad  i had our unit professionally installed  but two weeks in  it started squeaking really badly  no troubleshooting guide on nordictrack site   i could not even find the model number  then     minutes into a web chat with the service folks  it was obvious that they were hopelessly clueless  eventually  some youtube ing later  we decided to find all metal on metal contacts and wd   them one by one  we found the problem contact  and now it is a dream to run on  hip hip hurray  husband   thank you  and absolutely no thanks to the nordictrack service agents  hopefully they will hold up their end of the warranty contract when something really goes wrong  fingers crossed      
4791,5.0,                       this treadmill is perfect for my  th height   it s fairly quiet except when i m at     incline going     mph   took about and hour to assemble and i have had it for    in the now and am so happy with it      
4792,2.0,                       the track slips too much and i feel this is a safety hazard          have not used it due to being afraid of slipping     
4793,5.0,                       once my husband and i managed to get this in the basement  set up took about an hour and a half  it works perfectly now and i use it every day  you can tell it s very good quality  however if i ever have to buy this again i will definitely purchase the on site installation      
4794,5.0,                       product works awesome  can t say enough good things about this machine  you can t get something of similar quality for the     baffles me anyone would complain about putting it together and the time it takes   it took my   year and i just over an hour      
4795,5.0,                       i am    years old and overweight   like    lbs worth  i ve been a little weary of starting up exercising again but i have to say this treadmill is a dream  i ve had a couple of others in the last few decades and this is the best one yet i walked   miles this morning and feel great  this machine is smooth as silk  no swollen knees  no backache  just feeling good  i started with just one mile a day and will go up to at least   miles a day  i love the incline variety and even the cup holders are better      
4796,4.0,                       buyers check your breaker panel if you are setting this up in a bedroom  i really wish amazon or nordic trac would have given this information in the description  i have had my treadmill for    days and have yet to use it because of waiting for electrician to tell me it wont run on a gfi breaker and i will need an arc filter  in order to get nordic trac to talk to you be aware that you must have your treadmill registered    use the smart phone sticker on the display  i tried to do it on my computer and could not get it done  but the smart phone way was easy  fyi  the housing code where i live requires the gfi breakers on bedrooms as a safety device  according to the licensed electrician i paid     bucks to  if i move the treadmill to the living room it would probably work         
4797,2.0,                       super dangerous  within   weeks of buying the treadmill would speed up on it s own  when decrease speed was selected the speed still increased  my mom fell and scraped her knee and leg  very unsatisfied and unhappy      
4798,5.0,                       fits my needs perfectly and works great   very glad that we also ordered the professional installation service with the treadmill   absolutely worth every penny        
4799,5.0,                       so far so good and can t beat the price  best suggestion is to assemble yourself  nordic track knows what they re doing and doesn t deliver a treadmill in    pieces  it helps to have someone assisting to hold things together but for the most part i did it myself and do not consider myself very handy  the instructions provided are matched with illustrations and step by step pairing with the screws needed  we originally added the service provider to assemble and it was going to cost over       initially it was     but they emailed after saying with the complexity that they needed to charge more   even after that they weren t very accommodating to availability and then tried to change the appointment the day before  i requested to keep the time scheduled since i adjusted my schedule to be home and their suggestion was to contact amazon and get a different service  glad i canceled since it really was very easy as far as the actual treadmill goes     it has a ton of functionality and options for settings and types of workout  it s very easy to use and i would say it is better than most you see in gyms  haven t had the chance to really break it in but will update if there are any warnings that need to go out  this is just for our makeshift gym in our basement and will be a great addition  good luck and enjoy      
4800,5.0,                       very good     
4801,1.0,                       a key part should attaching the base   was not found      
4802,5.0,                       sturdy  reliable  and a great value  i walk on it daily and have for over a month  no issues  it goes plenty fast for me and has a great spot for my ipad  baby monitor  and water bottle      
4803,4.0,                       the treadmill is awesome  i d give it   stars but the assembly was a nightmare  the instructions were fine but there were   screws that were in the uprights that had to come out before you could screw the arms on  it seemed to me that they were put in to tread the holes but they were only started and not driven in at all as if someone forgot to do it  getting them out was easy but putting the arms on and threading in the new screws was near impossible could have just been a fluke  everything else is fine and the treadmill is used everyday and works great      
4804,4.0,                       overall a good product  the controls are straight forward  although a bit on the basic side  and it feels very steady   it is very heavy so had to pay a little extra to have delivery guys take it upstairs where i needed it  a little pricey for the features and a little louder than i expected but i like it  only downside i really don t like is that it occasionally pops the fuse breaker at my house  that may be a problem with my house but this seems to be the only thing that does that      
4805,3.0,                       i ordered this treadmill back in march of      and have been using it regularly so far  the main reason i chose to purchase this model is because it has a higher weight limit  allowing all of the members of my household to use it instead of just me  that is honestly the only reason i would purchase this model  here are the reasons i am not really impressed   i have found the heart rate monitor has no idea what my heart rate actually is  usually my heart rate is high  resting is in the   s  but when i run it is in the    s   this monitor says that after running a few miles my heart rate is in the    to    range  the speaker also seems to get louder at random times for just a moment or two before going back to normal  the speaker only goes up to     which with some devices i find to be extremely quiet  sometimes i just leave my tablet unhooked to it because the tablet speaker gets louder anyway  about two months ago the treadmill began to squeak and i can t figure out why  the belt does not need lubricant and it squeaks on and off  if it is changing the incline the noise stops  after a minute or two it comes back  it usually squeaks every step  but sometimes it randomly stops and i think it fixed its self  then it will start back up for no reason  i am honestly baffled as to what is causing this noise and have no idea how to fix it all in all  i would only buy this if you require a higher weight limit  this machine is limited to     pounds where most cheaper units are     pounds   the other features on it seem to be vastly lacking      
4806,5.0,                       i got this yesterday  was easy to assemble it with my wife help  seems good so far for the price i paid     
4807,1.0,                       this was noisier than i thought  after   month it just stopped working  it has been a nightmare getting a new one and shipping this one  back  consider a pro form     or higher instead  it was not hard  putting together  i did my myself  but felt cheap  could never get the belt to center either      
4808,4.0,                          workout app button does not work since day one  i called nordic and they replied that button actually does not do anything  it s weird why it was there after readjusting the walking belt and then it run smooth and fast      
4809,5.0,                       this product is really sturdy  less noisy   love it  the delivery guy was kind enough to bring it to our   rd floor apt     
4810,3.0,                        very noisy when in use  even at low speeds  the screen light doesn t turn off after use      
4811,5.0,                       hired a fitness guy to assemble  took him   hr but he had put many together at his work  loved this treadmill    bought many in the past  so wonderful that my movers stole it when i relocated  insurance would not replace it  wish i had one        
4812,4.0,                       but i wish you could lock the screen to show only the items you want to show instead of the view constantly toggling between stats the delivery company was pretty lousy   really mangled the box  however  there was no damage found to the product when unpacking      
4813,5.0,                       reliable and not too loud when running  the assembly was more time consuming than expected  but the instructions worked well      
4814,4.0,                       nice treadmill that does the job  i find it a bit noisy  but it is a treadmill  happy with this purchase      
4815,5.0,                       great quality for walking or running   very sturdy  easy to use      
4816,5.0,                       works great   same quality that you would find in a gym      
4817,5.0,                       i bought a  second   machine is quiet and does the job   would recommend this to friends      
4818,5.0,                       this is exactly what i wanted in a treadmill  i will probably skip the ifit addition since it has such miserable ratings but after researching it  it s nothing i m really interested in anyway  i was just looking for something decent to walk on after work  set up was much easier than i expected  my man and i are pretty inept at putting things like this together  we went slowly and it took us an hour and a half with no yelling at all haha      
4819,4.0,                       great treadmill just took   hours to put together      
4820,5.0,                       this treadmill is so nice   i needed the bluetooth adapter in order to use the ifit module but i love it      
4821,5.0,                       great  more than i expected  thank you       
4822,5.0,                       bought it for my wife  she loves it      
4823,1.0,                       so far not happy  just opened box to put together and the base is damaged  so far it just looks like the plastic cover  will see if rest is able to go together and works and if this part is just replaceable  was looking forward to working out      
4824,3.0,                       the cord comes out of the front and is very short  unless you want it facing the wall or parallel to it you will need a extension cord      
4825,5.0,                       great so far  had it   month     
4826,5.0,                       so far this has worked just as expected   it wasn t too difficult to put together either   i d say it took my wife and i less than an hour to assemble   one downside is that it is heavy  i got quite the workout just moving it from the garage to the basement but overall  it s a nice looking treadmill  with many functions   and when folded  it doesn t take up much space   so far  i have no complaints   i did buy a surge protector to go with this as well  just to be on the safe side      
4827,5.0,                       it s a great treadmill for the price  the construction is very sturdy and the electronics are sufficient for customizing your own workout  it was well packed in the box and it s very heavy  the delivery guys said it felt like it weighs a lot more than     pounds  i can see why it had to be delivered by common carrier  it took me about   hours to put it together and that was a workout in itself  the instructions were very clear and the hardware was shrink wrapped and numbered according to the steps in the assembly manual  the hardware includes the key but you will need a phillips screwdriver and some wire cutters to clip the zip ties from some of the packing material  and there will be a lot of packing material  the unit doesn t look that big in the video but it s really huge  so it s not really suitable if you have a small apartment  there are some design issues that can be improved  the display and stands could be improved to allow it to collapse or removed for easier storage  the unit only has   wheels and if you re moving it in one direction then only one person is required  but to move it in the opposite direction you ll need help  it you look at the end of the video  it shows the model lifting the base with no effort  what is not shown is that the reason it s so easy is due to the gas charged strut like you see on the hoods and trunks of cars  moving the base to the ground is very easy and the strut will ease it to the ground with no hands the base is extremely heavy without the strut  i estimate that about     of the total weight is in the base which is at least     pounds  the weight alone gives the impression that it is a really solid piece of equipment on par with commercial models  the instructions don t go anywhere near a workout routine  you will have to do your own research based on your own fitness level and goals  it is compatible with ifit but that s an expensive endeavor  once assembly is done then you are on your own in regards to a suitable workout routine  as far as the electronics  there are no input parameters for gender  height  weight  age  and fitness level  so i don t know how the calorie burner could possibly be anywhere near accurate  considering that other more expensive nordictrack models this one is very good for the price      
4828,5.0,                       update  i ve now had this treadmill for over   years and love it  it s still working great and i love the no slam feature for releasing it after i ve had it folded up  i now have a tv with my treadmill soo i don t use the speakers  and never got the ifit to work like i was hoping  but for a just a good treadmill with incline i love it review from        overall i enjoy this treadmill so far  the right side plastic cover at the bottom of the treadmill was broken when it arrived at my house  but the treadmill works great besides this cosmetic fracture  it has instructions regarding how to lubricate the belt  but it doesn t come with the applicator and lubricant to perform this  it also doesn t have the best instructions  and i have yet been able to figure out how to connect my ipad   ifit program to work with the treadmill  i know it is possible  and i plan to search youtube for clear directions the only true complaint i have about this treadmill is that the speakers are very quiet  when i am walking i am able to hear the music  but when i am running and have the music turned up all the way  i can barely hear it  i prefer louder music and better speakers  as the belt is about equivalently loud to the speakers when running  i have enjoyed several runs on it so far  and am pleased  i hope that this treadmill lasts me a couple years      
4829,2.0,                       lcd screen has broken twice  loses the pixelation and becomes unreadable   frustrating as the mechanics of the machine were good   used at least once per day for   hours   nordictrack says i have it in the wrong place  my garage      
4830,5.0,                       we love it     
4831,5.0,                       this is a great machine for such a reasonable price      
4832,2.0,                       this is a negative review i wish i hadn t bought it sight unseen  it is poorly designed in the following ways   i am a     woman with fairly long arms  however the short stubby hand bars on the side are too short for comfort   my hands have to be resting on the outer edge of the bars and even then the tips of my sneakers hit the edge on the protective cover over the belt   thus every time my sneaker hits the cover there is a clatter  if you are running you have to step back in order not to hit the protective cover   when you step back you are out of range for grasping the side bars   this is a potentially dangerous situation  in addition the hand bars are not designed for easy grasping  they are short  thick  tapered  and smooth another design flaw is that when holding the cross bar where  you place your hands to have information transmitted  regarding heart rate etc  it requires that you stand fairly close to the front of the machine  thus more clatter when your sneaker hits the protective cover   my husband has the same difficulty with both situations i have described i am appalled that a company with a reputation for quality and design slipped up this way  given the cost of the machine it is even more reprehensible  unfortunately nordic track is not shown in most sports stores store anymore  according to the company representative i talked with what i like about the machine is it is sturdy  the belt is wide and it is quiet      
4833,3.0,                       overall good quality looks nice   compact when folded up   fits in my office were some other units would ve been much too large   technology plugin features are dated   motor seems a little underpowered  belt will slow and speed up ever so slightly with each step   this makes a slightly annoying sound      
4834,1.0,                       amazon has been wonderful to deal with   they have offered to take the product back  but we are trying to get it fixed   but nordic track is impossible to deal with   stay away      
4835,4.0,                       nice machine for the money   does not have a lot of bells and whistles      
4836,4.0,                       good product that you have to learn to use to appreciate      
4837,5.0,                       this is a beautiful  solid piece of machinery  it is relatively quiet for a treadmill  not silent  but not loud either    this nordic track t     may not be the latest model  but it is close  i have been comparing treadmills for months now in search of the right one  and this is by far the nicest machine i have seen for the price  it s worth every penny  the    year warranty on the motor and lifetime warranty on the frame is incredible  i like this every bit as much as i like the commercial at my local gym  i have only had mine up and running for a week  but it already feels like part of me  the controls are intuitive and flexible the incline is so easy to operate  and the speed controls change effortlessly   so far  so good      nordictrack t     s treadmill
4838,5.0,                       i love my nordic track  i use it   times a week and its holding up fine  it was a little difficult to put together so i recommend paying someone to do it   but it is still well worth owning  i encourage you to buy it  i see the price has come down so buy it  buy it  buy it      
4839,5.0,                       love be it easy to use my one complaint is it gets gradually louder and louder makes a lot of noise     
4840,5.0,                       easy to assemble  you basically set up the top part to the bottom treadmill  part  it s plenty fast for me  i was a little concerned about the width of the track before i got it  but i m a         pound guy so pretty wide and i haven t had any problems  i don t have to think about where i m planting my feet or anything  folds up nice and looks sharp      
4841,5.0,                       got this for thanks giving  so far so good      
4842,5.0,                       excellent treadmill   very solid and fairly quiet   we really enjoy using this treadmill      
4843,4.0,                       it was easy to assemble didn t take much time  works great so far haven t had any issues with it and i am glad i was able to get this product      
4844,5.0,                       easy to assemble and works great      
4845,2.0,                       it s okay but constantly been tripping our electricity so had to buy an arc filter   surge protector for additional cost as suggested by nordictrack  it s also a little loud   makes some noises while treadmill is running     
4846,5.0,                       i love it         
4847,2.0,                       not pleased sorry     
4848,3.0,                       i have had this for   months now  very economical  shipping was very fast   i walk about   to   miles everyday i did have to replace the motor at   weeks  it is working okay now      
4849,5.0,                       so far so good  it works great and i love it  just to let people know it can be put together by one person but i would recommend having   if possible      
4850,5.0,                       very good treadmill  my wife love it      
4851,5.0,                       bigger than expected  thanks      
4852,5.0,                       as described     
4853,5.0,                       so happy i purchased this  it s a basic treadmill but has all the features i need  delivery was quick and easy      
4854,5.0,                       love     
4855,5.0,                       this product will take two or more people to carry this in to assemble  it is very heavy  open the box  then take a deep breath  yikes  it will be o k   follow closely the directions  the bolts and screws are all numbered  this honestly will take about   hours after the assembly   i place the magnetic key in place and it started right up  it is made well  hence that is why it is so heavy  i really like it      
4856,5.0,                       it is a very nice and sturdy trademill  it meets my expectations            
4857,5.0,                       as expected  like the pre programmed workouts  great price      
4858,1.0,                       arrived damaged and unusable unfortunately  waiting for a replacement      
4859,4.0,                       great treadmill  worth the price     
4860,4.0,                       very well made     
4861,3.0,                       so far the treadmill works great  it did take about an hour to put together  but nothing too difficult  the delivery service was ok at best  the box was partially ripped open and they wouldn t help bring it up a flight of stairs  i am curious if i had paid for the  installation  if they would have actually set it up where i wanted it      
4862,5.0,                       delivery and assembly were perfect they did a really great job thank you     
4863,3.0,                       disappointed in dashboard plastic cover  it has smudges and scratches on it  it appears this item has been assembled before  all smudges and scratches are visible when working out on treadmill easy to follow instructions   assembly took   hours   easy to adjust  as advertised  belt tension good local delivery service   item shipping over     pounds      
4864,5.0,                       machine is sturdy and has met all my expectations      
4865,2.0,                       the treadmill is functioning as expected   i ve only had it a couple weeks and everything works as advertised  but the delivery service left me angry   since they give a    hour window   am to  pm  i had my elderly mother stay at the house to sign for the delivery   she opened the door and said to put the box just inside the door  as the shipping rules stated they were only responsible to bring the box inside the threshold of the house   they flat our refused to bring the package into the house then lied and said they were not allowed to enter   when she asked again to bring it in they were rude to her and  as she put it   yelled at her  for asking   keep in mind this package is very large and nearly     lbs   i wish i had been there to defend her from this lazy  bullying behavior but i have a feeling they would not have acted like that for me nor would i put up with it   its sad to see employees taking advantage of elderly people because they know they are more timid and less likely to argue      
4866,5.0,                       good     
4867,5.0,                       very pleased   delivery was great and treadmill is rock solid   i knew prior to purchase that the hr function is bogus but that was not important  as i wear a monitor with a strap any way  overall the quality is exceptional for the price paid  only issue is that a flyer that comes with the manual mentions  lubrication and applicator  neither of which were anywhere in the packaging      
4868,5.0,                       i had this treadmill for a month   somehow after using the ifit module it went into metric mode   icon health   fitness called   told me how to change it back to miles   it s working great again   they re great   i love this treadmill   again      
4869,3.0,                       it is noisy and squiky     
4870,5.0,                       very good machine  performs good walking and running       
4871,5.0,                       works well  still have to learn all the functions this treadmill was stollen out of the house     its not like in a few month you couldn t pick up the one on amazon oe even buy used  so i dont know what the problem was of people      getting rid of competition  its not like i used it to run long distance or train for  hour maraphone      i was just walking slowly recovering from knee surgery     please     only mentally ill losers could be so stupid to raise up at the expense of poor sweet injured divorced lady         
4872,1.0,                       i am returning this as it continually trips my circuit breaker  i tried several different interventions to stop this and it did not work      
4873,1.0,                       received the product with a missing part left upright  which is one major part  i was really surprised how it was boxed without a major part  i am not sure how i will get the missing part and it is heavy to return it back      
4874,5.0,                       so far i have been pretty impressed with this product   i spent a lot of time going between this one and a newer  spiffier model  and decided to forego some of the bells and whistles to save myself some money  hoping i was not also sacrificing quality   when the product arrived  amazon delivered within    minutes of their top end estimate  which was really nice   this is heavy  somewhere around    lbs   especially on the end with the motor  so i would definitely recommend two people to carry it and to assemble it  my husband and i were able to unbox  move the pieces from our garage and into the house  and assemble within an hour   everything worked great when we turned it on without any hiccups   this is not exciting in its digital display or it s programming options  but it s not total bare bones  either   i am usually watching something on my ipad while running so i don t care much about the lack of a screen to capture my attention  but the speakers on this unit are definitely lacking in output   i end up just using my bluetooth speaker and set it next to the machine instead of using the jack   i am a recreational runner  usually running   miles or doing moderate sprint work intervals   for myself  this machine most definitely meets my needs and i am very happy with it   i haven t purchased the optional ifit or whatever it is to use with it and just boop the buttons manually and don t do much with the included program options   it s a comfortable run and that makes me happy      
4875,5.0,                       great price  delivered to the door  thanks      
4876,5.0,                       great design  not very loud when in use      hp        minutes to assemble  use instruction book  step by step  you will need some help to put it all  together  i hope it will work for long time  i was lucky  my box delivered without any damage  i read some information before i bought it    if your weight    lbs  buy treadmill with bigger capacity        lbs more than your weight    than more you weight and you will run on this treadmill  than more hp you need    look careful for capacity how many pounds treadmill can handle  good luck      
4877,5.0,                       it makes me fit and strong     
4878,5.0,                       good quality       
4879,5.0,                       great to exercise on     
4880,3.0,                       so far no issues  works well  box came crushed  a little plastic damage  customer service    min wait on phone to ask question  easy and quick assembly  controls are geared toward subscription to ifit com     a year  this is a little disappointing  feels strong and stable  speakers are low sound      
4881,5.0,                       wonderful product  highly recommend      
4882,5.0,                       my husband and i bought the nordic track treadmill on a lightning deal that was     dollars less than amazon s price  so we got a fantastic deal  the machine  itself  is awesome  we are starting slow  but this has many features that will be well used as we improve and re do our goals  we trusted the name of nordic track and did some research on this particular machine  it is highly rated and just a great machine  we highly recommend this for beginners  as well as runners  we are just walking slowly now  as we haven t exercised in a long time  we also like the fact that we don t have to depend on weather conditions to walk either  it is our ideal treadmill machine      
4883,3.0,                       i don t use it that much but it s good  not too loud  has lots of options for different kinds of workouts  i haven t tried the ifit part yet for lack of accessories      
4884,1.0,                       broke and could return it  waste of money      
4885,5.0,                       perfect for people who are a little older as well as youngin s  display is clear and well designed  we like the workout features you do not have to have extra equipment to view a wonderful display  we would recommend this treadmill to our family and friends      
4886,1.0,                       not happy with it at all  sending back  thats the beauty of amazon      
4887,5.0,                       bought as an early mother s day present for myself   it arrived today   my husband and i assembled it in less than   hours   the entire family has already tried it out and it was a perfect fit for our family   runs quietly for the size of the machine   a fan placed next to it supplied the only feature it was missing   and i love the bar that makes raising and lowering it so much easier because it is one heavy machine   i hope we have many years to come to enjoy this product      
4888,5.0,                       awesome     
4889,5.0,                       my wife  dog and lyself use it and it works great  easy to assemble      
4890,5.0,                           chp      by    track  auto incline up to    percent   speed up to    mph     workout apps  wieght limit     lbsand thousands with ifit including google maps ifit console sold separately with yearly membership has a ledge on the console to put a book or tablet easily  two bins for ample storage and easy access of water  cell phone  etc  foldable with hydraulic assist  built in speakers loud enough   not whisper silent but quiet enough not machine for you if you need a bigger track if you are taller then     or wieght more then     lbs or if you want to run faster then    mph  and lastly it does not have a  fan built in but didnt think paying         extra to get a fan built in was woth it   month updateuse it   times a week  run    miles a week  works perfectly  lubricate once a month  heart rate sensors is kind of garbage use a wirst based of chest strap if needed      
4891,5.0,                       two to assemble   very nice   treadmills have come along way   i recommend this product      
4892,3.0,                       it s not what i expected  because the apps don t work it says    workout apps so i ve been calling amazon but no nobody respond to my call about the nortrac so i m very disappointed      
4893,5.0,                       excellant machine for the money and not difficult to assemble     
4894,3.0,                       this is an adequate  basic treadmill  it doesn t feel as if the belt moves at a steady  even pace  it also doesn t absorb shock well  so i wouldn t use this if i were a jogger runner      
4895,1.0,                       it has been a year  this thing started to rust  it is noisy and inaccurate  hated it  worst money spent      
4896,4.0,                       very good for the money  wish the speakers were slightly louder though  the lip for your tablet is a good size  it holds my full size ipad in it s survivor case without any worry of it falling  i m      and mostly legs  the deck has plenty of room for me to run comfortably      
4897,5.0,                       nothing beats personal training when it comes to performance  i am impressed by all the tools that the nordictrack has to offer and how it can be adapted to my needs  i don t love running  but this treadmill gives me more motivation and variety that makes running more enjoyable      
4898,3.0,                       very squeaky even with amazon professional assembly      
4899,5.0,                       bought as a gift  never heard any complaints so  i guess its okay      
4900,1.0,                       worked for about    minutes  not worth the time wasted and effort spent to get it set up  do not order this treadmill  just don t      
4901,5.0,                       great product  works great  a           
4902,5.0,                       so far so good   been using it for several months and really like it      
4903,1.0,                       did not order it     
4904,3.0,                       i like it the only problem the volumen for music its bad other wise its ok      
4905,5.0,                       as ordered  very sturdy     
4906,4.0,                       works well     
4907,5.0,                       delivery folks were fantastic   thanks pilot and your affiliates      
4908,5.0,                       great     
4909,5.0,                       i was in pulmonary therapy for a while  and once it stopped i noticed a difference in my breathing and lung function  so i decided to purchase a treadmill  i didn t want the best machine out there and i sure didn t want a cheap one  i came across this one being middle of the price range and being a brand name i have hear of  i decided to buy it  it was delivered buy a guy in a truck and in my case i had to help unload it and bring it in the house  remember i have lung problems and i m trying to help carry a     pound machine up a bunch of stares to get to my door  so have someone available to help you out  the idea was to put the treadmill in an upstairs second bedroom     yeah not happing  now i have a treadmill in my living room  thinking this really is not a bad idea because i have no excuses for not using it  my lung function has increased  i can now walk faster than     mph and i have lost    pounds  not bad for buying this back in august of this year  like others have said it did not come with lube but  there is a sheet that says it don t need it  i highly recommend this treadmill      
4910,4.0,                       very happy with my nordic track only brand i can count on for a great preformance      
4911,2.0,                       better than nothing  seems to work well mechanically  problems   my strides are too big and my foot keeps catching the plastic motor cover    treadmill arms are too short to hold on to keep balance        incline compares to    gym incline      
4912,5.0,                       works as advertised   highly recommend      
4913,5.0,                       excellent treadmill  very easy to assemble and built tough  worth the money      
4914,2.0,                       was damaged  will not incline  have replaced line to console which did not solve problem and just received the replacement motor  unit was damaged in excess of what was presented on amazon for which i paid more      
4915,5.0,                       works great  easy to set up  though it took a bit longer than i expected   and works well   love the one button push to get to higher or lower speeds   obviously isn t your heavy duty fitness club level treadmill  but for a home treadmill i highly recommend it      
4916,5.0,                       i love the large display  and the number of preprogramed training exercises available are excellent  the live training sessions are a great touch too so you don t need to go to the gym for a professional trainer      
4917,3.0,                       it is hard to set for me to use i don t like it at all   wife can use it ok   i can see why i should have checked out other brands     
4918,4.0,                       good one for personal fitness   little noise   but it s not too bad     
4919,1.0,                       first  on delivery   they showed up when scheduled and called ahead   all good   unfortunately  they do not bring the box inside of the house   i had my mother     years old  wait for delivery   i assumed they would at least carry it inside of the door   nope   they are only required to leave it at the door  outside of the house   thankfully  an incentive can still be used to get help  read not a free delivery  second  on purchased assembly   my appointment was thursday morning between   and      i wake up to an email from the company that they have rescheduled for between   and     well  how convenient for them   fortunately  i was able to move my personal schedule around to accommodate the new time   as it turns out  that was unnecessary   they never showed or called   i spoke with amazon customer service who said they would work on getting someone in   no emails  no calls   i go online and see that my rescheduled appointment was made without consulting me for a week later than initially scheduled   that didn t work for me so  i assembled myself   let s do introductions     i am a moderately fit single woman   i grew up trailing my father around the house fixing things  and have a tool bench very tough alone i managed to assemble this myself  but would highly recommend having a second set of hands   i was able to use pieces of wood to lever things in upright fashion  but it would be safer to have someone hold things in place pieces and instructions are good and easy to follow   a couple of pertinent notes when installing the handrail  step   in my version   there are   bolts in them   these get in the way   they tell you to remove them later  step   in my version    they should tell you in step   the crossrail was attached to the console in my shipment   it is a little confusing when looking at the instructions and not finding a separate piece   you can just pluck it out of the console the latch crossbar can be put on upside down  guess how i figured this out       there is a sticker to show which side goes toward the belt  but you need to make sure that the holes are toward the ground to attach it to the storage latch hope this helps   the machine itself is relatively easy to assemble and based on a quick start and test looks great   i will add more on performance later  but thought this was critical to know when ordering   it took me       hours while multitasking  coffee and conference calls       
4920,4.0,                       nice treadmill for the money     
4921,4.0,                       not sure yet too early to know      
4922,5.0,                       i love it      
4923,4.0,                       so far so good     
4924,2.0,                       some of the screws didnt fit at all  the hand rail s screw eyes are too small       
4925,1.0,                       utterly disappointed with amazon   i didn t get the free assembly as promised  treadmill is great though       
4926,1.0,                       after   hours of assembly  the treadmill would not power on     
4927,4.0,                       great treadmill  sturdy and much quieter than my last one  only thing is it doesn t go straight up when i stored      
4928,4.0,                       i am super excited to write this reviewi ordered this a few months ago  and love it   the impact is nice not too hard  the only problem i had is to use the ifit you have to subscribe and it s quite pricey  also this machine is compatible  but you have to buy an extra piece for it to be wifi compatible so you can use to hook up to your ipad  that was a little frustrating but overall i love it so   stars      
4929,4.0,                       the treadmill is an excellent piece of equipment    however  if you re considering paying for the service provided by amazon to assemble the treadmill  don t waste your money   first  sonny s handyman service was scheduled to arrive between a certain time and never showed up   after realizing sonny s handyman service would not be following through on their commitment  i decided to diagnose the challenge assembling the treadmill myself   i am not mechanically inclined  yet i was able to assemble the treadmill within   hour   again  great piece of equipment   and again  don t waste your money paying for assembly  especially if its through sonny s handyman service      
4930,5.0,                       first of all  the box is heavy  almost     lb    so make sure the carrier places it where you can assemble it   once assembled  it is easy to move   assembly took me approximately   hours  i was in no rush    read the instruction manual before beginning and you will have no problems   follow the suggestions regarding how to remove the packaging   i did not attempt to move the treadmill until it was completely assembled   it will take   people to complete the final step or two once assembled  the treadmill is easy to use  quiet and has many different built in programs for you to use   controls are easy to use and clearly marked   the belt and motor are quiet and the heart rate monitor is accurate   the built n programs are easily adjusted to suit your needs   overall  i m very satisfied with this treadmill     
4931,1.0,                       this company is as slimy as they come as referenced by hundreds of reviews on this facebook page alone  we bought a nordictrack treadmill   years ago  we like it when it works but has broken several times and is under warranty  on our latest issue we called noridctrack as we have before and the representative asked if we could video chat so he could examine the problem more closely  we complied  he instructed me to start taking certain part of the treadmill apart so he could look at  the components  i foolishly complied  even though i had  no obligation to take my tools to a product under warranty after about a half hour the representative realized out treadmill was in the garage  yes it s in the back room of a temperature controlled garage in as area set up as a gym  he immediately canceled our warranty based on  unsuitable environmental conditions   what an invasion of privacy after we agree d to a video chat  he refused to let me talk to a supervisor or send someone out to reassemble the now dismantled machine that now doesn t work at all based on his instructions  he then discontinued the phone call  this company is for profit only  be warned      
4932,5.0,                       we just received our treadmill saturday morning and so far  so good  it took about   hours for my husband and i to get it in the house and then to assemble it  the instructions were clear and easy to follow i played around with the treadmill that afternoon to take it for a test run  the horse power is pretty impressive for such a cheap model  it s fairly quite and the display is easy to read and navigate  i don t know that i ll get to serious into the different training modes  but it does have tons of options  i ran on it at     mph for a mile and a half at different inclines and it was totally on par with the treadmills i use at the gym we haven t tried the speakers yet because we need an auxiliary cord to plug in our phones   the two compartments on either side of the display are great for holding your phone  bottle of water and a towel  while i haven t tried to move the treadmill into the upright folded position  it looked simple enough when my husband did it  but the track portion is fairly heavy i ll update my review again if we have any problems      
4933,2.0,                       treadmill is nice but norditrak customer service sucks   bought treadmill piece of as broken called norditrak piece on back order   weeks later on hold presently for    min trying to see about part     
4934,3.0,                       just a total mess trying to get this delivered   first one was broken in transit and amazon customer service made it right after setting it up  the track stuck periodically   it needed lubricant and enclosed in the box instructed the customer to call directly to norditrac if this problem occurs   called the number and met the worst customer service representative   he refused to listen  kept talking over us   refused to send the lubricant  because he insisted the item was pre lubed  and even refused to connect us with his manager yes  it was that bad my wife is he most kind  sweet and understanding georgia southern woman   she actually became emotionally upset talking to this individual      
4935,1.0,                       earnestly  i d give about a   and a half star rating  but who reads     star reviews when trying to figure out what s objectively wrong issues    so nordick track is a household name brand  and they ve decided to capitalize on that getting rid of the sturdy metal frames that established their brand and convert to cheap  flimsy made in china plastics  i assembled it out of the box and found the plastic frame pieces all warped and ill fitting with random corners and edges popping out  customer support did get around to sending out a technician  due to other issues  who professionally assembled it with newly mailed replacement plastic frame pieces    and there s still unjoined corners that stick out and look like garbage  congratulations on saving a few dollars on materials while sacrificing product quality nt    my heart rate monitor will not work  and nordick track says it s a feature  not a bug  giving me readings of     bradycardia   then    seconds later      tachycardia   then back down to the    s  then who knows where  either my treadmill is malfunctioning or i need a pacemaker  if nt had advertise it as a random number generator  i wouldn t have a complaint  but they very clearly brag how their smart system utilizes your heart rate and other metrics to science  but garbage in  garbage out  i contacted them multiple times  they tried replacing the heart rate bar  that didn t work  they did the math on shipping a new console  decided that was too expensive  tried to buy me off with a chest strap heart monitor  wat    then ultimately decided to piss on me and tell me it s raining   you can t expect medical grade accuracy   that was their line  so my heartrate is somewhere between    and      well thanks  that covers just about the range of survivable human heart rates  thanks nt  it s bull     and insulting  nordic track did their best to convince me they re incapable of designing a functioning treadmill instead of paying to ship a replacement console  but i m not as stupid as they clearly think i am    you ll notice the absence of a convenient tray for a book or a tablet present in earlier models  they even designed their heart rate bar to be rounded to ensure anything you try and rest  on it ends up falling to the ground  so  smart phones  tablets  enjoy shattered screens   now why would they possibly do that  previous versions had it  could it be that they re moving to a subscription model for their ifit content  maybe they want to make it difficult for you to provide your own jogging distraction material so they can sell you theirs at      a year  sure they give you a year free  what better way to get you hooked on their product  it s a cynical cash grab  taking away functionality to breed dependence somewhere  corporate efficiency experts are advising companies to cut corners  convert to plastics  out source labor  engage in shady micro transactions  and otherwise squeeze every last dollar out of their cow like consumer base  if we as consumers want to be treated any better  we have to hold them accountable  change the mathematics and demonstrate that their are consequences for underestimating your customers  otherwise  shoddy  valueless products will be the future  millenials are a lot of things  and willing to see through corporate exploitation  finding offense with crooked business practices  adjusting their spending preferences accordingly  and communicating their dissatisfaction to other potential consumers within their peer group numbers among them  sigh as for objective strengths  it hasn t broken yet  i ve had it for a few months now  so that isn t saying much   it feels good to run on  the fan is strong  my children love the music selection  ifit programming is legitimately engaging and productive for quality workouts a feature i would like to see would be a boom arm in the console that can raise  lower  tilt the embedded tablet  only having one small screen at a fixed distance and angle is very limiting  although  an excellent impetus to have people pay        more dollars for the larger embedded tablet that probably costs     more in fabrication costs  sorry  i can t stop myself at the end of the day  it comes down to what        means to you  if it s nothing to you  chump change  and you just want a cheap  enjoyable play treadmill you have very few expectations of  go for it  if        means a lot to you  and you think such a sum qualifies as an investment for your future  be prepared to be very disappointed      
4936,4.0,                       sorry i found the instruction back of screws set      
4937,5.0,                       ordered my treadmill july  th       received it july   th     as my husband attempted to assemble it  noticed we were missing the arms that actually hold up the computer board    called amazon  and then nordictrack   iconfitness com      within the week i was sent the right arm    the left arm was on back order  after a few inquiries  now  the left hand rail is out of stock with no eta   according to the email i just received     current status    a treadmill partially assembled in the middle of our garage as i send amazon payment    finally received part    been working like a champ ever since     
4938,3.0,                       we owned a nordic track earlier which we used for   yrs and so my expectations from this treadmill were higher  firstly the assembly and taking it to basement was an issue  amazon by default did not put in the basement and neither did the assembly guys  took couple of phone calls to sort it out next on the product   the treadmill in itself is nice except for two main issues  the front potion has a huge slab of nordic track which gets in the way of walking  i happen to hit on it when i am walking holding the sides  secondly there is no fan  i wish i knew that before i bought the product      
4939,1.0,                       on the video it shows there are forests  beaches etc that you can view as youre running  this does not have that  i thought i was getting a jicer treadmill than what i received and paid for      
4940,5.0,                       loved it     
4941,1.0,                       worked for less than   months  even when it did work  i was unable to use it unless the speed was over   mph as the track would slow down every time i stepped on it  now i turn it on  the display lights up and then immediately turns off again      
4942,1.0,                       i am so upset with this treadmill today is mother s day and my husband put it together yesterday i got on the treadmill everything was great at first press the incline button and everything was great i press it to go faster and i notice it did not work so i pressed the incline a little bit higher and guess what it went faster about knocking me off the treadmill i was not expecting if you hit incline you would go that much faster  and the whole kicker is the incline is now stuck on the   and will not go down  i was very disappointed but i can say don t use this review as the stop to get you one each machine is built different i really feel nordictrack is a great product overall i just happened to get a crappy one     
4943,1.0,                       its very jumpy  it doesnt stay true to calorie or speed  kind of dangerous considering if youre running and its skipping   im disappointed     
4944,1.0,                       i ordered the white glove delivery service  which included assembly of the treadmill   after they left  i reviewed the user s manual and found multiple assembly errors   some that may be potential safety hazards   i discovered multiple screws missing  star washers not installed  screws over torqued  and the plastic housing overlapped and not properly seated   most importantly  the power cord was not fully placed inside the right support arm and the wire was pinched between the frame and the bottom metal base   it does not appear that the ground wire was properly attached   my wife and i have unplugged the unit due to a concern for potential fire hazard or electrical issue s  i was going to dissemble the unit myself and assemble correctly  however i discovered that the  patch screws  used to attach the crossbar to the left and right uprights had been completely stripped   the manual states in several places not to use power tools for assembly   a power drill was used throughout the assembly process by the delivery personnel   the  patch screws   will need to be cut for removal   not certain what else is missing or improperly instaled  as i could not disassemble the unit before unplugging  attempted to use the treadmill  but found it to be very unstable   not certain if that is due to the inept installation or the unit itself   the other unit we had started smoothly   this treadmill jerks abruptly when it starts and stops   concerned about wrenching my back and or knees   also discovered that you can not access the      preinstalled programs   a complaint has been sent to customer service and waiting for a response   we are requesting a replacement   do not use the nordictrack website or their  white glove  delivery service at           amazon is much cheaper   amazon lists a     hour assembly time for their service   the delivery people from ryder were in and out in    minutes      
4945,1.0,                       the motor slows down randomly for a second and speeds back up   seems kind of dangerous   the speed change is not reflected in the settings nor am i using an endurance mode much louder than i expected i thought i was getting a great deal but it s more like a waste of money as i can t enjoy using it      
4946,1.0,                       i could not recommend this product based on poor performance  i suggest if your looking for a treadmill for serious home use you select another product      
4947,1.0,                       this product isn t water proof  my son dropped a little water while he was running and it broke     just had it for   months   my son almost got injured badly          
4948,5.0,                       i like interval training while running on a treadmill   but i don t like breaking my form to adjust my speed or incline  with this treadmill the interactive trainer does it for you while coaching you through your workout  i love it  i also love the flexselect that reduces the amount of the impact on my knees  super awesome             
4949,4.0,                       have not tested it to its full potential but it looks great set up   after assembly it was turned on and tested out  good incline levels   missing the lube applicator to allow the belt to circulate smoothly      
4950,1.0,                       i ordered a nordictrack treadmill as a family christmas present on          still waiting for it two days after christmas  on hold with customer service again trying to track it down   the good news is  if they finally set up a delivery date for me i will then be transferred to another department who will hopefully be able to tell me why an unauthorized charge for nordic track of     hit my account a week or so ago   i assume it is for the ifit subscription that is supposed to be free for the first year   tried sorting that out before  you have to deal with a separate department from shipping   but after an hour on hold i gave up my latest call with the nordictrack shipping department as i type this is currently one hour and twelve minutes long   they are going to send an email to the shipping company that has the treadmill  and can expect a response back within two days  and the rep i m speaking with doesn t have the ability to call me back  so if i don t hear anything back i can expect to spend another hour or so on hold to go through this all over again  this is one of many calls i ve made   by the time i get this treadmill it will probably be warm enough to run outside again if unauthorized charges  shipping hell  and absolutely horrible customer service are your thing  this product is for you   otherwise  check out the many other options available from better providers      
4951,4.0,                       don t like the way set time      
4952,5.0,                       no     
4953,5.0,                       all it took was a fit bit challenge and a treadmill and i was hooked   my nordic track is open all the time  since i use it at least once a day   when i first got it  i did roll it around my gym to find just the right spot   it was very easy to maneuver   it has any program you can think of to use to challenge yourself   i find that intervals  at different levels  gives me the best workout   i ve used it every day for about   months and it s the best gym equipment i ve ever owned      
4954,3.0,                       i thought it would incline more     
4955,2.0,                       i like the treadmill but i don t like that they constantly try to force you to sign up for ifit  basically  if you re not going to utilize the ifit membership  don t buy this treadmill  after almost   years of happy  and free  use  they just released a software update  september       that elimnates any all free basic content  this includes basic workouts that have pre programmed distances  elevation  and speed changes  i could have purchased a way cheaper analog treadmill that has all these functions  to be fair  they still have some free content with their trainers chirping at you the whole time  but i don t need that  i m just asking for a pre programmed workout with elevation and speed changes i m torn between burying my rage deep deep down and just continuing to work out on this thing or dragging it to the curb and putting a  free  sign on it just out of spite ps   ifit and nordictrack could care less  unless you sign up for their     month membership  they already have your money from the purchase of the treadmill and you can pound sand  welcome to customer service in              
4956,4.0,                       for this price i think it was great  i researched for about two months  looking for a treadmill that was within my price range and had everything i wanted  automatic incline  good for long legs  touch screen  not too loud  foldable   i m       months pregnant and put it together myself  i m     and the length of the track is great  i waited a few weeks to write this review after setup use to make sure it was honest  the package upon initial arrival was heavy  luckily the delivery guy brought it inside my house  small front stairs  without paying that extra     fee that they charge to bring it inside and not leave it on the front step  you can usually just give the delivery people a cash tip and they ll do it without the fee   the package itself was a bit torn or holes in some places  i didn t take off any stars for that because that s a delivery problem not nordic s  my treadmill wasn t broken or cracked like other reviews  it took me like three hours to put together  i used a tall chair for the parts that it said to use another person to hold certain parts while you screw in  took off one star during this because one bolt in the front wouldn t screw in  the pre made whole was too big  they also didn t include the tool needed to tighten the front bolts  i have a standard tool box that didn t come with the wrench size needed and i had to order it off amazon  i followed the given manufacturer manual to assemble and also followed along with a youtube video from a professional that gave me tips and tricks  highly recommended the ifit was included free for a year which i actually enjoy  i set it up before i turned on the treadmill  i love the programs and the ability to run with a trainer  this system is constantly updating itself and bug fixes which is nice  it records all your runs and progress too  i m not a marathon runner by any means  i just enjoy the daily    minute run so it works for me  the treadmill isn t very loud  my infant daughter can t hear it down the hall when i run in the mornings  the manual does suggest a surge protector so i would definitely pick one of those up before the treadmill comes  the treadmill also comes with  springs  that help create a bounce while you run  you wouldn t notice it at all if they weren t bright orange  however  i m in love with them  my knees and hips usually hurt from running longer runs or too many days in a row  this seriously takes that away  it s awesome  you re not constantly coming down on hard surfaces like cement  i think of it like shocks for a jeep i ordered this treadmill off the nordic site because after some googling i found coupons and they offered better ifit membership deals  i also sprung for the model with the bigger touch screen  totally worth it  it took over a month to get to me after ordering  which wasn t an issue after reading other reviews and mentally preparing for that  don t expect it within a week this is just my personal opinion so if you re some professional runner and think my opinion is garbage  don t be a snob and comment   insert nobody cares gif      
4957,2.0,                       i thought the treadmill item was excellent but i already had a lot of hard time and issue while doing my exercise  after   or    minutes on thewalking belt  i heard rusty noise  sound very uncomfortable  also  on the right side from the edge of the belt it s caused scratched with solid whitecolors  i m totally have no idea at all       
4958,5.0,                       i m really surprised by all the negative reviews  we receive our    s  assembled it ourselves in about     hours  carefully follow the directions  and have been using it for almost a week now  we received a gift card with our purchase with a code for the free year of ifit and have enjoyed it as well  unsure if we ll keep it after the year  but have liked it so far  we also found a video on how to fully use the screen and android system functionality to better serve our workout preferences this was an upgrade from a  very  old treadmill from a cheaper brand and i m very happy with the upgrade  i would absolutely recommend this treadmill for low to moderate in home workouts  for reference  we use our treadmill    people  for brisk walking  jogging and running strength training almost daily      
4959,3.0,                       so despite deciding not to buy this product  i simply couldn t find anything comparable for the price  especially not with the trusted brand name  so even though i hated the nonsense they were doing with the ifit  i ordered it anyway  so minus one star because of the ifit controversy  it s amazing how much work they ve went to to convince you you can t use this thing without ifit  seriously  a giant stop sign   in across right on the front of the machine that says  stop  your machine is locked  you must register with ifit  see the picture  a total lieso if you re wondering if the other people are correct  they are  you do not need ifit  place the magnetic safety turn off switch in place  hold down the ifit button for    seconds  machine never asks again  works perfectly  what s funny is  i wanted to try ifit  dummiesokay  minus second star because of assembly  yeah i knew it would be a complicated assembly  and that s fine  but i do expect things to fit better  i guess that s just the price we pay for still relying on china to build our products  and yes i know  that will never change  so just remember not to tighten things up until you ve got all the screws started other than alignment things it really doesn t go together too bad if i haven t changed this rating  the equipment works fine      
4960,1.0,                       while the treadmill seems like a sturdy piece of exercise equipment and so far seems to run well  we were disgusted by nordictrack force feeding the ifit subscription and extended warranty to the consumer   first  it is not necessary to activate the treadmill using ifit  but nordictrack says nothing about that in their directions  preferring to push the ifit subscription instead by claiming that the user must go through the activation process using ifit  which  after the free month costs     a month   we had to find out via the internet how to activate without ifit   after spending      dollars for the equipment  why should we have to pay to activate it   second  in order to simply register the treadmill  you have to bypass their extended warranty offers  which cost money   it is not intuitive as to where you go to simply register for the basic warranty   you have to poke around the website to figure out how to register without giving them your credit card  both of these things are  to my mind  scamming the consumer   the equipment seem sturdy  moves well  etc  but nordictrack is not doing themselves any favors by pushing the ifit activation the way they do   it certainly did not set well with us      
4961,1.0,                       i know we are in a pandemic but i wouldn t anticipate a new treadmill belt to snap at the seam after   months  the only reason i got this model is because i can t fit a huge one i my home  i am beyond disappointed  i am stuck with this thing and there will never be another belt available while the warranty is good until            i will never buy equipment from iconfitness again    months for        i am going to have to get this hunk of junk out of my home myself i bought directly from nordictrak com  they don t have any belts available and no estimates for arrival    months      
4962,5.0,                       very nice for home use  glad i happened to get this coincidentally right before the state quarantine lock down so we ve gotten a lot of use out of it  read the manual when you put it together to learn the basic maintenance of it  it seems like a lot of the negative reviews stem from operator error of people not knowing how to fix minor things  like belt alignment  and that causes them a lot of headaches that can be avoided by reading the booklet that comes with it     
4963,1.0,                       delivery was good  i started unpacking this behemoth and putting it together with the wife  we assembled the arms with ease and went to attach the console crossbar   its     inches too short its not wide enough  i would assume it was packaged with the wrong console  you can t even bend the bars inwards to attach the console  pro tip  they are metal   so after hours trying to get a hold of nordictrack we finally spoke to a human  they told my wife she got the wrong department and to call the same number we just called   times then hung up on her   when she called back they were closed so    we called amazon and they are replacing the unit  we tore up the box because its really heavy so we are unsure of how to return it  hopefully the replacement will be properly engineered and fit together     i will post again when it is delivered  ps  if you made a video on how to put this together  please do not skip steps so the audience doesn t have to see you wrestle a piece in or screw a screw  its actually helpful to watch you put it together    that s why you made the video right  took me forever to find a video wherein a person set the piece in question on the arms    and it fit perfectly in the video  so thnx for that      
4964,5.0,                       i purchased this to replace a treadmill purchased in      and that i heavily used until it wore out   i ordered the amazon assembly service when it arrived and highly recommend that service   two technicians put it together in   hour and it worked perfectly on startup   i am impressed by the clarity and color of the touch screen that opens when i turn the system on   it offers a quick entry workout video program that changes each day and displays images actually recorded at sites all over the world  the belt incline raises and lowers according to the terrain being displayed   there are also many additional videos available with more different workout scenarios that are impressive in their detail and interest   an example  a workout with a  partner  on the sidewalk along the seine river in paris  the workout winds in and out of other runners  pedestrians  sidewalk cafes  a constantly changing scene of visual and audio activity as though i were actually there doing the workout   this is a fantastic improvement over my old treadmill that only displayed  an oval track and provided no visual stimulation at all  i highly recommend this product      
4965,1.0,                       arrived broken      
4966,1.0,                       bought the t     years ago  within a year of buying it  had to get a new motor  the new one was  also faulty and it would shut off after one hour and    minutes every damn time   it was also super noisy   less than a year after that  it needed a new display board   now here it is four years later and the motor went out again  i am    years old so i am not an avid super athlete you know  they ve got some serious problems to figure out  it would be nice to find  a way to contact them by email to discuss my complaints and hope for a miracle whereby they could send me a     off coupon if i were to ever buy again  i was on the phone with them earlier today  and on hold for a good hour   considering the money i spent on that piece of junk it cost me      a year     a month to call it my  own piece of junk       
4967,3.0,                       i really like it had a lot of problems getting it arrived very late but amazin made up for itwith     more off on price     
4968,5.0,                       this review is for the t   si updated series  it is awesome  was delivered in a timely manner  they called the night before to make sure someone would be home  helped my husband drag it in the house    thank god the box has handles   it is heavy because of the motor  everything was in the box  parts tools including the i fit code card for the free   yr membership  easy set up online  it ll ask for your credit card  but will not charge it  thankfully nothing was damaged  was packed very well  it only took my husband an hr to assemble the treadmill  average instructions  very solid machine  we are very very impressed with the console  the     hd screen is just as big as my ipad  touch screen features are very cool  several classes to choose from on the i fit  love how the incline and speed automatically adjust with the instructor s workout pace  speakers are really not that bad  you can adjust volumes separately on both the instructor and the music in the background at the same time  which is another cool feature  not a real noisy machine  am satisfied with the comfort level walking on the belt  this treadmill with the added i fit personal training and wide hd screen has definitely revolutionized the walking jogging experience  helps put motivation with disciple in your workout  all in all a very solid  stylish and fun treadmill  was worth paying a little more  hope this review helps  it took my husband and i a few days of reading reviews to help us decide on the right one  and we did a lot of comparisons as well  we are very happy with our purchase      
4969,4.0,                       flex select after months of using the treadmill  i love it  except      they tout the flex select feature  unfortunately no where do they tell you how to make it softer  or firmer called nordic trac  they put you into new sales  that persons says they have no idea  i don t know about you  but i would think that customer service would know that  since it s a feature  they refer you to ifit  my favorite scam with nordic track  ifit didn t recognize my registration and said they d only talk to me if i registered the unit  one of the things you need is the serial number  i have no idea where that s at  ditto  other information great  they re selling you a feature  but don t tell you how to use it      
4970,5.0,                       great treadmill  quiet  but that is subjective so check this out  my    year old proform was so loud i couldn t hear the tv at full volume  with this i can hear fine at         so  i still have it on the loud side but it is a huge treadmill  i don t know how quiet it s going to get  assembly wasn t a big deal  the deck was alligned and lubricated from the factory  i was a little turned off that i to register it and download the app to get it to work  you only have to use the app once to activate it  after that it works like any other treadmill  there might be a way to use it without downloading the app first but i couldn t figure it out i was deciding between the horizons t     which i had seen in person  and this  which i had not  i really happy i went with this one      
4971,5.0,                       i shopped for quite awhile before i finally decided on this treadmill  i just got it last week and i ve been on it every day since i got it  it seems very sturdy  is a good size without being too small or too big and is not noisy at all  i have no idea how easy it is to assemble because i paid extra to have them assemble it  i m not a runner so i don t know what it would be like to run on but so far it s perfect for me just for walking  the only complaint i have about it is when you pause it to go to the bathroom or whatever  you can t re start it without the clock and distance starting all over but that s not a big deal for me  i just remember how much time i had on it before i get off it  as others have said  to start it without subscribing to i fit just push the i fit button for    seconds and it will start  nowhere does it say this  i found this out from these reviews  so far i am very satisfied      
4972,4.0,                       i m grateful to previous reviewers who tipped me on how to bypass ifit by pressing the app button down for about    seconds  otherwise  i would have believed all the warning signs plastered all over the packaging   what a scam   very deceptive  nordictrack  i thought you were better than that  this may scar your reputation and  frankly  i hope it does  i don t like feeling forced to buy something i simply don t need  i may eventually purchase the ifit module but only when i m ready it took my boyfriend an hour to assemble and he said it s a well built machine  everything fit as expected   i m pleased so far  i ve only had it   days  so i hope my sentiments are the same at least a year from now it does squeak and it s disappointing you can t connect your music via bluetooth  however  reviewers didn t care for the speakers so i m using my airpods instead   despite the highest set volume  i can still hear a little of the squeak   that s a little annoying the belt is fantastic  my running shoes don t slip  it s nice and wide as well as long   i m really leggy for someone who s only        aside from the intermittent squeaking  it s a great platform i m a bit disappointed with the user manual  my console is not the one that is in the manual so i m going to have to figure out some of the buttons and features on my own   i don t know if the console is for an older model or newer model  i d hate to think i got an older design       is not small beans overall  i am pleased so far   i ll remember to update my review in a few months  hopefully  nothing changes      
4973,1.0,                       took about an hour to assemble  seems to work fine but beware  what they don t tell you is that the ifit subscription isn t a perk  it is a requirement or else the treadmill won t work  it won t even work unless the phone is paired with it   luckily there is a fix  to get around this  press and hold the ifit button until it resets and then you will be able to use it like a regular treadmill   you will not find the direction to override this anywhere in the instructions  very  unprofessional for a company with this amount of a presence in the fitness community to scam customers into an unnecessary subscription when they have already spent      on this treadmill  i won t return this because it took too long to assemble  but i will not be buying from preform again      
4974,1.0,                       did not buy this item on amazon but ebay   but i wished i had bought it on amazon for the ease of returning painful  but doable assembly and the device itself runs ok however  and you need to be absolutely aware of this it cannot be started in manual mode after a while  i hesitated to register for ifit because i really see no sense in watching someone doing my workouts and paying a yearly fee on top of the hefty price of the machine itself at first it worked quite nicely to override it and start a manual workout  however a day ago this option was no longer possible and all it allowed you to do is to register for ifit or increase decrease the incline so i ended up basically with a large black brick that is completely useless for      bucks for me this is enough pain to return the item  and if that is not possible start a class action suite against this company do not buy it i could not belive     
4975,4.0,                       i like my nordictrack t   s with the exception of the ifit and monitor display controls  i really don t understand what ifit is all about  maybe i just don t get it but can t see why anyone would pay for this service  getting the treadmill to work without using ifit is a procedure  i just want it to turn on and work when i want it to work  and not have to cancel out programs and go to manual settings etc    also my unit did not come with any sort of manual so i had to research it on amazon and find a manual just to figure out how to make the thing work      
4976,1.0,                       got it friday april  rd   box looked fine but opened to find plastic base on one side was cracked   no one available at amazon or nordictrack until monday   monday   now on hold with number from nordictrack manual for  over    minutes   gonna hang up and call amazon   either the base needs to be replaced or the whole dang thing update   return and replacement approved by amazon on april  th and expected to take place april   th   just notified by carrier nsd that they have no pick up order from amazon   amazon  legally must provide the free pick up  which they approved  before their set deadline of may  th   will  update again with results no response from amazon for picking up return even though dropping new one off tomorrow   go back to my orders screen and original order gone and only says replacement order   go back to home to look at returns    that was gone and the price went up by roughly       bottom line they sent a broken machine and need to come pick it up for free     
4977,4.0,                       the walking belt would always move to the right or left side of the tread mill after several times of aligning it and it would still move to one side where it would rub against the side rails finally called the company and they said that they new about the problem and would send out new roller screws   not easy to install unless you take the back end caps off   after installing the new roller screws it looks like the belts does not move that much to   so much for the   year parts and labor   they just send you the replacement parts and we do the labor    for that price it is ok   plastic motor cover very flimsy  but i got to see once you get thru customer service they are very helpful and easy to send out replacement parts  note to start the treadmill without  ifit just press manual     
4978,1.0,                       fraud        
4979,5.0,                       i have owned my nordictrack treadmill for several years  i typically do not purchase service plans  but because i use my treadmill at least   times a week  i decided to take the chance and i am so glad i did  it has been super easy to have my treadmill serviced every year and parts replaced whenever needed  and i have never had to pay a dime for any replacement parts  the service plan has more than paid for itself  i am at the point where i now renew for   years at a time just because i am so pleased with their service plan  i highly recommend a nordictrack treadmill with a service plan      
4980,5.0,                       i ve been loyal to the nordictrack brand for the last    years  in that time  i ve had two treadmills  currently an elite        two ellipticals  currently an elite        and one upright bike  gx     pro   except for the no maintenance easy to assemble bike  i ve always had service contracts on my equipment  why wouldn t i  they re mechanical  anything mechanical is going to need maintenance and eventually repair  the service contracts i ve purchased that are backed by icon fitness have ensured that i don t have a huge repair bill when i least want it  and that i don t have to go without my equipment for an extended period of time  and i always enjoy the certified repair people that icon sends out  i always learn from them  and  at all my homes in those    years   colorado  michigan  wisconsin and now back in colorado   all the service folks have been great to work with  having the service contract also means i don t have to go out and buy new equipment  which is good for me because i don t always like the newer versions being offered  i was able to keep my first nordictrack treadmill for    years and that s the one i liked the most  upon reflection  i d say the service contract has greatly influenced my loyalty and overall satisfaction      
4981,4.0,                       overall i really like the t    s  a few things i think could use improvement    fan is useless  even at full blast  i m waiting for a clip on fan to be delivered    the side foot rails seem narrow and i have very small feet  if you have large feet i think you d either have your feet hanging off or be stepping on the belt    the    screen really is small due to black bars in the screen and that the stats appear in a thick bar across the top  i wish i d sprung for the upgraded model for a larger screen  or nordic track should give you a larger screen  it s not a cheap machine    some of the components feel a little cheap  if you tripped on the front belt cover it feels like it would break i had no problem with ifit as some other reviewers mentioned and really like the workouts  my only feedback is that there isn t as much to choose from as i had anticipated so i wonder if i ll get bored at some point or if they cycle new ones in regularly      
4982,5.0,                       have had my t     series treadmill for four weeks now and use it everyday   i absolutely love it   the ifit training is a great addition to my work outs and i love the fact that it offers cross training as well as walking running   i paid for assembly so i really can t say how easy it was to set up but being i didn t have to do it myself i gave the five stars as the assembly person was on time and very professional and friendly i truly look forward to logging many  many miles on my nordic track all whilst sweating and smiling      
4983,3.0,                       the treadmill itself offers a great workout but i do not choose to use the ifit programming  my husband got it for me as a gift so i can exercise indoors and avoid gym fees  it does not take up too much space and is foldable  amazon provided a technician to assemble the treadmill  which was very helpful  however  the ifit subscription requirement is a downer  so that removes one star  after assembly  we could not use the treadmill until we registered and activated an ifit account  they took our credit card info  we understood we were ordering a    day trial of the ifit program  which i never used  then about a month later i received a  congratulations  email notifying me about my  purchase  of an ifit program subscription  it was a one year fee of      plus tax  which i had not received advance notice of  when i emailed their customer service to attempt to cancel the subscription and get a refund  they said they could only refund a portion  about half  of the amount since i had agreed to their terms earlier  i am very disappointed in this process  it should be an option and not a requirement and consumers should be warned in advance of the additional costs  i also took one star off because i am unable to pause my workout for a couple of minutes  such as when needing to go answer the phone  etc   and pick up where i left off on the distance  timer  and progress of my workout  i have to start all over each time  i have the treadmill on a mat on carpet and there seems to be too much bounce when i am working out  other than that  it is a good machine      
4984,1.0,                       bought a treadmill from them  the incline failed on initial set up  replaced the incline motor  the circuit board  and the wiring  still does not work  now they refuse to enter my house to pick up this defective machine  despite the fact that they entered my house to deliver and set it up  do not buy nordictrack  horrible company  horrible customer service      
4985,4.0,                       everything arrived in solid condition  instructions were fairly straight forward  but really glad i read other reviews warning about the ifit com registration  terrible business practice to try and trick your customer into registering for your product  what would make more sense is to automatically give the customer    days free trial without asking for any credit card information   and then  if the customer likes it  he she can pay for a subscription service  besides that though  everything seems good      
4986,4.0,                       i was looking for a very basic treadmill  to use once in a while  particularly during the winter months   this is a fine machine for my needs  my needs include brisk to moderate walking     miles at a go  to sometimes a low jog  i don t really care about any of the exercise settings  though my husband does   my only gripe  i wish it wasn t so loud   it s not horribly loud  but i can hear it mildly on the main floor when my husband is walking on it in the open basement   nonetheless i would definitely recommend the product so far and possibly buy through nordic track instead of amazon  when i ordered through nordic track  i got a  free  fourth year warranty included by the representative  instead of the three year that was promoted   also  i went ahead and paid for the installation through nordic track  well worth the money  in my opinion      
4987,1.0,                       okay  nordic track  is made by a company  that make treadmills for other people   first  you don t need those fancy features  the are useless  a place to put your book is all you need   these things are made for people who don t use them  if you are going to stuble about  at low speed  three times a week it s fine  if you re going to use it five times a week  so it will actually be usefull  it break  two  you need something with a four horse power motor  and four inch rollers  if your going to use it all  that cost about four thousand bucks  and it will still be needed to repaired  so unless your near a repair station  don t order it      
4988,1.0,                       super disappointed in ifit and nordic trac  i recently downloaded the ifit ap to use with my nordic trac c    treadmill  the ap told me my treadmill needed an update  i started it and it stopped mid update  then my treadmill wouldnt turn on  i called nordic trac and they told me it s a common issue with the ap and treadmill  my console got fried and i need to buy a new console for       they said because i am outside of the one year warranty i have to pay for their ap frying my console  no way    if it s a common issue that they know about they should fix it  my treadmill worked perfect till i tried to use the ifit ap  i m so disappointed that the company won t replace the console because it s in issue they knew about  i never would have downloaded the ap if i knew i could fry my console   nordictrack  ifit     
4989,4.0,                       this review is more about the ifit applicationfirst the ifit pro s  the graphics are fabulous  the trainers are also fabulous  some celebrities show up to   there is a wide range of workouts for the treadmill  everything from easy hikes to endurance runs    up hill and down hill  if you don t feel like running you don t need to follow the trainer  put it on zero incline and     speed for an easy walk  great for the grand parents  you can play your own music or listen to theirs or listen to the trainer or not at all or listen to all   each has there own volume controlcons  it is a subscription service     i like working out with the trainers so i pay for it  but if you don t want it  there is a manual process and it works  ifit requires an internet wifi connection  if your wifi connection drops  there is no way to get back to the middle of your workout  you would think a programmer could fix that in a couple of hours  some of the trainers can be a little intimidating when they say keep it up and the machine is going faster then what the trainer is doing  that is when i do not follow the trainer and slow my machine down   it shows your work out compared to others and you can swear that some person put the treadmill on the fastest highest steepest setting and then jumped off to get their name at the top of the list     
4990,2.0,                       purchased it from sears  with a    yr extended service plan  on         by         the first motor finally went  i called nordictrack and they immediately placed an order for a new motor that i had to install  no problem  it was pretty straight forward by         the second motor went  this time i insisted that they send a technician to install it  he came and replaced it and i was  once again  a power walking madman fast forward to today motor number three has gone  i called to their delight and found out that not only is the treadmill getting a new motor it is also getting assy lube wlk belt d c w ri  walking platform walking belt motor belt controller all for a grand total of      moral of the story is to get a gym membership or an extended service plan when purchasing exercise equipment  service plan ends
