0,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       replaced our   year old netgear wifi extender that we have for our pool area with this one purchased with the lighting deal  our netgear extender was so obsolete that there was no app available to manage it but it had served us well over the years and decided it was time to upgrade it as the signal was becoming choppy and it couldn t handle the number of devices when having company over reading the reviews before purchasing really helped in making my decision as to what to purchase  most everyone said it was super easy to install and they were right if i can manage to do it being technologically inept  then anyone can do it so don t let that scare you away  i followed the instructions included but had already read previous reviews with tips and tricks i just plugged it in next to the router  let it do its thing and downloaded the app which is super simple to use and navigate  typed in my password to connect to the network and off i went i originally put it where the old one was  out in the pool house but via the app  it told me that the signal was weak and to relocate it and so i moved it inside  closest to the pool area  ran my signal test and viola  insta wifi had it all done and all my devices connected in five minutes i really like the fact the app tells me how many devices are connected to it  not sure why but i like it haha i don t foresee any issues but i ll update my review if anything changes      
1,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       my neighbor is gracious enough to share her wifi but i don t get a great signal throughout my place   this was the perfect fix and super easy to install  almost plug and play  i downloaded the tether app and connected the network to the extender then logged on to the new network and now have full signal through my place on every device i have on the network   all you need is the password to the desired network or access to the router and you re in     
2,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i bought this extender and installed it and everything was breeze so far  when i tested the download and upload speeds   with extender pretty much next to the router   the speeds were half of the main wifi  i called the support and we tried few things such as resetting the extender  ensuring the firmware is up to date etc and eventually the support person asked me to send screenshot of the speed differences between main router and extender to send to their engineering team  after couple of days  i heard from them for a troubleshooting session and when i send few timeslots  the next dayi heard that the half the speed from extender is expected since it is half duplex extender and whether i still wanted a troubleshooting session i was not expecting increase in speed  but i was disappointed that their product description did not say anything about half duplex and reduction in download upload speed by half  hopefully  tp link is more transparent about reduction in speed   i am returning it shortly      
3,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i used for upstairs fire stick  laptop  tablet  originally had no signal  now everything g works  love the tether app      
4,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is a little cross band repeater  kind of like your kids  hears it one place  repeats it in another in a higher pitched squeeky voice  used this to extend the range of my beloved apple airport to the far reaches of the house to talk to a ring camera and let my kids cell phone connect to the network  it knocks off some speed and adds ping time but overall does the job  pretty impressive if you ever built a cross band repeater its big and expensive and this is a little mini cheap version that does the same thing  no free goods  no compensation to write this  i just love rf and things that work with rf      
5,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is a nice package  easy to install and produces a strong wifi signal  it worked well for one day then while the wifi connection remained strong the internet connection was lost  i reset the unit with the same experience  i haven t had time to debug it  but i shouldn t have too  and i m way past the deadline for returns so i guess i either play around and get it to work or buy another vendor s product and use this one as a paperweight or doorstop      
6,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i tried all three methods in the instructions to get this re    extender connected  but no matter what i tried  i always saw the same error when trying to connect to the extender   connected  no internet       
7,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the photos are before and after i got this extender  i was using a linksys      extender that died within   months of use  i got this about an hour ago  set it up in   minutes using the app  and have already gotten  x the internet speed i had before and without this extender  i can t speak to how long this will last but considering a      extender lasted me   months and this is half the price  i would be happy if this even lasts a year  i work from home and my room is the only room in the house where the internet just drops  this has been a really great purchase for the reviews saying setup is difficult i can only assume some people don t have smartphones to set this up with or have no wps button on their router because this was insanely easy for me to set up also for the reviews saying this thing is garbage i can honestly say the issue starts with your internet  if you don t have good internet to start with then this won t magically fix that issue  i also don t think these people took the extra minute to move the extender around to see what spot it works best in  yes that matters    stars  thank you       
8,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i have a small single level      square foot home  the wifi router is in one corner of the house   i have   wifi cameras around the house on each corner of the house   the two farthest away from the router were connected but had low signal strength so i purchased this extender to give them more signal strength   i followed the instructions to set up the extender and they were fairly simple and easy to use   i proceeded to connect the cameras to the new extender  but the extender did not improve the signal strength to the camera s   and in fact the signal strength from the extender was worse than allowing the cameras to just connect straight to my wifi router   i allowed a few days to see if the signal strength would improve as suggested in a suggestion i read  however  after   days   the extender ceased to provide signal to the   cameras altogether  and my security system was compromised by those   cameras being offline for a day  until i could get home and assess the problem   i had to completely restart the extender in order to get the extender to begin sending a signal to my cameras again   this is a complete waste of time   i have never purchased such a product that actually makes things worse for the problem it was supposed to fix
