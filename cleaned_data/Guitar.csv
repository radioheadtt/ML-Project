0,4.0,                       good     
1,5.0,                       nice product     
2,5.0,                       it s perfect i love it  everything came in that was in the picture and it s just amazing        
3,3.0,                       tuning keys were very difficult to turn  you re all quality of the guitar was great other than this little issue with makes it difficult to noon and stay tune i would recommend paying a little more friendly guitar to make sure that this doesn t happen to you     
4,4.0,                       i own an electric guitar and tried to learn how to play it  i thought it was okay to learn first  but  i learned from a friend at work that acoustic is can be better for beginners  i don t make much money so i bought this one  cheap and quick to learn more  it works like any guitar would  i have found that when it was brand new  every day i picked it up to play it  the string were out of tune after i just tuned them the night before  it seems that they just aren t tight and need to be tightened a lot  they are new strings  after retuning it for   weeks everyday  it doesn t seem to come untuned again  still  pretty good bang for your buck      
5,4.0,                       just as it has stated  i got all  got   stars because each time you want to play  you have to tune it  all instruments have to be tuned  my pitch pipe is malfunction but  can tune the guitar using app on smartphone      
6,5.0,                       granddaughter loves it     
7,4.0,                       man     tuning it is impossible     
8,3.0,                       the guitar itself is decent for a beginner   the accessories that came with it are rubbish   the bag broke on the first use  so did the strap   the electronic tuner never worked and the pitch pipe sounds like a blue whale dying of emphysema      
9,5.0,                       i love my guitar    i bought this guitar a year ago after deciding on a whim that i wanted to learn guitar but not wanting to spend too much money  i was looking for a good starter guitar and this was exactly what i was hoping to find  while you can tell looking closely that this beautiful guitar is cheaply made  for example  the rosette and sound boards are both stickers rather than being built into the guitar  they don t fall or peel off so i don t mind that  but that s one specific difference in quality compared to more expensive guitars   it is good quality for the price  has good sound  and still looks like a serious guitar   it is a bit smaller than the standard size   as some others have mentioned  it falls out of tune very quickly  but that felt easy enough to me to resolve with the tuner  included   pitch pipe  included   or by tuning it to a guitar tuning video on youtube  this also comes with an extra set of strings    different style sound boards  you choose which to install put on   a pick holder that you can attach to the guitar  i love this    a set of picks  a strap  and a case  the case is not padded at all  so be careful  but i ve still been able to use it to transport my guitar and am really happy that this guitar came with it because i wouldn t have wanted to spend money on a separate guitar case at this point  the case opens at the bottom and has an adjustable strap and pocket  i haven t used the separate guitar strap because there wasn t something to attach it to the guitar on both sides  but i could have figured this out if i had tried harder  i think there might have been instructions in the other reviews oh also  another perk of this guitar is the strings and fingerboard are very comfortable  at least for me  i tried playing a friend s guitar after playing this one  and the strings were spaced a little bit higher above the finger board than this one  meaning it required me to press on the chords harder to play  playing this guitar was much more comfortable to me by comparison if you are an intermediate guitar player or more serious than i was about your long term commitment to guitar  you might want to get a more expensive guitar set but for someone like me who wants something beautiful and functional but cheap  i leave this with a very definite   star review  i am thoroughly satisfied with this guitar set  i love that it is a complete set with everything i needed to get started and an excellent value for the price  i may upgrade someday  or i may be happy with this for my whole life as an amateur guitar player  i highly recommend this guitar        
10,5.0,                       the guitar looks very nice and my son has been really enjoying learning to play it  i downloaded an app that is teaching him how to play songs  i am very happy that he is developing a new hobby  this guitar is great for beginners  it comes with a tuner  but i ve found that the app i m paying for tunes it easier  it also comes with a carrying case and pick  great value for the money      
11,4.0,                       nice       
12,4.0,                       good     
13,5.0,                       giving   stars bc i really can t find anything wrong with this package  guitar feels nice and quality and shipping was fast  blue color is beautiful  daughter loves it  she s    btw     
14,5.0,                       as other reviewers have said this stand is very sturdy and packs up very well  fits my acoustic guitar reasonably well  padding and feet are well crafted and functional however  this doesn t fit my strat or p bass at all  the slight asymmetry of the bodies won t line up well with the cradle arms  if you align the body in the arms  they lean to the side  you can adjust the width of the arms but the top pad is anchored to one of the arms  so that becomes oddly aligned with the legs at anything other than as wide as it goes  the cradle arms are welded to the frame which  i think  is the design flaw  if they were free to rotate  they could be adjusted to hold the instrument upright with one arm wider narrower than the other to accommodate slightly asymmetric bodies  note    i have a strat and fender p bass  these aren t exactly gibson explorer profiles does fit my acoustic  so i ll use it for that       
15,4.0,                       it s good  i m not a professional  but it feels cheap  aside from that it stays in tune okay and has an okay sound  it s a good deal for what it is  if you have a kid in guitar classes or want to try and learn yourself  it s not a bad buy  it truly is a   star   star beginner guitar      
16,5.0,                       kids beginner school guitar and it worked perfect for in school practice      
17,1.0,                       on the first day i received my guitar i was playing at      with my guitar and when i was done i picked it up  i didn t have a base so i leaned it on the wall and suddenly it fell and the top part of the guitar was destroyed  that is why i do not recommend this guitar         
18,5.0,                       bought it to learn  thought it would break on me    months later still hasnt

20,5.0,                       happy with product    year old daughter loves it     
21,5.0,                       i paid around     for this beginners guitar   i m into my  nd year of playing and wanted a travel guitar to take around with me and not be concerned if it got dinged up a bit while traveling  this was way better than i expected and cheaper than those practice fretboards that you see around it was well packaged and came with the following      a dust cover   extra pack of strings  it was already strung but not tuned    a pack of   guitar picks   a pick holder with adhesive backing to stick it onto your guitar  or strap i guess    a pitch pipe   an electric tuner that attaches to your guitar   a guitar strap   an adhesive backed plastic plate  for the front body where you would normally get scratches from strumming  i don t know what it s called    knobs for the strap already installed on the body and base of the necki was able to tune it out of the box  although i ll give it a few days to acclimate to the temperature and humidity of our place  and it holds it quiet well   i purchased the coffee finish which actually is lighter than the photograph  it s more of a cognac color  but is still nice to me all in all this was an excellent purchase for me  i actually wonder if they just had a warehouse full that they needed to get rid of and threw everything but the kitchen sink in just to clear it out   i don t think so though because nothing was dusty  for what i got with it  the instrument quality and the price point i give this one   stars      
22,1.0,                       my daughter bought this for my granddaughter  the included tuner wouldn t work at all  using the same phone app to tune this  instrument  as i have used to tune other guitars and my banjo  the bridge pulled out  don t know why anyone would waste their time building crap like this   at least some of the cost will be recouped by burning it in the wood stove      
23,1.0,                       over saturated in a could chemical      
24,5.0,                       looks gorgeous  the color is beautiful  i only bought it for display purposes      
25,2.0,                       the action is way too high       it will ruin any beginner s confidence bridge is plastic which will not hold for long the pain job is okay even though its cheap  no point if you cant play it well and comfortably     
26,2.0,                       just received product today  opened the box and noticed the guitar and case we re damaged  the guitar had several dot shaped scuffs on the front that won t wipe off  and the guitar case had fray s hanging all along the zipper seam  clearly no one checked it before they shipped it out  i don t recommend      
27,5.0,                       greta for my tall   yr old   she has been thrilled   i ordered more strings per my husband s request  by otherwise  everything in box and great for a child      
28,1.0,                       i understand that you get what you pay for but jesusya spent more money on packaging then the productstrap connections   brokenpick holder   brokenthere was literally trash inside the guitar   looks to be a japanese news paper and maybe a receipt lol       
29,1.0,                       if you use the strings that are on the guitar  you will ruin it  you need to use nylon strings for this instrument  the advertising is very misleading  very sad because as a nylon string guitar  it actually sounds nice and is very easy to play  this issue shou ld be resolved     
30,5.0,                       great     
31,5.0,                       this is a christmas present for my grandson  hope he likes it and learns to play it      
32,5.0,                       great for beginners   for the money i thought it wouldnt be that great  my husband and i were both very impressed when we took it out of the box  took some time to tune it right  but all in all for the price it s a good guitar     
33,5.0,                       exactly as described      
34,1.0,                       the product stated cosmetic damage when of should have started missing parts  surprisingly disappointed was my intial response  on a slight upturn returning was easy      
35,3.0,                       this guitar is aight for the price if ur gonna buy it make sure you know how to tune and  replace strings but overall for    bucks its not bad didnt expect much

42,4.0,                       great starter guitar  size is perfect along with the many accessories  the only problem we had was that there was only one place to attach the end of the strap and not the top

49,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          in the beginning the guitar isn t so bad  it didn t play amazing but it s cheap so i wasn t expecting much anyway  but it did not last  the neck cracked i don t know if just mine was defective  it s very hard to play  not worth it just buy an     dollar guitar  you can t learn how to play guitar on a cheap instrument  it will just frustrate u that u can t sound good and in reality it is the guitar  the tuning doesn t hold anymore i have to tune it after every song   the paint just keeps on chipping  and it looks horrible  i m giving it   stars cuz it was only    dollars  what guitar do u think  ur gonna get for that price anyway  it has a really warm sound and it could be a good guitar just very hard to play cuz it s made so cheap ps the video that i posted doesn t sound so good because the guitar can t stay in tune anymore     
50,3.0,                       great price for a beginner guitar with everything in the kit  it s definitely a good purchase to see if you enjoy playing guitar and want to continue  however  the action is really high so it s murder on your fingers and is tough on the sound  i am glad i bought it because i m having fun playing but i will be buying something with a better sound now that i know more      
51,5.0,                       this is a great kit for anyone who is starting to learn the guitar  you literally receive everything you need to start playing  i especially love the tuner that comes with  my only qualm is that i wish the strap was just a little bit longer to accommodate ladies that are busty      
52,5.0,                    muy bien por el precio a mi hijo le a servido mucho para sus clases

54,5.0,                       great for the buck     
55,5.0,                       my    year old bought this guitar for himself  it has a great sound  strings are easy to hold down plus it s just his size  he loves it      
56,5.0,                              
57,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my son  he absolutely loved it  this was far better than i expected when i ordered it this came with the guitar   strap   soft case   electronic tuner  pitch pipe   and numerous picks in differing colors for a beginner set up you can not do better for the price      
58,4.0,                       got it for my son s birthday and he really enjoy it     
59,2.0,                       the high pitched e string couldn t even make it to e before snapping  i used   tuners at once to confirm this as they both said it was a b including the tuner that came with the guitar  i m very disappointed as i have no experience changing guitar strings and will have to look up a youtube video on how to do this      
60,5.0,                       my grandson loved it     
61,3.0,                       this is not a modern acoustic  for what it is  it s beautiful  but it comes with the wrong strings  this is a classical guitar and needs nylon strings  if you really want this guitar  but a good set of nylon strings  steel strings will not stay in tune  the body isn t reinforced enough to handle the tension  on the other hand  if you have nylon strings it sounds great and is beautiful      
62,5.0,                       my son loves his guitar its perfect came just as described to and came fast

72,5.0,                       the guitar itself is really nice a great beginner for my    year old granddaughter the bag that comes with it is very cheap within a day or two the zipper broke all in all it comes with a tuner   picks definitely worth the money i would purchase again i had to buy another bag so i bought one a little more durable     
73,5.0,                       this is the perfect guitar for a beginner teen  buy a separate guitar bag case though  the one that comes with this guitar is too small      
74,4.0,                       sounds great  had everything included  however  when i attempted to put the strap on  it only had    peg  to attach it and not one near the neck  unfortunately that makes it difficult to play standing up           
75,5.0,                       bought for my   year old son he loved it and the whole family loved it was a great price so much came with it      
76,5.0,                       it s easy  to strum     
77,1.0,                       very poor quality  not a good choice for a beginner      
78,1.0,                       very cheaply made

81,5.0,                       wanted a cheap little guitar to play around with for learning  i m not a rock star or anything and if you aren t looking to be a major performer either i d say look no further than this  it s pretty  they give you lots as far as a beginner goes  the guitar itself sounds like you d expect a guitar to sound  it s light weight  perfect for any beginner     
82,5.0,                       this was purchased for my teen daughter who never played a guitar but she is very happy      
83,5.0,                       perfect size for purchased amount  very satisfied with item and packaging of item  will buy again      
84,3.0,                       it was okay but broke the strings at the second  class  spent more and buy something better      
85,3.0,                       when i received the item it was all scratched up and there was no charger     
86,1.0,                       please read the reviews  do not tune with factory strings  this will destroy the guitar  please restring with nylon strings  this is a classical guitar and not a traditional accustic guitar      
87,5.0,                       my son bought this for himself with christmas money   he absolutely loves it  been playing non stop      
88,5.0,                       first time playing guitar ever was a perfect purchase for me    it comes with everything you need to get started  minus perhaps a stand the ring around the hole is a sticker and the pick guard is also stick on  but playing it for an hour everyday for over a month has not caused it to come off or have any trouble the only thing its really missing is the fret markers  so i used some masking tape on the side to mark the frets  its not the greatest guitar ever but for     its absolutely amazing      
89,5.0,                       if you thinking about getting it    get it    it s an amazing starter guitar and it s come with a lot for under

91,5.0,                       purchased this guitar for my nephews birthday and might i say he loves it and me for getting it  his mother father has not found anything wrong with it so far  i will keep you posted if anything goes wrong  hopefully not because he loves it  i will try to get photos to add      
92,4.0,                       one of the strings for note a came bent      
93,5.0,                       got the blue one for my   year old  perfect for his age  was just a little big but not over bearing big  had plenty of picks  extra strings  a tuner and other goodies in the bag  he loves to sing and play the guitar but doesn t quite understand things break  with that being said perfect buy for a child      
94,5.0,                    me gusto el material        
95,5.0,                       son is enjoying this guitar      
96,3.0,                       its better than a   star rating  but not quite at a    i bought this over a year ago as my first guitar to learn on  something nice and cheap just to start out on  and it does exactly that  each time i pick it up i do have to retune it as it won t hold a note for more than a day at a time  i also had to file down some of the frets myself as the strings would rub when they shouldn t  overall i think this is a good guitar for the price  and great for beginners  the sound is pretty decent  i figured i d finally write a review for this as i m getting my second guitar  now that i ve learned how to play somewhat decent  if you re looking for the best bang for your buck in a guitar and have the extra money  check out the ibanez aw    opn      
97,1.0,                       not worth the money    pay a little more to get your moneys worth      
98,5.0,                       perfect size for my   year old grandson   very pretty and quite nice for price      
99,5.0,                       great item and a great price for a beginner      
100,1.0,                       i should have bought a legit guitar rather than this one  i cannot make proper sound with this  there was a code i ve never made and i thought that it was my fingers  one day i visited my friend s house  tried her guitar  and i now i know it was not my fingers it was the poorly made guitar  especially when you re a beginner  make sure to buy a proper guitar and not this crap or you re gonna waste your money and time at the same time      
101,5.0,                       awesome birthday gift      
102,3.0,                       pretty crappy guitar if we re being honest  but for the low price and everything included you can t really complain      
103,3.0,                       good to decide if you re really going to get into the guitar or not  very cheaply made  rosin from the handle is coming off on my hands  inclusion of an electric tuner was nice  all in all  cheap  but will help you decide if you re serious or not      
104,1.0,                       scratched   and broken upon arrival   smells toxic     
105,4.0,                       color of guitar     
106,5.0,                       bought this for my little girl and she loves it   it is a great value with the included accessories   easy to tune and get her strumming in no time      
107,2.0,                       stupid it sucks     
108,5.0,                       case is pretty cheesy but it works  great value for the money      
109,5.0,                       perfect as described     
110,5.0,                       i love it     
111,5.0,                    buen producto        
112,5.0,                       this set is great for the beginner  it s big enough for an adult and has everything you need  great value     
113,5.0,                       good start out     
114,1.0,                       this guitar is garbage  i will be returning it soon  i have tuned it so many times and still can t play it  don t waste your money  it looks used so does the guitar picks  has cracks all in it      
115,5.0,                       well worth for the price and great for beginners      
116,5.0,                       guitar is really nice  it came in good packaging  it plays well      
117,4.0,                       once the springs were broke in it played well  so far i am satisfied      
118,5.0,                    muy buen productos para unos de mis hijos de   a os  recomiendo el producto  llego en tiempo r cord        
119,4.0,                       good beginner guitar and not expensive if you decide the guitar is not for you  only issue i have  and may be my fault  is that it won t stay in tune  definitely buy at least a set or two of replacement strings and a better strap  would highly recommend a higher quality guitar for anyone more than a beginner  you get what you pay for  and shouldn t expect a perfect guitar for this price      
120,2.0,                       the sound quality needs improvement   strings are too high which makes it hard for beginners      
121,5.0,                       great      
122,1.0,                       it seemed like a good deal but it was to good to be true  it is simply cheap nock off  save the money and buy by a yahmah jr  instead of this      
123,5.0,                       my   year old loves it and it s held up well to her weekly lessons     
124,2.0,                       guitar case had a zipper attached but the piece to pull the zipper closed was missing         
125,5.0,                       a really beautiful and good quality overall  the included gadgets are really good and it s great for kids and beginners  the only issue is the strap  it s not good enough and feels weak and the end      
126,1.0,                       cheap material      
127,5.0,                       always wanted to learn to play  perfect guitar for what i wanted at a great price        
128,1.0,                       will not stay in tune   discouraged child from playing because the quality was so poor   went to a local shop and purchased a better model for not much more money and all is good   basically threw out this one  lesson learned      
129,1.0,                       i bought this as a starter guitar for my boyfriend for valentine s day  it arrived and when we took it out of the box there were chips all over in the guitar  the paint job is horrible and there are smudged fingerprints in the paint dried that way  the neck of the guitar is cracked  and the plastic things that hold the strings of the cut guitar or not even lined up and in the right spots  total waste of         
130,1.0,                       don t buy this  it sucks  you are better off paying a bit more for a real guitar from a store  the bridge isn t made correctly for the type of strings and it sounds like the strings will break while tuning  keep hands clear of strings while tuning  beginners will get discouraged while using this guitar because it sounds like garbage      
131,5.0,                       excellent beginner item  everything you need to start learning the guitar      
132,2.0,                       used little in the first year and it never held tune and is falling apart      
133,5.0,                       very pretty     
134,5.0,                       loved everything about it it s perfect for adults and even my  year old daughter finds its very lo eggy and easy to carry around when she wants to sit down and play around with it         
135,5.0,                       i loved this product  i  myself am a beginner guitar player  i love how it comes with extra strings  a guitar tuner  and several different sized picks  even though i play using my hand   although you have to be careful when tuning as a beginner  the high e string snapped on the first day because of me  but it was very easily replaceable      
136,5.0,                       my kid loves it     
137,5.0,                       just as the pictures     
138,5.0,                       i haven t had my guitar too long  but so far i have been practicing every day  looks pretty  sounds great      
139,5.0,                       this is a great starter set  perfect size to learn the basics  easy to tune and comes with everything you need      
140,2.0,                       all the strings on this guitar are strung backwards     
141,3.0,                       the guitar is small for a adult but for a preteen or teen its perfect the quality is good for the price  i recommend       
142,5.0,                       love it  wish it would come with a book or video     
143,1.0,                       okay i know it is very cheap for a guitar but its basically trash  it was missing a knob to hold the strap  the tunner fell apart as it was being taken out of the box  the guitar wouldn t even tune  i saw other bad reviews that it was cheaply made but my little sister is a beginner and i thought that it would be perfect but she cant learn on a guitar that cant be tuned  just a waste of money      
144,2.0,                       i bought this guitar as a beginner and at first  you think it s a really good value because it looks good  has a ton of stuff in the box like a tuner and picks but as you peel back the layers you find out it s not what it seems to be   first  the       strings are weak and broken  out of the box   and while the box did come with replacement strings as a guitar  for beginners  who is going to replace there own strings  on top of that the ones included are roughly the same quality as the broken ones and i bet won t last secondly  most guitars have dots along the frets  the metal bars  to help beginners to learn the different frets and get more used to hand placement  this guitar has them but very faded the same color as the body and almost non exsistantthird  the included tuner is terrible and not accurate so i had to use a third party app to tune and one would think a beginner guitar would be already tuned because beginners don t know how to tune but out of the box it is far from itover all don t recommend     
145,5.0,                       good beginner guitar     
146,4.0,                       guitar came missing a string     
147,5.0,                       bought this as a gift for my husband and he loved it      
148,4.0,                       it came just as should have been  no problems      
149,5.0,                       absolutely love this item well worth the amount paid     
150,3.0,                       this guitar is for a lefty  but that wasn t a major problem  you just do a switch a roo  but the case for it had no no zipper  how do you expect me to get the guitar in there without an opening  it was hilarious      
151,5.0,                       love this  buy it  perfect as described  recommend      it came a fast  just as pictured  packaged with care      
152,4.0,                       it s a nice beginner set  my daughter like it   i feel that is all that matters      
153,5.0,                       my son bought this with his birthday money and loves it  looks good  came with a lot of accessories  the zipper on the cover broke quickly but i was ok with that  as we also bought a more functional carrying bag anyway      
154,1.0,                       what a disappointment   i know that     shouldn t buy much  but i think a     kids toy would stay in tune better than this junk   if you tune one string  by the time you get to the others  they will all be out of tune   in addition  the way the strings are positioned above the frets so high  it will be a severe challenge for anyone to hold a chord note      
155,3.0,                       very hard to keep in tune  every few mins i have to tune it  picks are very low quality plastic    case is a cheap  thin plastic  will not protect much at all other than maybe from scratches  would not buy again but you get what you pay for      
156,5.0,                       great      
157,3.0,                       guitar and package was great however  guitar case had broken zipper   i have emailed the company twice about getting a new case and i even complained to amazon service department and have gotten no response      
158,1.0,                       trying to find box to return guitar  threw it out when i saw the worms return label has  lithium battery  all over it    which is not the case guitar sitting in garage while we try to locate a box can t wait to get rid of this item      
159,5.0,                       gift     
160,3.0,                       a string broke right after i opened the box but i fixed it     not to horrible for a kids first guitar      
161,2.0,                       a broken string     
162,4.0,                       i bought this guitar about a month ago to learn to play  for a beginner it s great to learn how to play on  the tuner works great and it s comfortable to hold and sit with  i m short and have small fingers so he size is perfect for me  i do notice that when i am playing and i am strumming a bit too hard the strings make a humming sound  yes they re in tune i always check before beginning to play and make sure my fingers have correct placement as well  but if i strum just a bit softer the buzzing goes away  that s really the only negative thing i have to say about it  other than that it s a pretty good guitar to learn with  for the price it is      
163,5.0,                       great present     
164,1.0,                       i understand you get what you pay for  but this guitar is for my son s  th birthday present and is scratched everywhere on the face of it  the packaging was decent so it was scratched before placed in the foam bag  very poor pride in their work  i am sure he probably will not notice but i feel bad that his birthday present looks like crap      
165,5.0,                       value for money  excellent choice for beginners      
166,5.0,                       fun     
167,5.0,                       i love the guitar  i love the color and it plays really well  i also like how much stuff it came with as well      
168,5.0,                       such a lovely guitar  i love it so much  it s very calming  mine came with a tiny chip of wood taken off but i don t mind      
169,5.0,                       love the color  good small guitar for younger people      
170,4.0,                       it plays well and was in good condition when received  as expected      
171,1.0,                       is this guitar a left handed guitar       
172,4.0,                       kids christmas gifts     
173,5.0,                       my son loves it  great for beginners      
174,5.0,                       it s perfect  i was a little skeptical but the guitar and accessories are great      
175,1.0,                       the e string was unable to get tightened properly causing the whole guitar to be useless  don t get it unless you re prepared for a defect      
176,4.0,                       for women or younger adults  this might be a good beginner guitar  for men  it s way to small and the fret spacing is way to close together  also  it needs constant retuning and   string has already snapped while in the case  which makes for an interesting adventure at  am     
177,5.0,                       i think i created the next naz x lol my nephew loves this guitar and plays this thing constantly     
178,5.0,                       everything was good     
179,4.0,                       it s good for beginners for the value      
180,1.0,                       this guitar just doesn t make any sence  it wont hold a tune to the point of snapping the nylon strings it came with in the effort to stretch and tune stretch and tune stretch and tune  replacing the strings with quality ones we ve used on other guitars  after repeated stretching and tuneing  we discovered something wonky in the raised fret bars that cause vibration and note distortion  this thing s junk  don t waste your time or money   or blood  unless you want a derpy looking wall decoration  because that s all it s good for      
181,5.0,                       i like that is affordable for everyone and and it s brings everything that a     dollar one will bring     
182,3.0,                       string broke first day      
183,5.0,                       as a introduction for my nieces into music      
184,1.0,                       i can t believe the neck snapped after less than   months of use   wow     
185,1.0,                       never stayed tuned      
186,1.0,                       we were so excited about this little guitar  well not little but for teenager  the craftsmanship is not good  which would explain the price  it s a beautiful guitar but it doesn t sound right no matter what you adjust  we would take it to a guitar specialist big that would come         which we paid around       not worth it  donating it to salvation army     
187,5.0,                       great first timers guitar      
188,1.0,                       trash the guitar vibrates bc the first   chords touch the bar closest to the end unplayable trash causes nasty vibration     
189,4.0,                       great       
190,4.0,                       you get what you pay for  i recommended just getting a nicer guitar such as a fender     
191,3.0,                       my daughter loves her new guitar    great upgrade from the toddler guitar    update   have not had guitar for a month and string holder is coming up  tuned guitar using tuner  so strings were not over tightened  just seems cheaply made     
192,5.0,                       great material and sound     
193,2.0,                       the guitar is a beautiful color with unique details  however  it is not tunable     
194,5.0,                       thank you i have recieved my package     
195,5.0,                    buen producto me gust  mucho  buena la guitarra        
196,5.0,                       this guitar is beginner friendly in that you don t invest a lot  but you do have to know how to tune it  tuning mobiles apps are available and accurate  so i will recommend using an app and instead of the tuner that is included in the pack this review is written     months after i brought the guitar  since which i ve been playing for half an hour almost every day  it s great in combination of a youtube course to help you navigate the learning curve  nothing broke so far  and i m looking to spend a year on my skills with this guitar before moving on to an intermediate level      
197,5.0,                       my daughter loves it     
198,5.0,                       it s a little bit little then a regular guitar but it s great for beginners     
199,1.0,                       the strings fall of easily  very hard to tune the guitar      
200,5.0,                       my grandson loved it   great product and good price   has been in use since we received      
201,5.0,                       totally worth the price     
202,4.0,                       it s a smaller guitar perfect for my    year old grandson      
203,5.0,                       great guitar for begginers my daughter loves it and the color     
204,5.0,                       great product  great service      
205,4.0,                       nice beginners guitar for the price     
206,1.0,                       i was very disappointed with this guitar  would not hold the tune  was taken to a guitar shop hoping they could get it to tune  and was inform i really wasted my money on this item  was poorly made  item not returned  i left it at the store to give to a child  because i could not use it to learn guitar      
207,4.0,                       really good beginner guitar     
208,5.0,                       very accurate on color as seen in photo  fits to size      
209,5.0,                       great product for the price     
210,5.0,                       surprisingly good value for the money  actually stays in tune  sounds a little bright  imagine because of the inexpensive wood  but for the money you can t go wrong  there s simply nothing wrong with it      
211,3.0,                       nice looking  only it s not the guitar that was in the picture  hard to tune and stay in tune but it s not high quality  good for beginner      
212,4.0,                       good for beginners     
213,5.0,                       grandson loves it a great beginner guitar     
214,1.0,                       the strings of this guitar got broken on the second day i got it  buy something around           that s good quality for beginners      
215,1.0,                       just got my guitar  very excited as i had a lesson the same day  the guitar loses tonality every   minutes  so i have to return it  the tuner doesn t have a battery  i will look for something better and spend more next time  probably at a store as now i have to organize the return of this large box which is a pain      
216,5.0,                       when i  st got the package i was so excited   i ordered this for my niece for christmas   she wants to learn how to play a guitar  love the color it s so gorgeous   and the cost is really good   i am getting extra stuff for the guitar all for a very awesome price  the other companies charge more for the extra stuff     
217,5.0,                       this is perfect for my sons first guitar      
218,3.0,                       nice starter instrument but tuff to tune  strings seemed to loosen quickly      
219,3.0,                       it was delivered right on time as promised  i love all the bonus items  and the blue color is amazing  unfortunately  it does not hold a tune and that is the only reason why i would not recommend it      
220,5.0,                       great     
221,1.0,                       i opened the box  took the guitar  tuned and then tried to play and then put it back in the box and called for a return and refund  it is that bad  there was some kind of making defect in this guitar  the sound is horrible  this guitar made the poor tuner crazy  the whole deal looks lucrative  but don t fall for it  i have played more than    guitars in my life  but this is surely the worst one     
222,1.0,                       broken tuning peg upon arrival  didn t even get to try to play it   and no battery in the tuner   ordered another one and it just sounds awful on the high e   even after tuning   i guess it s ok to learn with but the sound is awful it s really too small for an adult   i m a woman      and i m having a hard time      
223,1.0,                       don t buy  the craftsmanship is horrible and won t stay in tune      
224,5.0,                       great buy      
225,5.0,                       my    yr old collects and dabbles in playing multiple musical instruments  he is pleased with this guitar  seems like decent quality  i don t play so i can t speak to performance      
226,5.0,                       a starter for my musical granddaughter at     she loves it      
227,5.0,                       pretty good     
228,5.0,                       great guitar  very esthetically pleasing      
229,2.0,                       the body is very cheaply made and  it looks it  but the worst thing was that it would not stay tuned for more then just a few minutes  buy something better     
230,4.0,                       great guitar  i m having a lot of fun with it  the only problem i m ran into it so far after a couple of weeks is that the tuner doesn t really fit on the end that well  just a tad bit too small      
231,4.0,                       good for the price     
232,5.0,                       my daughter was so happy to get this and is in the process of teaching herself to play  she is very happy with it      
233,5.0,                       when you buy this product  you are not just buying the guitar itself  you are buying the digital tuner  extra strings  travel case  guitar picks  etc  this is basically the perfect kit for anyone with zero experience with a guitar because you don t have to worry about going out and buying these individual items some people are hard about the sound that the guitar makes  but to me it s very beautiful the biggest pro about this item is that it ships in a way that protects the guitar during shipping  the guitar is packaged in a box inside a bigger box to protect it      
234,4.0,                       i bought this for a gift for my granddaughter  within a couple of weeks  the neck of the guitar was separating from the body   we were just outside the return policy period  i reached out to the company in hopes they would help me  they were over the top helpful  they immediately guided me through re ordering and sent another out right away   communication was great  customer service was great  the new guitar has been great  i think it must have just been a fluke that the first one was faulty  good company who backs their product      
235,3.0,                       the first day one of the strings popped off  my    year old daughter being a beginner doesn t mind but still not happy with the situation      
236,4.0,                       item as described  all accessories and extras included  zippered case is nice  very fast shipping  nice  inexpensive guitar      
237,5.0,                       my granddaughters love it      
238,3.0,                        gettingwhatyoupayfor     
239,1.0,                       it broke just trying to tune it  i saw someone else say it in the reviews but didn t believe it would happen to me  learn from my lesson  don t buy this guitar      
240,1.0,                       the sticker that was around the center was all cracked apart and the gutair itself was so thin it snapped when i tried to file off the remaining of the sticker not worth the money i put in to purchase it      
241,5.0,                       not a good case but then it s a inexpensive guitar      
242,5.0,                       this guitar is so good  i tried a couple weeks and its quality is great  the color is bright and i like it so much  the best fit for beginners       
243,4.0,                       quality isn t that good  doesn t sound that good  the rope broke easily values not bad anyway     
244,5.0,                       my daughter loves it  carries it everywhere      
245,3.0,                       a cheap guitar  but you get what you pay for  the accessories were a good quality  i bought it so my kid wouldn t be hauling my really nice guitars to school and back for class  it s good if your kid doesn t know if they will get into it or not      
246,5.0,                       bought it as a gift for my dad lol he wants to learn to play  great beginner guitar       
247,1.0,                       if you are seriously considering learning to play  don t buy this guitar  it is untunable and i bought a quality guitar just two days after i received this one  might be good for kids if they ll be into it for two seconds  otherwise i am currently using this as a wall decoration      
248,4.0,                       ok     
249,1.0,                       very disappointed  i couldn t use either tuner included but found an app that worked great  unfortunately  while tuning the guitar  i discovered that one of the string pegs wouldn t stay in place  after all that   unusable      
250,4.0,                       i bought this for my husband  he said it s a good guitar for beginners  the quality and everything is good  so if your a beginner it s a good item to start with      
251,5.0,                       first of all  i am grateful  i didn t have a guitar one day  and two days later i m ready to start a band  and hold up  not only did i get the guitar  i got a case   and pics and all this other stuff i didnt even know i needed   less than    bucks   if you have extensive knowledge and skill  this is not for you  this is for the humble beginner   the passionate artist with a newfound desire   for the price  i thought i was buying barbie accessories   i wouldn t pay a penny less for something that holds so much value  in the right hands   i put   stars for craftsmanship because no it ain t perfect for someone who is used to high quality  much more expensive instruments  also the dark coffee color i thought i was recieving was a lot lighter than advertised  but with the effortless shopping method and shockingly prompt delivery  i couldn t be more impressed      
252,5.0,                       great guitar for the price   plays a little sharp but is to be expected with lower quality materials   again i emphasize for the price it s absolutely worth the money   i am a novice player and found the tone  playability  craftsmanship  and paint job to be surprisingly good   it comes with two pick guards  i chose this one in the picture   so just sitting it looks like an old martin hummingbird guitar  i digress   it s worth every penny i love it      
253,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift to donate to toys for tots  i cannot attest to it s sound quality but the guitar looked nice and seemed decent for a reasonable price  although it was well packed  the overall appearance of the packaging it came in was plain and uninspired compared to others i have purchased for the same purpose in years past      
254,5.0,                       we are more than happy with this starter guitar  i wanted to make sure my preteen would like it and stay interested before buying a more expensive one  it comes with all you need to get started      
255,2.0,                       guitar looks used   not sure as to why  neck looks like peeling and there s scratches all over      
256,3.0,                       it looks like a little bruised and scratched but maybe that s the factory     
257,5.0,                       i bought this beginning guitar for my daughter to use in a class   she did   it worked well   it gave us everything but a music stand to get her started   she didn t like playing the guitar but it wasn t the guitar s fault      
258,5.0,                       very good set for the price     
259,5.0,                       birthday gift for    year old son he loves it worth the money spent     
260,1.0,                       good evening i had difficulty with guitar the guitar arm is very small and narrow i did not good that i want the return of my money    excuse me        
261,5.0,                       a great kit for starters my brother has been playing guitar for over    years and even he was impressed with the quality of the guitar and all the products it came with      
262,5.0,                       great value for the price  my granddaughter loved it      
263,5.0,                       great beginner guitar     
264,5.0,                       it came with everything they said  it s the perfect size for my son and got here in a good condition  beautiful color and the tuner works  thought it will be just a toy but no it s a good instrument and when we ll play it produce a very fine music      
265,3.0,                       this did not come with the accessory s shown in picture  what up with that and what can be done about it  could you let me know please  thank you     
266,1.0,                       very cheaply made  was cracking around the thin wood that it is made of      
267,5.0,                       perfect to start learning and playing guitar with my kiddo       
268,5.0,                    exelente me encanta        
269,3.0,                       this guitar can not be tuned using the guitar bag its not very good quality at all very filmsy and light weight strings arent very good     
270,3.0,                       already has notes that won t play      
271,2.0,                    se tiene que afinar cada vez que se usa         
272,1.0,                       the neck was already warped when purchased  it wont stay in tune  the battery tuner doesn t work well either  this is still a toy not an instrument  very disappointed in this product as i was going to teach my son with it  waste of money      
273,5.0,                       it s been a great purchase     
274,5.0,                       just a perfect gift for my husband   he loved it        
275,4.0,                       this is a great guitar for the price  it sounds really nice and the strings are good quality  perfect for beginners or if you need a small guitar      
276,1.0,                       i didn t like the strings  it seems like it doesn t belong to the guitar  it had a crack on the back      
277,4.0,                       was very satisfied i gifted myself the guitar      
278,2.0,                       was trying to tune it    the strings broke to easily   so i would say it s not for a younger beginner      
279,5.0,                       so far so good my son loves it teaching himself how to play from youtube     
280,1.0,                       other than d cor for the wall this guitar is useless   the strings are at least     inch from the frets and there is no adjustment  that makes it useless  and very difficult to play      
281,5.0,                       by husband loves his bday present  infact so much we got the pink     guitar for my granddaughter  i m excited to see them playing together      
282,4.0,                       this is great overall  however  when i tried fretting some barre chords no matter how many adjustments i made to my fingers the sound wasn t very clean      
283,5.0,                       perfect starter set           
284,2.0,                       comes with a bunch of crap that you don t need  the design is a nylon string guitar  yet the manufacturer put steel strings on it  which will damage the instrument   once you get proper strings on it  it sounds okay  but if you re looking for an actual beginner guitar  pay a little more for a better instrument  your experience will be much more positive if you do      
285,1.0,                       when our son opened it for christmas one of the strings was already broken so he hasn t even tried it waiting to go to school for guitar teacher to help might be sending it back son is very disappointed in his new gift  this was only thing he asked for christmas     
286,5.0,                       my daughter loved it for christmas      
287,5.0,                       gift     
288,5.0,                       i donno a lot about guitars but this one is pretty good except for one of my strings kept popping out so i had to fix it     
289,5.0,                       this guitar is even more beautiful in person  i haven beber played guitar before  so i will be a big time beginner but my nephew plays and when i showed him it turns out he has the same one and he said it s a good guitar  i can t believe the price  definitely a good purchase      
290,5.0,                       in wish i had a small video to upload  my son absolutely loves it  i woke up from a nap hearing him play and it was beautiful  very soothing sound      
291,4.0,                       it is a begginers guitar  nothing fancy  the strings are ok  you might want to get new ones  do remember that new strings are always going to need tuning every time you are going to play  that is not a guitar s fault  it s basically the strings adjusting themselves to the tension  let s be honest  it is a cheap guitar  when you hold it it does fell cheap  like it s going to break at any time  i ve been using it for almost a week  and i m concerned it s going to break  and eleven though was cheap  money wise  it still money invested and i dont want it to break sound  with the strings that comes with it  it s ok i do advice getting new ones it does have a paint smell  specially the cover  but after a day or two it comes off   the cover might need more time the picks are nice  different thicknessthe tuner it s good  even though i don t know how to use properly  which is my fault
