0,1.0,                       warning  these masks do not provide a proper seal  the nose piece is flimsy  i do not believe these are fda approved and will report them  false advertising     
1,3.0,                       workmanship appears adequate   made in china apparently for chinese size heads   ear loops are short and uncomfortable but do appear to be well anchored   overall measurements seem designed for smaller faces   definitely not suitable for beards   nose piece is adjustable but it takes more work to get it to fit properly than flat masks   i think i could only recommend this for small to medium faces without beards      
2,1.0,                       these masks made our throats hurt  even causing canker sores  there is something nasty in these  they are good construction and comfortable  but whatever is in them isn t clean  used   masks total and now it s a waste  rather wash fabric masks and be blinded by fogged up glasses than have to wear these again  don t buy      
3,2.0,                       these mask seems to be of decent quality but they have a small surface area  especially from the top to bottom   if i move my jaw just a bit  like when talking  the mask will slip down on my nose   don t know if they would work for someone with a small face as the ear straps seem to be average length have bought other k   masks that are slightly bigger  just as good if not better quality  and fit perfectly      
4,5.0,                       i work in a hospital and these masks are very comfortable and have a tight but comfortable seal   the only minor problem is after wearing them for several hours  they are just a little bit hard to breathe in  we don t use anything else though   we feel very well protected      
5,5.0,                       it s a mask    function  rather than fashion  is paramount   these masks offer full multi layer protection with just enough interior space to allows for breathing   ear loops are comfortable with adequate stretch   mask seals comfortably against face for good protection   and these masks also come with instructions for cleaning      
6,5.0,                       we ordered these and have been wearing them at work for the past   weeks  these are kn   masks and provide much more protection than the cloth or disposable ones we were using  they re comfortable to wear  much easier to breathe  fit snugly around your face while leaving space for you to talk without having to keep repositioning the mask  don t fog your glasses  and fold up neatly when you take them off  they are also reusable  simply let it air out for a few days before using it again  you can use one  set it aside  use a different one the next day  set it aside  same for a few days  and then start the rotation all over  don t use soap and water or alcohol based desinfectant to clean them  just rotate them  airing them out before using them again      
7,3.0,                       i see it has been written that they have dozens of holes punched in them  i thought so at first as well but if you look at the outside of the mask in a bright light you will see that the  holes  are actually heat welded seams  they reflect light  they are solid heat welded areas that are more transparent  so they can appear to be holes  but they are not holes at all the masks are comfortable  but they do not pass air nearly as well as what i am used to with a  m or especially a moldex n   mask  nor do they seal as well around the nose  for me anyway  they suck tight to your face when you breathe in i d say they are as good as the typical disposable  medical  type mask a lot of people wear and that seem to be acceptable for reducing the risk of contracting bugs  those don t really seal around the perimeter at all if the filter medium restricts air more  then more air will slip through the perimeter  thus unfiltered so i would not wear them around serious risk areas or for construction where you are trying to filter out drywall dust  fiberglass dust  etc personally i doubt that they meet the usa n   specifications      
8,5.0,                       some have said that these are really   or   layer masks  but they are not  i cut one apart and easily found four layers   but by looking close and tearing them apart  the white material inside the black material is two thin layers  so these truly are a   layer mask  i have a little trouble being understood sometimes while wearing them  but i would rather have the extra thickness that you don t have with the standard surgical masks  i was double masking as advised by the cdc  but with these masks it is not necessary  they make me feel much safer  one review was written by a nurse who recommended these  and that is a good enough review for me  i recommend these masks      
9,1.0,                       these are not in    masks and they are pretending to be that so there is a truth in advertising thing going on here  for untruth rather  deja flimsy and they don t smell good     
10,5.0,                       my mask fits like a glove and i think i m getting more protection  my wife s face is a little smaller and she does a lot of typing  she says looking down a lot causes the mask to touch her eyes and is not as comfortable      
11,5.0,                       i purchased these three months ago and work in congregate care for children and am in daily direct contact with children and adults  so far  so good  i wear these all day every day and forget i m wearing it  i have them on hooks labeled monday through friday and will reuse a few times before switching out  i ve been contact traced but have luckily never gotten covid thanks to several safety precautions  one of which are these masks      
12,1.0,                       not sitting with a hot glue gun to reinforce the elastic straps so that they don t snap pop off of the actual mask fabric i would look elsewhere of course  must of these masks are made by the chicoms  so it s hit or miss with the quality they don t believe in quality control this product shows this to fact      
13,4.0,                       i feel very well protected when i wear this mask  the only issue i have is that it can get very warm on your face   i feel it doesn t breath very well so i wear it only for a short period of time when going in and out of stores  restaurants  etc   i would not wear it working out in a gym      
14,5.0,                       ordered the black and white masks  arrived fast and packaged well  the masks are well made  soft and comfortable  fit my face and my husbands face very well  the nose part can be formed to fit snuggly around your nose  highly recommend      
15,1.0,                       mask material is very stiff and very scratchy due to the way the seams are sealed  i couldn t wear it comfortably for more than a minute  it also is impossible to get a decent fit even with added strap tighteners   air still leaks  a lot  out of the top   i m a big guy  but even so these can t fit  use a blue procedure mask with a cloth mask over it and if that works for you then you ve got more than this mask provides   just don t buy this turkey      
16,5.0,                       i ve been using these masks  throughout the pandemic  i like them and as i am a nurse i m very confident of recommending them  they are comfortable and soft  wear as recommended  i use one per week on average and spray them with alcohol and allow it to dry each time i use them      
17,5.0,                       i amvery sastify with this mask  i did two test to find out if are good and it pass the test    test is put water and see if links  if is a bad one will link    blow a candle or lighter  i did and it pass the test   i feel happy to find a mask that pass this test   recently i bought a different mask and it fail the test  so i did return them      
18,5.0,                       these masks fit very nicely on my larger face and my wife s smaller face  as both of us wear glasses  the vertical fold style fits over our noses and when pinched with the built in metal nosepiece reduces fogging better than anything else we ve tried we wear them under the three layer washable gildan cloth masks we bought back in the summer  and the fit saves us from having to try and jam the cloth mask up under our glasses and up against our eyes to get it secure  and the washable cloth masks protect these masks from as much exposure  so we hang them on command hooks to let the germs die  and rotate through a few of them each week   it helps to number them  so you don t forget which ones you ve worn when  i like that these are fused masks  not stitched that s what the lighter spots are  the synthetic filter layers have been heat fused together  and the wider fused base that gives the straps seems to make them much more secure to the mask than other disposables i ve used these seem to be legit  the packaging has its own batch numbering and they come with a stamped slip showing that they re the chengde masks that have been tested  and it s much harder to smell things when i m wearing one  even as breathing is not a problem  so i m going to say they re at least adequate at filtration      
19,2.0,                       i was hoping to finally find a comfortable n   or kn   mask and have a few to spare but these are not one size fits all adjustable  messing with the nose piece does virtually nothing  i would have to cut around the chin area if i don t want to look like i have jowls  there is no  seal  between by face and the mask anyway so i can t use these effectively at work  this size is way too spacious for a thinner faced adult so i m doubting any child who hasn t been photoshopped would be out of luck as well      
20,5.0,                       it s a good mask  fits tighter than surgical mask i had been using for covid     which i m told is important   because of that  the strap fits tighter at ears requiring a second or two of extra adjusting   worth the effort for the five layers and tighter fit      
21,5.0,                       these masks are thicker than the standard amazon mask most common in the market they pass air acceptably well for non physical activities i do not believe any mask on the market actually prevents the passage of the chicom virus much less any other virus  the diameter of the bug is much smaller than the filtration level of most  prophylactic  masks not using a contained air source      
22,4.0,                       this is exactly what i needed for some extra exercises since my local gyms are still closed  i would have rated it a   except for the rubber ends for the feet wont go in  but no big deal there      
23,3.0,                       there are lots of positive reviews here and i don t mean to discredit any of them  but regardless of how comfortable these are  they are not on the approved list  there is an image in the product description that shows a letter supposedly from the fda  while i am not disputing its validity  i did google the eua number that appears in the letter and it took me to a site which said  in essence  that these are not fda approved  having said that i will also add that i am not returning mine  these are beautifully made and have many layers  i m sure it offers adequate protection  i m only giving it three stars because it is being advertised as if it is an approved kn   and it is not  so take that into account when ordering      
24,5.0,                       i purchased these because they are n   foldable masks  initially they seem to have a bit of an odor when taken out of the package  but that odor goes away quickly   people wearing eyeglasses can will experience glasses fogging up  but not bad   i shared what i purchased with some friends   they seem to like them too   i would recommend these as a purchase that is useful      
25,4.0,                       i bought them because they were kn   and black  i had some in white but thought black would look better  they fit very well  the elastic band is not too tight so my ears are comfortable but  they do have an initial smell i suspect is due to the black dye  i found that taking a set out of their plastic bag  they come in sealed groups of    which is a plus  for a day to air out  the smell goes away  but that is why i give only   stars   would buy again      
26,3.0,                       this could be a great product  but the bands that go behind the ears are too small  so the mask doesn t stay on my face  i ll find a workaround  but unless you have a small head  this product may not fit     
27,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          these mask are perfect becaaue the other ones i was using sat directly on my lips and made me feel like i was suffocating  although these ones give me a bird like look they make it so i feel like i can breath  they re also layers which offers extra protection      
28,5.0,                       well made   comfortable   seems to seal as well as anything i ve had on my face   and most importantly  when i inhale the material stays in place and doesn t try and smother me like the cloth masks i ve been wearing for the last year   i ll be buying more      
29,4.0,                       this us very comfortable  it doesnt hurt your ears and the thickness is perfect  the only con to thiscprofuctviscthat it doesnt securely fit around nose guard  seal is loose  fir protection i would say cover with a medical mask to secure this or you can pinch the gaurd very tightly together at tip of nose so that air dosnt get in or out  overall  i like      
30,5.0,                       these  masks are a little  thicker and you can breathe better     
31,5.0,                       the mask was really comfortable and provide no air gaps in between the face and mask  i really liked them     
32,5.0,                       first time using the n   face mask  for personal protection from the covid     i m actually using it   at the same time   with one blue surgical mask  for extra protection  got used the n   no problem  i can definitely feel a huge difference in the breathing airflow  for sure   black looks stellar      
33,5.0,                       fits well  i m       i wanted a mask that sealed better then the surgical masks  most  masks are big on me  this is better im hoping it is as protective as it s supposed to be  i read to look for  gb           in the kn   masks  this has that designation      
34,5.0,                       these are light and snug  and the clever design keeps it in shape and away from your nose and mouth  the four layers  metal insert that bends to match your nose shape  and sturdy ear straps keep this mask in place  it s airtight enough to flex slightly as you breathe  but thin enough that there s little resistance  altogether the best masks we ve tried  supposedly meets eu and us standards for filtration  too      
35,1.0,                       don t buy these   so poorly made that they likely are not effective for the purpose   straps snap off with slight tension   i tried repairing them enough that i could still use them but became so frustrated that im just sending them back for refund   theres no way i can depend on these masks to protect me and my family      
36,5.0,                       i love the fit  not enveloped around my nose and lips which provides for better speech  the five layers offer better protection as opposed to double masking and they clean up real well   washing   for multiple usage  it has taken me a bit of adjustment to the five layers in that my breathing initially was labored  but i ve adapted  now if only i could adapt to doing three miles on the treadmill  mission impossible  sorry pf      
37,4.0,                       my glasses still fog  supposedly related to the fit  but i did have a good seal   frustrating i do like that i don t get lip irritation with this mask   plan to wear them for work travel with a cloth mask over top during this pandemic      
38,5.0,                       i like that they re black  i like that the fda recognizes them as legit  i like that they can be easily folded flat and kept clean  i like that they don t take double masking  i like that they fit closely but don t collapse against my face when i inhale i use them to keep from dying of the plague      
39,3.0,                       update  the seller was kind enough to contact me and provide a full refund  i really appreciated that this mask allows air to freely flow through  there are air holes and i do not appreciate this at all  these are in no way shape or form suitable for medical grade      
40,3.0,                       the mask itself fits well  unfortunately  the elastic straps are too short so they bend your ear forward  i have a small face but find the mask uncomfortable and irritating to the ears  might be ok for children rather than adults      
41,5.0,                       i can t say how effective it is   the ads say       what i can verify is that they are comfortable to wear   they are thick enough for me to assume they are safe   i will rebuy     
42,5.0,                       awesome quality  very classy  i actually got compliments at the post office  ppl asking where i purchased  it s thick also  so i don t worry about double masking  it s so easy to breathe in these  def nothing like i have purchased before      
43,5.0,                       i bought these in black because they were out of white  then got white pack  love both  its hard to find the right fit of  n   ish  masks  most are too big  this one is just right for me  gave some out to coworkers  fit them too  love the v cone shape  mask doesnt get sucked into mouth when talking or breathing  good value i think      
44,4.0,                       first  to clear some confusion  these masks are on the fda eua list   chengde is on the list not this specific brand as the list  is by manufacturer not brand   all chengde masks  including the wwdoll  chisip and others made by chengde would be approved the masks seem to be of excellent quality     layers and very well made  yet comfortable and lightweight   the nose band adjusts nicely to fit the face  or at least as well as they can i think   i cannot make them airtight   there is leakage at the top near the eyes and in fairness i don t see a way to make these seal completely unless i m missing something   but with normal breathing  that is very minimal my only issue is with the elastic ear loop   although wide and more comfortable than most  there is no way to adjust the loop easily and this results in some of the leakage i described above and also causes the mask to slide down the face a bit after an hour or so of wear   since all faces are different shapes and sizes  it is a difficult for elastic to be completely effective without an adjustment to take up some slack and i would think chengde could come up with something without increasing the cost much   i do not have a small face   i m      with medium build and still had to invent an adjustable loop knot to take up bit of the slack so i could get a tighter fit and it works fine i still highly recommend the mask with that one caveat      
45,5.0,                       these masks work very well  they have a good seal around my face  there are reviews saying that there are a bunch of holes  i looked at mine before i used it  these are the places where the masks are melted together and if you hold it up to the light it looks see through  these little  holes   it s melted and looks like plastic  no holes  i tried blowing out a lighter and the flame didn t flicker the tiniest bit  i will definitely get these again      
46,5.0,                       i get a good seal and you can tell it is filtering because there is slight resistance and sucking in and out of the material  the straps are softer and wider than less expensive disposables but just the right amount of tension resulting in long term comfort  an unexpected plus is that you can wear it multiple times before they begin to create that time to change out smell  much longer than previous disposable masks     
47,2.0,                       i really didn t like the way it fit and it had a bad smell while wearing the mask and i felt like i couldn t breathe because of the smell  will not buy again      
48,4.0,                       they fit pretty well  better for people with smaller faces  but still not bad for those of us with larger faces  little foggy with my glasses on  and the nose gap makes it feel much better when wearing  i dont feel like my nose is being crushed  i have severe lung damage  and it feels easy to breath with it on in normal conditions     
49,1.0,                       first  they are way too small  if you have a small head  these may work for you the biggest problem is that the bands are attached way too cheaply the bands kept breaking just attaching them to your ears i am taken aback by how poor the quality is on these compared to the price returning immediately      
50,5.0,                       i ordered the black masks since they were cheaper  go with everything and are just as effective  i work in person  not remotely so i needed something reliable  thick enough and comfortable to wear all day long  i really like those masks as i did not even need to adjust the elastic as i did with other masks  they cover everything really well and are comfortable enough to wear all day  i have been using them daily for over a week now and i m very satisfied with this product  i am thinking of ordering some more      
51,4.0,                       i am not sure they are any safer than the non rated surgical masks we bought in march  dr  fouchi says we need better masks to slow down the spread  i do not understand any of the terms on the mask and i will never trust the chinese for a long time  i never did   i wish i could find a box of m     m masks  made in the usa   these make you look like a duck and steam up my glasses more than the surgical masks we were wearing      
52,1.0,                       i purchased these because i thankfully had n  s from previous projects but running low and wanted to conserve what was left for potential armageddon  i knew kn   would not be as effective but still a plausible alternative  however  these masks are no different if not worse than the disposable blue paper masks  in terms of viability  it is a mask which should provide protection to others from you  but the reverse seems impractical  they re extremely thin and though it has holes it s supposed to be  filtered    not sure i buy it   i ve tried the lighter test and it held up  tried fragrance test and had no issues smelling anything  there s practically no seal   if you need a mask just to have one there are more cost effective alternatives  save your money      
53,1.0,                       product is well made  but is extremely small   i am a small woman  but the mask immediately made marks on my face   my husband couldn t fit it on his face   this would be perfect for children      
54,5.0,                       this mask fits me  my husband and our   year old granddaughter   i found it very comfortable for several hours   recommend      
55,5.0,                       loved the black color and the comfort it provides as well as the safety factor  thick but breathable  it does not fog glasses as much as a regular surgical mask  pricey but worth it      
56,5.0,                       please  trust me  you will like the comfort and feel of this mask  it s not irritating at all  i use this mask for   hours a day    days a week  it s very face friendly  you will not be disappointed      
57,5.0,                       exactly what is needed  fits perfectly and comfortable too  will purchase again when needed     
58,5.0,                       with all the new covid variants  i knew i needed to increase my protection   additionally  i needed to travel via plane and wanted a better mask   after trying one of these from a friend  i bought several packs   one for me and one for each of my two daughters who are teachers in class with students now   i like the fact that these masks fit snugly around my entire face and are lightweight   additionally  they have a lot of room between your skin and face so they don t  suck  in with each breath   while i d rather not wear a mask at all  these make me feel protected   i m glad i had them      
59,4.0,                       tried to buy us version  k   but these came up in amazon search   i assume just as good but honestly  i do not know     
60,5.0,                       a mask that gives one a secure feeling  fits snugly with nose clip as added protection  it is thick so if you wear glasses  the mask does fog them up  but i have had that problem with other masks  too  very comfortable  has the feel of a mask especially created for me i do intend to purchase again      
61,5.0,                       i am not an expert but have tried several masks during the vid and these are very nice   i was tired of wearing cloth and cheap otc masks and felt the n   would do a better job  if masks work    anyway i dont think you would be disappointed with these      
62,5.0,                       to date  this is my favorite mask   it is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and gives you more room inside to breath   it has   layers so i feel safer   i wish everyone would wear this type of mask      
63,5.0,                       i m a rn  and these masks are so comfortable  most of the n   s that i have had to wear are extremely uncomfortable  and have the elastic that has to be placed at the top of the head  and back of the head versus these that go behind the ears  i feel very safe wearing these  and highly recommend      
64,3.0,                       would not fit   different faces   severe leaks at top   noticed it first when our glasses fogged worse than in any other mask   we actually felt  and couldn t stop  exhaled air blowing into our eyes at first  we thought they were perfect  extremely easy to breathe   however  when sealing them by holding them down to our faces  as expected  they became just as difficult as any n   or kn   mask   further  without sealing them by hand  inhaled air simply bypasses the mask thru the same gaps might be improved by upgrading the bendable nose piece   the existing one isn t strong enough to hold its shape it also does seem to extenuate the bird beak look   this is becoming more common with foldable masks  but this one did elicit laughter from those who knew me well enough not care if they embarrassed me   ha  ha  ha all complaints aside  the company is exceptionally good to work with and the mask seems like a high quality product   they responded immediately and      satisfied me by going above and beyond with superb customer service   they offered no excuses  had no questions other than   how can we make you happy and we hope you ll give us another chance to serve you  so if you think they might fit  give them a try   in my experience  they ll stand behind their product so you really have nothing to lose      
65,5.0,                       great thickness and material   it took some getting use to at first but after a while it was easier to breathe with it on the best ones i have f t ound so far outside of the batch of n   i owned at the beginning of this pandemic   it is a snug fit for my size head face   the elastic is not for those with those with a large head face   i mean   it fits  just perfect on me but  i can t say this will be a perfect fit for everyone   i wore mine for   hours today for the first time and for the first time since this madness started  i felt as safe as i could be while wearing a mask   this is my opinion on this mask      
66,1.0,                       not confident that product has provided  acceptable protection and would not recommend its purchase  contacted covid after diligent usage of this product      
67,5.0,                       love this mask my glasses don t fog     
68,5.0,                       i don t have any complaints about this mask  compared to the non medical masks that i ve been wearing  this one is thicker  comfortable and brings me a sense of comfort that i m more protected by not only the coronavirus but other environmental concerns  i will buy again in a larger quantity  also the color goes better with my clothing      
69,5.0,                       i bought these as an upgrade from the cloth masks for my parents and grandparents  my dad says that after wearing his all day it rubs a bit on his nose  but overall the interior of the mask is softer than other kn   s that i ve purchased in the past  i like the black masks because they look less clinical     i only wish the price didn t increase     after becoming more in demand      
70,3.0,                       google  chendge technology and cdc kn    the resulting pdf indicates that the filter material is appropriate and effective  but that no manufacturing certification has been supplied and the fit might be ineffective   if you want to take a chance and try the fit out for yourself and assume that the filter material is consistent  without the certification   then these are probably good masks   i specifically ordered them because i wanted ones on the cdc approved list and they weren t      
71,5.0,                       just got my package  and wearing one now   i love the secure fit and have not had to adjust because of sliding off my nose   i ordered my daughter the package of multi colors who lives in another state and she loves them   i ordered her the pack with the variety of colors to match her outfits      very comfortable and lightweight   importantly i can talk without them sticking to my nose or mouth   huge plus       
72,4.0,                       this product does the job it advertises  there are no detectable strange smells  and it is very lightweight  the only issue that i experienced with this product is the fitment  likely my face is simply the wrong shape for this product  i ll try adding a cloth layer underneath it to get a better seal around my nose and upper cheeks  other than that it is spot on      
73,5.0,                       love these kn   masks  adjustable  really comfortable  and they fit with a good seal  i went to a hospital yesterday  and they complimented me for having a really good mask  great purchase      
74,5.0,                       finely  i found the perfect mask  and believe me i have tried a bunch  including cloth  cotton   fiber or paper ones  and silk layard  the best part  your glasses do not fog  and when breathing the mask dos not suck in   and great ear loops as well      
75,5.0,                       throughout this pandemic i ve tried several kinds of masks  including other kn   s   this one is very well made  fits the face without gaps and is comfortable for the ears   it was highly rated by consumer lab  and i ve found their recommendations to be excellent      
76,5.0,                       can t verify the filtration offered because i don t know how to test  the color is nice  i wanted black because i wear dark colors and frankly just hate the white and blue colored masks  comfort is not a good as some i ve own mainly from the black colored section  it has a somewhat plastic feel which is fine but not as comfortable as others on the market it is not distractingly uncomfortable so even though i think if could be improved i don t mind i would have liked each individual mask to be in a separate protective package as they are packed in groups of   masks  all in all i m relatively happy with the purchase      
77,5.0,                       easier to wear because of great fit  i double up on masks just to be safe but this mask is still comfortable with any other mask i choose  this is a kn   mask that loops over the ears  just one step below an n    impossible to get       
78,4.0,                       i got these masks for extra protection  and i m glad i chose to get kn   s  these masks fit my face really well and i appreciate that you can pinch them tighter at the nose  i also love how the ear loops aren t tight on my ears and cause discomfort like other masks do  you can also tell they re filtering more because when you inhale  the mask moves with your breathing  but the masks don t make it hard to breathe  at least not for me  i d definitely recommend these      
79,4.0,                       these masks fit me snugly and i have a smaller face   they seal well   i feel safe wearing them   they do leave an indention  in my skin around the edges   i wish they were a little bigger and fit my husband too   the quality is good and the ear loops seem very securely attached      
80,5.0,                       good quality  tight seal around nose helped by in mask adjuster  by wearing can tell thickness and overall protection  only minor complaint is ear loops could be a bit more stretchy causing some ear discomfort when wearing for extended period of time      
81,5.0,                       these masks were surprisingly comfortable and lightweight  i thought with the higher filtration  they would be harder to breathe in compared to surgical masks  but i find them to be well fitted around the cheeks  chin  and around the nose  the elastic is a good length and i don t have a problem with my glasses fogging  either      
82,3.0,                       these masks are comfortable  but my breath seems to shoot out the top edge  into my eyes  even if i m not wearing glasses   they aren t sealed at all and don t feel as safe as most cloth masks      
83,4.0,                       very happy with this mask purchase  excellent quality and no holes in masks  like others i had recently purchased and returned  these were a little more pricey that other brands  but worth it for the pack of         
84,5.0,                       i don t like wearing masks   that said  these are a good price for disposable n  s   i m doubling up per latest guidance and using this as a first layer      
85,5.0,                       the brand name on the package is wwdoll   however  if you scroll down to the  product details  section it says that they are manufactured by  chengde technology co     this is one of the companies on the cdc s approved   tested list   i found that list after reading an aarp article   the kn   masks that i bought awhile back are on the cdc s fake list   there is definitely a difference between the two the wwdoll masks are softer  thicker and really hug my face   i feel much more secure now and my husband says they don t fog up his glasses as much as the regular blue hospital type masks      
86,4.0,                       the mask are nice  they re the korean version of the n    i have a smallish face and they fit me perfect  i  m  not sure they ll work if you have a large or fatter face  they are not soft like the white kn  version but more like a  thicker harder plastic type of material  on the outside  i like them at the gymas they don t touch or collapse all over my nose   mouth   they reequipped  with the adjustable  wire in them  overall they re good and for those who wear make up  get the  charolette tillbury setting spray from sephora  or nordy s ect    or the ofra fix setting spray from ulta they  both play well with  both the regular blk mask and this kn  one  lolmy only con is the price  why so high  is it because the black color andand  that they re  a novice  on amazon   they need to do better with  the price  just like the white ones decreased in    as they  became more common and attainable i  would buy again  they also came way quicker than the shippingdate      
87,2.0,                       i can t get this to seal on my female face around the nose   even with the metal bar being compressed  very disappointed  it s worthless if it won t seal  i gave much of my order out to family to protect them  and am now having to warn them about this  the manufacturer needs to add padding around the inside of the nose area to help make a seal      
88,5.0,                       had to return these face masks i found difficult to breathe through  they seemed like they were made of a plastic material  i would give the company   stars for their great customer service and quick response  i had no problem getting a full refund for this product      
89,5.0,                       these are nice kn   masks  comfortable  tight fitting  well made  when the nose piece is bent properly  the sides suck in on a deep breath  suggesting a good seal  i ve tried many n   masks and these are on top of my list  i was in critical care for    years  so i have a lot of experience with masks      
90,5.0,                       i love the mask  but disappointed that the price went up by     from dec      when i got it delivered  to jan     when i was getting ready to order more  the count is still for    masks  what gives      
91,3.0,                       the last thing i wanted to buy were kn    masks made in china  the shortage of n    masks made in the usa made it necessary  the masks were well packaged  with several smaller packages containing several masks each   even thought he masks make you look like a you have a duckbill  that s ok  it allows them to be easily folded and out in your pocket  they fit fairly tightly to the face and are a bit more difficult to breath through than a paper surgical masks  but that s part of the price of the extra protection  my only real complaint is they itch on the skin  i don t have sensitive skin  but after a few minutes there is a low grade persistent itch  i can and will wear it  but not looking forward to an upcoming long air flight  my wife flat out won t wear it and is going to go with a regular paper mask  we have friends with similar complaints  and they wear the kn    on top of a paper mask  just got the masks last week and haven t given two masks routine a try yet since i find it a touch difficult to breathe  through it anyway  but plan to try it this week  if they can figure out how to reduce the itch  then it s a decent product  assuming it s doing what it s supposed to      
92,5.0,                       i work in an essential job  where i am exposed to people not wearing mask  or wearing mask incorrectly  which is why i bought these mask  they fit and seal well  while leaving a nice  breathing  space around my nose and mouth  i wear glasses and this mask fits well enough my glasses do not steam up   i will be buying more of these      
93,1.0,                       these claim to be   ply  but are actually   ply   indicating to me that they are counterfeit  as other reviews have mentioned  the portions where the straps attach to the mask are suspicious   there is only   layer of fabric there additionally  the fit is not very good  on several different instances  this mask has caused irritation on my left ear due to tightness  i know n   s  and presumably kn   s  need to be tight to the face to be effective  but i ve never had comfort issues like this with any other type of mask  i assume it s due to poor design      
94,1.0,                       i think there is a problem with these  after wearing one for the first time  my throat was irritated and i felt like i could taste fibers on my tongue and feel them in my lungs  i personally don t think these are safe to wear  i have since tried other masks from the package and had the same effect  maybe this is because of the additional layers of material  but i don t think it s my imagination and i will not wear them again      
95,4.0,                       have a very strong chemical smell  air out fir at least a day before wearingalso small flexible package of masks arrived in a giant box with about    feet of cushion wrap  total waste of packaging and environment disaster     
96,5.0,                       got my pack in the mail today and confirmed the manufacturer first  chengde technology co  kn    indeed listed in fda s appendix a  eua authorized non niosh approved respirator   which was on the back of the packaging  as well as on a package insert  see photos   i also confirmed the model was marked as gb            on the packaging and on the masks overall  i was impressed by the quality of the masks   they seem higher quality and are more comfortable than others i ve bought however  most importantly  the masks made a good seal on my face with just the ear loops   adding on an  ear protector  mask strap definitely made an adequate seal around my face  similar to the seal made with the powecom ffp  with the headband straps  without the ear loops       
97,5.0,                       these are the most comfortable masks i have ever worn  yes  even more comfortable than fabric masks since n   is stamped on each one and they are all lauded by amazon  i feel snug and protected whenever i m at the grocery store  even my husband liked them and he is a hard one to please when it comes to masks          
98,5.0,                       mask s are great and the company is really helpful  cant go wrong with this     
99,4.0,                       these are fine  the only issue i had with them was the ear loops are extremely long  comparing them to some older kn   masks i have they re at least twice the length tying a small knot into the ear loop fixed that issue although the knot was a little uncomfortable after a hour of wear      
100,5.0,                       i love these masks    was debating on kn   mask and i picked these  which were the best selling masks on amazon at the time   the black doesn t show dirt and they re pretty comfy  i don t regret it       
101,3.0,                       the mask s fit is a little uncomfortable because of the ear straps were tight   they responded and apologized and offered a     refund   great customer service      
102,5.0,                       if you are like me i have tried several mask shapes   this is by far the most comfortable for me   it fit securely and tightly but allowed me to still breathe   i would highly recommend it      
103,1.0,                       not good for medical protection or to safeguard others from covid   they protect from  certain particles    returning unopened      
104,5.0,                       so far it seems to fit well for big and small faces and goes under cloth mask nicely  we removed the ear straps and just use those on the outer cloth mask  its slight stiffness holds the cloth mask off nose and mouth when breathing which is a plus      
105,2.0,                       i m sure the fabric is good  but a few drawbacks make this unusable    nose bridge has minimal seal  air surges upwards towards the eyes when breathing  it even tickles the eye lashes  uncomfortable    small size  even tight for my skinny gf with smaller than average face      
106,5.0,                       i have no desire to come to an early demise  nor do i want to be the asymptomatic community member spreading this virus to innocent people just going about their necessary business  these masks fit well  although adjustable elastic would be better  they re comfortable  and hopefully  better than a cloth mask for protection  i wore one of these underneath a cloth mask when i went to my local health center for regular medical care  i could breathe just fine  if i don t get sick in the coming weeks  i ll give these an a   stay safe  my fellow americans who care about others      
107,5.0,                       everything about this mask recommends it  it is extremely comfortable  i really don t notice that i have it on  it has a snug fit and appears to have adequate thickness  but my absolute favorite quality is that  if it positioned correctly  it absolutely does not fog up my glasses  i went to the grocery store yesterday  got back in my car  and drove home  i didn t realize i still had the mask on until i drove  into my garage      
108,4.0,                       these masks are a great fit  there is no gapping on the sides or around the nose piece  the cone shape makes breathing easy in this mask  a good value for    masks  however  i do have one complaint  the masks have an awful smell  the smell dissipated after a few hours  but the smell was really bad  i have to air the rest of them all out for a few days before using them  that is the deal breaker for me  i won t be ordering these again      
109,5.0,                       i really liked this mask  my husband and i tried the  blow test  where we lit a match and tried to blow it out while wearing the mask  the flame didn t move at all  we were very happy with this mask      
110,5.0,                       these are definitely more comfortable than the previous batch of n   i have had and the ear loops are longer and fit my face better without pulling my ears out  they are lightweight and don t smell as bad as some masks  i feel like the price was fair and will definitely buy again when needed no masks are really comfortable but these are about as good as you can get  still difficult to wear for long periods and talking a lot is hard as well  but that is the same with all n  s i ve seen so far  i use these on all my shopping trips now and at my medical office if around exposed or sick patients      
111,5.0,                       just too small for my liking          after giving this mask a better trial i want to say the mask does fit well  i had to get use to the tight ear loops  that do hold mask firmly to my face      
112,5.0,                       by far my favorite disposable mask     there is a great seal   no gaps    and when i breath in   the mask does too    i love that it s not pressed against the center of my face   so i really feel less claustrophobic wearing it   it s the one mask i feel safe wearing and it s comfortable enough to keep on for longer periods too       
113,5.0,                       great mask   comfortable and provide a sense of protection due to fact that they are tight over crown of nose  wrap under chin  and are roomy enough based on structure to allow you to breathe   will be ordering another box      
114,5.0,                       delivered quickly  well made and fits well   i have copd and find this mask allows me to breathe more easily      
115,1.0,                       made in china  without the code or seal showing they re approved for use in the usa  false sense of security      
116,4.0,                       these masks have small holes in them along the ridge of the nose  its doesn t seem safe like that  but i am not sure      
117,5.0,                       fits well  does not fog up glasses as much as some others      
118,5.0,                       finally  a mask that affords the wearer protection and comfort  especially one who wears glasses      
119,5.0,                       this product is a great mask for protection   i love the fact that it also came in black  as i prefer that over the white masks   it is thick and well fitting   this also may make it a bit warmer to wear and you have to talk a bit louder  but for safety sake  the reason the mask is being worn   it is superb      
120,5.0,                       first they arrived early  then i love that they are thick enough and still can be worn with a cloth mask underneath  they are very comfortable get some while last      
121,3.0,                       these masks fit very comfortable and true to size they are very good quality made the mask themselves however i m having issues as many others have i should have went with the reviews  the loops are just barely on there  i don t know if it s the way they attached him or their dry rotted but when i reapply my mask two or three times one of the ear loops pulls apart and comes off  i m on third pair i m not even through the day yet  i bought these because i thought they were a great quality and i could at least wear one mask in a day maybe two  i am very disappointed in this mask coming apart  i pray the rest of the mass don t fall apart  this is my second order for mass my first order never made it from another company and i was glad to see this one made it in a timely fashion  the wearing my first mask and then have to put a second and third one on before the day is up was very discouraging i m going to have to try another brand like i said the mask itself is well made it s the ear loops that s the problem i m going to try to staple it together see if i can get some more use out of it that s really going to look weird  if anybody knows how to fix this problem let me know      
122,1.0,                       i noticed this black kn   mask had a scent to it unlike the white ones i bought before from the same seller  after    minutes my face felt funny and when i took off the mask my skin was red and looked sunburned   not sure if its the  black  ink but something wasn t right with these masks  i have never had any reactions from any other kinds of masks so this was concerning  i returned them      
123,5.0,                       this item fits well around the face  leaving little or no gaps for incoming air  easy to breathe through  no mask is going to be comfortable for   hours straight  but i feel more confident in this product than i do with anything else i ve used      
124,5.0,                       the packaging was sealed and made me feel safe using something so personal   the delivery date was met as expected from prime   these masks are durable and provide the comfort necessary to wear a mask for long periods of time   the color was an added plus because they felt more natural and less medical even though they are n     the earloops are very comfortable and have a good stretch to them   not one of them detached under extreme stretching purchased a second time and will purchase more if needed      
125,2.0,                       maybe it s just the plight of people with big noses and glasses but i get disappointed at every turn when it comes to fogging and this product is no exception   after almost a year  the only thing that really works for me are masks that are fitted with the wire closer that comes on a bag of coffee   on my first breath after putting on this mask i was feeling the air on my eyes and couldn t adjust the nose guard  which is admittedly better than average  in a way that made it stop   the search continues      
126,4.0,                       these masks are wonderful but the ear straps are a bit short  they hurt my ears after a short period  this affects the rating for comfort and stretch  lengthen the straps by a quarter of an inch and they would be five star masks straps can always be shortened but they can t be lengthened  as a teacher  the mask stays on     hours at a time  ear comfort is mandatory      
127,5.0,                       after wearing this  you will question the value of your cloth mask  naturally air intake takes a bit more effort   as a healthy person it is fine for me  the air passage so filtered that breathing out tends to leak just a bit under my eyes  i feel much more protected at the grocery store than with a cloth mask  kn   is not the same as n    so inform yourself about that if you need to know  there is plenty of info online      
128,5.0,                       good seal when inhaling   i can hear a little leakage when i exhale a little heavily  comfortable  although i d prefer head straps rather than ear loops  price dropped     after i ordered them        
129,2.0,                       i bought these because of the overwhelming number of positive reviews  i am disappointed because the ear loops are too small and pull out my ears  and there was an unpleasant smell when i opened the package  if you have a normal size head  you may find these masks uncomfortable      
130,5.0,                       for those asking about the fda approval of these masks  i found a cbs article that states   the food and drug administration does however provide a list of kn   masks it authorizes for emergency use by health care professionals  among them are kn   masks from chengde technology   the fit is very comfortable  truly wish i had bought these masks long ago  of course they don t provide the top protection like a n     but they are the next step down in terms of safety  while this is frivolous  i will also add that the design means no lipstick smudging   may we hold hope in our hearts  and blessings to those who have lost loved ones      
131,5.0,                       i m a retired rn and have worn every type of hospital mask  this is almost  as comfortable as the paper surgical masks but with a more face forming fit for better protection   not as highly rated as an n   for protection but better than paper or cloth      
132,5.0,                       this is a fantastic product  delivered in a timely manner  please excuse and overlook a previous   star feedback review accidentally submitted  the poor feedback was intended for another item  my apologies for the confusion      
133,4.0,                       i thought they would be black on the inside   it s difficult when i have these on with my glasses   my glasses fog up when i am using this mask   i will wear on the plane to not get covid as i think they will be protective  but not comfortbale      
134,5.0,                       looking for a kn   mask to feel more secure during this pandemic  this fits the bill great value for the money   do seem to be sturdy  leave it hanging in the care between uses      
135,5.0,                       initially i avoided purchasing the kn   masks believing it was a cheap knock off of  m producted n   masks   after a bit of research it appears they are essentially the same mask  the n   is the us standard  the kn   the korean standard   a  m executive said  they are essentially the same mask       
136,1.0,                       waste of money  very poor quality and clearly made with thin  cheap materials      
137,3.0,                       these masks are definitely more comfortable than the blue medical style face masks and fit closer to the face  the shape makes it easier to breathe  i thought i was buying a certified kn   mask  but can find no certification on the package      
138,5.0,                       i m very satisfied with these mask because if the comfort  coverage  and protection  there are overly obstructive when speaking or functioning in any way  my husband even liked them   he s not easily satisfied      
139,4.0,                       these are good for the average size face  my face is larger so i find i have to still pull it up every so often   my wife doesn t like the fit  too large for her face  i think they should have measurements for the face to determine how this will fit      
140,5.0,                       at last i don t mind putting on my mask   it is snug but not overwhelming   the elastic doesn t need adjusting which means i can grab it and get it on when i need to answer the door   no tying knots   what a treat   i have shared this order with a friend and she also plans to reorder these   thank you      
141,5.0,                       i can t begin to touch the value of this in my local drugstores   i have bought two packs and change the mask every day   i can afford to do that at the cost   they are more comfortable than the blue surgical masks and all my friends who wear glasses say they cause their glasses to fog up less      
142,3.0,                       it rides up into my eyes and doesn t hold on the bottom of my chin  i ve had other n   and didn t experience this issue      
143,5.0,                       seem well made  on the proper cdc list using under three layer cloth masks with     ppm filter  as the  double up  for safety was concerned though when i stepped outside my door with only the kn   on and fumes from the neighbor s idling diesel truck about gassed me hope that isn t one of particulates they are supposed to block      
144,5.0,                       no dislike  and used this going out in public     
145,5.0,                       they fit my face perfectly and definitely reduce the fogging up of glasses  i don t need to wear   masks if i am wearing one of these  most of my friends agree about how comfortable they are  but not all  i think it depends on how far back your ears sit on the sides of your head or maybe the   dimentionality of your face  can make the elastic too tight       
146,1.0,                       i researched a bit before purchasing these  i have ordered several other brands and all were satisfactory  but i wanted something that had the emergency fda approval  i deflnitely find that the fit of this style is my favorite  however  after wearing the mask for about       minutes i became severely nauseated  when i thought i might vomit  i removed the mask and ate some yoghurt  slowly i began to feel better  i did not want to try another mask  so i retruned them  perhaps if i aired them out before wearing it would have been okay  but i just wasn t willing to put another one over my mouth after the reaction i had  it was very concerning to me      
147,4.0,                       this mask looks sharp and doesn t have that generic n   look  love that there s room to breathe  less one star only because the straps are too tight  after a couple hours starts to hurt behind the ears  wish the straps are adjustable or made of  stretchy material      
148,5.0,                       great product  just wish the price had not went up  will buy again if price drops  the ear loops are sturdier than some others i have tried      
149,1.0,                       the masks are full of a lot of tiny holes and are extremely thin  my homemade double fabric masks are thicker and completely sealed  i bought these after seeing a report for nk   being the best after n    so i bought the pack of     the product is so misleading and lacks the protection it claims to have  the only positive thing about it is being comfortable      
150,5.0,                       like that they are vetted by fda  i am a surgical nurse and will say that i can tell the difference in ppe   this mask has superb filtration  better construction and fit     
151,5.0,                       we ve been using the standard blue dusk masks  in fact i still have two boxes but the masks from our last order are not as well made as previously and the strings keep pulling out  we wanted an alternative and tried these kn   masks  we give them   stars for fit  usage  and quality  and  in the manner they are made we can double up with a plain cloth mask if choose and they are just as comfortable      
152,5.0,                       i ve written poor reviews of other kn   masks   this is the second time i ve purchased these masks although i didn t leave a review the first time they fit snugly and seem well constructed   each mask lasts for several days before needing replacement if necessary  i ll buy them again      
153,3.0,                       upon arrival  i opened the package to inspect contents  first mask i pulled out was missing an ear loop  not opening all the others until i need to use them  but hopefully no more are defective  seem like reasonable quality otherwise      
154,5.0,                       i work as a nurse and sometimes is required to wear n   or kn   when we are in the yellow zone   i work lots of double  shifts and wanted something comfortable but fashionable the same time   i m glad i bought these  they are quite comfortable and the ear straps havent hurt my ears  great buy      
155,1.0,                       the mask was fine appearance wise and i don t doubt it s legit  one problem though   it s tiny  i m not a giant by any means           lbs  i put the mask on and spoke and it came off my chin and jammed up into my eyes  then i pulled it down so it covered my chin better and when i spoke it totally exposed my nose   this mask is a fail      
156,3.0,                       the non elastic strings are too short  they pull your ears out and break off of the little drop of glue that holds them onto the mask when you try to stretch them out   the mask part might be ok  but a normal sized adult will look like a dog hanging out of the car window in the wind     
157,5.0,                       these are so great and breathableneatly packed in small bags which makes storage easy  so you don t have to carry the whole bag     
158,1.0,                       not for medical use  not for virus protection  these are not the n   respirators  i didn t read all the information before i purchased   they really need to say that first  not at the end of the page  haven t used at all  have no need of them since not n   respirators  but am still disappointed with product      
159,5.0,                       these fit my husband and myself just fine  he s    and i m       while wearing  i couldn t blow out a flame which is a good indicator that it s thickness is adequate  the ear elastic is soft  and a good length  the nose wire is long enough as to achieve a good seal  it might not have the perfect seal as a professionally sized n   mask that health care workers are required to wear  but i feel confident with these masks for us      
160,1.0,                       i was wondering if the mask was authentic so i gave it the water test    put a bit of water in it to see if it holds   because if it lets water leak  it  certainly  will let respirated particles leak i put a bit of water in it  and after about    seconds it came through  a very pronounced drip   very sorry to see  because the mask fits and performs nicely otherwise   unfortunately  there is no way this could be an authentic k   mask with that kind of leak      
161,5.0,                       i have a small face  so i wish these came in more sizes than just one  other than that one complaint  these work great the metal nose band works more or less to help with glasses fog  the band is inside of the mask instead of being glued to the top  like other kn   s  this makes them easier to reuse  if needed  my other kn   masks had metal bands that became unglued or straight up just broke  as a glasses wearer  this feature is important  these are harder to breathe in  but i take that as a good sign since i suppose this means they re actually filtering out the air of dust and pathogens my main reason for getting these masks is because i work as an essential worker where  ft social distance isn t always easy to maintain  and even when there is proper distancing  one can never be too sure  better safe r  than sorry bonus points  these come in black  which fits my aesthetic      
162,4.0,                       after i bought these  i learned that i don t know if they re authentic  i m not saying they re not  i just don t know how you can tell if kn  s are authentic and there are a lot of fakes   they are too big for my face  smallish woman  and slip around so i have to adjust a lot  not good   my husband likes the fit and uses them  he s very satisfied      
163,3.0,                       these fit well and are ok  within limits  they are not  real  n   masks i just don t like the strong chemical smell when you put them on if you leave a mask open  on your car seat  for example   the odor goes away in about a day      
164,5.0,                       these are the perfect masks   protective  comfortable  don t fog up your glasses  and don t suction to your face   i highly recommend them      
165,3.0,                       seems well made  but i should ve looked at the photos better  these cut uncomfortably close under your eyes  there s no curve  so it sits right under your eyes  and i couldn t stand wearing it for more than a few minutes  also  the nose clip is weak  so it doesn t do anything to create a seal  both my husband and i found it annoying  another thing is there s a gap under my chin  i can easily fit two fingers  and no matter how i adjusted it  there was still a gap  also  because the bottom is structured  any time you move your head  it also moves the mask up  i would suggest buying a smaller pack to see if these are for you  not one size fits all      
166,5.0,                       good fit  my face is smaller so i twisted the elastic which worked well  they fit my husband s face very well  i like that they don t collapse when i breathe in      
167,5.0,                       very good seal around entire nose and mouth      
168,4.0,                       the construction of the mask theoretically makes it easier to breathe than a typical surgical mask and the mask fits snugly to one s face  the number of layers  which is t he reason for wearing this kind of mask in the first place  does obstruct air flow  if you have asthma or other copd  you might want to rethink the use of this type if you have to do something requiring physical exertion      
169,5.0,                       i am pleased by how closely these masks fit the contour of my face and that they are reasonably comfortable  i don t think i would double mask with these however   i don t think breathing would be easy   breathing is quite ok with just this mask  i did not try wearing it for exercise      
170,3.0,                       they say the kn   is suppose to be the equivalent to n    fyi i have not compared the difference  first impression   this mask kn   has tiny perforations along the mask and inside  the perforations may not be open but light does shine through  it appears it may allow particles to be inhaled may not provide protection from biological aerosol  it is very thin for being a   layered mask  i think you would need to wear it under or over another mask   i ll have to check out the n        
171,4.0,                       they seem good  only drawback for me is that they ride a little bit high up beneath my eyes  but that is true for me with other masks of this shape   nice  with good all around coverage and i didn t find the elastic too tight      
172,1.0,                       real n   masks have straps that go around the entire head  allowing for a custom fit  these have elastic loops  worse still  the loops are far too tiny for an adult male  and perhaps an adult female as well   the loops will pinch your ears making for a painful way  the tiny loops also make it more likely for the mask to slip  making these quite dangerous  at this price point  they could have easily included proper head loops that go around the back of the head  instead  they pinched pennies  pinched ears  and have lost this customer  do not buy these masks  they are flawed and potentially dangerous      
173,5.0,                       these are perfect for protecting yourself and others during the pandemic      
174,1.0,                       i received a package that was already opened  um  no  that s not acceptable for masks intended to be clean and new and makes me question if these are fake  inserted into another package or already tried and returned by someone else  in any case  not good  i do not recommend      
175,1.0,                       the test to determine effectiveness of a mask is to hold a flashlight behind it and if you can see the light  the mask is not good  it didn t past the light test       
176,3.0,                       when i first opened a package of these  there was a strong smell of something like kerosene   i pulled out all the masks and hung them on a hanger for a few days   that took care of the smell   i wore one for the first time yesterday   the elastic that goes over the ears is a little too tight for my comfort and my face got really hot under the mask   this was my first time wearing a kn   mask so maybe i just need to get used to the heat      
177,5.0,                       comprehensive filtration you need plus well fitting  this mask has a nose piece that can be adjusted to fit your particular nose structure   quality manufacturing is evident   i used double masking in some situations and found an  or  type mask to fit completely and comfortably underneath the outer kn    mask   i was able to breathe without difficulty  although my voice volume was attenuated somewhat      
178,5.0,                       i purchased these because i think the do a better job at filtering out virus than the simple cloth masks i have been using now for   months   i like how the provide a better  but still not perfect  seal around my mouth and nose than an cloth mask   and i like how they are point so then are not sitting right on my mouth      
179,1.0,                       not happy  these are not suitable for an adult mouth to move with proper coverage  which is the entire reason they were purchased  you cannot receive a refund exchange for such grievence  totally unhappy  they seem great upon initial wearing until you try to talk  they slip below your nose or creep above your chin causing you to use your hands to reposition  rending them useless to me  i want my money back      
180,5.0,                       a very comfortable mask  i feel like i can breath  don t feel stifled  i wear glasses   the bono with other masks is very uncomfortable  this mask does not cling to my nose   moth     
181,5.0,                       number   rated by consumerlab  so that s good enough for me   a little harder to breath through than lower rated masks but i  expected it to be much more difficult      
182,5.0,                       these masks are great  i work in a pt clinic and wear these for    hours per day  they are not difficult to breath in  and the ear loops are soft  and easier on the ears than traditional surgical masks  i did get ear saver headbands   do like to wear those with these masks to make a tighter seal  will definitely be repurchasing these      
183,3.0,                       i ve used kn   masks before  and found them to be the most comfortable and secure feeling  far superior to the light blue disposable ones  or any fabric mask i ve yet tried  however  these particular ones are smaller than others i ve used  other kn   masks are very spacious on your face  tenting out and sealing around your cheeks  chin and nose  but not uncomfortably  however  these ones are like they ve been minimized by      the cup is smaller  and they can crush your nose a little  admittedly i have a bigger nose  but not that big   they re not absolutely terrible  but they re not the very comfortable and well sealing experience i ve had with other masks of this variety      
184,5.0,                       the kn   masks are very comfortable  as well as being very secure when you wear them   i have used the blue masks previously  but feel that they are less comfortable  provide less protection  less durable  and not as breathable as the kn   masks  i order them online and receive them very quickly      
185,5.0,                       seems a bit thin and gaps slightly on my face  which is small   but had a metal nose piece which allows an excellent fit and reduces fogging  black on the outside and white on the inside  so it s at least   layers      
186,5.0,                       these masks are well made and fit securely over entire face     
187,5.0,                       i m so happy that this mask stays on my face  the extra thickness makes me feel safer than the pleated masks  i wear glasses and the way these are constructed  doesn t fog my lenses      
188,5.0,                       as the pandemic continues  i ve generally been using cloth masks with p   fillers  decided to get a number of relatively disposable ones  i don t go out much  but when i do  these give me stronger confidence that i can resist thee incursions of the maskless into my personal space   and their black  so they seem slightly more fashionable  they are in my maskwearing arsenal from here on in      
189,5.0,                       comfortable and breathable  very fast shipping and pretty good value  a little large for my smaller face but i wear a second cloth mask over it which makes it snugger  i like the black color for work instead of the usual medical blue      
190,3.0,                       i m a small woman and wanted a snug fitting mask  i carefully looked at the measurements which were helpfully posted  the face mask itself s size is perfect  however the elastic bands are too short to make it comfortable to wear  it pulls the mask uncomfortably tight on your fact      
191,5.0,                       great quality  i was getting the official kn   masks from the school and than they stopped  searched high and low for a mask with similar quality and this one without doubt is identical to the school s masks  love it  feel so safe with it on  you won t regret buying it      
192,1.0,                       not good for the price  air comes out from everywhere  even when you press the nose area  it comes out through there too       
193,4.0,                       these masks appear to be very thick  and the fit around your face is comfortable   but the elastic ear pieces seem quite short   they hurt my ears after a short time  and i have a small face   might be a little uncomfortable for a larger person     
194,1.0,                       cheapest made crap  wore over    of them in the package and they all tore at the chin seam after about   hours of wear      
195,5.0,                       i have worn these mask multiple times each and they are very comfortable  have a good seal on your face  and don t slide down when you talk   after multiple wearings the inside does seem to get a little fuzzy    tickle your nose and lips   as the humidity  i guess  makes the lining pill up a little  but this is minor   and at that point it is probably time to grab a new one anyway      
196,5.0,                       totally worth the purchase  one size  easy to adjust  and i have a round face  i can wear this mask all day and feel safe and protected  i feel find pairing with surgical mask underneath  mask does not stretch out or fall  i happen to get compliments on the black mask  and i will be purchasing more      
197,1.0,                            recommend there are two major problems with these masks    they are very small  almost a child size  i m adult female and these hardly fit  the ear loops are also like other reviews say  and are not even    they have a strong chemical smell  like burning plastic  when you put on the mask  it s overwhelming  how can you breathe through a mask that has this toxic odor      
198,5.0,                       like everything about the mask  i highly recommend      
199,5.0,                       these are a softer version of what we had in the work blue ones  they fit tighter though than a cloth face mask  which is what we wanted  then we cloth mask over them  we have health issues in this house so we take all precautions      
200,1.0,                       the masks are too small   if you try to talk with them you are doing the up and down adjustment you see too many people doing   constantly touching your mask defeats the whole purpose of a mask i bought a pack of    black kn   masks from another vendor in october and they were great  so i know a bigger size exists   unfortunately  those are no longer available that i can find   i have included an image of these masks on top of the mask i had previously purchased   it is easy to see the size difference      
201,5.0,                       with the mask properly on my face  with the nose brace fitted correctly  this is the most comfortable mask so far   i have tried dozens  some just double cloth   these are n   and the best i have had      
202,2.0,                       like some other masks of chinese manufacture i ve received from amazon  this is just plain too small for my face   i believe these should be labeled s m    they will work for children and at least some women  but i don t think you re going to find a lot of six foot tall guys who can wear these took a long time to arrive   they are being returned      
203,5.0,                       we have tried many masks in the past but we can conclude that we like these kn   face books the best  as they are protective and comfortable to wear for long periods of time  we have recommended them to our friends and plan more again as masks will be around for a long time yet  thank you for your great mask product      
204,5.0,                       product appears to be high quality  arrived quickly  lacks way to adjust straps  but knowing need good deal i just tie a knot in the straps to make tighter  i am       male  and take a     size hat  straps are more than big enough for me      
205,4.0,                       i m teaching myself to breathe a little differently in these since i m switching from a cheap   ply medical style mask  they are heavier and the airflow isn t as easy  which is a good thing in a pandemic  they are also a little on the small size so trying to keep it over your chin and nose properly if you have a long face is not optimal  i will continue to use them until we don t have to though      
206,4.0,                       these masks are good  i have to do the crossloop to get the most snug fit  but i have a big head  my only complaint is that these cause your face to get very warm after a short period of time  other than that  they are acceptable      
207,4.0,                       like the mask because the black is a little slicker and less obtrusive  as comfortable as a mask can be  and the layers of filters are not heavy or annoying  like the product a lot when she came in more colors   since we have to wear them   fogs up after a few hours   stay safe y all     
208,3.0,                       this mask will take some time for me to get accustomed to wearing it   the fit is snug and not comfortable so i won t wear it on occasions that require many long hours of mask wearing   i do like that it doesn t touch my lips and i can breathe okay when wearing it   i don t care what it looks like if it does the job better than the blue white masks      
209,5.0,                       the mask fits my face snuggly  it has a smell when you take it out the bag  but the smell dissipates in a reasonable amount of time  i feel safe in the mask      
210,5.0,                       i feel safe wearing these  they seal well  i can tell by the way the material moves when i breathe  i think they fit better on larger heads  like mine  my wife still likes them though  durable enough to re use after airing out for a few days      
211,1.0,                       these kn   masks fit my wife fine  while not fitting my face very well at all  i would think that if you have a somewhat smaller face these masks will do okay  just not for bigger faces      
212,5.0,                       great high quality masks that you can use several times  they fit snugly  can be worn for long periods comfortable and the elastic straps are high quality and don t tug too much on your ears  keep in mind they are paper based so they won t be able to be reused if wet  however  it doesn t easily get wet from your breath or high humidity  you ll need to actually drop it in water      
213,3.0,                       the masks fit well  and seem to be well made   however  scanning the barcode on the package returns the result    invalid barcode    could it mean the masks are counterfeit   i really don t know  but it s unsettling   i ll be looking for masks with a barcode that identifies the product properly      
214,3.0,                       these masks are decent  i like that i can talk and i don t feel the mask rubbing against my lips  they eat loops are on the smaller size so my husband feels like they re too tight  also will mention that the loops also break pretty often  i d like to use them for a weeks time  especially at this price point  but with them constantly breaking i m not able to  will likely look for a replacement when i run out      
215,2.0,                       have a larger face with a beard and this mask hardly covers my mouth   it puts quite a bit of pressure on my ears and pulls them forward   i also wear glasses and the seal is poor enough that hot air escapes the top and fogs my glasses  all in all this mask is very uncomfortable and inconvenient and if they are meant for smaller faces it should have been clear      
216,4.0,                       i bought these masks as my wife and i headed out to san diego during thanksgiving week  i didn t want to chance using the thin blue masks for a long flight out to california and then back to the dc area  comfort is about medium as the ear loops take their toll on your ears  i wish the seal was better as the mask itself will all of a sudden start leaking air from around your nose and cheeks  my wife s glasses were fogging up randomly even after adjusting the nose strip  i honestly did feel safer with the thickness of the mask  the size of the package was perfect for our trip  we had plenty to use on the plane ride there and back and while out and about  other than the fact you need to relieve the pressure on your ears and adjust the nose strip to reseal the mask back to your face every       minutes or so  i d say these masks are pretty good      
217,5.0,                       i love the  snugness  of the mask but it hurts around the back of my ear  i haven t tried it yet maybe it just needs a little adjusting   other than that it s great and i don t use it every day most likely when i have to go to high traffic areas  you price was higher than others i saw after i purchased this product      
218,5.0,                       these masks fit well  without gaps  a problem i have had with other masks since my face is not large    they are also thicker than other similar ones i have had  which is reassuring  i am glad to have them at this time  with the variants of the virus posing more of a threat      
219,1.0,                       air comes in all around the mask  disappointed     
220,1.0,                       i work in the medical field and i ve been wearing masks since this all started  the real n   masks are very uncomfortable so i thought i d try these  the pictures on here are not like the ones i got  the mask doesn t even cover your whole face  they are very small  the metal nose piece doesn t stay in place  and the worst thing is the seam that runs down the middle on the front of the mask comes to a point which sits very far out and it s quite embarrassing  you look like a bird with a big beak  i m very disappointed with this purchase and the price i paid for these  what a waste      
221,3.0,                       the ear straps are too short for me  rather than return them  i have ordered some strap extenders to see if that will fix the problem  otherwise the masks are adequate      
222,5.0,                       i have to wear kn   for    hrs at work   these are the most comfortable that i ve worn   i ve also referred several of my work mates to buy them here as well   these have the thicker ear straps that are more comfortable and stretch better      
223,5.0,                       i like the safety the mask   provides  i m a covid    survivor and the way i got infected had to do with using a regular mask  this n   really protects because your mouth and nose aren t against the mask like regular masks  so the design is perfect      
224,3.0,                       i liked the material of the mask   the mask definitely  stayed off of my nose and mouth and it was easy for me to breath  however  for me  the ear loops were tight  the loops pulled on the back of my ears and made them hurt   don t know if this is due to product design or  the way my ears are situated on my face  my face isn t large and i don t think my ears are set way back on my head but either way it was tight    if the ear loops had been longer or adjustable   or the ear loop material had more stretch  these would have been perfect for my face      
225,5.0,                       the mask is comfortable and safe as per latest recommendations so i m glad i have them  i face some to a couple of my friends who loved how they fit and plan to buy a box of the masks for themselves  stay safe everybody     
226,1.0,                       mask nose clip does not bend to the nose  too loose  mask slides down your face  i have a normal sized face was very disappointed when this mask did not fit well      
227,5.0,                       i love not only the way it feels but the way it looks  i get lots of compliments and questions of where did i get them  i could wear the mask throughout my whole shift at work and not being uncomfortable or notice it all   i work surrounded by people infected with the covid  not going on details  and i do what i can  i know nothing is      proof but at least i feel more protected       
228,5.0,                       i am very satisfied with the fit of this mask  i have a smaller face so it is hard to find a good fitting mask  it is very comfortable on my face and is tight enough for protection without smashing my face or hurting my ears  this mask allows you to easily talk without the mask moving  overall i am very satisfied with the fit and comfort      
229,5.0,                       i work in a covid icu  i wear this kn   with a level   mask over it   i ve been safe  i ve been testing my luck since the beginning of this covid madness since jan      i can t wear regular n   respirator masks because of my tmj dysfunction  i get terrible migraines   i only wear certain brands of kn   masks  this company sells the most comfortable kn  s  i work with patients on hfnc  bipap   vents in the covid icu  this mask w a level   over it   a shield plus gown   gloves  of course  has kept me protected from covid  i ve been doing this over a year since being fully vaccinated   i continue this regime b c i also care for a disabled loved one   i don t want to be a carrier of the virus and transfer it to them although i ve been fully vaccinated with the moderna vaccine  i m a pro vaxxer    just drink lots of fluids   take tylenol every   hrs before   after  nd booster for   hrs before     days afterwards and you ll be completely fine even if you don t  you ll be ok  just remember the most signs symptoms of flu like symptoms after taking the  nd booster  the better  that means you have a strong immunologic response  aka  you have an awesome immune system  and for god sake can our state senate or governor get us more nurses  we re drowning  we desperately need staff     anyone out there with a heart whose a nurse  please help us anyone out there that is not a nurse can take a couple week course to become a pct  nurse assistant and come help us  please thank you  south floridaespecially margate     especially me          
230,3.0,                       i bought these after reading a review on consumer labs   but they seem really really thin for   layers  what s up with that   otherwise they are fine   and they don t say that they will work for airborne droplets but they are kn   so i guess they should      
231,4.0,                       i can t smell any cleansers while using these and they cup my face perfectly  they are to tight and i have a small head  they also cut under my eyes so i have to cut a piece out so it won t rub under my eyes  i will buy again because they work and i know every face isn t the same size but the elastic should be a bit longer      
232,5.0,                       i generally don t care for the way an n    mask looks   but i ordered these and they are so much more comfortable  and protective  than a cloth mask   i am very happy with this purchase   i received my order really quickly      
233,4.0,                       i researched these kn   masks from this provider and manufacturer  i was concerned that the masks met the specs and afforded protection while traveling by airplane  there are bogus kn   masks coming from china  i can say that these masks are rated     efficacity  i hope that they really are protective      
234,5.0,                       comfortable i wear them all day in the kitchen and have been able to stay safe and covid free    i throw them away when they let my glasses fog up  i use this as an indicator that it s time to swap out for a new one      
235,2.0,                       the masks look great  but the metal strip to seal them around the nose is a poor match for asian noses  the metal strip around   cm from the edge  which means the mask either sits too high  and intrudes on the eyes  or is too low  either way  i can t get it to seal properly  combined with a smaller oval face  the mask itself is just too large for me   also air gaps below my chin  tried clipping the bottom for a tighter seal which is better  but still feeling leakage around the face      
236,5.0,                       this k   mask seems to be of excellent  quality  as masks go  it is comfortable and fits well  there is not as much fogging of glasses which is a definite plus  they arrived well packaged  i would definitely recommend and purchase again      
237,1.0,                       all of the masks arrived wet  they were fully sealed and inside the sealed packaging was water  i would highly suspect the quality of any facility making medical grade equipment that seals their cloth masks in wet bags   probably best to move on to a different vendor      
238,5.0,                       great product  i really like how roomy it is inside the mask  your face is not pushed right up against the mask  which makes it better for your skin  it fit perfectly  it does not tug on your ears and is comfortable to wear all day  i have looked around and for this quality of mask the price is unbeatable      
239,5.0,                       i bought these masks for my husband who had to travel internationally   he had to wear this mask for the better part of    hours and said it was very comfortable  he wore these while he was in meetings and for his trip home  they were comfortable and keep him safe  traveling half way around the world and returning safe to his family  i highly recommend      
240,5.0,                       i did the mask test  it is definitely   layers  i sprayed into it with an aerosol can  placed water in it for a minute and lit it with a lighter  this mask passed every test    i ve  purchased a lot of different masks and this is the best quality i ve found as an alternative to the n    smart and safe buy      
241,3.0,                       i like the room in the mouth area  i can breath   don t feel like i m suffocating  lipstick remains in place  however the mask is so tight it leaves a definite imprint on my face  that is unacceptable      
242,3.0,                       as a person who wears glasses  it is important that the nose piece can be made to conform well to avoid fogging the glasses  this mask does not conform well because the metal piece appears to be too flexible      
243,4.0,                       good thickness  good fitting on a relatively narrow face  comfortable   the black ones are white on the inside these were rated as effective by the independent consumer lab com   cdc approved them as effective  where many others were not      
244,5.0,                       two things that i was concerned with     being the filtration factor  the mask is rated as one of the best mask for protecting people from the virus      was comfort   the mask is very comfortable to wear and an unexpected benefit is that it is easier to breath wearing this mask and than previous n   masks that i have used   i highly recommend this mask      
245,2.0,                       i was initially impressed at how well this mask was fitted and sealed to my face  the mask is definitely breathable  then  i noticed the horizontal rows of open holes just above and below the kn   imprint  see promo pic   the holes are much larger than typical bandana fabric cloth has  the fact is  i can clearly see the skin of my finger through the holes  the seal around the face is also full of a row of such holes  so  i think while this mask might protect others from your coughs etc   it is unlikely to fully protect you from covid    in close quarters where an infected person has been coughing  singing  or yelling a lot  it is not because of the lack of layers but because protection seems to be at least somewhat defeated by the designed rows of holes  the mask seems likely to be better than wearing nothing    perhaps just barely  i will not purchase these again      
246,5.0,                       this is an upgrade from my cloth mask   the seal is tight around my face   i can bend the upper nose clips for a snug fit   the mask goes slightly below my chin and seals against my throat   it has a slight stiffness to it  allowing the snout to create a space for your mouth to move inside the mask      
247,5.0,                       excellent protection   it covers the mouth and nose completely  and is close to the cheeks as well   a perfect shape for the face   this dense   ply provides excellent protection   it has an embedded nose wire which is padded and comfortable   this is for a normal sized adult   too big for my petite neighbor who will buy a child s mask      
248,3.0,                       i liked the kn   masks that we had been wearing and wanted some more   however  these are not as large   they are fine for me but too small for my husband   he has to keep pushing them up   very disappointed      
249,1.0,                       where do i start  i thought since i couldn t find the n   mask this would work  it comes in   separate plastic packages  on the only package i opened the stap  which is very soft and could be comfortable  was already dislodged from the mask with no way to put it back together  i tried another ne in the pack and that step stayed together for    seconds  on the one i was able to try it was impossible to breathe with it on  now i have to try and see if it s returnable  this costs just under     for    masks      
250,1.0,                       im a regular man  not a big head but they are too small  too tight and edges are sharp  painful  retuned     
251,4.0,                       comfortable fitness  does not fol over my ears as many other masks do  i bought extra packages to give a few packages to my immediate   extended family members  they too like the comfortable fit      
252,4.0,                       i have a narrow face but a big nose  high bridge   and i can t adjust these to fit comfortably  others in the family haven t complained  though  they cover my face from under my eyes to well under my chin  so the overall size is good if only they weren t pinchy around my nose  i ll still make use of them      
253,5.0,                       i have tried a handful of different disposable masks  usually disappointed by at least one aspect  not this time  these are absolutely perfect  they fit wonderfully  can wear all day with no pressure on the ears  it feels like a kitten is hugging your face  these are among a handful from china that the fda actually approves  will definitely purchase from now on      
254,5.0,                       these are the best disposable masks i ve tried  according to the literature on mask testing  they are a good replacement for n   masks  you just need to ensure the ones your buying are on the fda approved listing  i find them more comfortable then any other mask i ve tried  because of the construction  mask only touches along thes sealing edge leaving the end of your nose an lips in untouched in the interior open space  also  so far  fogging of my glasses is a rare  temporary event      
255,4.0,                       really like these masks  but the elastic straps don t make the mask fit as snugly as n  s are supposed to      
256,3.0,                       when i checked on this mask  it was recommended on the consumer lab site  the mask seems to work well  but the fit around the bridge of my nose is not snug and requires a band aid to seal the mask      
257,5.0,                       these are very comfortable and lightweight but fit close to the face  the duckbill design makes them easier to breathe in and so far they don t fog up my glasses as bad as others      
258,3.0,                       the short of it is that i can t get a good seal  particularly around my eyes  whenever i breathe  i feel jets of air blast my eyes  and fog up my glasses  both factors making them incredibly uncomfortable otherwise  it seems pretty good  the fabric is a little rough  but not abrasively so  and breathing through it is fine  definitely can tell how thick it is from the fact it flexes when i breath      
259,4.0,                       they are not individually wrapped they are wrapped in quantities of   and then   packages are in the bag  it says individually wrapped and i purchased them for my team of    to share but no one wants to touch a package   other people touched  they really don t streach the opening only opens so far and the your face is not covered but the entire mouth and nose is      
260,5.0,                       love these masks and feel protected around my nose and chin   i can breathe better with this type of mask because it doesn t cling to my nose and mouth like other masks   a great purchase please wear masks and social distance       
261,5.0,                       so  no mask is totally comfortable  these  however  have a little metal piece at the bridge of the nose which can be bent for a more comfortable  and less glasses fogging  fit  i have read that kn   masks offer more protection than cloth masks  so this is my  nd purchase      
262,5.0,                       they give you excellent protection  your are able to wear the mask and glasses without themfogging up   you are able to breath much better in them compared to the blue masks   color isgood  i got  pink much more attractive than black      
263,5.0,                       these fit well and comfortable  easy to breath because they do not get too close to your face      
264,5.0,                       very comfortable and a great fit   recommend buy     
265,5.0,                       i have been waiting and searching patiently for the quality of mask for my own protection  now that the medical experts are recommending that everyone resort to  double masking  and to stop using those unreliable  cloth masks  these kn    masks are extremely necessary to make things much safer for myself during this pandemic  i sincerely believe that whether you are a health professional working on the front lines or not  everyone should be afforded the same protection in order to control the spread of infections as best possible  the first step to this end is the personal practice of protection for one s own self which means what quality of masking is being utilized  the continued hand washing and social distancing must also be observed without exception  i also believe that even after one has been fortunate enough to receive a covid vaccine shot that all these precautionary practices should be continued no matter what      
266,5.0,                       the masks were exactly what i expected  not only are they comfortable but they provide good coverage  i can breath and talk clearly  not muffled like the cloth masks      
267,3.0,                       fyi  these masks are not  certified by niosh   pandemic masks should be certified   you can find a    pack of these certified by niosh  here on amazon for similar statements      
268,4.0,                       i purchased these to wear for quick runs to grocery store or going to the salon to get my hair done   if you have a slim face like i do they don t fit too secure   i like my masks to be comfortably tight and secure  i have to double loop the strap for a more secure fit because it doesn t fit with just one loop around the ear   other than that i have no issues      
269,5.0,                       i admit i was skeptical about these being real kn   masks but i trusted the reviewers and i am not disappointed   they are very well made  fit perfectly  and in my opinion  make it unnecessary to use a second mask as some have done for added protection   they are heavier because of the five layers but not so heavy as to be uncomfortable   i highly recommend them      
270,5.0,                       i love these masks   they are the only ones i will wear right now  they are a bit more pricey than other masks  but you re paying for quality and those promising lab results  i adore it s filter of efficiency of     or more  and its five layers   the extra space gives this mask its signature  duck face  look  but also makes it feel more breathable  the nosepiece is easy to use  and the mask  molds  to the shape of your face the more you wear it  the ear bands do not put that much pressure on my ears  if they do irritate you  i recommend stretching each one a bit before using again   i use these masks in school  at the store  and more  i even ran with them a few times  i typically replace them once a week  as i only use them a couple times per week  it depends on how often you use it and where they re being used   i highly recommend these masks  give them a shot      
271,4.0,                       tight fit that loop over your ears and provide a good seal though enough air escapes that your sunglasses or glasses still fog up a bit  they take getting used to as they re harder to breathe in than a surgical or cotton mask  if you have a larger head these may not work out  they give me a bit of a headache after wearing for awhile but still wearable and make us feel safer  layering under a surgical or cotton mask the  holes  other reviewers point out aren t holes  no air escapes or gets in through them  they re merely heat sealed areas created by the manufacturing process  no worries there  try them  may you all be and stay well      
272,2.0,                       small size  poor fit  nose clip is not strong enough to prevent air leakage  sending them back  amazon needs to clearly indicate  country of origin  on their products  of course  they ll never do that      
273,5.0,                       this type of kn   mask is a step up from the regular disposable mask   the packaging is nice and it has five packs of five masks each   the first thing i noticed was how much more tightly the mask fits to your face than the regular masks which is the purpose of the mask in the first place   it folds so you can put it in your pocket   all these kn   type masks make you look a little  duck like  but it does seem to make it a little easier to breathe   i m satisfied      
274,5.0,                       i love this mask  it s very comfortable   fits securely on my face  i actually prefer this one over the surgical masks i ve been wearing  i ve performed the tests necessary to ensure this mask is not an imposter  it s      legit and i feel well protected wearing it  i will be purchasing more      
275,5.0,                       the mask covers the nose and mouth securely  feels comfortable for the most part except that the bridge of the nose  the fabric will flip over and it will rub your nose raw  i m a massage therapist and i do plenty of talking educating my patients and scheduling appointments  this little problem makes me feel the need to take my mask off and touch  not only my face but my mask to  fix  it  it s is light in weight so it doesn t sit heavy on your face so that adds to the comfort  i m claustrophobic and this mask doesn t hinder my breathing with its stretch  although with taking it on and off in an attempt to  fix  the nose problem  the elasticity of the bands will weaken  i have pulled on these bands  on a new mask  to have it break  i didn t feel i pulled too hard  i use a mask extender so i can pull the mask on and off over my head rather than wrapping it around my ears  this also wears down the elasticity of the bands thus making it to slightly slip off the nose i feel safer wearing this mask than others knowing it securely covers my nose and mouth compared to other masks  even with the nose problem  i will also add that not every mask out of this pack causes the nose problem i m mentioning  which kind of adds to any frustration you may already have regarding wearing a mask  i will buy again      
276,5.0,                       i thought i was not going to like it but it is thick enough to not have to worry about it and it does not fog up my glasses and was actually able to wear it for a long time without needing to take it off      
277,5.0,                       these kn   s fit better than the cloth mask that i was using   they feel good on my face and they are thicker which makes me feel that i am getting more protection   plus the ear elastic works like a charm      
278,5.0,                       these are great masks   i feel they give much better protection than the cloth masks i have been wearing   they are comfortable and allow me to breathe easily   they also fit snugly   very pleased with the purchase      
279,1.0,                       horrible and it stinks     
280,5.0,                       i used this product when getting groceries or other places that were occupied by a large group of people  i like the masks for this purpose  however  for me i felt they were warmer than other masks  i will still wear them  just takes a little getting used too  very well made      
281,5.0,                       these masks were just as advertised and a good value   for most of us who don t need a surgical grademask  these kn   s are much better than the average mask and great when you are going to be in a store forany length of time      
282,4.0,                       kind vendors  i sent this back once and gave up when it was sent to me again with exactly the same problem   the picture you show of the black mask does not match the black mask in the sack and i particularly chose your mask because of the nose brace s outside material and for its graphics and these do not match the picture shown on amazon s website and amazon s picture is the same that you offer above  thank you sooo very much if you could know that i m sharing this with sincerity and not to be unkind or critical  and of course warmly thank yous for making masks at all  wishing you abundance and all richest blessings   patricia     
283,5.0,                       these are exactly what i thought they would be except i was hoping they would be black on the inside  they are white on the inside  that is the only thing i would change      
284,3.0,                       this mask is problematic unless you have a small circular face  the material is rather stiff and on larger faces  or faces that aren t round  it will be difficult to get a good seal and the mask will slip and slide  usually downwards  when that happens the mask is practically worthless   that said  the instructions specifically tell you this may happen and you should look for a different mask  great warning if you could actually return the product after you read the disclosure      
285,2.0,                       i bought these because i was of the impression they were reusable  all other ones i looked at said somewhere whether disposable or reusable  i was disappointed  although quality is ok other sellers have the same quality for better price      
286,5.0,                       bought these mask because we saw people wearing on plane when we fly  looked high tech and comfortable so we bought them  does everything stated on package so far  comfortable as can be and folds up nice  fits in any pocket      
287,5.0,                       i received my mask in two days with amazon prime  the  mask are  just what i was looking for   they fit great  comfortable  has a good stretch and just enough thickness and i can breath in them   the only problem was the smell  it was pretty strong   what i did to get rid of the smell   i open all five of the mask plastic wrappings they came in  open each mask   laid all    of the  mask open on my table  sprayed the inside and outside of each mask lightly with witch hazel or rubbing acholol  which ever you prefer  and let them air out overnight  in the morning all    of the mask had no more strong smells  then i use ziploc  the small ones and put five in each bag and use them as needed  this is what work for me  i will definitely order again when i get low      
288,3.0,                       given the current status of the epidemic  i ordered these for me and my husband   they fit me fine  but  they are way too small for an adult male of average proportions   we ll save them in case our grandchildren need them   the quality is fine  but they are a disappointment because they seem to be made for women and children      
289,5.0,                       my wife and i are pleased with the fit   i checked that this mask manufacturer is on the fda emergency use authorization list of chinese manufacturers   yes  chengde technology ltd  is on the list   it s nice that it s an n    equivalent when n   s are so hard expensive to obtain      
290,5.0,                       have done extensive research on these kn   masks before and after purchase   the fda and health canada have been inspecting these imported ppe devices since      and no recall notice on this product as of feb       fit and comfort is good and the cost is competitive with currently imported covid    masks   although they arenot niosh osha approved  they meet criteria set by the u s a   fda  and health canada as eua      
291,1.0,                       based on other reviews i m wondering if i got the same product      
292,1.0,                       i performed a qualitative fit test on one of the masks and it failed instantly  these masks do not provide the coverage of an n        
293,1.0,                       i was just told by my doctor today that the kn   masses  don t meet the the american  standards they are alright  in china  but don t meet the standards in the united states      
294,5.0,                       these are light  well made  and fit tightly  they have a faint chemical smell but it s not bothersome  it fits me fine but i am a woman with a normal sized face  it s tight on the adult men in my household  but we still wear them  good value for protective masks      
295,5.0,                       these masks are quality made and far better than cloth masks  they fit comfortably and snugly   making them better suited for protection during this pandemic   the price is very reasonable  too     
296,4.0,                       these masks are small  and do not cover much of the face  the ear loops are quite snug too  i am a medium sized woman  and they fit me just fine  however  my husband and son are over   feet tall  with large noses  the ear loops are much too tight  and uncomfortable  for them to wear      
297,3.0,                       while the mask is very comfortable and form fitting i found it difficult to breathe though like other reviewers on here  much less breathable than many n   masks i ve worn  i don t know if it s the black color or what on the flip side the mask is comfortable and seals well but i think i ll shop for a different brand      
298,5.0,                       this mask fits fine and has a good secure feeling around my face      
299,5.0,                       these are amazing masks  i have made many in the past year  yet these fit me the best  i have floppy ears  and the seal of these is perfect  just as all medically recommended  i have give several yo friends and again  as i did the ones i made  to medical friends      
300,5.0,                       i have ordered two other brands of masks online  only to be disappointed  i was hoping the third time would be the charm  it definitely was  my son and husband are difficult to please when it comes to comfort and breathing through masks  but these  filled the needs for our household  they were the right level of thickness  the straps had just the right amount of stretch and mask itself is comfortable  i will definitely be reordering      
301,3.0,                       i just received these   the fit is o k  but the straps are a bit too tight   i have a l xl head   there is a slight chemical smell to the mask   not unexpected for a synthetic product  but it does make me uncomfortable having it close to my face   what exactly am i breathing in      
302,1.0,                       i can t wear these masks  the smell in the material is terrible  do not recommend      
303,5.0,                       i love these masks  they are very comfortable but make me feel safe  they are well fitting and make a good seal without being too tight  will buy more of these      
304,5.0,                       these are great masks  so much better than the blue surgical masks  they re much higher quality  smaller  fit better  seal much better  thicker  more layers   and claim to be far more effective  it s a little harder to get air in and out  but that s because they filter better      
305,5.0,                       this is my first time to purchase this product  i definitely recommend this item because it was really nice and comfortable to use  and their customer service are so awesome  they are good for all of your concern  i totally give this   star  satisfied and successfully purchase      
306,5.0,                       i usaed one  this morning and it  was  very  comfortable plus my  glasses  didn t  get fogged up  like  the extra  room over  the nose as to the ones that are  up against your nose     
307,4.0,                       the only problem or i would have given them a   star total was that they had a medical type smell but if you take them out of the packaging and hang them somewhere for a day or so it goes away   otherwise very comfortable  much easier to breath and definitely feels a little more snug around the face bam     
308,5.0,                       since these a cup shape they don t sit tight over the nose and seem to leave a little extra breathing space   i don t have to wear a mask for very long so i can t comment on wearing them over a long space of time      
309,5.0,                       i m lucky enough to work from home so i only need a mask for when i run errands  this mask fits the bill   it fits my face securely with very little leakage   it s snug fit at the nose also cuts down dramatically on  not completely eliminates  fog on my glasses  i can breathe just fine and the ear loops do not bother me   for a mask  i find it comfortable   most important part  it has kept me covid free   i just bought another pack i like them so much   if all you need them for is errands  i highly recommend them      
310,1.0,                       these masks are coated with some kind of nauseating  chemical   i don t know what the toxicity is  but it was enough to make me vomit from the fumes emitted from the mask     they are made in china  and do not know if there is any kind of safety regulations governing chemical toxicity in this product also    i am of a small build  and these masks were too small for my face  they would fit a    year old       
311,4.0,                       we ordered this mask to not have to wear two masks which is now being asked of us to do   this mask is a   layer mask and much better than the masks that we have been wearing therefor more secure   it is very comfortable and we are able to breathe we are giving it   stars and not   because our glasses are still fogging up even though there is the metal bridge on the nose   we have squeezed it close to our nose a few times and our glasses are still fogging up   but great mask and we do not have to wear   masks now        
312,4.0,                       the fit is far more breathable than the surgical mask  the cone configuration helps a lot with comfort  my kids do not like them for athletic practice  i wish the nose wire fit a little tighter  i find myself adjusting it often      
313,1.0,                       mine has holes   no way are these what they claim to be      
314,2.0,                       i had a box of real n   masks by  m from before the pandemic started   they fit comfortably and tightly against my face all around my nose  cheeks  mouth  and chin   as though they were designed for my face   however  these particular kn   masks do not fit tightly against my face at all   significant air leaks in and out  bypassing all filtering material   regardless of how good the filtering material is  it does no good for all that air that leaks around it   by the way  at the beginning of the pandemic  i donated my remaining n   masks to a local hospital      
315,1.0,                       these kn   masks are not certified by the us national institute for occupational safety and health  and are inferior to n   masks  the kn   masks  which are certified via chinese standards  also filter out and capture     of     micron particles  but there are differences  filter layers of n   respirators were    fold thicker and had   fold higher dipole charge density than that of kn   respirators   a study published in december found      
316,1.0,                       these are not niosh approved kn   masks  they will not keep you safe from covid   especially the new variants  buyer beware  buy only niosh approved kn   masks that are clearly labeled niosh approved      
317,5.0,                       i have copd so wearing any mask is difficult  this one makes me feel better during covid    but not quite as comfortable as others  trying to breathe normally is extremely difficult to wear for any length of time      
318,4.0,                       these are nice   yet a little small      
319,1.0,                       the straps are too loose and don t hold the mask properly  works when you inhale  but when you exhale due to the air resistance the mask gets pushed from your face and exhaled air is not filtered  this works to protect the user  but defeats any protection for others  if you wear glasses  you are      guaranteed they will fog up when you exhale  my face size is pretty average  but the lack of any seal other than the nose clip really prevents this mask from working properly      
320,1.0,                       there are dozens if not hundreds of holes in the mask  see photo  this allows things like the covid    virus in      
321,5.0,                       i didn t think this would be different from the everyday mask i was using and i was wrong   the first time i wore one it was   degrees outside with a wind chill of     below   stepping outside of my car my face would normally get cold quickly but the mask didn t allow any outside air to penetrate and when i took it off my face was warm   so it does what it s suppose to do  keeping the air droplets from entering and keeping me safe      
322,5.0,                       awesome masks  have been using them for a couple of weeks when i go out  i m still quarantined and only go out when absolutely necessary  since i don t have an immune system due to my medical conditions  but these masks fit my face just fine  and i can breathe well  they come wrapped in packs of   in a resealable bag which is great  i can keep them in my car      
323,5.0,                       these mask are great  very sturdy  nothing like the cheap ones from the big box stores  they do get hot after wearing for prolong periods  i would recommend these to anyone      
324,5.0,                       i bought these after reviewing the fda website for approved kn   masks and reading prior reviews   i held the mask into the light and could not see anything   the mask fits great on the face and covers all areas as it should  i could breath without difficulty and because it is away from your face somewhat in the center of the mask it does not tickle the nose   i gave some to my adult childrent and teenage grandchildren and they all like them and fit well  i do not think my   year old granddaughter likes it as it is too big for her face   i would definitely recommend these but always check the fda website first      
325,5.0,                       this mask is comfortable and is designed so that you can talk without the mask touching your mouth  i particularly like that it doesn t smear my lipstick  as i don t wear it when i am alone  but still enjoy wearing my lipstick  it is thick  so i feel more protected when wearing it  but notice that when i am speaking to someone  i need to project louder to be heard clearly  as i have a soft spoken voice  overall  this is my favorite mask  i have plenty of different ones      
326,2.0,                       this product is typical of a chinese company as their government businesses are unethical   don t care about the safety of people so they have no regulations  the masks smell horribly of strong chemicals that i fear may cause long term irreparable health consequences  the ear loops are too big  so it s difficult to get a snug enough fit to the face      
327,5.0,                       i like the kn   mask because like all other mask it doesn t elastic band doesn t pull on year earsand you an breath better and i also that it have   layer for protection     
328,4.0,                       quality seems fine but they are way to tight around the ears and the bands don t stretch out  it hurts  if you are a larger individual i wouldn t consider these  when i say larger i don t mean fat i man larger build and size      
329,5.0,                       these are the best  since pandemic started we have purchased so many masks  because of  our concerns for our lives  we were faced with an unknown virus and this world has been scrambling for safety   these are the first masks that fit  feel  and provide what i have been looking for all along   they are black    ply  breathable and not so bad looking   i am happy and i hope you will be too      
330,4.0,                       switching to more aggressive use of masks  these seem like they re well made  they fit pretty tightly  they re listed in the government s approved list   they arrived ahead of schedule  always a plus      
331,5.0,                       kn   works great  don t even have to put the plastic frame with other reusable masks or daily use masks  has enough space when worn  comfortable enough to breath and it folds nicely      
332,1.0,                       these are extremely small and not made for the average american face  air flow is much more restricted than surgical masks making breathing difficult  the nose portion top is pointed and narrow  the mask covers about half of your cheeks  compared to surgical masks  they also have an oily odor and your voice is highly muffled      
333,5.0,                       i really like these masks  as they give me more room to breath  the extended cone of the mask allows me to at least feel like i can breath better  now  if i am running or exerting myself a lot  it is harder to grasp that much air so fast  i feel well protected with this kn   mask  much more comfortable than with a cloth mask or   medical paper type blue masks      
334,1.0,                       at work for a municipality  i received a kn   masks that has chinese writing and gb          printed on them  they seem a lot better than these problems thickness  feels a lot thinner than the   ply mask i received from work  despite claiming it has   plys   i would cut one open to find out  but i m going to return them because that s how disappointed i amnose clip   the nose clip is made from a lot thinner metal than other masks and because of that  doesn t have the strength to create a good seal  and because of that    seal   the seal around the nose is horrible  due to the thin metal nose clip  no matter what i try  i cannot create a seal around my nose  and can feel the air rushing past both sides of my nose into my eyes  and not a tiny bit  a tremendous amount   although i do not wear glasses  i would imagine that these would cause them to fog up pretty badly i cannot express how truly frustrating and aggravating it is to try and find a quality mask on amazon  and considering your health is literally on the line  and like me who has their     year old mother with preexisting conditions staying with them  and that of a loved one   unfortunately i work a job where i come into close contact with numerous people every day  and though they wear masks  they re nothing but single layer cloth coverings i don t put much faith in what s worse is that amazon will not allowregular consumers to buy any of the niosh approved masks  so we re basically forced to walk a mindfield of cheap  chinese knockoffs with misleading claims and probably fake reviews   and even when the reviews are legitimate  it seems as though some people have a much different opinion on what constitutes a quality mask than i do   a lot of reviews claimed this is a good mask  and i honestly can t see how they came to that conclusion other than that they re probably comparing it to a cloth face covering you buy at a box store  because if you compare this with a decent kn   mask  it seems like a napkin or a toy this was my first attempt at trying a kn   mask from amazon  and when i was making the gamble on which to pick  i d come across products like these where most of the reviews were good  with a few bad ones   i wrote off the bad ones thinking they were just being way too picky or crazy  and now i realize i was wrong    the negative reviews are right  and the positive ones are wrong      
335,5.0,                       i like the number of layers and the shape  which has a  pouch  for easier breathing  it fits securely around my mouth and nose but doesn t close in on either  the sturdy construction gives me confidence  it is now my favorite mask      
336,5.0,                       it fits perfect and is a big improvement on the masks we usually use wear  no complaints so far  and other nurses are noticing and are also impressed with the way they fit   i shared since we were working in a vaccine clinic all day      
337,5.0,                       i really like these masks  si much room to breathe  my husband says his glasses fog up  though  and i m unclear if they re good for multiple  or only one time use  couldn t find the anywhere      
338,1.0,                       the cut of this mask is too extreme  it d fit someone with a trunk or a snout  too goofy looking for me  i d never leave the house in this      
339,2.0,                       the mask seems to have some good features  however it did not seal at all on my face and consequently is useless as a      mask  at least for me   there s nothing particularly unusual about my face  so i imagine the mask would not seal for many people   additionally i found the elastic uncomfortable on my ears after an hour or so   amazon has been carrying a us made n   mask that seals perfectly for me and is vastly more comfortable than this chinese mask      
340,2.0,                       they had some type of heavy industrial odor inside the mask  it was hard to put on because of the smell  it was like some kind of heavy industrial  cleaner had been placed inside the mask  i have to spray them out with disinfectant to try and hide some of the smell      
341,4.0,                       stylish with that gman look  i feel though that too much air escapes at the top  i got a fat head too   recently went to my grandmithers funeral and the black color worked out well  rip grandmom      
342,5.0,                       very comfortable and good seal  someone mentioned that they could not find these on the fda s list of approved kn   masks  but i found them  listed under the manufacturer chengde  see picture      
343,1.0,                       this does not have the efficacy and fit of an n   mask  it is thin  loose  and you will have gaps if you have a thin face      
344,5.0,                       the mask fits me and my    year old son perfectly  i have to knot the elastic to make them tighter for a better fit as my face is smaller  my husband  who has a very pointy nose  seems to have trouble adjusting the metal band so there s no air leakage near his nose bridge  i recommend propping your mask open and letting it air out for a day or so before use  they have a plastic like odor upon first opening  we plan on gifting them as stocking stuffers      
345,4.0,                       i like these masks because they have enough form to them that they don t cling to my mouth and cause irritation   i ve found that surgical masks irritate my face  and cloth masks get damp  which also irritates my skin   these fit snugly on my face  but have sort of a  beak  that keeps the material away from my mouth   the ear straps are comfortable  too      
346,3.0,                       we found kn   masks at a reasonable price  so we purchased them  they arrived a day early  the first time i tried one on  the ear loop detached  i fixed it with a stapler  my wife did not have the same problem  the ear loops don t have enough give in them for my comfort  your ear is pulled forward  when the mask is in place  i used one at the grocery store the other day  and i was getting a headache  they are very snug   probably not a bad thing   but also uncomfortable for me  to be fair  my wife did not have the same  fit  issue that i did  they fold in half very well and are easy to put in a coat pocket  i find the blue disposable masks much more comfortable  but the kn   may offer more protection      
347,5.0,                       i m a      lady and most masks kill my ears  got these today and am so happy that the ear bands while snug don t seem too tight  but my nose air seeps out into my eyes probably because the mask fits almost up to my lower eyelid  maybe the search for the great mask is still on     
348,4.0,                       i give this highmarks    because it fits snugly under my glasses and  as a result they fog up very little  and    because it s tighter fitting than a paper medical mask and  as a result i feel quite a bit safer out in public  whether others are masked up that said  it is a little harder to breathe in  but my o  rate was still     at the drs  office today i had covid pnemonia in november  i ve heard from plenty of people who got it twice  this will be my everyday mask      
349,4.0,                       grandson loves them  but they don t fit my face  loops stretch  but mask doesn t for better fit      
350,4.0,                       there is a slight smell from manufacturing when you first open the packages  i just hung them to air out for   hrs and it was gone  not a big deal at all  i am really surprised at how well the masks conform to different faces  they aren t bothersome to wear  i think they did a good job making them      
351,2.0,                       i cannot get this mask to seal against my nose  which completely defeats the purpose   the wire is too weak to stay put   you have to keep pressing it down to stay sealed also  this is a very small mask   i am a small woman and it just fits  barely   my husband is an average sized person and it is not long enough to cup around his chin or even begin to seal around his nose   very disappointed   i ordered these because consumer labs recommended them   will let them know the size and sealing issue
