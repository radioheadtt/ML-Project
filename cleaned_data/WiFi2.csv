0,1.0,                       i don t think this did any good  the wifi network is still the same  the led light turned red because is farther away from the wifi  i don t understand what purpose this serves  i wanted to place this in my bedroom which is away from the router  but the red light turns on  i don t have many power sockets in the apartment to be  halfway  from the router  fails to serve its purpose      down the drain  also  it is not that quick  it takes time to start  the network keeps dropping  turns red then green  and then red again pretty frequently  don t invest your money in this      
1,5.0,                       i got a wifi extender for my apple router  very easy to connect  you simply download the app and follow the instructions add the device on the app  set up in about   min  i got one since two rooms require internet  aesthetically  it looks great too which i like  i did a bit of research before buying an extender since i didn t know which one would work with my apple router  i just connected to the wifi i had already set up with router  seamless connection  i actually ended up buying a second for downstairs  i just added the device to the same app  make sure to get your phone close enough when u add it because the first time i did it  i still saw my first one but when i started over i was able to see the second extender  also i recommended renaming the second one when you save the new connection  connect the extender to your wifi with the wifi password  you ll see both on your app  happy with my purchase      
2,5.0,                       this was the easiest installation i ve ever encountered    and it works great    i used the wps method and had it operational in minutes   my provider is xfinty    i bought their   cube mesh extender and the install was a total nightmare  range did not improve   and it switched over to    g    and disabled all my    g  smart devices   i had to purchase all new    g outlets and reconfigure all my security cameras   i bought the  cubes  directly from xfinity and returned them and got my money back the tp link ac    boosted my range by at least    feet  best      i ve spent in quite a while          
3,5.0,                       i bought this on a leap  really had no idea if it would work  i get terribly weak wi fi in my bedroom  i have centurylink let me tell you i am beyond impressed  it takes minutes to set up the first time  after that it is quite literally smooth sailing  i do my sons distance learning in my room and was having to use the data on my cellphone because the tablet they gave him couldn t get a good signal  we plugged this in there and haven t had an issue since  if i unplug it for any reason i just gotta plug it right back in  i don t have to set it up again  which is pretty cool  if you are looking around for a good wi fi extender i really wouldn t look any further  really  get this one  i can t really speak on how good the tech support is  but that is only because i haven t had a reason to contact them  which is wonderful      
4,5.0,                       i was skeptical about purchasing this and wasn t sure if he would  be a waste of money or not but it is great  i installed a roku tv in my garage which requires wifi but my garage was too far from my router to get a good signal  i couldn t watch anything without buffering  this fixed my issue  i put it about half way in between my router and my garage tv  literally pressed a button on my router and plugged this in and it worked immediately  there was no installation  took me all of maybe    seconds out the box and it was working  it s like a miracle product really  would      recommend and purchase again  if you re skeptical  don t be  buy it  well worth it      
5,4.0,                       although the red light shines steadily  indicating a weak signal  it was enough to keep from losing my streaming connection   but barely   on occasion there is still an interruption and reload   i have a      sq ft house which is probably a bit larger than this product is really set to handle   if your house is smaller and the ranges are less  then this is a good product for the price      
6,5.0,                       i have    mbps internet and my router maxes at about    mbps per device over wifi  in my garage we were experiencing buffering because it s the furthest from the router and behind   walls  it can handle   walls perfectly fine but adding   more when moving the office was too much  that    mbps wifi per device from my router was dropped all the way down to   mbps   which indicates very significant signal loss  shows were buffering and xfinity streaming app likes to shut off due to the ipad reconnecting every few minutes  frustrating i plugged in the tplink re    and could not get any of my devices to retrieve an ip address from the device  it said it was connected to my router fine  after investigation i realized i was using a setting on my netgear router that turn all   wifi signals into one name and the router will assign which band you re on  that was causing the issue  turning off the option on the router immediately fixed the problem and now i have   mbps  wifi in the garage with both the wifi extender and ipad showing full signal on both devices  i was worried about the internal antennas not giving enough output buy it s essentially doubled my wifi range  they re on sale right now for      anyone complaining that it doesn t work doesn t know anything about networking   or got frustrated and give up      
7,2.0,                       so i live in a small apartment with thick walls  and my router is in a bedroom at the end of the apartment so my signal is horrible in the living room at the beginning of the apartment  so i wanted to try a extender to help with the signal  it works   just not great  put it mid way like directed and it seems like it s still to far   remember my apartment is small  tried the kitchen  not great  so it s in the bathroom which is closer than the kitchen by maybe   inches  and it worked better but    g is red and  g is green   i still have slow wifi   i guess i was expecting to much thought it would give me uninterrupted wifi like in the room but hey something is better than nothing lol     
8,3.0,                       this was easy to install and provided additional signal to an area of the house that was weak however after multiple tests  my     mbps download speed   when going through the tp link   drops off    mbps to     mbps total bandwidth   that seems excessive   i turned off all    ghz to ensure i was only getting  ghz   i then brought it into the same room as my router and using   laptops  connected either directly to my xfinity wifi router      mbps download     mbps upload  or the tp link      to   mps download     mbps upload    this was on  ghz  same room as the router with no interference   so even though it provides a signal to remote areas of the house  the throughput drops off dramatically if that is an issue for you   if not  then it works great in all other aspects      
9,3.0,                       i have tried this extender in several different areas of the house  a plus is the app that can tell you if it s placed well  in a zone where the original wifi isn t optimal  but beyond that  it s a bust   i have it in the entryway with a metal entry door  and the signal can t get outside   i ve had it in the back yard in the alcove with the water heater  and the signal only goes another     into the yard   the alcove is made of wood  and has a metal door  it might work better if the signal can escape via a window or wifi porous wall  but my house isn t set up that way      
10,5.0,                       i bought this to leech off of my parents wifi signal lol  they said i could   my family and i are currently staying in a mother in law suite  log  next to their house  log  while we wait for ours to be built  their router is on the second floor  about      away from where i ended up putting this device  their ethernet speed is about   mb s download  we get around    mb s with this  which is enough for   devices to stream  i can sit out in the screened porch and still stream  which is about     and two log exterior walls from this device  worth the price to me  no issues      
11,1.0,                       it was great when it first set up  decent connection coverage for my basement  however  after months of usage  it started slowing down     now to the point of unusable  all this while nothing was changed since the initial setup    nothing was done on it and it somehow stopped working     did many resets and google help for it    no good      
12,5.0,                       do a speed test before then after you install this item   you should see a difference   best way to get up and running is to download the app onto your iphone   also  in windows    bottom right your wifi symbol should see all lines full strength now   another way to get this device to work is to connect an ethernet cable from your computer to the extender   then in microsoft edge type in               to connect to it   you may need to reset the the device by plugging a pin into it before you do this if you it was working and stopped working      
13,1.0,                       had this for   months and needed to move it  i pulled it out of the outlet and one of the metal prongs snapped and remained in my outlet  i had to turn my power off and get it out with pliers   i contacted customer service on their live chat  after over an hour they say i have to pay for shipping back to them  shipping would be at least    on an item that is     do not buy any tp link products if anything happens they expect you to ship it back on your dime and wait weeks for a replacement      
14,4.0,                       i bought this device because my house has walls that eat wifi signals  my main router is upstairs but most of my devices are downstairs  i have spotty and slow wifi connectivity with my stock u verse router  especially downstairs  i installed this device upstairs near the u verse router but closer to the middle of my house  it actually did a nice job of giving me more stable wifi connectivity  instead of  weak  wifi signals on my devices i now have average or good signal strength  i am much less likely to lose connection than i was before  in my case this device was a definitely improvement the only complaint i have is that on occasion you have to power cycle the device  several times i ve had to just stop talking to my devices  the wifi network it creates just goes away  but it comes back immediately after a power cycle  i go through this maybe once or twice a month  it may be inconvenient but i must say that it is still way better than the horrible connectivity i have without it  in the future i may buy a smart plug and have it schedule weekly power cycles at  am in short i can recommend trying this device if you have spotty wifi connectivity  like anything wireless there are no guarantees  however i can say that it does work for a number of users so don t be afraid to give it a whirl      
15,2.0,                       i installed it in just a few minutes  i have    mb internet  my main router is on the first floor and tp link on the second floor  i wanted to use it in an area where i get    mb speed   it connect shows strong single   if i connect my ipad to the extended link i get    mb  if i connect to my wireless i get    mb so it does work but not at great speeds  going to keep it and just connects lights and guest to it i did also try it turning off one band to spreed it up  no difference     
16,2.0,                       i ordered this little device back in september to extend our wifi due to continually working from home   i do a lot of zoom meetings as i am a teacher   this device was amazing for about the first month  now it is constant interruptions associated with lots of error messages saying the wifi does not have valid configuration   requested tech assistance from our internet provider only to find out it is the device itself   like i said great while it lasted  set up was really easy using the app that i downloaded from the apple store      
17,3.0,                       i bought the extender to use it in wireless client mode  often also called the media bridge mode   so that i can add a device that supports only wired ethernet connection to the wifi network   it works  but not completely satisfactory  due to some undocumented limitations    the extender supports only some  ghz channels but not others   the extender cannot see the host ap on channel         mhz   and i have to reconfigure the host ap to channel         mhz  to be visible to the extender   i am guessing that the extender lacks  dfs tpc capabilities and thus cannot support channels          if so  that excludes over half of the  ghz wifi channels in the united states   this is a serious limitation and is not documented anywhere    there is no way to turn off extended network completely   the re    emulator on tp link website shows that you can disable extended network for both    ghz and  ghz bands   on the real hardware  you must enable extended network for either the    ghz or the  ghz bands  or both    the ui does not allow turning both off speed is satisfactory   i get    mbps via  ghz uplink  which is adequate for my needs the second limitation probably would not affect most people   but the first would affect all users relying on  ghz uplink   the limitation should at least be documented on the datasheet   if the extender cannot see your host ap on  ghz  try moving the host ap out of the dfs tpc channels      
18,4.0,                       super easy to get it to link to my router  it took maybe   tries to connect through the wps   but when i went to connect my equipment it didn t work   it took me a few hours to troubleshoot it because all of the links and instructions were poorly written and didn t address the issue i was facing  therefore a poor rating on the technical assistance    what i found out is that the feature called onemesh  which allows for the extender to assume the same original password as the router  unfortunately is not compatible with my centurylink router   i thought i had done my research adequately before buying  but i guess not so i downloaded the app to manage the extender and had to find out what the factory password was   unfortunately it wouldn t let me modify the extenders original password   the crazy thing was that the factory password was bulletproof because it was     random characters  so entering in that code into all of my equipment connection settings was painstakingly time consuming   but after     hours i finally am set up and operating      
19,5.0,                       kids stuck at home in zoom meetings for classes  got more then one child  or you are working from home and so is your spouse  need to be on   different ends of the house to avoid cross talk in meetings  signal too weak to do that  that was my house  added this device and the whole house has wifi now that is  usable    only thing i didn t like was having to install yet another application on my phone to setup and manage the device      
20,2.0,                       there is no effort to install  consider it just plug it in and work instantly  however the signal constantly dropped off my net work  i use tp link router  so i don t think there could be system conflict or that sort  for its price  i was not expecting it to be wide coverage  but  all i want is stable signal and it failed  you might want to just have a better coverage router  if you are looking for  stable wifi extender  you might want to shop something else  i like tp link but  i don t recommend this      
21,5.0,                       when trying to install a smart tv  i discovered that the wifi signal in that end of the house was not strong enough to allow installation   i learned about this product through research on the web   installation was a breeze and the signal was moderately strong   the bandwidth has been sufficient to operate the new tv with no glitches and no noticeable delays for buffering i am very satisfied with this product      
22,1.0,                       it failed miserably as a range extender  there was no meaningful gain in range  much much worse  was the speed of its  ext network  it was unbearably slow comparing to my original router network  it took forever to load a simple web page  the only good thing about it was the easy setup  but that s rendered pointless when you couldn t use it at all  all for nothing  these        price pint range extenders are all pretenders  junk  there s good reason google and others charge up to      for their good routers  those cheap alternatives are just  cheap      
23,5.0,                       i needed to improve wifi in the family room  so i got one of these   works well and solved the problem at low cost background  we added a family room    years ago   because it s at the far end of the house from the office i ran an ethernet cable from the office to the new family room and put a wifi access point in the family room   time and technology made it obsolete  so when i put a new router  netgear r      in the office     years ago i disconnected the access point   wifi in the family room was adequate for phone and email but not streaming video to smart dvd player or roku after doing a lot of research i decided my options were to remove the router and get a mesh network or put a new access point in the family room   for     it was worth trying the tp link       not as fast as the ac     or ac     devices  but for this it works very well   it can be set up as a repeater or access point  which requires a wired connection  which i have    it was a bit trickier to set up than the instructions imply  but the online manual helped   now the streaming works fine      
24,1.0,                       item loses settings and connections with main router  first night device was setup and working well  tested location and it indicated location was good  next day  no wifi at all  all lights off except its own wifi  it lost all settings  next night  loses  g settings  repeat  repeat  repeat  setting up the device after many resets barely works  can t even connect to its own device directly after a factory reset within   foot away using their default ssid and mobile app  if you do eventually get it to locate its device  it doesn t like to stay connected to  g or sometimes won t even locate your  g network that works fine with other devices  when  g is connected  it does not get a strong wifi signal for  g in the same room about    feet away  this device is very flaky setting up  and with general use and functionality  i ve reached out to customer support  they tell me to install the latest firmware  it has it  and ask the same or irrelevant questions with no help on each reply  i have decided to return the product due to its flaky functionality and lack of support      
25,4.0,                       i had a wifi dead spot at the front part of my condo that i did not even know  i did not know this as i am always connected since my cell phone and pad have  g connection  i am on  g connection while at the front part of the condo   there was no signal in my guest room but since i seldom have guest staying  i was not aware of this   recently a friend of mine mentioned that i have a dead wifi zone   i checked it out and sure enough  he is right i had a similar issue with my house which i solved with installing a google wifi system   it works perfect   a   pack covers a multi stories      sq  feet house   i have     mbps download all over   i have about         mbps in my condo   both internet provider is spectrum  different cities   since my linksys wifi router in the condo is doing fine  i rather not spend      to get the newer google nest wifi  spending     to extend my wifi is a no brainer option  so i thought here is the issue   this device while named as an extender is not an extender   it does not act like a mesh system  this device has its own connecting id   that means your device would not automatically connects to it unless you change the wifi connection   so  having a consistent wifi signal while walking around the condo is not what this device can do  it does solve my issue for my guest though   i can now let them connect to this  extender  instead of my regular wifi  at     this is a cheap solution there are other issues with this device   when connecting to it  the wifi speed drops to about     mbps when being close to it   it would drop to       mbps in my front part of the condo   this is acceptable as the speed is still fast enough where i was not getting any signal before if you are still with me after reading so much   here is a pointer   do not use     ghz unless your device does not have   ghz connection   set the host network using   ghz and also use   ghz for your clients  connections   the reason is using     ghz would drop the wifi speed down to       mbps  in my case  your mileage might vary  if you are installing a new wifi system or upgrading   i suggested that you go with a mesh system   this wifi extender does not really extend   it provides another connection point with a different id whether this device would work for you depends on your need   it is not an ideal solution for me but it would do btw   the setup was quite easy and fast   i did spend more time on this as i was playing with all the settings and connecting with my varies devices   if you have one  save some time and just use the   ghz connections      
26,5.0,                       my router is in our  bonus room  over our garage about as far as possible from our family room tv in a       sq  ft  house  i was having big problems with buffering especially since i switched to an all app based streaming service  twice i rented movies on apple tv which never did load  decided i needed a wifi booster and saw a highly touted one that advertises heavily  but i read the reviews of wifi extenders  or boosters   are they not the same   the tc link ac     wifi extender was the highest rated and least expensive on cnet  it was on sale for     at amazon and was a cinch to set up and easy to log on to   uses same name as my router plus  ext and same password  i could never get wifi signal on my ipad on our back porch   now i can check my email and use google and safari while outside  and      almost no buffering when watching tv  nice to be able to enjoy uninterrupted netflix series and films   best     investment ever      
27,5.0,                       i just got it today and i already have it hooked up  my kitchen is a dead zone and my wifi is listed as  fair  in there  i connected this wi fi in the neighboring room and the signal is now listed at  very good   i mainly use the wi fi in the kitchen to stream tv  so it s always cutting out  i was able to watch tv and be on my phone at the same time with no problems we originally purchased a much high brand that had satellites and that kept disconnecting  we returned it  i saw this on sale and figured i would try it out  best decision ever  also  now my basement has a better signal setting it up was very easy i just got it today  so i will update if i run into any issues      
28,5.0,                       needed to boost the internet signal from a   year old fios gateway router located at one end of the house on the  nd floor  to a  rd floor office near the other end of the house  was hoping to place the extender at an outlet halfway up the stairs  on the office end of the house   but it didn t receive a strong enough signal from the router there  however  i was able to place it in a  nd floor bedroom at the other end of the house from the router  and directly under the office  it is sending a strong wifi signal up to the office above  devices are responding much more quickly with the stronger wifi signal  and the signal seems strong and stable  if we need an even better signal for skype or zoom  we could easily run a longish lan cord temporarily up the stairs from the extender s ethernet port to the office i am extremely pleased with this little device  for a very low cost and with a very easy setup  it has solved our connectivity problem that was preventing us from setting up a  rd floor office  i appreciate the flexibility of having the ethernet port      
29,1.0,                       it may work when the distance between it and the wifi signal and the tv are pretty close  otherwise it s useless   it wouldn t work when it was    feet away from my wifi   it would pick up the wifi at ten feet  but didn t provide a useable signal at my tv which was    feet away   i finally gave up and sent it back      
30,4.0,                       simple product  i needed it for the ethernet cable port for my work setup  speeds aren t the fastest  i think i still got about      mbps down with it  sufficient for my needs and cheaper than buying a pair of moca adapters if you don t need these for anything fancy  they work great  app was easy to sue on my phone as well to get it set up and paired with my home network  kinda wish the ethernet port was on the side instead of the bottom and it s hard to plug anything else into the electrical outlet      
31,4.0,                       i get    mbps from router on wired devices and close to a tri band nighthawk r     router i get close to    mbps down from the router alone  but once i configured router as wanted  i only use this extender if i need to have a portable ethernet bridge but even the jack on bottom utilizes   of   pins  rendering bridged ethernet speeds to less than    mbps  so if that s not an issue and yes it is easy to set up with wps  on both bands  but low signal from router is still faster than decent signal on extender for the money and for what it is  it s a great product  just over advertised  i would buy another one if i needed one and didn t want to spend alot of money extending  or really i d go with a mesh system      
32,5.0,                       i have a workshop  metal  about      from the house  and      from the wifi device   my iphone was barely able to get a signal positioned in the window of the shop with a clear view of the window the wifi sits in   yet this device picks up the signal fine  and  i have full   bars wifi in the shop   very impressed   it does get pretty hot  but still seems to function quite well   installation was a no brainer  simple and straightforward   oddly the signal it puts out is strong enough to reach back to the house  whereas the original wifi couldn t quite reacha s strongly to the shop   i returned from the shop  and the iphone still had   bars from the shop      
33,5.0,                       idk why but the wifi doesn t connect to our room  weak horrible connection and i have to move my laptop to the edge of the bed to get any kind of signal for downloads  even the smart tv struggles to connect to stream shows  i m guess the mirrors on the closet doors are making it harder  bought this and installed it in the hallway outside our door      ft from router   and now   problems through our door  love the fact i don t have to be wiggling around corners of the bed for connectivity     
34,1.0,                       connecting was pretty easy  bought      stars cuz   loses signal constantly on the      doesn t even show up on my phone to connect to   i have smart devices that don t use   so i need the     for those  one is upstairs  constantly having a signal loss on       it s up in our loft further than the  st one i set up that loses the     more than it has it  this is extremely frustrating as i have to constantly set up devices and that s gotten old real fast  maybe one is faulty i don t know  i hooked the  st  further known as   ext  wth the wps system  the  nd further known as   ext loft  it found it right away in the app  i can sit outside on the deck watch youtube  vudu   netflix in hd on my laptop or tablet   phone on      but i need     and it needs to be constant  in our bedroom not far from  ext and i m resetting my led strips   smart bulbs and now even alexa every day pretty much  no excuse for this   they came at the same time   did i get a dud update aug   all the seller has done to rectify this is emailing me things to do to  all things i ve tried  so i brought the working one downstairs to see if it was the location  nope the working one is losing the     signal as well  my wifi app to check signal shows it s a great area to add an extender  but it s losing signal  second one is a dud  don t know how much more proof that is  so taking my   stars i have gone to a    may just return these and   that work and have a way better honest customer service  returning both  don t waste your money on these      
35,5.0,                       this review is for use as a access point only  i bought this for use as a access point in my bedroom for phone use  i would get decent signal from the router located in another room  but there was always a lag  i installed this and wow what a difference  pages load fast with no delay  if you can get a ethernet cable to the extender from your router this will set up a new wifi signal that you can connect to and the back haul  to the router will be by cable  so very fast  you can rename the wifi ssid if you like  i also turned off the     ghz signal as it is not needed  also lowered the  ghz transmission power as i am only a few feet from the extender and don t need full power to fry my eyeballs  you get a power choice of h m low  i set it for low and signal is perfect for my bedroom use  my router is a vpn connected router and set up was a breeze  also the set up app has many functions that you can change if needed  lan  dhcp settings etc  also a wifi detective to see whats all connected to your device  this device was money well spent  very happy with the purchase      
36,2.0,                       i live in an apartment so unless we are close to the router  we struggle with wifi connection due to overlap with our neighbors wifi signals  we bought this so the wifi would extend from the living room to my office  again  not that far since we re in an apartment   however  every time i have to be on a zoom meeting  i try to take it from my office and end up needing to move to the living room because this device is just not extending the wifi good enough  i m really disappointed the return window was so short because i was trying to give it a chance and by the time i realized it for sure isn t going to work as i had hoped  can no longer return  in a house without overlapping wifi signals  perhaps this extends fine  for me  i haven t noticed a difference since using this      
37,4.0,                       tp link wi fi range extender ac   i orderded this range extender as our master bedroom is on the backside of our single story      sq  ft house and has too much interference coming from the front room where our cable modem router is located through the kitchen appliances to the master bedroom room  i use a combo cable modem   ac     router which works great for the rest of the house and worked great in our previous   story      sq  ft house with no problems  we are on    mbps plan  and the speeds typically run about          mbps download in the rest of the house except in the master bedroom   bathroom where they struggle to get even     mbps speed on the   ghz channel due to the interference of appliances and mutiple walls  hooking up the to link wi fi range extender ac    took about    minutes using option    which is setting up the extender intially next to your router via the wps button on the cable modem router  you do this  x since once for the    ghz channel and the second time for the  ghz channel  it automatically assigned the two signals with  ghz ext and    ghz ext as i have each channel listed as a seperate passcode signal  it automatically assigned the passcode for each channel  after setting it up i let the extender run for about    minutes to make sure the signal stablized which might or might not make any difference   i am very happy to report that signal now using the  ghz ext boasted the signal from     mbps to       mbps using ookla s speedtest site for verification  the    ghz ext is running in the    mbps range as well which is great as the normal speed is typically in the    mbps range      
38,1.0,                       bought this to help boost the wifi signal to our son s room upstairs  it actually crippled our internet speed  connect wirelessly to our modem  our devices will hold at    mbps no problem  switch the network to the tp link extender and it cuts it down to   mbps  same devices  same hardware  same distance  all we are doing is clicking the other access points  router vs extender   so  boosts the wifi signal from     to     on the upstairs device but cuts the speed from    mbps to only   mbps  this garbage is going back      
39,5.0,                       my problem was that my router s     ghz signal had good coverage in my townhouse  but was clobbered during evening hours with competing signals from neighborhood routers   my roku tv s were constantly freezing   the solution was to use   ghz  a much less crowded frequency  but the higher frequency doesn t have nearly the range of the lower     ghz   after adding the tp link extender between my router and the tv s  i now have a strong   ghz wi fi signal at each tv   no more problems   simple solution   works like a charm      
40,5.0,                       it is essential  when working from home to have a strong internet connection  i called my current network company and  i would need to invest        to upgrade my network  decided to purchase this and honestly  it was the best investment  super easy to set up in    minutes  i downloaded the tether app so it was easier  as soon as set up was done  connected all my devices at home  made sure all were in watching a movie to see how fast it went and it was amazingly fast must buy  no regrets      
41,3.0,                       this device helps to extend the wifi a little  but can t cover as much of the house as i wanted  i initially tried to install this upstairs  our router is on the first floor   but the signal was poor  i moved it down to the first floor about     from our router and it helps to extend the signal to the rooms directly upstairs as well as the garage   however it doesn t really do anything to help with my problem which is my bonus room upstairs  i m keeping it because it was relatively inexpensive but long term i think i ll need something more powerful      
42,5.0,                       our house is about      sq ft over two floors  main tower for internet is upstairs   and our desktop  laptop and smart tv is downstairs most on the opposite side of the house ordered this  son hooked it up  we were away   internet is faster and does not drop  love that it uses the password from the original modem and no need to input the password in again      
43,2.0,                       this extender masks all mac addresses that connect to it   this means when a new client connects to the extender  the real mac gets added to the router so it can connect there  and the fake mac gets added to the extender so it can connect there   this actually makes it worthless to me as the dhcp server assigns static leases based on mac the address   my router firewall currently has about    known  allowed  wifi devices   that s an obnoxious amount of duplication   even if i m not using the access control filtering on the extender  it still masks the mac to the dhcp server   if the mac masking was turned off when the access control is  then i d give this   stars furthermore  after upgrading the firmware  all the fake mac addresses got re enumerated  which nullified all the previous allowances it entered in my router dhcp server firewall so i had to start from scratch again from the extender s manual    q  i have enabled wireless mac filter  wireless access control  or access control list  acl  on my router  what should i do before configuring the extender when a device connects through the extender to your router  the mac address of the device shown on the router is translated to another mac address  if your router s mac filter  wireless access control  or acl is enabled  the devices connected to the extender cannot get an ip address from the extender and cannot access the internet to solve this problem  please follow the steps below   log in to your router and disable the mac filter  wireless access control or acl note  for more information about how to disable your router s mac filter  wireless access control or acl  please refer to your router s user guide   power on your extender  and run the quick setup to configure your extender   connect all of your devices to the extended network   on your router  add all the online devices  mac addresses to your router s mac filter table   enable the router s mac filter  wireless access control  or acl to complete the configuration        
44,5.0,                       i just got it  so i can t comment on longterm reliability yet    if problems emerge in that area  i ll revise this review  but i am very impressed by how easy it is to set up  i already have a tp link router  and i use their tether app on my phone  so that probably makes things easier  but i bet it s pretty easy with other brands  too set up consists of plugging it in near your router and opening the app on your phone  it searches for the new device  and when it finds it    about a minute later    it asks you for a network password  the one your router uses  and a new network name  it suggests networkname ext  but you can make it whatever you want  once it links up with your router    about another minute    and all the signal lights go white  you unplug it and plug it in somewhere midway between your router and the area of your house that needs better service  another minute or two  and if all the lights go white  you re done some reviewers seem to have gone wrong with this last step  they choose a position for the extender that is out of range of the router  of course  this won t work  the extender needs to receive a strong signal in order to extend it  in my house  somewhere around   ft from the router seemed to work best      
45,4.0,                       product was what i expected and hoped for  after setting it up i was able to locate it some     away from the router around a corner and at the top of the stairs with no problem getting a strong wifi signal  my house is made of concrete blocks and it was a little disappointing when the signal strength dropped to medium the other side of the wall with the door closed and a further drop to weak in the next adjoining room  even so i am now able to get a signal where i couldn t previously and i ve not had a problem with my wifi signal since installing it      
46,5.0,                       living in an apt is hard to modify the place and wired it  i have the router on living room and one of bedroom the signal would drop around the room  was thinking about wiring but found this extender and works great   install took   seconds  out of the box and plug into an outlet  simple enough  download the tp link app to setup and again took only couple of mins as long as you follow the app prompts  it creates   other ssid  if using both     and  ghz signals  called same as ur current wifi but with ext at the end  during setup you disconnect from ur wifi and connect temporarly to the extender then you can choose which one to connect to  also simple to check what clients are connected to it its recommended to put between the router and the dead zone  remember the weaker the signal it recieves the weakest will transmit is not a magic box  keep ir in mind while deciding where to install  speed is great and now finally whole apt is covered  definitively will get more when we move to a bigger place note  sometimes ur device will switch wifi ssid automatically but like our apartment sometimes it doesnt  if your speed start slowing down always check to what device you connected to      
47,5.0,                       my bedroom is a wifi dead zone in my house  it doesn t matter how good my router is  i will frequently lose connection altogether or get a really weak signal i put this extender about half way the distance between the dead zone and my router and the connection is amazing  i rarely lose connection  i generally have two or three bars compared to one bar  most importantly my bandwidth speed is anywhere from three to eight times as strong as it was without the extender what i really love about the extender is the meshed network  meaning i don t have to connect to a different wireless network for the extender  it is all one network  so if i move throughout my home i m always on the same network  i don t have to disconnect and reconnect as i go between rooms  for those of you who have used older extenders who made you log into a separate network you know how frustrating this can be this thing was only thirty bucks and it has saved me so much stress and time  i would highly recommend it for dead or weak wifi zones      
48,4.0,                       so i was about to order an uber expensive ones thru another website claiming that they were going to give me     and just with that claim i remembered i tend to always buy everything thru amazon and was so happy that i did  because some of the pricier models did have good reviews but there was always one person not happy  anyway i saw the amount of great reviews with this one and i thought great reviews and great price  let me give it a try  it was ridiculously easy to install and i have wifi downstairs nice and strong and now don t have to get another wifi router making wholes in my walls downstairs  this was perfect   thanks reviewers that is truly what convinced me     
49,4.0,                       i bought these to complement my xfinity modem wifi router and provide a boost of signal upstairs in my bedroom where my iphone s signal drops  the setup of this was very easy and simple  it took me maybe two minutes the downside is that this thing in isolation from their mesh product does not offer simply a relay booster signal  in isolation  you have to create a new ssid for these  eg if your home wifi is myinternet  this would create a myinternet ext  so you have to connect to a second ssid  which is fine except if you re like me where when you walk downstairs and you re closer to the main wifi  my phone is still trying to stay connected to the  ext upstairs  so its signal is much weaker so yeah  these would be great if they could seamless boost my existing signal  and for     i didn t lose a lot of money  but do your research first and find something that can simply emulate your existing wifi ssid  not require you to create a second ssid      
50,5.0,                       bought this to try and extend wifi from a main house on my family s property to my house approximately     yards away  works good for what a paid for  it was just enough to capture the main wifi from the main house  which has a different booster in it  and relay that signal through my approximately      sq ft house  it will cut your speed from the main wireless router but for the     something i paid for it  i am pleasantly surprised that it could grab the main wifi signal from so far away  as a disclosure  there are really no visual obstructions between the houses so this could be why it worked for me at this distance  the setup was very simple and required little to no technical knowledge of wifi systems  for the low price  i recommend trying it if you are in a similar situation as i was  if you want anything with better signal boosting capability  you will have to shell out the     s for a mesh network      
51,2.0,                       very easy to install but like all wifi extenders it suffers from the same short comings  the wifi extender has its own ssid  separate from the main router ssid  this creates a problem  if the device is connected to the main router  it will remain connected to the main router even if the signal is very weak rather than switch to the stronger repeater signal  this creates an unstable network i switched to a mesh router system  tp link deco m    cost is more but the signal is strong  stable and works  in the long run its more cost effective than buying multiple wifi extenders      
52,2.0,                       once you have the extender installed and up and running  it works just okay  not great  half the time it doesn t work great though  the product has just decent range  but nowhere near       sq  ft  as advertised  speeds are also nowhere near     mbps  and i think this product actually has lowered my wifi speeds  at least some of the time  it struggles to extend signals beyond certain walls and hallways  and dead spots persist  for some reason  the connection to my roku tv gets dropped at least once per day  usually in the evening  but only for a few seconds  that s kind of annoying  i m also getting slower speeds and more intermittent signal loss as time goes on installation is a pain  and it took me two tries over about    minutes to an hour to set up the wifi connection with the extender following the directions  at first  i couldn t get all four lights to light up and couldn t get the   ghz to connect  i had to completely unplug the extender and restart the installation steps from the beginning  but with a little patience it worked generally  i m not too happy with this product  it works okay some of the time      
53,5.0,                       pressed wps on my router then the only button on this extender  waited   minutes to connect  then boom   ghz for only my living room tv  netflix  disney  and my youtube content is all instant and the highest quality without the headache of loading buffering or picking my quality  worth the inexpensive amount for the ease of use      
54,1.0,                       so  i ve had these extenders for about   months now  and i regret ever buying them  about    hours a day they just don t work  all lights are on  i ve reset them and reconnected to the router several times and no luck  i can connect with my phone or any device just fine  but my phone for example  will say  connected without internet  and never connect  it is like this half the day  every day  when it does connect  the internet speeds are great  but getting to connect with internet is like a       shot daily for me  the first month it barely ever happened  and now it s a regular occurrence  save your money  buy something worthwhile that costs more because you re wasting the money here      
55,2.0,                       so i don t know if it s me setting up wrong or my internet is terrible  so the only reason i got this wifi repeater is to improve my ping during me playing heavy games like cod and steaming music  my home is fair large and there are some dead stops but it extends it to a point  now i don t know if delivering fast speeds like it say it does but it s not there to say the less so i did two tests one is about   ft away from my router and then another  ft with a ethernet cord and another  ft away with and without enternet cord so ft with no cord on  ghz         up and down is       and a ping of    ms now it spikes up and down and results in me getting pocket lost so i would play cod and there would be a person in front of me the time i start to engage i m already respawing ft with cord      up and    down and ping stay roughy   ms to    ms  ft with no cord   main router   hey um i m sending this information to you can you reach me  over  repeater   lost signal  constantly requesting information then crashes   ft with cord   router   hey are you getting this information repeater   has a stokeso it was a point where i had to disconnect it and reconnect to the router and it would just drop constantly  my provider is spectrum and the up is     and the down is     on our router so i don t know if i m doing something wrong or maybe i m trying to much into it     and my home router is a net gear night hawk and it has it own little armor protection thing and it keeps notifying me about potential high jacking idk  i tried to use the new xbox stream thing as well and it s just crashed my internet so i don t know if i m doing anything wrong but this is my take on this device        
56,4.0,                       i needed to extend our wifi signal from the basement to the other side of the house and outdoors  on the deck and patio  i had bought a previously used unit that was doa  then found this one  right before it went on sale   oh well     on amazon  setup seemed like it would be easy  but took a little futzing as i moved it into different outlets  trying to decide which one provided the best coverage while still getting a solid signal from my router  after going back and forth a few times  hitting the reset button on the router a couple times  and on the unit  it finally connected to the network and i was able to set it up as an extended access point using the phone app since then  it s been working with no problems  and has solved any connectivity issues i might have had in parts of the house yard that were more distant from the original router  a good range extender   available at a lower price now than when i bought it      
57,1.0,                       setup was pretty easy and after testing   different outlets found the one with the  best  placement between the wifi router and my bedroom where the wifi signal is the weakest   initially it seemed like the extender was going to work but about an hour later my tablet started acting weird and constantly losing connection to the extender   reconnected it to the main wifi and things returned to normal   at this point i was concerned that the extender was not going to be working so installed the ookla internet speed test application and in   minutes tested the speed on the main and the main ext in my bedroom multiple times the area with the weakest signal    main internet speeds were      and the extender was in the    s even though it s signal was the strongest see attached image  unplugged the extender  plugged it back in and the results did not change currently returning the extender for a refund      
58,1.0,                       this is the second repeater i bought  the first one which is an earlier version works perfectly and deserves a   rating  this one never worked  when i first installed it  it connected to my my tp link  in use  rather than my router  i would never have known this but i downloaded the tether app  which made me aware  i fixed that by changing the connection  next  i changed the name fro  ext to my router s name  it shut my wifi down  i unplugged it  wifi back working fine  plugged it in again  wifi goes down again  getting tech support takes up too much time so i decided not to  i am extremely disappointed in this product  compared to the earlier version      
59,4.0,                       i got this because in my apartment building  there are thick walls  presumably constructed from steel and concrete   this makes it difficult for a strong signal to make it from my living room to my bedroom  about     walls over a span of about    feet   my wifi signal strength was fine from the isp  so i installed this device at a midway point   long story short  it worked   it s not the strongest signal booster  and you do need to create a separate signal id and password setup   however  i stream videos and games without issue most of the time   on very rare occasion the signal has been weak enough that it has disrupted viewing  low res  error in fire stick  etc     i would recommend it to anyone  having not further explored other devices of its kind   it is reliable and very easy to setup      
60,5.0,                       i was not able to install it correctly following the instructions given  amazon kept wanting to send me a new one  i told amazon that i did not want a new one  i wanted help from tp link technical support to install it correctly  it was extremely difficult to get to tech support  but once i got to tech support he walked me through it and the device works very well  my modem and router are at the other end of the house  so my laptop was not getting a good signal  if i had a nickel for every time i had to show available networks and connect or disconnect and connect  i would be rich  i no longer have that problem  i was a business computer instructor for    years at the community college  so it is not like i do not know anything about computers  but the instructions were not that clear  if you are a real techie  you can probably install it yourself  the device itself works well      
61,1.0,                       i was really counting on this to work but after installing this  easily btw  and trying a couple of locations per the instructions  i shockingly got half the speed as i already had without the device on a different floor of my home  i bought this upgraded device to get up to      since i usually get         on the floor the router is on and         on the separate floor   unfortunately  i am only getting     when i usually get         without it  although it did help with the reach to one additional area  the speeds being half as much as without it is counterproductive  perhaps it is the home construction  but i have to return this      
62,1.0,                       installation was easy using wps  note  its takes a while for the light to be solid and not blinking with you start connecting to router  after pressing the wps button  again  be patient as it takes a while to configure  all this was easymy verizon fios router is in the basement  i have devices on second floor  i got this with expectations that i could possibly place this on my first floor to get better signal on the second  so after setup  i moved it to first floor  then connected my phone while on the second floor  the signal strength and download speed didnt look good  so standing at the same place  i tried connecting to the router directly  i was surprised to see my router actually still had better signal strength and speed when tested via speedtest net      
63,5.0,                       i bought this product to test if it can host my hotspot   route it through its ethernet port into my home router it workedsetup was very easy there is another way to setup this product besides clicking the wps button you can set it up via the web browser after doing that  i just plugged in the ethernet cable   it worked this is a great product for hotspot users wanting internet through ethernet cables from your router  this product works      
64,1.0,                          mbps is far from the truth  my speeds were less     of what they were before  back to back speed tests from the same location im my house i had over    mbps connected straight to my wifi and when connected to this i barely broke   mbps  the    g network was terrible with speeds in the teens  i will be returning this worthless product  why would i pay money to have a slower connection      
65,2.0,                       i bought this wifi extender based upon excellent reviews to enhance the home wifi in my bedroom  the wifi it produces is unstable   unreliable  and the device disconnects at random  i tried it in four different outlets  i will be returning it asap  i love the looks  size  and idea of this device  but it just doesn t work as expected or advertised      
66,5.0,                       with shelter in place and work from home  my wi fi router in the basement was spotty with my desk on the third floor of my      sq  ft  townhouse  after extensive research and reading reviews  would recommend this for price value  easy to install  it took   minutes via the app  and after   weeks  my connection has improved  no issues      
67,1.0,                       i do not understand why i need an app for this   i have other extenders that do not need an app i should have stayed with them   stupid me i did not read the fine print well actually already asked questions   i just went with the average customers review   so i guess it is a principal thing for me   i don t see why i need to  register  with the manufacturer just to use their product   software i kind of understand   like i say i have other extenders who do not require i register my ownership of their product   it s been    hours still no promised e mail with instructions   i am going to throw this thing out   it s is a lump and i cannot do a think with it   you tube shows getting on the tp site and using software but i cannot get on the site so     junk      
68,1.0,                       setup was not an issue via the app  but the range sucked   i suspect because it defaults to using the same wireless channel as the router    so they conflict and add noise to each other logged into the web interface to see if i could adjust this  and found there was a firmware update available   it downloaded and installed automatically via the web utility   then it rebooted and never worked again no wifi signal generated  no leds besides the solid power light  no response to the reset button  device is bricked    minutes with the chat support later  and i was told to get an ethernet cable to try connecting that way   so the tech could drop off the chat while i was gone   not that it matters  it turns out that a dead device with an ethernet cable plugged into it remains dead  amazing if it works for you  great   if not  just send it back and save yourself the time      
69,5.0,                       ordered it on              received it on              the installation was very easy   within    minutes of taking it out of the box it was up and running   it took longer to read the instructions than to implement them   fortunately  my base router supports wps and that made the install very easy   i didn t have to use any of the other install methods so i can t comment on their ease or difficulty i ll update this review in the future to report on the product s durability   but  at just      even if it lasts a just year or so  it s a bargain      
70,5.0,                       looking for a wifi device to replace my ethernet over power line setup in an outdoor application  this one foots the bill nicely  very easy to setup using one of three options listed on the menu  many potentials for this little device  a wifi extender  wap  or extending wired network for my case  very appealing design  i take advantage of its small size by housing it with a poe injector in a small utility box  i can see it s appeals for indoor applications  good wifi signals for its size  i only use one way receiver to connect my wired devices  never drop any connections over   feet over walls for few weeks now  my only complain is the status page doesn t show the devices it connect over the wired port  it might set you off during initial setup  once i know the limitations  i rely on my router for the status of extended devices great value  the new vision will not work for me due to the the location of the wired port inside the utility box      
71,5.0,                       while i gave this firve stars it didn t do what i needed   but it did do everything it said it would   i hate reviews where people cut down on stars when it does what it says   it not it s fault that we wanted it to do more  what i want is either not possible or will cost way more than i want to pay  this does extend the wifi the way it says   we can get it a few places were we couldn t before   but it s way too slow for my use in those places   again it stated that it was just an extender   but the price was low enough to give it a try   and like i said it does extend my wifi      
72,1.0,                       i spent over an hour trying to get this device to connect to my wifi router  which was less than    feet away from where it was plugged into the wall  each time my phone would connect to it  it would go offline while i was trying to configure the device  i finally was able to get it to join the network  but now when i try to join the extender s wifi network  it says the password i set is incorrect and i can t even use it  save yourself a headache and go with another wifi extender     
73,5.0,                       the product works great  after it was set up  i plugged it into a wall socket on the  nd floor next to the chrome book and now the wifi signal is strong  i also set up my desk top and printer via the same device  it definitely made a huge difference in the strength of the wifi signal  however  i could not do the setup myself   which there are three ways to set it up   nothing i tried worked  so much for the   min set up  i ended up contacting t link via chat which in turn  they had someone call me to help me with the set up  that became a     hour adventure with the technician s  to get it done  which in turn cost me      to get it accomplished because the laptop i was using had over      intrusions  and was also infected with a virus  so they had to do a thorough pc cleaning and finally install the t link device  believe me it wasn t a easy install for them either  they definitely had a challenge on their hands but were finally able to get the job done  so don t rely on the microsoft free programs such as  windows defender    fool you into believing your pc is protected from everything  because it doesn t  but now i have a good clean pc supposedly protected from everything   anywhere  via a     day  anti every thing  anti threat program  i suppose all in all it was worth the      for the pc cleaning  getting rid of the virus and getting this device installed  i mean how much would it have cost just cleaning up the pc  getting rid of the virus and all straight from your home      
74,1.0,                       i bought this for our detached garage located just a few feet from my house router   it worked great in the garage until the doors were closed  the doors are just normal garage doors  nothing special   i requested a return and the system only gave me a drop off at kohls  i live over an hour away for a kohls   i called amazon and they said it is up to the seller on the returns   no option  and i was informed there is no way to know return options prior to buying   i am more upset about this sellers return option or lack thereof than the product not working as expected      
75,5.0,                       i had needed this in my life for the past year  i felt like i searched several devices but was unsure how any of these worked and if i figured out how to connect it all     would it even work  the answer is yes   my house is long so my kids room has been running on mobile phone hotspots for almost a year since we moved in  it s super frustrating  after opening the package   the instructions were simple  the app walked me thru everything  plugged it halfway between the router and my problem area and boom  the connection on their tv now says excellent  very happy with this purchase   like super happy      
76,5.0,                       first of all  these are range extenders not signal boosters   whatever signal strength the unit receives  from your router will be same strength the unit transmits   if the signal strength it receives from your router is weak  so will be the strength of the extended signal   it will boost the range of your router  not its strength    garbage in  garbage out  applies the smart tv we have by our pool always displayed the internet strngth as  weak    after i plugged the  ac    wifi extender into an outlet about midway between my router and the tv  the signal strength improved to  good    good is good enough for me set up was seamless   i used the wps button on my linksys ea      router and the unit did the rest  picking up all   router networks and adding a  ext extension to each  resulting in a total of   networks   password for the ac    is the same as for the linksys network   i did need need to use the tether app or a web browser to set it up all in all  i m quite pleased      
77,1.0,                       as i was unable to successfully install this item  i have given it   star ratings when i setup the unit i got a network message   device  unstable    i have verizon fios as my internet provider  i don t know if that has any bearing on the issue   but just info for you to consider  i had purchased   units  both had same result  i tried several times to set these units up  but the warning message always appeared and i didn t feel secure using them   i returned them to amazoni found reviews online that praised this item  i researched them thoroughly online before i purchased them      
78,5.0,                       amazing performance for any price  let alone for    bucks  my router is on the third floor of my house  i placed this in the kitchen on the first floor and the wifi signal  even the  ghz band is a full    i bought a second one and put it in the basement  again  excellent reception  such performance at such distance through     floors is remarkable  the unit is tiny and just plugs into an outlet  set up is the usual process  plug it into an outlet next to your router  press your router s wp button  then the extender s wp button and wait till both acquire signal for both the  ghz and  ghz bands  then unplug the extender and plug it into an outlet wherever you need the boost  and wait till all the lights light up steadily and you are all set  remember that on your device  whether phone  tv  ipad  etc  be sure to check that the extender s wifi is selected  which is your network name that has an  ext  after it  i also have one of the top end tp link extenders that was quadruple the price and didn t provide half the reception as this one  its  ghz band stopped working   there are no cons to this product that i have seen so far  how long it lasts  however  is unknown since i ve only had it for   weeks  if it fizzles out in a year i ll revisit my review  in the meantime  i can t imagine anything else outperforming this for anywhere near the price      
79,5.0,                       so far so good  install wise i did have a little trouble but i m     i tried method one and got lost  so i hoped method three would work  it was a snap almost  after following the instructions i discovered the password i put in did not match my modem  but with the help of the three bars on the search for devices page i found the way to change it  luckily the instructions are written in plain english  if only i could read it  i did not even have to go to tech support to correct my oops  the instruction pages are that easy to use  only problem i still have is with my tv  it cant connect to it in normal operation mode  it can find it but just won t connect  however with the roku that s plugged into it and using it s internet connect instructions it found it first try in less than   seconds  go figure  i d buy this again if needed and would suggest it for seniors  price  install ease and operation are for us older generation that s having trouble keeping up with the new technology okay  it s been plugged in for   months now  i ve been able to connect to it from my shop with a    year old compact computer with a netgear n    extender through four walls with blown in paper insulation at a distance of about     feet and a    foot wide cedar tree  granted i get no more than   bars and sometimes on windy days it loses signal completely  compare this with the same setup in my shop and cut the distance through the same cedar tree  two insulated walls and only about     feet and i get one or two bars to my centurylink wifi modem  facts give this   stars  and this on only service available to us and it s a poor   mbps speed internet  don t get me wrong though  if your in the country and the only thing you can get is satillite internet this won t improve latency and give you streaming video  this is great but only for range      
80,4.0,                       i have this in my garage which is on the opposite end of the house  router is upstairs at the other end    the location tells me that its perfect   this extended the range where i would get maybe   bars wifi  now full connection   the ethernet port is handy if you need it and the other options that you can manage on this are an added plus for the     that this costs   if anything changes i will update my review      
81,4.0,                       as an extender this works just fine  and it works great giving us great rate coverage out in the garden where we had a dead spot that part would get   stars what s not so convenient is the inconvenience of having to manually switch networks  however all extenders i ve seen have this issue  so i suspect it s not specific to this one the setup is  minimally  more complex than others i ve seen  but it gives a lot of configuration options and the management page is also great to tweak settings  if you know what you re doing if you re computer brain dead you can still set it up easily  but if you know what you re doing  this is a good choice i ve now used it for more than a month and it s been pretty stable  i have not had to restart tweak it ever since      
82,4.0,                       i read the reviews outside of amazon  such as cnet and others so i purchased this extender   it was easy to install  via app  and so far it provides a great sign   just keep in might you have to link the components to that extender for maximum use   the signal doesn t transfer from let s says using your usual wifi signal from down stairs to then connecting to the extender upstairs   you ll have to change your wifi on your components manually   so if you use your laptop and want to utilize the extender  let s say upstairs  then link your laptop   the signal is great and i m happy so far      
83,1.0,                       update  i have just had to reinstall this       thing again  that s it  into the trash it goes  buying another dlink extender  makes me darned furious   too late to exchange  etc  do not buy   no internet connection  drives me nuts i bought this and a top rated d link extender at the same time  on my cell phone i have a wifi signal measuring app as well as walked away from each  installed almost side by side  and kept checking signal  the tp link seemed to work well  harder to set up  but lost signal     from the unit  the dlink worked up to      away  and it still works perfectly  whereas the tp link has lost contact with the router twice and needed to be reset as from new      
84,5.0,                       i ve got at t wireless internet  the service is awful  had to reset router a few times every day  response on desktop attached to ethernet port was the worst i ve ever experienced for      i installed this extender  install was super easy       minutes  worked immediately  i assigned wireless printer and two roku devices to this unit and all work better than without it the tv still cycles from time to time but recovers quicker than without this extender so  for      i m reasonably happy  again  the major issue is at t with a download speed of     mbps    believe that    horrible so  given what i have to work with  the extender is doing its job  it helps but does not solve the issues  makes them more tolerable      
85,4.0,                       there are two rooms in my sister s house that get no coverage  my room when i stay there and the living room   this house is probably around              square feet  it is made out of concrete  it is in puerto rico  the setup took a few minutes and it was pretty easy  i looked up the app because i could not get the iphone to recognize the qr code  once setup was completed  i relocated the extender to the second floor hallway  right in between the bedroom that has the modem router and my bedroom prior to the extender  i had   wifi bar in the edge of the bed in my bedroom  there was no signal in the living room and we could never get the tv in the living room to connect  the tv in the living room works great now we now have   wifi bars in the living room and my bedroom  very happy with this extender  works great      
86,4.0,                         stars because ethernet connection is not faster than the wifi speed it provides and slower than wifi speed sometimes  otherwise it does its job for what you pay  i get better speeds on my phone then i used to with being away from the main router  i get     mbps down from the main router when i am at two bar signal and     mbps from the extender which is doubled the speed  my laptop doesn t benefit from it as much  my ps  gets   mbps down and with the extender it gets up to   mbps  its not perfect but i recommend it for the price and functionality combo  easy to install  didn t come with any cables      
87,2.0,                       the first week of using this wifi extender  it worked beautifully and the set up was so easy  the wifi signal was definitely hitting the section of my house better  thennnn     a month later it somehow made the wifi      worse  i was connected to the extension but the wifi wasn t working so i turned it off and just went back to using the regular  i e   i was lagging on the game like crazy as it was connected to the ethernet cord to the extender  so i switched it back  no longer using the extender  and didn t lag as bad as i did using the tp link  later  it came the mac and my phone  so  there ya have it  junk      
88,1.0,                       this product doesn t accomplish anything for me   i m trying to extend my wifi out to my garage  but the extender needs to be placed so close to my host wifi router  and has a weaker signal than my router  that it does nothing to extend the bubble of wifi coverage  i get equally good  which is very spotty  coverage from my main wifi router   what i really don t understand is why the extender can t be placed further from my main wifi router   i plug it in an outlet in my bedroom  from which i have   issues streaming hd netflix on my phone or computer  but it can t connect from that location  and gives me the red wifi signal   furthest i can get it from the router and show green is like    feet  while my phone and computer can go much further   if it could be placed further away  where other devices can still connect  and or broadcast a greater distance itself it could be of use  but it seems to do nothing also really did not like the conditions of information sharing on the app they try to get you to download   i would not recommend using that app and sharing all your information with them      
89,1.0,                       i have     mbps service and was seeing speeds of   to    from this extender  it is also unreliable in that it disconnects from wifi several times a day and even multiple times within a single hour  the problem was isolated to the extender as all my devices were seeing      mbps when connected directly through the router or plugged in to the modem  i contacted amazon and they said i could return the product but would charge a restocking fee  a restocking fee on a defective product   i guess they have a fee now if they have to throw something in the trash when they receive a defective product back from the customer      
90,4.0,                       the wifi extender was easy to install   i like the fact that it creates two  ext wifi networks  one at the higher speed  ghz and another the slower  ghz speed   my router puts out    mbps wifi  on the extender  i get   mbps with the  ghz  ext network and   mbps on the  ghz  ext network  all at areas of my house where my router s wifi can t reach   transition between the various wifi networks is seemless   however  when i return to a part of my house where i can utilize my router and    mbps speed  i have to manually switch from my  ext network to my router network   although i wish i could get faster speeds on the  ghz  ext network  i think that the   mbps speed is adequate      
91,5.0,                       i was getting charged      month from my isp for a range extender  i bought this and it solved my problem asap and waaaaay cheaper buy it  totally worth it  took me   minutes to set up and i m covered throughout my house and yard      
92,1.0,                       device links to network well   easy to set up  however doesn t work in the one area  i need it to   would have returned item  but past    day return window   this isn t a tech support issue  device just does not send signal far enough for my need  which is up one floor in the house   it should based on the description will have to purchase a wifi mesh router it appears to do the trick   unless you have a very small range to extend in  it sounds like the mesh routers are way to go   this was well rated  but i can t purchase another tp device having invested in this one already      
93,4.0,                       tried to setup using the wps method and could not get both the     ghz and   ghz to connect   after several attempts at wps   i reset the device and used the app to establish the connection between the extender and router modem which involved having to go back and forth between the cellphone and computer   not as easy but it accomplished what i needed to setup the extender   once setup and relocated   the extender is working as advertised  without any slow down in internet speed      
94,2.0,                       the strength of the signal in my home was increased and i was able to maintain   bars on my iphone    pro in the area of my home where i struggled to maintain a good signal  the issue i had was that my netgear nighthawk r     and the tp ac      tested independently  would not reach cellphones and small devices with full signal downstairs in my home i have been using the tp ac     exclusively while waiting for the extender to come in and was pulling down    mb with full signal  laptop  and cellphone   and      mb with   bars on mobile     mb on laptop  my plan provides up to    mbps from comcast i set up the extender as close to the upstairs route as i could while still servicing my deadzone  everthing was working on my phone and laptop perfectly   full signal  however  my phone was only pulling between      mb  even worse my laptop only pulled      mb as well  the best i could do was positioning my phone right against the device and i could get   mbps this speed drop is total junk if you re paying for a boosted internet speed  i ve just ordered the upgraded model of this device and will report back when i have that installed and tested tldr will create higher signal saturation  but might cost you a lot of speed  would not recommend if you want a speed higher than   mbps      
95,5.0,                       easy set up  took about    minutes    extends what you have  no it does not provide more internet  or faster internet  it is just extending the existing radio signal to areas that were blocked of obscured from the existing signal   yes  truthfully and scientifically it can not provide      of what it receives to the new extended area for perfect saturation  but since i had dead spots in the home prior to this  this has filled the gaps with a use able signal   it has a open network cable port on its underside so you can actually  also  plug a device into it   recommended and well worth the price   joe     
96,5.0,                       the wifi signal was great and the process was a breeze  i have two words of wisdom     when it is on the blinking green step wait for a while because it may appear solid but that doesn t mean it is     the security on this is low  wpa  but so long as you are using this for residential you should be fine  further  i purchased the older model and the newer one may have improved security  possibly wpa  or greater but i don t know about that or if it is as easy of a setup or as good of coverage extension as this one is      
97,1.0,                       unlike my other extender that i had  this one has proven useless  first  it took me several hours to get it set up  then it has continuously just quit working  everything will work fine for a couple of days  then it will quit  i have to unplug it and replug it back in to get it to work  i have tried uninstalling it and starting from scratch several times  to no avail   also  it will not reach far  i live in a metal building but my modem is only about    feet away from where i have the extender plugged in  the computer that i work on is another    ft away and the signal still is not strong   it will not even pick up my smartphone from    feet away    i know that it is not my modem because i have a brand new modem i thought that i would give it some time and now i think i have waited to long to return it  i am going to have to buy something else if i want it to extend any further  i am not happy with this product       
98,4.0,                       i bought this because my new work from home deal requires a hardwire set up  and they told me to try one of these if connecting directly to the router wasn t an option  i m amazed at how easy this was to set up  i plugged it in  downloaded the app  and within five minutes the signal was good to go and everything was running smoothly on my work set up  which is pretty extensive  i will have to update my review as time goes on  the only thing that makes me uncomfortable is how hot it can get  but i ve seen that s pretty standard for these types of devices      
99,3.0,                       the device does its job  but not well  i m using it to extend the range of my archer a   which is a gigabit router  however  this is not a gigabit device  so it will already slow down the max speed  once you factor in distance and the second hand wifi  i got at most half the speed of my primary router set was was easy  except it only worked as a repeater rather than a onemesh system  i didn t realize i had to upgrade my archer a  firmware first  once i upgraded  onemesh worked fine and combined all the networks into one i would not recommend using this to extend wifi into a primary device like a laptop  you re not going to get great speeds for video conferencing of streaming  however  this would be great for extending wifi to low bandwith devices like wireless printers  wifi speakers  smart thermostats  etc  this device is more for extending range over preserving speed for faster speed  i would either get a better router with better range  or a dedicated mesh system where the router and repeater are equal quality      
100,3.0,                       i read some reviews about problems with these extenders  longevity   i chose to overlook the reviews as ai thought they were negatively biased   i purchased three of these extenders and after about a month i began getting a red light on the wifi signal   i tried resetting to default settings  resetting with the manual button and powering on and off   however  i still get the same issue and sometimes the extenders will not find the host network   they will only show the power light and nothing else after i power them back on   this is highly disappointing considering everything worked so well in the beginning and i did not move my main router or the extender locations to cause this problem   they devices just decided they no longer wanted to work well   i will be returning one of these extenders but unfortunately the other two are past the return window   buy at your own risk      
101,1.0,                       followed the directions  plugged it in  set it up  doesn t work  not even a little bit the wifi connection is better and smoother without it the app the ask you to download to connect it is very shotty  app didn t work on the first   downloads  the third time it finally came through  please for the love of god purchase any other device  i beg you not to make the same mistake i did      
102,5.0,                       we moved into a brand new home and had a dead spot  the router modem is located in the main living space and since working from home my office is on the other end of the house  i set it up initially by the modem router then moved it to a halfway point in the hall  this works perfectly  the set up was very easy and fast  after registration i was able to use all devices effortlessly  before this extender the scan feature on my printer wouldn t work but now it works great  i kept losing network connection but now it remains solid throughout the day  great product for a great price and highly recommended      
103,1.0,                       after connecting this my  g channel went from a dissappointing    mbps to a being literally to slow to test  the one successful test was     mbps  so i turned on the  high speed  feature  which kills your  g entirely and routes all the power through the     channel  the speed increased to a best test        so still below what the  g channel averaged before i added the this extender  i called tp link   the   is no longer in operation               so i did the  live chat   no one ever came on the other end  so i just returned the product  i figure the terrible service was a favor in that it kept me from having to spend an hour  troubleshooting  a worthless product this experience has been so bad i will probably get rid of my tp link router that i recenently purchased and replace it with a reliable mesh system from another manufacturer      
104,5.0,                       this is my  th attempt at finding an extender to put in the garage to service just one device  a wifi enabled doorbell camera installed in a stone pedestal at the end of the driveway  not only was this extender simple to set up  it actually keeps a solid connection with the doorbell day after day  another bonus is that it was easy to turn off the  ghz network during setup  the other extenders i tried automatically set up both the    ghz and  ghz networks  which is fine  but made it either challenging or impossible to turn off the unneeded network i had dismissed this extender early on because of how inexpensive it was  i thought if i paid more  i would get a higher quality or better performing extender  i was wrong      
105,5.0,                       i have an ethernet drop in the part of the house that has the wifi deadspot issue  this product solved the problem perfectly  i hooked it to the ethernet once everything was setup and now have a new     and   ghz access points i use this so my older chromcast works much better watching movies from a laptop on wifi directions could be a bit clearer  make sure to setup you link the laptop or your mobile phone app to the tp link s access point as a way to connect to the device to configure it  then you configure using linkrepeater net      
106,5.0,                       the limitations regarding arlo video doorbell not being  g incompatible lead to me purchasing the tp link ac    wifi extender  my townhouse was built in        structural factors of going through glass and brick with my rear doorbell were definitely a problem   i connected the front doorbell without making any changes to my wi fi or iphone    iphone connected to    g  g  meshed  wi fi   after initially connecting rear doorbell with  g  meshed  wi fi  it worked fine for two or three days   after it became  disconnected   i was able to remove re add four or five times   then  after going through the  add new device  many times  the arlo app on my iphone never  found  my rear doorbell   after going through all the documentation  i decided i had to really make every effort to ensure the rear doorbell was definitely using    g wi fi   not  g   for me  this meant    un meshing my wi fi into separate    g and  g bands on my comcast xfinity router    installing the tp link ac    wifi extender downstairs within    feet of the rear doorbell    linking the tp link ac    wifi extender to both    g and  g wi fi    reconnecting all my other devices to the new un meshed    g and  g wi fi bands   alexa  printer  laptop  etc        connecting my iphone to the    g ext  extended  wi fi band     going through the arlo app  add new device  on my iphone  which after    or    times is still super annoying  it s probably    screens of buttons and swiping to get to the point where it generates the qr box for the arlo doorbell camera to scan my rear doorbell is now operational  and working as expected      
107,2.0,                       even having this plugged in directly next to the wifi source and adjusting the settings to dedicate to  g  we were only able to get about     mbps for this extender on a     mbps connection in real life use with some distance in order to get wifi to remote locations of the home this was reduced to around      mbps max  for contrast  when the signal is solid from the main router i can usually get         mbps on the same laptop this is useful for work situations where you want to make sure the signal is reliable and the highest speeds arent needed  but still disappointing that it is such a reduced speed      
108,5.0,                       we are switching to streaming tv from satellite and also remodeled a room to make it our main tv space  it is far enough from the router which is an upgraded model but still could not get enough signal on a consistent basis so we had a buffering problem off and on   this was a cost effective solution  easy to set up  although it took   tries to get it to connect  that was not unexpected  once up and running tv viewing was perfect      
109,1.0,                       the extender attached to my netgear     p nighthawk router  but cannot connect through that host to the internet  customer support simply had me repeat setup steps i had already successfully completed  and could not understand that the extender attached to the router fine  but provided no internet connection  after researching online this is a common problem  returning and never purchasing tp link products again      
110,1.0,                       i had everything below written and set up as average   star but noticed a review about their privacy policy   if you read just the first couple paragraphs of their policy  they mention that they ll pull as much data as they want and use it as they want    including sending to  rd parties and once sent  they have no control over what is done with the data such as name  address  payment information  personal information such as birth date     etc    and other info used while using this product   yeah     im returning this thing asap  i advise everyone to do the same                           set this up on            i ve got a verizon fios gen  router as the host router connected wireless to the re    model really annoying to set up at first    wasn t working no matter what which way i tried i even tried connecting with ethernet cable from router to extender but that didnt work either i unplugged and plugged the re    while following the instructions within the applet to set up device extender  and randomly it started working    o obut after it connected  it works  i ve got it extended past rooms  doors  and stairs  got it to use wifi in my garage  i m using the  high speed mode  where it cancels either the     ghz or   ghz and amplifies the non cancelled ghz so far   i ve tested the internet speed from speedtest net with different options and these are the results i got control     dl    up straight connection to router from phone rooms away about   ish feet  control    ghz     dl mbps      up mbpscontrol  ghz      dl mbps      up mbpsextended wifi standardextended standard    ghz     dl mbps      up mbpsextended stadard  ghz     dl mbps      up mbpsextended wifi high speedextended boost disabled    ghz to boost  ghz     dl mbps      up mbpsextended boost disabled  ghz to boost    ghz     dl mbps      up mbpssome weird data and some regular data   idk   enjoy the info      
111,1.0,                       the extender is ok  but i have a problem where i m loosing an order of magnitude of speed if i take it more than   feet from the router  you know  in order to extend the network  there may be a solution to this  but tech support definitely won t help me find it  my first experience with tech support was that they are slow  but it was all fine until the person essentially hung up on me before the issue was solved  i was so annoyed it was several weeks before i tried again  this time  i got someone who kept not reading my responses  giving me unclear instructions  and then told me that there s no way to look up my previous session without a ticket number  i asked for a supervisor and he just got rude after that  done with this company forever edit  heard from new person at tech support who was actually helpful  but  turns out that the max download speed when connected to this extender is only    mbps    the    mbps is completely misleading      
112,1.0,                       the product does a reasonably good job of doing what it is supposed to do  once i found the chat button in tech support i was helped by a very knowledgeable individual  the printed installation instructions were terrible  method three did not work for me at all  nor did method two  method one left out a very important step  you have to be connected to the internet to create a tether  not the extender s network tp link extender  those instructions never mentioned anything about being connected to the internet first and then proceed  the frustration of trying to setup the machine with totally inadequate instructions is poor  the company should do better than this      
113,5.0,                       this extender just proves once again why tp link is the best company out there for wi fi products   if you aren t familiar with the set up of an extender  etc  then read the quick installation guide first before you do yours   i would suggest to d l the  tether  app via the playstore or app store  before you start the set up process for your device   make sure to place the device within a foot or so of your router  then when you re done you can move it where you would like to place it on a more permanent basis   if you use the tether app  this is all laid out for you in a step by step fashion   it literally  holds your hand  and walks you through it   there are three modes  or ways to set it up   i always find that if i can set it up using an app  then the easier it is with not as many problems   as far as any problems or issues with this device   well  not so much   actually i had no problems at all with the set up of it if  you re thinking about getting this  i would suggest it   coverage with the     is outstanding   it also has some tools that will make the process of using it even better and or easier good luck with whatever device you plan on using  if you purchase the     then you have plenty of easy fun times ahead      good luck ron g  p s  i apologize for my pic   no matter what i do when i transfer the pic to this page  it will never straighten up   in my gallery the pic is correct  so i m unsure of what s going on      
114,5.0,                       we have xfinity and our house is mostly an open floor plan except for a couple bedrooms in the rear   our kids were getting some serious  lag time  during their video games so we though an extender would do the job  unfortunately xfinity only sells them in bundles of   for           so we tried this one from tp link and it works great   saved a bundle too       
115,4.0,                       i live in a medium size apartment with my wifi in the living room and office work in other room   with the current day situations most of the day on  zoom calls my zoom call most of time gets disconnect   reconnect interrupting the calls  i saw this product and seems helpful that it extends the wifi to my other rooms but i see little improvement but not that great as i was expecting  atleast i am able to use this as wifi extender and using it with wired   it helps and working for my needs but i feel the performance can be better      
116,5.0,                       wanted to connect to wi fi from garage workshop to the router in house  linksys i think  so  plugged this in an outlet upstairs closest to the garage  and voila  i get wi fi out to the workshop    it was very easy to set up  from the main computer station next to router  although i do speak passable geekish  so  might be challenging for less technically inclined   but once it was set up  unplugged it and moved it to the outlet where it was meant to sit  and got usable wi fi to the workshop      bars usually  depending on what weather is like outside and whether shop door is open or closed but it can vary    worst case  it does have latency  so big files and youtube videos  images  etc can take a while to load  if they load at all  but  crappy wi fi is better than no wi fi at all  so  for the price and ease of setup  i am a happy camper      
117,1.0,                       the wifi extender worked okay for a couple of months   then it stopped working   i called amazon and they said i needed to call the company   i did and after many attempts with the tech person  it was determined that the item should be replaced   i was to send photos and proof of purchase and they would replace the item   i did all that was requested   that was in early november   i never heard from the company again   i do not want the extender replaced at this time   i have since changed my internet service and have a strong wifi signal   i would appreciate a refund for this purchase      
118,5.0,                       took me    seconds to unbox took me    seconds to read instructions took me     seconds to setup took me    seconds to plug into and get working in our intended location if you don t have this kind of time  you should skip this product   however  if you want     and     wifi to stretch to a dead zone and you have   minutes   then this product is what you need   working great in our previous dead zone patio and backyard      
119,5.0,                       i have an unattached garage  and it was always in that iffy spot for wifi from the house   i plugged this little thing i say that because it looks like a nightlight  into the outlet closest to the house and now my garage and even the backside of it has wifi it was very simple to install using my phone  and i have had   issues with it in   weeks      
120,5.0,                       i purchased this to help boost the wifi signal reaching my outdoor security cameras  it s too early to tell if that part of the mission has been fulfilled  but the initial setup was a breeze  i used both the printed quick start guide as well as the mobile app walkthrough to get the device up and running  then relocated to the  dead zone   really just the front of my house  with little to no trouble  i am still using the rented modem router combo from my cable provider  but that didn t seem to be a problem at all  as others have noted  a separate  ext  version of your wifi network needs to be created  but i actually don t mind that  since only my cameras will be using the extender network and i actually like having them on their own  it s early  but as long as the signal provided to the cameras is improved  i would say this is a great purchase      
121,5.0,                       i bought this extender due to the reviews i read on amazon   it s a slightly older model but it was inexpensive and i had hopes that it would help with the streaming problems on my smart tv   our internet is supplied by satellite so it s rather expensive and we try to work with a lower data limit   most months we run out of data within   weeks and have to settle for a much slower signal than we want but have settled for due to cost   we ve always had a problem with streaming from netflix  prime  and other apps   even when our signal is    mbps or more  we spend more time watching the little circle as it buffers over and over again than watching the video   it often becomes so annoying we switch back to standard tv  my thought was that with an extender  i could hardwire to the tv utilizing the network set up by the extender   there were some difficulties setting it up as i was trying to use my desktop as the main control   there is no pc app for the tether i needed and i was trying to workaround to get it for my pc by using an emulator   it didn t work   nor did my android phone work   after a frustrating couple of days  including time on the phone with tp link s support whom i can t fault though they didn t solve the issue  i finally remembered my android tablet  downloaded the appropriate tether  and had everything up and running in minutes with no further problems hardwiring the extender to the tv works perfectly   i now almost never have to wait out multiple buffering and it doesn t seem to matter what the download speed is from the satellite i would recommend this extender from tp link as a possible solution to your buffering problems      
122,3.0,                       lasted less than one month   one morning i woke up and it was off   unplugged it and it was very hot   plugged it in again and started to come up and shut down   let it cool down for   hours and it started working again for a while   decided to return it   already got and installed a replacement from amazon   when it worked  it worked very well   hoping that i just got a bad one and the new one will last years      
123,5.0,                       okay  guys  if you are having wifi connection issues    get this  our apartment is literally only about     sq ft which isn t big enough for us to be having wifi issues imo   yet for some freaking reason the wifi signal in our bedroom is terrible cuz it can t penetrate the wall i don t think  so we got this  and it is a life saver  our connection went from poor to excellent with this simple fix   highly recommend  it s cheap and         satisfied with the results      
124,2.0,                       i may of had a lemon  i followed the directions and set it up  everything went as it should of  the light was on steady and the device showed on my tablet but i could not connect  i tried several times before contacting amazon tech support  that unfortunately was useless and the person i was chatting with disappeared        i don t have time to waste and gave up when i  contacted the seller i was treated very well and was able to return ths link even past the return window      
125,1.0,                       not recommended   st  definitely not an easy set up  there s   set up options   rd is easiest  can t get the tp link added to available wifi network list needed for  st    nd opt   wifi here is unstable  that s why i got this  router is on  st fl  wanted it in my bedroom   nd fl  was too far from router  so  it s downstairs using  rd opt  has not made a difference here in my room  all this took   hrs  that s not an easy set up  is it  i m very frustrated  as you can tell      
126,2.0,                       i plugged this range extender into a   gang receptacle and due to the width  of it i could not utilize the open plugs for appliances that had been previously in use  the width of it prevented interfered with the open receptacle on the side and the data port  which i needed to use  is directly underneath of it  which means the lower plug is now useless  moving the extender down doesn t help either  the shape if this item is meant to look sleek and high tech  but its not logical or user friendly   seriously  how did this thing get past its engineering   design phase and into production      
127,4.0,                       this product is phenomenal   the price is great  i had several wifi dead spots   limitations on the range of service in my place   this extender is perfect  my wifi is super fast   available in every part of my home now  the only negative thing about the purchase of this product is on the paper instructions  there s   different set up options and the first choice to download the app  is the best one  but it wasn t specific enough if you re not knowledgeable on your tech lingo  basically  when the app asks for your     ghz host network then the next step asks about your  ghz host network  the instructions should clarify where you can find that info  otherwise  they should make it understood that it may be the same network   at this point you can  skip  trying to locate the  ghz info  and hit  next   i spent a lot of unnecessary time trying to manually enter info  from my internet provided modem  my personal router   the wifi extender s info   but even though i was frustrated by the time i figured out they were the same login i use for my internet provider  i can admit it was at least worth it      
128,5.0,                       i have no idea how this gadget works and my tech support is my grandson   i was having a heck of a time getting streaming for my television or my tablet in my sitting room   the grandsons  plural  told me i needed one of these gadgets   so  we all went shopping on amazon and they agreed that this gadget would be my best bet   i ordered  it arrived  i opened the box  handed the gadget to my grandson and left it in his competent hands   he did whatever was suppose to be done and i now have streaming for the television and my tablet   it is magic great value for the money and my personal tech team are worth their weight in gold      
129,3.0,                       the device was reasonably easy to set up with the iphone app the broadcast signal strength is a bit week  the real weakness seams to be that while the device can do both    ghz and  ghz  it uses one band to receive and the other to send  this means that either way  you are limited to     ghz speeds      
130,5.0,                       we ordered the wifi extender because the signal to our front door s ring doorbell was too weak for it to operate with our router located upstairs in the back of the house setup was rather straightforward  following the instructions  i first up the extender when in close proximity to the router  both    ghz and  ghz bands   then moved the extender downstairs to the front of the house  where the ring doorbell and other devices now have high connectivity i was initially wary the the extender had different network names than the original router  the original name followed by   ext    but once i set up my devices to also allow usage of those networks  it has not been a problem at all      
131,4.0,                       first surprise was that this device will broadcast as a new ssid  unlike my prior unit   not a deal killer  and maybe a plus if you need to troubleshoot  but  the signal is not strong enough  the measured signal of my existing wifi was    ish  not enough for my needs  so i installed this maybe    feet from my ap  and i was disappointed to see that the new ssid was actually weaker than the signal from my ap  after relocating the unit  it did the job  it s compact and fairly easy to setup  perhaps the tiny size and lack of antenna is the reason for the weak signal      
132,3.0,                       i read a lot of reviews about repeaters extenders and chose this device over a netgear model  set up was very easy via the app and also even easier if you have a router with a push button wps i tried setting the router up with this repeater both ways  it recognized both bands from my router i was trying to extend my wifi signal into an upstairs garage apartment about    feet from the room the router sits in  the signal dropped to nothing almost when i got outside the garage  in the upstairs apartment i could get a weak signal  speed test said it was    mbs upload and    mbs download  in my house in all rooms i can get       mbs download and around       mbs upload my chrome book could actually get close to the same upload download speed connecting to the weak signal from my router as i could get connecting wirelessly to this extender right next to it now to be fair this was only     and also my home was built in      with plasters and lathe walls and is all brick so that is a lot of material to get a wireless signal through  i will end up probably putting this extender out in the back screened in porch to give a stronger signal for wifi when out there and order a more expensive model and try it instead  you get what you pay for      
133,2.0,                       it worked fine for a few days  and then i noticed it was dropping the connection  i had my ring doorbell connected to it and i went to look at the live video feed and it said it wasn t connect  then i checked on the tplink app and it said there where no devices   well that s odd   so i unplugged and plugged back in and everything was fine  then a couple days later it happened again  and after the third time of this happening i decided i can t have this happening with the ring doorbell  something you never want to be disconnected  so i ended up returning it  when it did work it was fine  good signal  easy to setup  i m not sure if the one i got was defective or not but i thought it would be worth letting the public at large know about my experience      
134,2.0,                       i purchased a couple different extenders and these just don t really get the job done  i have ring doorbell that  couldn t get a good wifi signal even tough it  was    feet from the comcast router  i had this extender setup and plugged in just    feet from the router with no walls in between either  my ring doorbell was on the other side of the wall from where the extender was plugged  the signal was poor to ok   half of the time i could not view the picture from the ring because of a poor signal  i bought a tp link deco m mesh system and the ring gets an excellent signal as well as every where else in the house      
135,5.0,                       lately i have been having wifi connection problems  so i decided to look into buying a wifi extender  i wasn t sure at all about which one to buy and which was worth the money  i also did not want to spend an excessive amount of money  i search online and found an article listing the best extenders to buy in       i decided to buy the tp link ac     the process was very fast and very easy to follow  it took me about   minutes to set everything up  before buying the extender the wifi in the far end of my home was very poor and sometimes no signal  with this extender i am able to stream on my tv without any problems  the wifi signal literally went from poor signal to excellent signal  i highly recommend this item      
136,1.0,                       a few salient features which you should consider to buy this great piece      signal strength  even placed at   feet apart  you get very poor signal in phone  laptop    reduces bandwidth  i bought this extender to boost up the signal of base router  however  this pice is absolutely useless  this eats up the bandwidth  when i do speedtest with this router i get     mbps  when i switch it off and use the base router at same location  which is even far  i get    mbps   freezes up frequently  you have to plug  unplug to get this back to work love it   avoid it  dont buy       
137,1.0,                       i am using this product for a month i brought this as i wanted a dual brand support  this item works fine when it works but suddenly internet connection drops and shows limited access in wifi signal in laptop  there is no issue with laptop as it works fine when connected to different router or booster  if you want a reliable connection this is not for you  i just connected   device with this and   device in total in my home network  i do have high speed fios connection update  stopped working after   months not recommended     
138,4.0,                       it does basically double the range of my wifi signal  but i noticed a lag while gaming  turns out it basically cuts your bandwidth in half by the way it s designed  i get    mbs from my router and      mbs from this extender  it s fine for everything except large multiplayer online games  but i wish i would have done a little more research and bought a more robust model for a little more money      
139,1.0,                       i read a review that said the privacy policy is not good at all  and being in desperate need of a wifi extender i still purchased  biggest mistake of my life  i had it plugged in for a total of   days and now have   credit cards that have the addresses changed and new cards being sent to a new address  this is ridiculous       these should not be sold  they pretty much have access to everything  i am now out the money  and have called credit card companies pretty much everyday to close them  because of someone hacking in and pretending to be me and changing the addresses on my accounts and requesting new cards  do not buy           
140,5.0,                       for years we have had issues with the smart tv in our bedroom  back of the house  not having good network connection because our router was in the front of the house  add in covid    working from home   it has been very patchy  but  this thing has been amazing  currently i am working from home  well  taking a break to write this review  and streaming netflix in the back of the house  while my husband plays xbox and probably checks his phone a million times in the front of the house  awesome connection  no delays or buffering at all  my only issue was some slight trouble setting up  because the app didn t work and i had to try and do it through the site  one issue was completely my mistake but it wasn t quite as smooth of an install as the instructions made it seem even discounting that  overall  i would  and have  recommended this as a very affordable option to help boost home wifi signals      
141,5.0,                       product is accurately described pictured as in listing and was delivered within   days   small modern design which is always a plus  instructions are straight forward and was easily installed   set up in about   mins   tvs and devices were always lagging and buffering on the opposite side of home router  but not anymore   the proof is in the pudding  see photos   highly recommend at such an awesome price      
142,1.0,                       installed the extender in a room that s    feet down the hallway from my room  since that room has a window which is adjacent to another window where my router and modem are set up  i mainly got this extender so i can use  ghz in my room because the original signal is horrible in my room  the extended network has full signal when i connect in my room but doesn t even work if my door is closed  from    feet away  open the door then bam  my down up speeds start blowing up  this extender doesn t work because of one little door but if i m in my bathroom  signal has to go through   walls  with the doors closed  i get a decent connection  my original  ghz network works better than the  ghz provided by the extender in my room  ruined the whole point of getting this      
143,1.0,                       i bought this because other reviewers were ranting about it  some reviewers said setup in minutes  baloney  first you have to download an app and setup an account  then you plug it into an outlet and wait for the green light  then you go through the setup process  and when you are finished  you relaunch the ap on your phone  great   power on  wifi signal great  however  connected no internet   there is no way to enter your router password into the connection  two hours later  hurting and frustrated  i put the piece of junk back in the box and filed a return to amazon      
144,5.0,                       we live in an old house  and the wifi doesn t like to travel all the way into our bedroom  with our router  the signal cuts out when laying in bed  we had been using an older model extender that only used     ghz  and there would be interference at times  with this model  our devices connect to the     ghz band  and we get the same speed as if we were on our router  no more dead zones in our bedroom  and it even extends coverage into our back yard was super easy to set up using the web browser and connected to a different brand router no problems      
145,1.0,                       this is actually my first ever online review of a product  this thing was so bad that i had to leave one for any future unwary travelers  in short  i couldn t even get connected to it from my computer via ethernet  the extender never would connect to my brand new tp link router  which works like a dream   and the app would never install on my phone  nothing about this product was worth the hour i spent trying to even get connected to it  i received it today  and i am returning it today  i ll buy something else      
146,2.0,                       this extender kept dropping the signal  it showed that it extended the signal from my router but would constantly drop it  i had this setup to extend the signal to use with my roku in a back room  it is a super easy setup    stars there  got the new extended network all configured into my roku tv  turned it on and started watching  awesome     minutes later i get the spinning thing on the screen  it comes back but then about    minutes later it does it again  i tried it on both the     and the     channels  unplugged it and went back to the original weaker signal from my router  it never dropped with the weaker signal i plugged the extended back in the next day and tried again  again it dropped the signal  tried this for a week and gave and and returned it   it just doesn t seem reliable enough for me or i got a defective one      
147,5.0,                       really easy to set up from start to finish  i got it for working from home as my office is far away from the router and my vpn kept disconnecting  this solved the issue and kept me with a reliable and full signal  it also helped the picture and signal for one of my security cameras that is near my office  the only downside is that it s basically it s own wi fi network and you have to connect to it separately from your main router  i was hoping it would just  extend  the signal  which it does  but you will have to connect to it with any device you want to use and any time that you move to the area where it s needed  overall it does exactly what i need it to do and looks nice on the wall      
148,3.0,                       i bought   of these  easy to install  but both the units have weak connections to the timewarner router  sometimes the connection led is green and some times red   the time warner signal strength on my cell phone     bars    is maximum  while the extender has a red signal light  i would expect the extender to pick up a signal slightly less than maximum and extend it   there is less value if it has to be next to the router   often i am about    feet away from one of the extenders and my phone or laptop show good signal strength  but there is no internet   sometimes it work ok  maybe     of the time ok  i also tried another manufacturer that was much more expensive  with a similar result   my real problem has not been solved   i just kept the cheaper one      
149,1.0,                       bottom line  pure junk that will work long enough for you to be out of warranty  then die not a tech neophyte  or one of those guys that complains the box was too hard to open   this looked like a good solution to get some extra signal in one dead corner of my house  and it worked great for a few months   i noticed it wasn t working  and the red  connected to wifi router  light was on   i moved it a little closer  still red   i put it in the same room  the wifi connect goes green and it works  but of course  pretty useless to extend the range of my network when it has to be in the same room  full reset  clear to factory defaults  reconfigure   it just won t connect when more than    ft from the router   my theory is the rf amp is degraded or blown  most probably due to poor thermal design  it gets pretty hot    the most annoying junk  that works for while  then pops after you can return it     
150,4.0,                       i have an optimum arris cable modem router and was apprehensive that this tp link extender would not be compatible   since it was only      i took the plunge   the set up was a bit more tricky than the instructions lead me to believe   i downloaded tp link s tether app but that app did not find my arris modem router   rather  i needed to use their website to find my router to complete the installation process   once the extender is activated  you need to select the extender network   router name  ext  and provide your current router s password to join   i plugged in the extender about halfway between the router and our semi dead spot upstairs   my son tells me the wifi signal is now better in the study   it s a good fix for          
151,4.0,                       the tp link   why all lowercase  are they trying to be cool like k d  lang  whatever       wi fi range extender  re     was a breeze to set up  the directions were clear and simple  i had it working   installed right out of the box in under    minutes  ok  maybe         the longest time was determining a suitable place to locate it  so  then  yeah  under    minutes installation tip  when you are first setting up the re    and it  recommends  a network name  ssid  for itself   this will typically be whatever is the name of the network  ssid  you have already running in your house but with an   ext  on the end  don t use that  i mean  you can but if you truly want to seamlessly extend your network  then name it exactly the same as your home network name and use the same password  as well  this way you will always be on the  same  network as you move about the house      
152,5.0,                       this came recommended from a friend in the tech industry and am very happy with the purchase  solved my problem of very limited wi fi to my garage  which is roughly     away through   walls from router  extremely easy to setup with step by step instructions  had to do a little bit of trial   error to find the best outlet halfway between  getting       mbps to my garage device now  as opposed to    before      
153,4.0,                       i followed the directions in the box for downloading an app to my phone in order to configure the extender  it was not at all clear what the app was telling me to do  at the end  it told me repeatedly to log into the network  it meant the  ext version of the network  but it took me several iterations to figure that out  then  once i was able to verify that the  ext network was working properly  it still brought me back to that same screen instructing me to log into the network   i finally simply dismissed the app   and wouldn t you know  the device was properly configured and i was good to go the point is  the device is pretty easy to configure  but the instructions leave a lot to be desired      
154,4.0,                       i live in a two story house  three if you count our basement   we got fiber recently and had to have the router move from the main floor to the basement  we pay for    mbps upload download and i was only getting about    mbps upload download on the second floor due to the distance  i work from home and my office is on the second floor  and those speeds just weren t going to cut it picked this up  took it out of the box and installed it in no more than    minutes  the app was easy to walk through  placed it on the main floor in the center of the house  using speedtest net  my laptop went from   mbps without the extender to   mbps with   a great improvement  will be noticeable at work on monday and definitely worth the          
155,1.0,                       not sure if it was this particular brand or maybe i just don t know what i m doing  but extender did not work  not sure if it s connected properly  tried the   options to connect and it s not still working  but i think i got it connected  to be honest i can t even tell if it s working  the wifi signal in the target room does seem better but it still drops the signal at times  but i m sending it back and trying a different brand      
156,5.0,                       i m a good household mechanic but wi fi setups go right over my head  so  i hired my computer consultant to figure out what i did wrong  he was here for    minutes and he was able to rework my clumsy set up and when he was finished he said   i m impressed  i must admit  usually these extender set ups are like a bunch of monkeys driving a clown car  this  tether  app is the best yet  i m really impressed   so for the rest of the  minimum  hour fee  we just chatted and laughed talking about comedians  eleven years of working for my home business and this was the first time he ever bowed towards the supplied software      
157,4.0,                       i had a little problem setting this up and they gice you a chat window and so i decided to use tach support   they tried to tell me i needed to buy some software from them because my ip address was being hacked and that is why the extender was having a problem   the first option cost      so i said no to them and told tme i was going to return the product   but before doing that i tried again and successfully set it up   don t use their tech support   it is working fine without spending the additional money      
158,5.0,                       i m enjoying the performance of this extender  it was super easy to install  cute design  looks like a scented plug in  one feature i didn t know i wanted was being able to see what devices are connected  the app includes the ip address and sometimes gives things a funky name  but it s very simple to update the name      
159,1.0,                       okay  i m old  late    s    is it so hard to make this plug and play   you have to download apps that mess up your phone and it won t work unless you download something to your phone  even if you just want to use it to your tablet   if it won t work unless i hook it up to my phone  how can it ever work  since i m one of many who only use their phone to call triple a   i ve wasted more money than this  but not often   and that s how i d describe it  a complete waste of money      
160,5.0,                       i have a     sqft single story house and even though my wifi modem is directly in the center of my house  the signal was only strong in the living room  it was awful or non existent anywhere else my internet provider wanted to sell me a     a month  whole home wifi  like i m only paying for a one room wifi right now  eyeroll thankfully this extender did the trick  it s plugged in right next to my modem  but it covers my whole house without issue no more streaming tv dropping  no more virtual class dropping etc  it s flawless sanity saved      
161,1.0,                       set up and install was easy enough but when using the extender on my devices the wifi was actually slower or they didn t connect at all   when i selected my regular wifi network without the use of the extender  my devices connected immediately so the issue isn t with my router or internet provider   i followed all instructions procided and downloaded the required app but connection and speed just isn t improved   i m in a small one bedroom apartment so i m well within the range this item claims to cover      
162,2.0,                       the first   weeks after installation  the extender worked fine  but then it started becoming faulty   the signal would drop so i could not connect in the area where i had extended the wifi signal   after resetting a few times few days  i could not take it any longer   calling the customer service was a headache since they had limited hours and the wait was too long when called   i ended up returning it   i m getting the newer version  re     and see if that works better      
163,5.0,                       ok   i hardly ever leave reviews  but this took me me    minutes to install and improved the wifi connection in the office from   bars to full bars   since having to work from home  my office is stuck in the corner of the house and suffers from abysmal wifi  i put off ordering an extender  since they were for the most part much more expensive and what if it was a waste of maoney   i saw this one at a reasonable price and gave it a whirl   it works great and is unobtrusive in the hallway and was easy as installing app  plugging extender in next to router  letting it sync and then moving it to its final placement in hallway and letting that sync   all i had to do next was login from my laptop and bang  a decent signal      
164,3.0,                       not that impressed  the wifi signal is okay  my speed drops every so often causing me to reset  it can not penetrate through thicker basement walls  i had this thing plugged in my lower quarter just on the other side of my brick wall and the signal was not able to get through  i was getting     mbps  it was worse than just connecting to my router which i got at least    mbps in that area  not a very good extender at all     
165,3.0,                        update    after searching for a range extender that didn t act as a proxy and use virtual mac addresses  it seems everyone i looked at did this  i guess that s the nature of the beast  i realize mac addresses can be spoofed  but along with the firewall  anti virus  and anti malware it s just adds a bit more protection i up the star rating from   to   as the device did what it said it would do  just doesn t seem good for me i wanted to get a range extender to help with some weak signal areas in the house  i had great success with my older wireless n tp link router so i figured i d go with a tp link re    extender to keep things simple before starting the extender setup  i turned off my router s mac address filtering  i still had a bit of a challenge setting up the range extender  not sure why it didn t work connect  but i had to do a reset and the setup a second time  this time it connected to my network just fine  so i moved the extender to where i planned to use it  everything in the area had a great signal and all was well i went into my router s client list and saw that the mac address shown for the extender was different from what the extender s label showed  the label mac address began with        but the router showed        both addresses ending in        i tried both in the mac filtering  but each time i enabled the mac filtering the extender would be disconnected connected the extender via ethernet cable directly to my pc and tried the tp link extender web link  it showed mac addresses starting with        but one ending in       for the     ghz and       for the   ghz networks  i tried the mac with the      my network is     ghz  but no luck this seemed to be a simple address translation issue  so i updated the extender s firmware to the latest version  now i saw a totally different mac address starting with             tried those   no success  i then spoke with tp link and their tech said that they used a  virtual mac address  in most of their extenders and they did not recommend using it with mac address filtering enabled  i asked why  but really didn t get a satisfactory answer  it seems so simple  but i can t get an answer on which mac address to enter in my router s configuration to allow the extender to pass through maybe i m missing something here  but i use the mac filtering as another layer of router security  i shouldn t have to disable some security to use an extender  so i m returning it and will buy something else  however  it won t be a tp link product due to this issue  the instructions make no mention of this  but this is information that would be nice to know before purchasing      
166,2.0,                       i bought this to replace a failing re      i wanted to stay with a onemesh product so i went with this model incredibly easy to setup with the tp link tether app   recognized right away and paired with my archer a  with no issues  after setting it up  i connected an ethernet cable to it and then to a switch and then to my laptop and desktop   i was extremely happy with the increase in speed   my ip is     down    up   before hardwiring  i was roughly       down and      up   with hardwire  i was at       down  and    up  a huge improvement   the problem is i started randomly losing connection  an issue i did not have before i disconnected the hardwire but kept the wifi on with the extender  just to rule out it was a bad cable or switch   still had the random disconnection   unplugged the extender and my speed went down to the previous speed  but  i don t get the drop anymore i m going to try a replacement and hopefully it works because the speed difference is huge   hoping it was just a defective one      
167,5.0,                       i have a background in it and was curious how this  extender  works  in short  it creates a new network  you place it in range of your existing wifi and it creates a new network that extends out further  you have the option of having it go faster by just using one band     ghz or  ghz   so that it can dedicate the other band to the back to the other wifi router  backhauling  in my case i have a deck outside that i like to hang out on but the wifi from the house didn t do a good job of getting all the way out there  i plugged this in on the interior of an exterior wall in a regular outlet that got   or       bar signal strength  i created a new network  via the app which is easy to install and pairs with the device  called  backyard  on    ghz and opted for  ghz to be the backhaul even better  i have a home office vpn meraki that will only work if plugged into a physical ethernet port  conveniently enough there s one ethernet port on the bottom of this device  theoretically you could perhaps plug a small switch in there to have a few devices although i d guess there s a limit to that all in  these are terrific  without this i would have constructed some external antenna system that would have costed me multiples of this device  as it stands i don t even think i ll need a second one and it s a tremendous value for what you re getting      
168,1.0,                       this creates a new wifi network and does not extend your existing network  so if you are at a different part of your house with a weak signal you have to change to the other network manually  also  the signal strength is very weak with this new network      
169,5.0,                       the tp link ac    wifi extender is simple to install   sets up in minutes  the extender connected with my router effortlessly  if the signal is weak  the unit lights up red  if it s a good connection  it lights up blue  very simple  coverage is great  i can now receive my wifi signal on the second floor of my home  previously a very weak signal   my router is located in the basement and this unit had no trouble connecting  i set it up on the first floor  near the stairs to the second floor  you can try different locations to find the best one for your needs  i m pleased with this purchase      
170,5.0,                       very easy to install  with multiple choices of method        using the tether app on your mobile phone      with a web browser on your computer  or     with the wps button on the device   best installation instructions i ve seen bundled with a new wi fi device  and a couple of faqs for additional installation issues performance seems to be very good    solved my weak signal problem in one corner of the house   a bargain for the money      
171,1.0,                       i have tried many extenders  and this one was by far the worst one i have used  the signal did not get extended very far  and the speed was about   mbps whereas if i disconnected from the extender and connected to my base signal  which was very weak  in the exact same spot  i got about    mbps  not great  but miles better than the extender which was supposed to be boosting  not downgrading my speed and strength  if you need to boost your signal to parts of your house  i would recommend just investing in a mesh wifi system  they are very reliable and you can take them with you if you move into a bigger space      
172,5.0,                       this is a great product so far  we bought   the older version and the newer version it has made a big difference with covering our dead zones update  while this product seemed to work well in the beginning it has fizzled out  when connected to the extender the devices will state that there is a weak connection or no connection at all  even when we upgraded out box with the cable company the extender still doesn t work  it also cuts in and out at various times  will look for a different product   very disappointed      
173,4.0,                       bought one during a deal   for the price  you can t beat it   but  it is not as fast as others are the market   my     mbps connection  i could only get    mbps from this on the   ghz in    mhz signal  operating it as an access point   an old netgear ap i had would get me     mbps using the same settings   the reason i bought another one is the netgear has stability issues and would stop functioning after a power outage   these are nice  stable  small  easy  feature rich  able to block clients  this helps when your home has several access points  and you want to share the load and make sure devices near to it will join the specific one you want    btw  i m a network engineer with    yrs exp with route and switch  video and voice  security  and wireless   i suggest these to people to help improve the coverage in their house i do not recommend using any device as a repeater  because repeaters only repeat the signal at the level it has  say the place you want to put the repeater measures the signal at    dbm and it gives you    mbps throughput  if you put a repeater in that location  the highest speed you ll get will be    mbps even if the signal is strong     dbm or more   you will be repeating the poor signal that it has   i understand some don t have the luxury of running ethernet throughout the space   use a mesh system thats designed to space out things  usually uses a radio to just control the communication between the access points    while not as good as running ethernet to each access point  its better than nothing      
174,4.0,                       i m a reasonably savvy person on tech this is a pretty good product but it is not easy to set up with cloned ssid update     i have an approximately      sq ft split level house the router is in the back corner of the upper level   i had a bedroom in the front at the far corner of the same level and a tv  man cave  on the lower level   both had problems with wi fi intermittently dropping   after i placed the extender about midway between the rooms i now have a solid  good to excellent  signal the set up effort seems to be worth the effort  one caveat be sure to keep the same ssid for the extender as is on your router   if you do your internet life will be much nicer      
175,5.0,                       extremely happy with the purchase  my modem is in the far corner of my first floor  and trying to connect to wifi on the second floor of the opposite end of the house was a nightmare  purchased this bad boy  plugged it in  followed the super easy instructions to set up and bam  consistent and strong wifi upstairs  i plugged it in to an outlet on the second story that s about at the halfway point between the two ends of the house and have had zero issues  for the price  you honestly can t beat it  my house isn t massive  but it s a decent reach and i m very happy  definitely recommend      
176,5.0,                       if you have a large house and you are relying on the main router modem to serve wifi to the entire house and are experiencing some lag time with video  video games or if you utilize internet for tv services like prime video  youtube tv  etc  in the far reaches of your home  especially if you have long winding hallways  these little devices are an inexpensive way to boost your wifi signal throughout your home i bought two of them and put them in halfway between the router modem and each end of the home  both of which have winding hallways going to either side  and it worked perfectly  super easy to set up  takes     minutes max      
177,4.0,                       this tp link ac    wifi extender is a good buy if you are experiencing problems with getting a good signal on your smartphone or laptop that is in another room away from your router  i live in a coop and when it was built many years ago they used plaster   cement  not sheetrock so depending on the device my signal is not always good  this extender works well   but it is not the easiest setup because you have to try it out a few times to find that  sweet spot  in which to put it  somewhere between the router   the problem area  once that is done  you will wish you had bought it sooner      
178,1.0,                       like many reviews i  found the extender easy to program  it was placed in a recommended area per manufacturer direction  the unit worked as advertised for three days and then started to malfunction giving a  no internet connection   indication although the router was functioning  i reprogrammed the unit and it functioned for less than a day  found that it would reset if removed from the power receptacle and reinstalled but would malfunction hours later  the extender was quite warm when in service  may have been the issue  returner the unit      
179,4.0,                       now that i m working from home  i needed a very strong wi fi signal near my home office  which happens to be in the basement  got the range extender and set it up  which was very very easy  it does a great job of bringing a big strong signal into the home office  but it s slowed down from the speed coming out of the main router  as much as i d like to have the fastest signal possible  i d much rather have a strong signal then a super fast one  it s fast enough and it is never gone down in the almost two months since i ve had it      
180,5.0,                       i purchased this a few months after purchasing the tp router and noticed that i had great connectivity everywhere in my home except in my bedroom which is way on the opposite side of my house from the router  the wifi extender is as easy to install as simply plugging it in and adding the device to your home tp network  the new network that gets created will have the same name as the original network but with an  ext  at the end and it will automatically switch between both networks to whichever has the strongest signal  signal speed remains the same with either network  the only minor issue i mentioned is that once a month or so i do notice that connectivity with the extender becomes inconsistent  the original router doesn t have this problem and it is easily solved by simply unplugging the range extender and waiting a few minutes and then plugging it back again  the ext network automatically restarts itself and nowi have a strong connection again  it doesn t happen often enough to be a problem and when it does happen it is easily fixed so i still have this product five stars  i would recommend      
181,3.0,                       this range extender did not improve wireless internet speed sitting right next to my laptop  wireless internet speed was the same if laptop is connected by wi fi to main router several rooms away  however  when i connect laptop directly to ethernet port on extender  the results are fantastic this extender also has a major design flaw physically  while small in size  it covers both electrical outlets on the wall plate  you cannot plug in another device into the wall socket because the ethernet port on extender is positioned underneath instead of on the side of device  the cable will then block your ability to use the second electrical port  same problem if you plug into a power strip  it covers four electrical sockets  see pictures that accompany this review  amazing that this obvious flaw was not caught during quality control      
182,4.0,                       i m forever having bad wifi in my home  i got the idea from a friend to try out and extender which i did and i purchased this one  i have to say it was extremely easy to connect as i can t stand having to do to much lol and it definitely does work  it s   of us in my household and the amount of devices connected to the wifi is uncountable  what this does is still used the same wifi you normally do but it s somehow apart  in other words instead of everyone using same wifi connection now we can switch to your same wifi but thru the extender  so if a wifi name is   bob   and everyone usually connects to   bob   with the extender it s another connection named   bob ext   and it doesn t clog all of the connections to just one direct wifi  again you are still connected to your own wifi but hints it s an extender  overall it makes things run smoother in our house as we have changed certain devices to the extender wifi connection      
183,1.0,                       don t buy it i bough this product based onits on line reviews  according to my search  it is claim to be a reliable product however  i had a totally different experience i bought it to use it as an extender for my ring device and it was a disaster  all of the status lights were steady green but  i had no connection  i tested my wireless internet and it was fine  so it was an issue with the extender i try changing its configuration in order to improve it response time but  not even on it fastest setting  i had better results i also find myself re setting the connection on my ring device more than once a week i removed the extender and my ring issues stopped waste of my money      
184,5.0,                       each year my wife s family gathers at a beach house  my wife and i get the same room  and the wifi is terrible there     our room is just too far from the router   these extenders remedied that problem enough that we could stream our favorite shows in the evenings set up can be done with a button on the extender  via an app on your phone  or through your computer s web browser   i did it through my browser and it was really little more than selecting tp link from the wireless drop down  creating a password  putting in the router s password  and then moving the extender where you want it   done  i m probably going to get another pair to further extend and strengthen the signal nest summer      
185,5.0,                         stars  great ui my cable modem is an old motorola surfboard that can only do    ghz or  ghz at a time  so  i setup the surfboard to use  ghz and the tp link  placed against the farthest wall  to use    ghz  both using the same ssid  this works well for me  as the    ghz is perfect for the areas of the apartment that need to penetrate walls  i was constantly dropping connection before in my bedroom  but now i am getting a steady   mbps  my internet max internet speed       
186,2.0,                       i purchased this so our outside video camera would have no wifi connection issues   our home is not large at all  and one level  minus the basement    i put this in the middle of it and our wifi as instructed  i ve even put it closer to the camera and there is no additional wifi strength noted on our security system   this is only the first day of use  but when i can visibly see on the camera app the wifi strength  and it hasn t budged  i d have to say this product does not work      
187,5.0,                       i have an online job that requires a descent internet speed  unfortunately in my area we can only get    mbps from at t  even worse was using my desktop wirelessly i was getting about     mbps   horrible  because my office is far from the router i ended up buying a     ethernet cable that ran through the house to my router  it was a nuisance having to always step over it but it did put my internet speed at    mbps  at t and geek squad had several expensive ideas for my situation  so i thought i should give this inexpensive wi fi extender a try  i plugged it in behind my desk  rolled up my very long ethernet cable and plugged it in to the extender to see if it still worked  it does  i get the same wonderful speed without having a cable going from room to room  i could try it wireless but why bother  everything is hidden neatly behind my desk where it cannot be seen  awesome solution for about          
188,1.0,                       the tp link wifi range extender was a total nightmare   we have spectrum wifi  and a tp link modem   router   as soon as we activated the tp link range extender  all our wifi disappeared and the name of our network disappeared from every device spectrum could not help  and the engineer from tp link could never figure out what went wrong  even with more than an hour of trying to fix the issue with us using various techniques   we unplugged the new range extender  and the tech was able to get us back our previous networks by resetting us on our tp link router   we will be sending the extender back rather than try it again and lose our wifi network   creepy thing   the tech had no idea why it affected our wifi that way  but someone else said the device does not work with spectrum  so we will try a different brand of extender   any ideas would be appreciated      
189,1.0,                       this works great as an extender  which takes the form of an alternate connection point to your devices  with a name that defaults to xxx ext   however  i purchased this because it says it is onemesh compatible  i have a tp link onemesh router  but the onemesh configuration screen on the router says that there is no onemesh device on the network  likewise  the setup screen on the extender provides an option for selecting a host network  but does not provide an option for selecting a mesh network to join   tp link provides no email for support questions  their chat feature is automated  it will allow you to connect live if none of the canned responses help  so i did that  it said that david would be helping me  but after a couple of minutes it became clear that there was no one on the other end  it had asked me for my email address and a description of the problem  so i hoped that they would get back to me by email  but they did not  so just beware  despite what it says  it is a standard extender  and will not work as a mesh node  bait and switch      
190,3.0,                       our verizon wifi signal had been variable and less than great  zoom calls freezing up  on my computer  so we bought this after doing some research    main router is at the other computer  two rooms away   but wifi is still variable and it is hard to tell whether  on the average  it is better than before   it s not worse  and i think i am having fewer freezes   speed tests give numbers all over the map   at different times  and even one right after the other  there is no place we can put the extender where there is not at least one wall between it and one of our two desktop computers      
191,1.0,                       extender worked fine until i recently updated my firmware and now ever   hrs every device on the ext network gets assigned a     x x x address  no device will ever communicate with the internet with an address in this range bc it s sole purpose is to self assign when a dhcp association can t be made   there are plenty of     extenders that won t encounter this within  mos nice      
192,4.0,                       super easy to install  make sure you download the app  my netflix stopped saying  signal lost  every   mins  i have a     sq ft apt  the extender shows you  lights on it will be red if it s too far away  where it has to be in the home to work  i was surprised it required it to be rather close to the router to work  this will not work for large spaces but is working great in my small apartment      
193,1.0,                       well  maybe my signal was not weak enough for me to benefit from this product   i assumed somewhat lackluster performance on my    mbps line was due to a somewhat weak signal on the other side of my condo to where my desk is   i generally see        signal there   i get better  but still not what i want to see  speed tests either direct wired or when closer to the router so i tried this device out  hoping that a stronger signal would equate to more consistent speeds   well  in my case it did increase signal strength to the mid   s  but speed tests showed much worse performance when attached to the extended network compared to the main network   i tried a couple of locations and tried so called  high speed  mode  all to no avail this might be fine based on my use case   perhaps in a case where i had truly horrible signal strength  or an inability to connect at all  this would at least make a connection  possible   and speed might be the least of my concerns it was easy enough to install and configure  inconspicuous  and nicely takes up only one  the top  receptacle on a gang   if it works for you  then you ve made a good purchase   for me  it s a return      
194,5.0,                       so far so good  we purchased this wi fi extender a few days ago after looking online at different ones at different prices i decided to go with this one and so glad i did  this is a very affordable wi fi extender and it works great  we had major buffering on our tv we have hulu live and prime and we re so upset because it was so bad sometimes we couldn t even watch a show in full without interruption  i installed this extender the wps installation is the easiest method so i recommend that for quick installation also it has to be not so far away from router we put it in our kitchen about    ft away and it works great   so far no buffering at all  i m so glad i purchased this product it fixed our problem at a fraction of the cost of others  i recommend it       
195,4.0,                       this extender allows me to stream videos  etc   from my router to my tv   about    feet away  around a couple of corners  and past the signal blocking appliances in my kitchen  i also can mirror content from my phone to the tv while sitting on the couch  so it does what i need  setup wasn t bad  although i had to get an extension cord to get the extender close enough for the first pairing with the router  after that  i moved it to an electrical outlet closer to the tv  using the wps button is easiest for setup    i had problems figuring out and using the website and phone app  tether   tech support by email was quick and responsive  although at first i was told to watch a video i already had seen  the tech rep patiently walked me through several questions and was gracious when i realized i had typed in a wrong password   you ll need the password for your router and will have to set all your devices to use the extender network  rather than the router  but they have the same name and password  i ve tried moving the extender to different parts of the house with no luck  but i must admit the locations were not in a straight line with the router  so far  i m pleased enough      
196,3.0,                       we had quite a bit of trouble setting this device up and getting it recognize the router  after some research and many failed attempts  it finally registered and linked up  however  we could not get our devices to link up to the extender for some time after that  eventually  everything settled into place but we did not notice a significant increase in the signal strength  not seeing a significant boost  we returned the product  i see others appear to have luck with it but in our case  it was not what we had hoped for      
197,5.0,                       got this today  and am writing this from my living room  where i haven t been able to get a good wifi signal in years  am very pleased with the installation process and the effectiveness of this product  thus far  installation plug it in near your wireless router  select it as your wifi on any device  i used my iphone   then either download the app or enter a simple url  which is what i did  on the device s browser  and i can t remember what the third option was for connecting to it   and then enter a password that you make up on the spot  select your current wifi  enter its password  wait like a minute  then plug it in halfway between your router and where you want the range extended to  and then wait another minute  and then select it as your wifi in those previously out of range areas  these things are usually not this easy or straightforward will update if anything changes      
198,4.0,                       my previous tp link wireless extender simply refused to pair with my router  i finally gave up and started shopping for a new extender  tp link was not my first choice due to my previous experience but i eventually bought the re     i was pleasantly surprised  it easily paired with my router and works flawlessly with the tp link tether app  it also has better range  i am completely happy with the re         
199,5.0,                       i m in a place where the wifi is shared between three people and oft times there are computers  laptops  tablets and phones  on at once  most of the time i wouldn t be able to get even a wifi connection going in my room at all unless it s in the middle of the night so  i brought this product out of sheer desperation so i could at the very least be able to watch shows but  let me tell you  this product has far exceeded my expectations  directions on how to set up was clear and easy and within just minutes i have a very stable and strong connection to the wifi from my room  i m watching streaming services  downloading updating games and other programs and writing this review from the comfort of my bedroom because of this little extender i didn t even have to plug it in halfway between the router and my room  i placed it in a far corner of my own room  which is the room farthest away from the router and the connection and overall speed has been nothing but perfection highly recommending this      
200,1.0,                       total crap   will not work in basement   no signal   if you have to have near the router  why have it     in order to set it up  you have to install several apps and it screws up your alexa plugs   i now have to work on getting plugs working again   to much work for no gain in signal   customer service just gave me more apps to install and none worked   past return time or it would go back   don t buy        
201,5.0,                       i also connected this to my samsung tv  by wifi and it works better than directly from the router itself and the tp link is in another bedroom not the living room  i gave this tp link a   star review but it is important to know that if you use the same  password as your router  then you can take advantage of being able to use the roaming feature  where it automatically senses where you are and switches directly to either the direct router connection or the tp link   i had been having connection problems with my tv in the living room and once i connected directly to the tp link those problems disappeared   when i connected my phone my bedroom reception was enhanced and was faster  than when i was three feet from the router  how did they do that   great product       
202,5.0,                       why i didn t buy one of these years ago   no idea   maybe it was because i could never figure out my fios    mg  was buffering constantly    feet away from the router  maybe because it wasn t the speed i was paying for      anyway the signal no matter which service i used   wasn t going through thd thick walls of     yr old house   so everything lost signals  i plugged this in outside the door of the bedroom   perfect signal   hasn t buffered once   and i just switched to the cheapest service in town   makes me mad i wasted so much money on their    better fiber optic service   that  was promised would never buffer  try one of these   before going to a more expensive service   you ll be glad you did   works great       
203,3.0,                       used this for several months and tired of have two addition wireless names to connect to  in fact this was my second repeater so that made more network names than i wanted to see or connect to  i did not find it improved my wireless calling on my cell phonefinally splurged for a mesh system i was at one point a tp link fan but poor warranty support is a killer  not that the cost of this needs a warranty      
204,4.0,                       this is a great product  but the directions are terrible  the company may want to have a layperson sit down with a technician and develop directions that will help those who are less techie than most people  i good comparison would be to give a person a new high end jaguar car without directions  the person may have difficulty even starting the vehicle  let alone realizing all the safety features and other bells and whistles available to the driver directions are important       
205,4.0,                       i would suggest updating the firmware asap   i purchased two of these extenders about a month apart   the first served to get a much stronger signal to my ring doorbell and kids xbox   the second i placed in the garage because i plan on adding another wi fi camera out front   these extenders don t extend your existing wifi ssid they create a  rd    th wifi network with ext added to the name of your existing network   this meant i had to reset the ring doorbell   if you understand this then these extenders are a good value   once i updated the firmware on both they both became visible in the tp link app and all is good   a nice boost to the wifi where i wanted it      
206,5.0,                       recently changed to a new router and had a couple rooms upstairs that were buffering videos games  i set up the tp link   ac    wifi extender and wow  what a huge difference  instructions provided with the extender are easy to follow  choose what set up option is best for you  i opted for the browser instead downloading the app  at first i couldn t log in using the http repeater address so i used their http ip address listed in the guide  if you feel challenged by the set up  don t be  go to a popular video site and there are some quick videos that will explain  configuring for the     and the  g signals were intuitive  i gave them unique names  norad ext  so we could easily spot them when logging in with multiple internet devices  roku  iphones  ps   laptops   note  after set up  plug the extender between the router and the weak or dead zones  in my case  about    feet away from router  the green signal readouts will confirm you re good to go      
207,5.0,                       we recently had wifi installed at our lake cottage so we can work remotely from there as well as from home   i bought this extender in the hopes that the signal could be picked up at my parent s cottage next door as well  and also in the  clubhouse  in the yard where the kids like to hang out and watch movies   this extender has worked great   between the router on one side of the house and this extender on the other  we can get a clear wifi signal all over the house  our yard  in the clubhouse  and at my parent s cottage   the signal is adequate for streaming for a good distance in all directions and i can even get a signal down by our boat dock  though it does fade out at the end of the dock  which is     long in addition to about     of yard in front of the house   the lake house is on a hill  so that may help increase the range works great  very pleased   definitely increases our wifi range well beyond the regular router s range  though speed does decrease with distance   overall it s awesome   really easy to set up as well      
208,4.0,                       since adding to a tp link router i figured they would pair right up   that wasn t the case   i had to go online and go through the procedure to pair them up   once paired up  they work great   i have a dual band router   when on the   ghz band our wireless tv had poor wireless connectivity  so we had to use the     ghz   with the extender  we now have excellent connectivity on the   ghz band   i would have given a   star rating if it had been easier to pair      
209,5.0,                       exceeds expectations  i ve used other inexpensive wi fi extenders but this one is by far the best  my internet provider gives me both  ghz and    ghz networks in my home  my router is in the basement and this is the first extender that s been able to acquire the  ghz signal from the second level and relay it into the deadzone  other extenders could do it with the    ghz  obviously  but the faster speed is making a huge difference  super easy to set up      
210,4.0,                       our daughter s wi fi signal in her bedroom is spotty at times so i bought this extender due to the best rating given by cnet  ever since she has no cutoff of signal   she has decided to take her classes      online now due to her private school now having positivity result of covid     the extender was easy to set up  our router has the same brand as the extender  it blends well with her room as if it only looks like a night light      
211,4.0,                       i am sure the picture is confusing  however we live in the burbs of rockwall  texas that is   k city and county   strangley  intranet service providers are few and services are sketchy at best   we have the fastest out here via at t which is the better  one to have   the router is in my bedroom and we needed out in travel trailer for grandbaby and kid stays i am a techy idiot  so i had to use my   yo daughter to do it  she is a techy person  so my review of   ease to connect  is scewed     by a lot  i will say  we had to move the unit two times  first we put to far away    ft from second location  and the bars on the phone showed the difference in connectiviety   the second spot was closer to the router  and ended up giving better signal   we never were able to get all   lights  just three house is a   story      ft each level    so the garage is a questionable area for wifi  backyard was not  dont ask we do not know why    now we have great wifi and out to the trailer      we are happy   i bought two by mistake   i see a christmas gift in the future      
212,3.0,                       now that we re running zoom meetings and classes every day  i needed to boost my signal upstairs in my office  was hoping this would do it  the extender is directly above the router and is plugged into a wall about    feet from my office  the signal definitely looks better on my computer screen  but zoom still takes up too much band width to be able to run both audio and video  so  i either need to turn off the video or call in on my phone  so  signal is better  but problem is not completely fixed  overall  i guess not bad for what i spent compared to some of the other options      
213,1.0,                       this was impossible for me to set up via the tether app  it would show connection in my phone settings and give me a message in the app that it couldn t connect  tried setup with the wps button on the router after resetting the device and my router  would not connect  live support is a chat bot that was useless   worked on trying to connect this device for an hour and a half  it shouldn t be that difficult  it s going back  i will try something else      
214,5.0,                       the key to getting the best performance from this wi fi extender  and probably all others  is to install it on the same floor as your router   i learned this from a poor review of a different product that i was reading after being disappointed with the performance of my pc link which i had installed in my library on the floor below at the far end of my house   the support tech in the aforementioned poor review had said that the product was intended to be installed on the same floor as the router  which in my case was in an upstairs bedroom    this seemed to a problem for the reviewer  but not for me   i simply plugged the extender into a power strip in my upstairs office and bingo   the performance of all the devices in the rooms below improved dramatically  equivalent to the performance in the rooms below the router side of the house   this makes sense if you visualize the device ranges as circles in a venn diagram   having the devices on the same level maximizes the area of the diagram subset where the data is transmitted      
215,5.0,                       after a quick amazon search and realizing i was not paying more than    bucks for a wifi extender  because the last two that i paid for were crap  i settled on this unit  hands down  the easiest unit i ve ever set up  i think it took me no more than    from taking it out of the box and getting it on my wifi and set up on my phone and other devices  service no longer drops in my home  when we move from the front to the back of our house this uint automatically switches over to the extender seamlessly  a great buy for less than             
216,3.0,                       i bought this so i can get a better signal for my ring floodlight cam and smart garage door opener in my detached garage as i was losing connection from my main router frequently  i placed the repeater about half way between the garage and the router and unfortunately the signal strength was actually slightly worse in the garage than from my router  however  it does seem more reliable as i haven t had any issues with the signal being completely lost  so even though the signal is low it is stable the setup is very easy and there s a smartphone app so no need to go to a web portal at some ip address you re going to forget which is great  however i could not find a way to modify advanced settings like change the channel from the app  by default it was using the same  ghz channel my main router was using and i couldn t find a way to change it  so i ended up just having to disable the  ghz band entirely in order to prevent interference overall don t expect this to drastically change your network performance or range  but in limited use cases such as mine it works fine     
217,5.0,                       this is going to sound so weird but i bought this because the internet in my house wasn t strong enough to stream video games to twitch without being in the worst quality imaginable so i bought this in hopes that it would fix it but my internet doesn t feel stronger or faster or anything but i can now stream video games just fine  so i guess it s doing it s job lmao it was extremely easy to set up  it says you have to have it close to the router but i have it upstairs while the router is downstairs and it s fine and the red light that warns you it s too far away didnt flash     
218,5.0,                       working from home required me to set up an office in my workshop  i have so many devices attached to my router and too many walls between my router and my  office  that i had a problem maintaining a signal  this device boosted the signal and my computer is the only device connected to it so i now have fast speed without any signal drops  installation was very simple and once it s up and running  you don t have to do anything else  just turn on the computer and start working  it works great and didn t require a second mortgage to buy it  if you need a better signal in your network  get this  you won t go wrong      
219,3.0,                       i am not impressed with this   i bought it because i ended up putting my office in a back bedroom and the wifi signal has always dropped a bit in the back two bedrooms    bars instead of     with the video conferencing needs for work right now i wanted to make sure i didn t have issues   what i find is when i look for a wifi network my regular one will have the   bars and the extender will show   song select it  as soon as i have it up it too drops to   bars   every video conference i ve had with it freezes and jumps at times so it is not a smooth call like it is in the front room   i have a      sq ft house and the space from the router to the extender is about   ft  in the same room  and from the extender to the bedroom is only down a   ft hallway   well within the range it promotes      
220,2.0,                       we have a large apartment so i m thinking maybe my dead zone was too big to be covered with this device  i tried moving it around for several days since i really wanted to save the money but ultimately ended up returning it and buying an eero pro instead  i think this device would work well if you have a small dead zone in your space  or if you live in a smaller apartment or only want to address issues on one level of your home      
221,2.0,                       if this didn t perform the simple functions other repeaters do then i could recommend this   unfortunately you are very limited with what you can do to extend the existing wireless network you have to use the existing wireless network password   you can change the network name to anything you want  but are forced to use the same wi fi password   i purchased this because my mother had her internet service provider change her modem and they didn t configure it with her existing network settings   now all her smart devices stopped working   tried to install this repeater and change the extended wireless network to match the old settings  but since we can t change the wireless password  it makes this unit useless   such an easy fix  but a sign of very lazy programming   contacting support made the experience even worse   their support tech was very condescending   much better companies out there      
222,5.0,                       this device is about as plug in and use simple as it can get   perhaps a catch for some folks routers is getting the device to connect to their router  but a simple single button push worked for me   previously wifi dead spots in my house  including outdoor areas  are now covered with a strong wifi signal   the remaining test is to see how long it lasts   but for now    stars      
223,5.0,                       there s probably a reason this extender has over        reviews  it actually works  i ve purchased three over the years and none of them have ever even connected a signal  i didn t even bother to read the instructions  youtube has countless videos of this exact make and model of people showing you how to do it  it s seriously a matter of pressing two buttons  it connects itself  and you re ready to go  you seriously can t go wrong with this and if it doesn t work for you for whatever reason it s a prime item    return it free      
224,5.0,                       set this up as an access point  i had very poor wifi reception in the front part of the house  i did install wired access years ago but hate the hassle of cables outside of the main computer room  i connected this device to a wired port and set it up as an access point  it was quick and easy and worked first try  i now have both    ghz and  ghz wifi networks available in the front part of the house and they are strong and stable      
225,1.0,                       i set this up by following the directions exactly  placed it halfway between my router and ring doorbell  i wanted to assure no wifi interruptions  trouble connecting to my ring video  or any disconnections instead my connection was worse and i was constantly stuck on a spinning wheel and unable to load my ring doorbell image i decided to remove the wifi extender and the problem went away immediately and my ring worked perfectly and what also concerned me was  how hot  the extender was to the touch  i discarded it a waste of money      
226,1.0,                       total waste of money  these did absolutely nothing to help extend my wifi   in fact  my coverage got worse with these installed  they are slower to transfer data  set up as new network names which have to be attached to as you move between them  and slow down traffic downline  get off this old patchwork system and go with mesh instead mesh wifi systems are so cheap right now and easy to install  eero  google nest  orbi  tp link   no reason not to go there  also  with smart devices becoming cheap and ubiquitous  downloading and running google home to run lights  media  group smart speakers  activate dimmers  monitor cameras and security  run routines  and much more is the way to go  with mesh  you will never drop calls as your phone shifts between nodes or lose connectivity with your devices  you can also keep track of every device using your network  what download speeds you are getting  set up guest networks  prioritize devices  etc  just by using their app on your cell      
227,1.0,                       i never recommend buying itvery  very bad device  all operating instructions were made and three days ago the device was unable to capture the name of my wi fi network the device has been restarted more than once  everything has been done and also explained how to operate  this is a useless torment device stupid device that can t even capture my wifi network name i will ask for my money back from amazon  do not buy it and make my mistake     
228,3.0,                       i tried one of these devices a couple years ago  different brand  and it didn t work as advertised  it s been a couple years and i m still dealing with dead spots in my backyard and garage which are at max maybe    feet from my router and with the extender maybe half that  thought maybe in a couple years the technology and devices would get better  i was wrong  this unit did not perform the way i needed it to  i m trying to run wifi security cams in my garage and back yard  this failed to allow that  i gave it three stars because although it was useless to me  it did work and set up was easy  if you re looking to do what i m doing  this is not the unit  returning      
229,4.0,                       i have struggled to get a good signal in one part of my house  my only solution before this was to move closer to the router i read many reviews and then studied how to make this work  this was delivered and i got going on setting this up i was nervous as one review stated it didn t or wouldn t work with spectrum  and that s what i have i was trying to use my old iphone  that i just use on the home wifi  but found it could only go so far i plugged this in  waited for the light to stay on steady  then downloaded the app  i had to create an account with this  then i tried to go from that point and all i could find was it could not find anything in my house that s when i switched to my other iphone and had to use my data on it to make this work i got this connected and it found    of my things  so i was very happy  even though i have about    or more things i then proceeded to move this about half way between the router and the dead zone i have   i went into my dead zone and turned on my device  and holy smokes it s got   bars after i found this works great i then went to some of my other devices and pulled them off  just want this for one area of my home and i couldn t be happier would i recommend this booster  yes i would  just take your time and it will work  if this fails me at anytime  i ll come back and edit this review      
230,5.0,                       i ordered this for my office  it is an old brick house that had a large area added onto the garage area  so brick wall separates one half of the space from the other  i ordered this bc in the downstairs area there s a smart tv that runs off wifi for when the kids are at work with me and the router is in the main area enclosed in brick and the wofo doesn t reach that far very well  today i tried to turn the tv on and connect to he internet but there was barely   bar and it wouldn t work  so i hooked up the extender and once that was done i had full signal so in order to get the extender working  you have to download an app onto a phone and connect to the extender  and then connect it to the router  there are a few steps and it is not as simple as just plugging the thing in and bam you ve got better signal  just an fyi  bc i was kinda under the impression that it was that easy lol      
231,5.0,                       my house is three levels and i wasn t getting a reliable signal on the  rd level at the furthest point away from my router   this solved the problem totally and now the signal is as strong there as it is next to the router since i had a tp link router all i had to do to install this was to press the wps button on my router and then press the wps button on this extender     that s it   it took about   minutes to totally synch up and since they are mesh products  they appear as one big wifi network and my cell phones  tablets  tv s and firestick simply and automatically pick the strongest signal   the router was     and this was     so for under      i have a terrific  high speed network   i had my own computer sales and service business for    years before i retired   years ago and i wish things had been this inexpensive and easy then      
232,4.0,                       i had to find a new extender after my netgear extender got bricked when i tried to update the firmware  i even tried the reset and nothing  so i decided to try the tp link on advice from a co worker  i tried to do the wps sync from my modem router  but it wouldn t cooperate  so i tried one of the three methods in the instruction  i logged into a browser and was able to establish the  ext connections for  ghz and  ghz  i hid the  ghz because it has yet to live up to its capabilities  the footprint in my house is just over      sq ft  so this extender model more than suffices my networking needs  i gave it four stars since i ve only had this installed two days ago  so far  so good  i m happy with it thus far      
233,4.0,                       i was pleasantly surprised at the signal and throughput this gives   i m using it in the window of a metal building and didn t have much hope   i have a larger antenna with a usb connection to the computer  but it doesn t work on a raspberry pi and though it has an incredibly strong signal  i can t use a hub and connect multiple devices this device works and works every time   in fact  its output is strong enough i could use it all the way back to my office in the house  where the access point is   wouldn t make much sense  but it would work setting it up the first time took a little thought and a few tries   i m not certain where the problem was unless i missed one instruction and got it right after i went through it again   anyway   i went through the process again it worked and has worked every time since i don t have formal measurements  but the signal strength on the primitive display of my laptop networking setup was pretty good and the throughput was fair   i wish i had the numbers  because it would be interesting   however  considering my expectations  bupkis  i m quite happy with it for casual surfing and small downloads      
234,1.0,                       i bought an extender product  re     on amazon  to improve the dead zones of my wifi in my house  i saw on tik tok that this kind of product could help me with the wi fi signal by improving it  it never did the job  i still have dead zones without wi fi signal and i lost the time to return the product through amazon  i tried to get a money back from the manufacturer and although the product has a   year warranty  they do not refund the product money yesterday i had such a big network problem because this product created an ip address conflict  in my network provider that started to pop up a network ip address alert on my mc  i have to  deleted the re    info from my wifi and delete my network info on my laptop and reinstall the my network info from my wifi i do not recommend this company for any equipment and support issue      
235,1.0,                       i agree with some previous reviews who said that the privacy policy that must be accepted in order to use this is absurd  as usual  it s difficult to understand the legal stuff  but they seem to be saying they can use any information they get and give it to  rd parties  this was a deal breaker for me  i am returning it i can t speak to how well it works because i was unable to set it up due to the fact that i would not accept the privacy policy      
236,4.0,                       initially i tried to set up the extender using the wps button and it would not allow me to log on   i reset the unit using the button on the bottom and then set it up using my web browser   no problem   the tether application seems to imply the you need a different password to be created to log in to the extender but you do not   i used the original password for the router and it worked fine   you do need to set up a different password to initially do the set up and any administrative functions but this is not for logging in to the extender wireless      
237,5.0,                       i may actually graduate from college   with all of the crazy coronavirus things  the past few weeks internet in our house has been strained   i d spend hours trying to upload documents for class   and there were times where i couldn t even attend the zoom class sessions because life was just too slow with wifi in my house my sister suggested that i increase my internet speeds or buy my own line   that would have been an additional     a month   this     device has saved me    look at the before and after speed from my computer       
238,1.0,                       before buying this extender i had my firestick directly connected to the router  sometimes  every once in a blue moon my stream would pause but other than that no further issues  i was simply hoping to completely get rid of this little hiccup with this extender cue in the  ac    extender   i received my  extender  promptly from amazon as usual  my main router is located in the first floor of my home i placed the extender on the second floor  about    feet from the router s position setup was simple  i proceeded to connect my amazon fire stick to the extender  upon trying the new connection my fire stick kept freezing and losing connection   at some point  i had the message  connected to network but no internet  i had to unplug the extender to regain wifi connection on my fire stick   this happened about   times in a single night   long story short  my wifi connection is faster and more reliable directly from the router than from the ac    did all sorts of testings too   tried positioning the extender at a mid point between devices   closer and farther from the router  and or devices   same result i can not recommend this device      
239,3.0,                       bought this for use with my spectrum router which was just updated replaced within this past year  unfortunately i had the same issue as other spectrum users did where the extended goes through the whole setup without issue and even allows you to  connect  to the router wifi only to find out it won t actually connect in full  it shows the networks as available and let s you connect and input the wifi s password but after completing it shows the network as unavailable  i did all   setup processes shown on the instructions but nothing works  so if you have a newer spectrum router then there is a good chance that it won t work for you      
240,1.0,                       with this tool  you only can read simple email  you can not open facebook or run video   it is waste of money  i have to turn this t p link off and use my phone to be able run video or open website   does not extend wi fi for what you need       
241,1.0,                       update  the extender has performed increasingly poorly over time  six months in  i now need to unplug and re insert it every eight hours to move speed back up to   mbps from around   to   the easy of use of the extender is great  the range is quite good  but i was disappointed to see the onemesh functionality not working with my tp link c  router  it is possible that tp link will add compatibility through future updates  but it looks like not much progress has been made along these lines since onemesh was released  so i have to switch wifi networks on my devices as i move through the house  which is less than optimal      
242,5.0,                       i was able to set this up in less than    minutes  and it eliminated a persistent weak spot in our house s wifi network  relatively straightforward for a modestly technically adept person to get working   the instructions provided  and available via the product s smartphone app  were clear and logical   if you need to augment your wifi network for a reasonable price and without frustration  this product is for you      
243,2.0,                       had nothing but problems with my wifi connection since installing this  finally called spectrum to come out because the wifi was intermittent  spectrum checked the wifi download and upload speed  on spectrum wifi the download speed was close to     as it should be  however  on the extender  it dropped to     we disconnected the tp link and had no further issues with our wifi  piece of you know what  spectrum said      
244,3.0,                       i got this because working from home in the time of corona means that it would be nice to work from all areas in our townhouse  wifi really only works on main floor   while it does help in the areas where we didn t have coverage before   when i m in the main area that does have wifi  the devices get confused and i ll be connected to extender but not the internet  or my computer will be connected to the original wifi signal but it will be too weak to zoom with video  it s frustrating  again  i appreciate the original need   but now i just unplug it when i know i m going to be in the regular wifi signal  don t recommend      
245,5.0,                       works well  my bedroom is above the garage and even though i m about    feet from the wifi  my signal is terrible   i bought this to strengthen the signal for work and gaming   signal is about the same as if i was right next to the router modem   i like the option to plug in my computer as well if needed  super easy to install  every once in a while it needs to be reset  unplugged  for some reason  not entirely sure why   not a super inconvenience      
246,1.0,                       i am highly disappointed with this product  devices were able to connect with a high signal  though no data would transfer from the router  no internet connectivity whatsoever  contacted tech support for assistance and was referred to a youtube video that i had already watched to attempt to address the problems  i would give less than one star if it was an option  the device for me is less useful than a paperweight  i would not buy again or purchase any product of this manufacturer      
247,5.0,                       my office wifi was constantly dropping  i got this thing and now i have a solid connection  it s really easy to install following the included instructions  make sure to place it halfway between the modem router and the  dead zones   don t put this in the dead zone  it won t work since there s no connection there  we ll see if it holds up but so far so good      
248,5.0,                       i got this extender to reach two shelly  wifi based relays to control a remote gate  it works well for this purpose  and i mounted the extender about    feet from the wifi router  outside the house in a plastic waterproof box  underneath the eve of the roof iot devices are typically assigned static ip addresses  and this is what caused me problems initially  see the attached screenshot of my wifi router s static ip address page  when a device is connected to the tp link range extender  its apparent mac address becomes a virtual one  comprised of the first   octets of the repeater s mac address plus the last   octets of the device s mac address  so for static ip address assignments  both the device s physical and virtual mac addresses must be assigned  i hope this will save someone the time spend figuring this out         
249,2.0,                       not as fast as one would expect  my gateway and internet service are very capable  internet service is    mbps down and the best i can ever get from the ac    is   mbps  the router in use is twice the distance from the user point then the ac    yet i get more than double speed from it  what is the point of having the extender      
250,5.0,                       we live on the first floor of a duplex  our apartment is good sized    bed      bath   we had issues with wifi coverage in the rooms at the front and rear of the house with the router in one of the center rooms  instructions were easy to follow and installation was pretty simple  once connected to your network you just plug it in  it solved the problem and hs worked perfectly  very happy with purchase      
251,5.0,                       needed a range extender so our wi fi would reach our patio  works great  i bought the older model  fairly easy to install using the tether app  i could not get it to install using the router itself  but tether hooked it right up  even though the only outlet i could place it in is only a few feet from the router  it sends the signal far enough that we can listen to music and surf the web on our patio over    feet away  five stars overall      
252,1.0,                       i was thrilled with the easy setup until i actually checked the outputs   using    g wifi  the speed of download was half what it would be using the regular signal from the router   tech support  so called  said it s not supposed to make it faster  just extend further   but no matter where i placed it  it did not extend the range of the wifi in any way i could detect   all of the info from the extender s app makes it look normal  but afai can tell  it just provides a second wifi network name that is half the speed of the router s network  and extends no further than the original router signal   after extensive discussion with both amazon and the company s tech support  i still can t tell whether my particular device is defective or whether i m dealing with a poor product  notwithstanding all the positive reviews      
253,5.0,                       i ve had this guy for a couple months now and it s awesome  didn t know too much about extenders when i bought it but it turned out to be exactly what i needed if you re down to the reviews and still not sure what this one does it s basically this  you plug this thing in the wall near enough your existing  router bubble range  so it can still pick it up  sync it up per the instructions  it creates a duplicate  clone  network and effectively  extends  your wifi s range so i ve got   floors but my router only covers the middle and lower  i put this thing in the hall by the stairs and it strengthened my wifi for the whole top floor tvs  netflix etc   ps   phones  tablets  zoom on laptops  they all can run off the cloned network and it works just as good as the wifi downstairs bonus  when we have power outages it doesn t freak out  it just turns itself back on with the power and syncs back up no sweat you can also name the cloned network whatever you want and set the password  i just did the same thing as the wifi downstairs but it d be cool to set it differently if you were doing an airbnb or renting out something      
254,5.0,                       set up the set up on this wifi router is extremely easy  the product provides you paper instructions but essentially you just need to download the app and follow the instructions on it  took no longer than   minutes important this doesn t  boost  the signal of the same wifi network  let s call it oldwifiname  but rather takes it and creates a new one called  oldwifiname ext   i use this to give me signal outside and i just need to remember to connect to the new  ext  wifi network  if you stay connected with to the old wifi signal  you won t see difference      
255,5.0,                       setup was easy with an app on my phone listed in the instructions  the app even told me i could move it farther from the router and still be able to optimize the signal  so i did    now the one device that is picky about the wifi works in all the rooms of our house  it is a great economic fix  especially that it is not a permanent modification in a rental home  and if we have to move and stay in hotels again with wifi i plan on trying it there as other reviews had success  then we can stream our shows in the hotel and have stronger signal for the kid s devices that save my sanity in a pinch      
256,1.0,                       i received this today and after reading the requirements for set up i immediately returned it  there is no way i would allow this device in my home  by using this you re basically giving this company permission to record and use all your personal information  personally i m not comfortable with that type of invasion of privacy but to each their own  i guess      
257,4.0,                       this is the first wi fi extender i have ever used  so i did not know what to expect  for the installation i chose to use the tp link phone app  the app made a very slick process of installing the extension wi fi  network  device increased my wi fi foot print and provided pretty decent speed  it s only been inservice a couple of weeks without any communication dropouts so far  i ll update my review after a few months of service the reason i am using this extender is to push a better signal to my ring floodlight camera mounted on back of the house  it worked very well for that purpose      
258,1.0,                       tldr  the internet from this device  not the wifi signal itself  is very unstable  the device uses a lot of power  customer support is bad with my whole family working and schooling from home and all of us mostly spread out upstairs  our router is downstairs  i figured this would be great to boost our upstairs signal to the back bedrooms  installation was relatively easy and took about    minutes  you need to use tp link s app which is a little clunky  but you can get through it i immediately noticed that the device got very warm  very quickly  it never got hot  but this thing clearly burns a lot of power and i m not sure why  that was my first indication that this was maybe not a great pick over the course of the next two weeks  my wife and i both experienced frequent internet  not wifi  disconnects when connected to this extender  working from home  this meant video calls were dropping left and right  thinking it was our internet  we switched back to the router wifi instead of the extender and the problem vanished  back to the extender  and there it was again attempted to work with tp link tech support  which was sooooo bad  after waiting    minutes for anyone to even connect to the chat and then another    minutes for the rep to say anything after she did  her advice was to force a specific channel for my home wifi on     and  ghz  what   so the problem is that your hardware can t effectively a wifi standard stay away and buy something else  this is already in a box getting sent back to amazon      
259,3.0,                       the one drawback to all these types of devices is that you re limited to the outlet locations of your house   with an older house like mine  you can t try a new outlet every   ft with that limitation  i m either so close to the original that it s not giving me much more range or i m so far away from the main router that it isn t picking up enough signal to boost in the first place   streaming videos were stalling just frequently enough to be annoying   better than nothing   but maybe not installation took more steps than it should   i had to sign up for an account rather than simply picking up a signal from the device   i don t know if  that is normal for these things   but i didn t like it recently we had a service technician come to the house and the gadget  happened to disappear  upon his departure   i ll have to get another one   but it will probably be a different brand      
260,5.0,                       i use this to extend a wifi signal from a hotspot   rooms away  i  have to keep the hotspot  using my phone s or tablet s hotspot  next to a signal booster  i did not want to install the app  i really don t remember how i got it installed but it shows up with the same name as the hotspot plus ext  i don t get that great of a signal in the room the hotspot is in  but i don t lose in strength of signal using this   rooms away  pleased with my purchase and consider it a great value      
261,5.0,                       this wifi extender was very easy to install   there were   install methods listed in the directions   i bought this to extend the range of a video doorbell   this boosted the signal from  weak  to  moderate    note that this extender will have a new wifi name that ends in   ext  so you  ll need to reprogram your devices to connect to the extender rather than your router   overall very happy with this wifi extender and would recommend it   there is a newer model out that might be a little stronger but at twice the price  and sold out       
262,1.0,                       i did a test sitting right next to the extender  the extender s signal light is green  which means it is in a good location in terms of its distance from the router     ft at most   however  the extender cannot deliver the full speed of my internet  as you see in the picture  i download at around     mb when connected to my router  but when i connect to the extender  i download at    mb at best  i ran this test several times and observed the same result every time  it was a waste of my time  if there is a max speed limit on the extender  they should mention it in the description      
263,3.0,                       looks nice and is unobtrusive  and setup is a breeze  connection strength was improved but was shocked to see it cut    ghz throughput to about a tenth of the speed   ghz was better but still cut it down by almost      what s the use of a stronger connection with way less speed  expected some loss but this was ridiculous and it was just extending the connection to upstairs in a modest sized dwelling  returned     
264,1.0,                       good reviews  good price   the only problem is that it never really worked well for us  it works the first time someone tries to connect  but then  the next day  our devices won t connect anymore  they connect to it  but no internet   not sure what its problem is  unfortunately it s been couple of months since i bought it and can t return it  so off it goes to the trashcan  i d gladly pay more to get something that works consistently but how to find one  based on reviews  this one supposedly had good reviews        
265,5.0,                       i saw some bad reviews here so i wasn t sure if this would work or not   so i figured i would give it a try   i moved into my first ever big house and my old house was smaller with vinyl siding so my modem router had no problem with the wifi  in this big brick house my wifi had read spots even on the first floor  so i gave this product a try and no more dead spots while speaking on the phone using my home s wifi and my irobot roombas no longer have connection errors      
266,5.0,                       easy to install i have an re     the model before this one  and where it is setup  depending on the outlet i plug into a little shift of a couple inches and i get the red light indicating it s a poor location   i have it plugged in the outlet that gives me all green and it works excellent   i use the lan port and have an ip camera plugged into it and i also have   wireless cameras connected via    ghz and   wireless cameras connected via  ghz coming back to the re      i swapped it out with the re    to test it   i got all green lights and was good to go   i changed outlets and everything was good   so the wifi signal reception on this unit  from my router  is way better than the re         
267,1.0,                       goodness gracious  the instructions barely resemble what you have to do in order to set it up  that said  i was eventually able to set it up  but then  after having done so  the connection would just fade away  the device would no longer be available for wifi pairing  like magic  it just disappeared  perhaps as worn out as i was after the fifth attempt to start from scratch again in hopes this product could be made to work  alas  i had to send it back      
268,2.0,                       why  not the best or easiest to use   setup wasn t too bad but it will show up as full strength connection on my device but then i see that i am connected but no internet   i have to unplug it and plug it in again so it reset every couple days   i also don t like that it doesn t provide mesh network for the router that i have so i have to make sure to manually switch the network i want to connect to from my device when moving from one area of the house to the other   if you looking for a quick inexpensive solution that isn t perfect and has some quirks  this will suffice but for a long term  more seamless suction for signal strength and area coverage  i d go with a mesh service device and make sure it is compatible with your router   might be a bit more money but would be worth it in the long run      
269,1.0,                       wifi signal   goes in and out and will disconmect and connect to other networks randomly  if you look at it wrong  the connection m is lost or very weaktech support   they have chat support which is nice  but any actual troubleshooting is done by scheduling a call with someone overseas to remote into your computer and poke around  not only are you giving full access to your computer  but you have to do so in the middle of the night  assuming you re in the us   because they only work on their hours overseas easy to install      minutes of plugging in near router modem  unplugging  plugging into another outlet closer to where you need the signal  seeing if it is strong enough  and repeating spend a little but more money on a better  higher end wifi extender  if you don t know  you will be down the line      
270,4.0,                       i live in a    year old home that has lath and plaster walls throughout most of the house   this makes it difficult for wifi access   i thought the booster would help and it does  but minimally   i don t think it s the fault of the product  but rather that of manufacturers who believe that all interiors are drywall only and won t be bothered with other structures   until the u s  catches up to the technologies offered in other parts of the globe  we ll have to limp along on slow  outdated wifi signals      
271,1.0,                       what a disappointment   i have a linksys wrt    acs and this product could not see the two ssid s that were broadcasting   the message on the cell phone app said little except not compatible   when i looked through the list of compatible routers nowhere was there a linksys router at all  but a lot of tp link routers and more that i ve never even heard of   seriously i sent it back immediately and now i have to ponder if i want to spend a lot more money for a mesh system       
272,5.0,                       i had a little trouble setting this up  i am sure it is due to my dumbness for technology  my son got it up and running fairly quickly  i needed internet out in my shop  which is     feet from the house  and in a metal building  after testing for placement  it actually worked  the only problem i have is that it keeps dropping the internet  it is still showing the wireless signal is available  but if i take any break from the computer  it drops the internet signal   i assume it is something to do with my computer settings and not necessarily this router      
273,5.0,                       an absolute breeze to set up   i just pressed the wps button on my router and then held the wps button on the extended for   second   a minute or   later it was set up on both     and  g bands   and it works exactly as it should   i have it at the top of our stairs in our   story house  and now the two upstairs dead slow zones are no more   i bought and returned   other extenders before settling on this one  but my search has now come to an end    one additional note on performance   i m now getting     mbps on    g and     mbps on  g with the extender in my previously slow zones   those areas with my router alone get      mbps and     mbps respectively   so yes  it works great      
274,3.0,                       having been a techie   beta tester for decades  i m always happy to find a device that is actually better than it s older model s   however  the re    is a disappointment when compared to prior models  there are   ways to link the device as an extender  i always use the easiest which is the wps buttons on my router and the extender  in order to get the re    to connect to    ghz and  ghz you have to do this procedure twice placement is the    key to getting the most out of these extenders  took some trial and error in a   story     sf home where i am powering    devices off a tp link cr     modem router  before pandemic  cox delivers a consistent    mbps at upstairs centrally located router  with an re    downstairs  through   walls  floor and over    feet away from router  my android tv box was grabbing    mbps from the re     see photo with speedtest results  which surpassed all the similar small plug ins and even the       highly advertised mesh systems  the re    delivered only    mbps and the wifi was not as good as the re     meaning it left some of my wifi devices offline the only extender i ve yet to try is the netgear eax   but i will be watching reviews of it to see if it could possibly be worth more than    times the price of tp link re     which will remain my    choice for now don t want to mislead anyone so i will mention that in order to serve all    of my wifi devices i have a total of   little tp link extenders  two are re    and  rd one is a re     all   are basically at the furthest indoor outlets in my home and for the record  my wifi devices include   amazon echo dots    echo input  rachio  kwikset  zmodo cams  wyze cams  smartthings hub  plus a few dozen smart plugs and smart bulbs all connected to alexa      
275,2.0,                       i did some quick research for a range extender  we had a lower end tp link router and were happy with it  i decided to go with the tp link range extender the issue is getting the wi fi further out to the rv pad  we bought a better dual band tp link router that really helped  so into the range extender to get full strength installation was a breeze with the wps setup  i quickly connected both bands on the network  i placed the range extender in the bathroom that only had an exterior wall to reach the rv the result was one bar to not seeing the extender in the rv  i have a better signal from the dual band router  it s pretty disappointing to say the least  i have a good working knowledge of networks  we used a netgear extender at our previous house that works great  i have very little interference from the router to the extender and the extender to outside the screenshot is from my iphone standing in front of the house where both the router and extender are located  i m actually standing closer to the extender  disappointed and returning it      
276,5.0,                       we live in a concrete and metal stud      ft  condo   router on one end of the unit  tv with roku on the other   i don t want to look at my electronics  so have the router behind a cabinet and the roku behind another   there are   metal stud drywall walls between the two   probably       feet apart   well  the roku got a weak signal   i considered moving the router or the roku  but didn t want to look at wires or devices  so bought this   very inexpensive   first attempt to intall failed because i entered wrong wifi password   the extender  accepted  it  but was not repeating the signal   luckily  i went in to rename the network  ext to see if roku would find that network better and noticed that i entered the wifi password wrong   corrected that and all is well   you need the app  no problem   it would be   stars if the device let me know it was not connected to my router   but  i am glad i have this and i now have excellent roku signal and speed in the othe room      
277,5.0,                       the only con i can offer is that perhaps once a week the wifi signal drops a bit   i m not sure if it s a problem with the extender or position of the router  but since the router is in line of sight  straight up the stairs and just inside the home office door  my guess is the extender just drops the connection   most days  the signal range has been extended        through an exterior wall and onto the back deck   on a few days  the wifi will easily go another        into the back yard      
278,5.0,                       i purchased this item because my house is so big and the back of the house internet is so bad with connection  this has made my family life better  we can all sit in the rooms in the back and be on the internet without the connection being lost  this is a great product and easy to install  you plug it up by your modem or internet box then the light click and then you unplug it and plug it where you want and that s it  the internet connection is in full working condition without dropping  i love this  worth the money     
279,4.0,                       i have about an acre if property and i picked up the signal almost at the back corner   so distance is good  this is how it works  it creates  a new network in your system  you must create passwords for the new network and log in to it setting auto wifi so it will automatically find it when your out of range  once i figured that out it worked fine and continuously works in background until when needed  hope this helps  by the way i had a question about installation and emailed them  they got back to me within the hour  good service too      
280,5.0,                       great so far we received item quickly and was well packed  it was very easy to install as it helps you find the optimal location to plug in  we have a variety of wireless devices   phones  tablets  computers  cameras  etc  and they were all able to connect to and not lose signal we have not had to contact customer support  so we cannot comment on their service  but overall we are very satisfied with the product and have had no problems  if things change i will update review  highly recommend      
281,1.0,                       it took me a few hours to attempt to use this both as an extender as an access point   neither of which worked well  as an extender  it s core purpose   it gave super crappy signal and it took me    different tries just to get it to connect to my host network  super pathetic and then it gave    maybe      th the speed it was supposed to as an access point   using my wired network as the host  which should also mean top speeds   it gave about     th my normal speeds  if you live with not so fast broadband already  let s say     mbps down  and you have severe deadzones in your place  i guess this could be passable  for anyone with relatively high speeds      mbps down or faster  and mild deadzones just look into a mesh network  not this thing      
282,5.0,                       didn t expect much for the price but it works exceptionally well   purchased exclusively to extend  ghz network for streaming hd video to a roku with poor signal   i found that  high speed mode  works best  where the extender connects to the router via    ghz and then extends the  ghz network only   this gives it the strongest signal to the router and works well even though our     here in our neighborhood is saturated   no buffering and no lag  went from  mbps to   mbps at the roku speed testing the connection on  ghz installation was a breeze with the app you download from your app store   really couldn t ask for a more efficient  easier to implement solution to poor wifi signals      
283,3.0,                       the setup process is real easy and tp link does a good job of making the installation effortless    unfortunately  despite it s good looks and ease of setup  this little unit is not powerful at all i have a dead spot in my appartement and  after setting the unit up  i moved it as close as possible to the area i wanted to cover and was pleased to see all green lights  meaning the signal was good    or so i thought  tried accessing a web site and it took forever to load  used the ookla speed test and the result showed a speed below   mbps  i ended setting up the repeater about    feet away from the main router  but that was not much help  i even tried the speed test a few feet away from the extender and the results were only marginally better  i ended up returning the extender and replaced it with power line ethernet modules and an old router i had on hand  a much more reliable solution      
284,5.0,                       the problem  i have a galaxy note   i use the smart lock feature that keeps my phone unlocked when i m at a  trusted place  such as my home  before i purchased the tp link ac    my phone would not recognize where i was and automatically lock at home  this happened when i was in my office or back bedroom far away from my router  worth mentioning  i keep mobile data turned off so i m always on wi fi at home  my office is about     from the router and at my desk i d only get a wi fi signal of   bar  sometimes no bars  if i held my phone up above my computer monitors i might get   bars since i installed the tp link ac    at about the midway point between the router and office i get   bars everywhere in my house and my phone hasn t locked once remember to change your phones connection to the tp link instead of your router if you found this review helpful  please click the  helpful  button  thanks      
285,2.0,                       we have a       sq ft house  two levels  all wood and drywall  no solid walls   our main signal is upstairs in one end of the house and we wanted to extend the signal  putting the extender directly below the main signal did not work  no connection   red light on extender   but putting it at the other end of the house on the same level did work  however  the extender frequently drops the signal  even when the main signal s still on  when it does work  it works well  overall  though  it reaches far less than the advertised       sq ft        
286,5.0,                       located the device one floor below the router   the dead zone was the furthest point from the router   went from   bars to   bars  much faster on the laptop now   good bye dead zone   one caveat i would like to share   it took several tries to pair with wps on the router  but that was not the fault of the extender   after two false starts  i went to the router manual  supplied by my cable company  and realized that wps had to be enabled  via a web gui  on the router before by pressing the wps button on the router   once i enabled wps on the router  the extender paired almost instantly   connection between the laptop and extender was equally quick   i realize that routers are different but verify that the wps button on your router is lit before pairing   other than this hiccup  process was very quick and the extender works great  and for a reasonable price      
287,5.0,                       it took me all day to install this item despite what appear to be detailed instructions  which turn out to be ambiguous in several places   but in the end  it was worth the effort because it performed as described   i was left with   wifi networks    the original    mynet  and mynet g and the extended network for each as well as one that merged these for my final network mynet ext which appears to repair the original reception holes most  though not all  of the time   this is more than i had hoped for after reading the many negative reviews on this site   in the end it was all worth it for the price      
288,5.0,                       i only needed an extender to get to a weak zone in my basement   i didn t want to have to buy a mesh system or anything like that   this did the trick for a nominal price   easy to set up  my location is pretty good so the signal is strong   i am having a challenge with devices like my phone trying to hang onto the old signal when passing into the new zone  but this is not the extenders fault      
289,5.0,                       the ps  pros built in wifi is so bad i couldn t stream amazon prime or hulu at all  i could hardly play games online and netflix was at a low resolution  my ps  is in my room which is on the second floor and the router is on the first floor directly below it  all my other devices have no issues but as i get a couple rooms over the signal does drop  so i got this wifi extender and wow  idk how i went so long without it  i ve hooked it up in my room and connected the ps  via ethernet to it  everything is loading now and playable   before i had kb s to   ish mb s now i m getting around      mb s   moving a few rooms over i get a very solid  ghz singal now      
290,2.0,                       simple to install but unfortunately placing it close enough to my current router meant that the extended signal is no better or worse at distance to the existing router  my current router is a tp link ac     archer c   i had to replace this with the more expensive ac     extender which seems to do the trick  the other issue is that i need it for mainly is for security cameras that i don t want to give access to the main disk system so i attach them to the  guest  network   an extender like this can only extend one network so i have to pick the guest one  i m not sure if setting the ssid to the same name as the main network will cause problems   i ll update this when i find out      
291,1.0,                       first off  i have good knowledge of wi fi networks and networking in general   i could not get this unit to maintain a connection with my network even after reaching out to their technical support   i must have reset the unit at least a dozen times and tried many different configurations such as     repeating both     ghz and   ghz   only     ghz   only  ghz    broadcasting a new ssid   same ssid    selecting different security protocols    playing around with various i p  address settingsimmediately after a reset configuration reboot  i would be able to connect to the new network and have full internet access   however  a short while later  i would lose internet connectivity   i would still be able to login to the repeater s admin page with a web browser  but i would have no access to the internet   the lights on the unit would indicate that it had a strong wi fi signal and that it was working as expected   from that point on  the only way i could get the unit working again was to do another reset configuration reboot   i explained the problem to one of the technical support people on the tp link website  but he she was of little help   the support person just told me to try broadcasting the same ssid of the network i was trying to connect to   i had already tried that about   times without success   i m not sure if my problems are unique to my specific router ap  but none of my other devices have ever had issues connecting to it   i ended up just buying an additional wi fi access point and setting it up in a different location in my house      
292,5.0,                       excellent product  easy to install  does the job  i have a basement apartment in my house and the router is all the way at the opposite end of the house  this router fixed it in a jiffy  the other thing that was really great was that i went on youtube which showed a couple tricks as to how to connect up the signal to my roku tv  that also works great  i am not super high tech and this thing was super super easy to install  really happy with this item  highly recommend      
293,5.0,                       this tiny device is amazing  it worked quickly and fast  on speeding and stabilizing the connection in the officeroom  none the less  i will recommend this product  so others people can give it a try  if you have a connection problems around your house  this is the device that you is must have  and you will notice a significant improvement in connection stability and speed levels the installation of this device is pretty much easy  it comes with a brochure  and application on the app store  available for download on iphone and android devices  you don t need an hour to set it up  only few minutes to install  builder in dual bands frequencies      and  ghz  simultaneously  the device boosted and stabilized my wi fi speed as followed    on the     ghz the speed is up to    mbps  and on the  ghz is up to      mbps  no more dead spots      
294,1.0,                       significantly inferior to a mesh network  save yourself the frustration and go with google wifi  which is what i use  with mesh you seamlessly bounce from one node to the next  all on the same network  but with a repeater  such as this tp link  you have to connect to that repeater s network  super irritating  especially when moving to different rooms for short periods of time      
295,5.0,                       i was nervous to purchase this as i did not know if it would work or if i should spend more money  the wifi would not reach my basement and it was super frustrating as that is where i workout and i want to be able to stream workouts down there  i purchased this in an attempt to fix this problem  ever since installing this product i have not had this problem  my videos stream so quickly at high quality  the set up is so easy  i even use this network instead of my normal network in my living room as i get this network stronger there      
296,5.0,                       i m no expert on bandwith or up down speeds  but it did the job i wanted with no problems  i use it in the kitchen to make my firestick happy with a little tabletop tv  the extender is  fairly far from the router  and behind a coupe of walls  but it works  strangely  i have no problem with the router s wi fi signal with my ipad or smartphone at the same location as the tv  but  without the extender  the firestick keeps dropping the connection  with this guy in the loop   no problems at all  one note  my wife doesn t like it plugged in above the kitchen counter  i tried moving it to some different locations  all of which alowed the extender to lock to the router  but which had other  issues   not related to the extender   so until i can figure out a better location  it is back above the counter  the note is this  while the extender locked in to the router again  you do have to be a bit patient   firestick was intially not happy this time   very good signal but no internet  however this cleared up with just a bit a fiddling between  home  and the wi fi setup  screen   be patient update  it turned out that i could cure the unhappiness of my firestick by using a longer hdmi extender cable instead of the wi fi extender  if you have a similar issue  it may be cheaper to solve the problem that way  but the extender is still useful or other things  a longer cable only helps one device   strangely enough  the firestick is currently sitting in what would seem to be a much worse position than next to the tv   the line of sight between it and my router goes through a fridge  but it s happy there  go figure       
297,4.0,                       used to extend a week signal from my ubiquity ap which works well inside to outside on the patio   plugged into a wall adjoining the patio the ios app did not work  didn t want t accept my password  didn t error but just did nothing i then tried the alternate  mechanism using the http          whatever address  written on the quick start leaflet  this worked well   it  prompted me for my    ghz network and a password then for the  ghz network  gave me an error on the  ghz setup but i figured  oh well as long as it works for one of the networks i automatically created an ssid with the name of the riginal network and  ext postpended to it proof of the pudding i took my linux laptop which had been struggling with one bar or circle on my existing wifi and being a crapshoot whether the gods of wifi were working   in my initial test after installing and setting up this device  i got   mbps down and   up    i m on comcast  so pretty awesome   ipad and iphone also worked well  i ll forgive the setup hiccups and highly recommend this     device now i can surf the net do work outside reliably   at least i can for tonight   being a natural skeptic i ll see how it holds up longer term and update this review if things go south      
298,1.0,                       i m pretty bummed on a few fronts here   i m used to apple airport and other mesh solutions and how they extend a network  resulting in one network with broader reach  this creates a new network  one     ghz and one     ghz  so actually   networks  that repeat the original network  but require you to join a different wifi network  that means devices that could share things across wifi  like iphones controlling apple tvs  won t work unless you switch them both  i guess that s the price you pay for such a low cost solution  not a deal breaker  but annoying my bigger issue is that it s unreliable  it has been tough to get devices to connect to it sometimes  and doesn t always get an internet connection for long time after booting up  like over   minutes  though sometimes it takes a reboot   that s really frustrating  i have this in my garage for a workout equipment area network  and turn it on when i go out there to workout  so i end up losing      minutes just dealing with the network issues lastly  there are   leds on the front  but   labels  one of the lights is red  but i don t know if it s for wifi or  ghz since it s between the two  when i use the app  it looks like  ghz is working  and i know wifi is working since i can connect to it  so maybe it s just a manufacturing mistake where they meant to use a green light but put in a red one update  the reliability has just gotten worse  despite having a good connection to the main network  it drops the connection or the throughput is unusable  i can connect devices around it to the main network and they work really well  so the issue is definitely the extender this purchase has essentially been a waste of time and money  i would not buy this again or recommend it      
299,2.0,                       updated review        originally i gave this device   stars  but since that review  i have lowered to    stars  since january    months since install   periodically  the tp link loses internet connectivity and any devices connected to it also lose internet  at first i hadn t realized this was happening and our lennox thermostat quit working and we were looking at having to replace that        before i noticed it had no internet  once i connected the thermostat directly to the regular router  those issues went away i gave   stars instead of   because if i reset the tp link it does reconnect to the internet and work for a while before it drops internet connection  at this point i wouldn t recommend this and have essentially stopped using it original reviewcomputers in the office have always had low signal strength  due to passing through several walls  i guess   anyway  bought this for         good price   install wasn t too difficult  used the app on my phone  it took a coupe of tries and about    minutes and had the extender in our wifi network  moved the unit to the hall right outside office door with line of sight and bingo  connection now shows all   bars and great signal strength   used to only get about   bars and fair  so far i am happy  no more dropped signal  yes  i would recommend     
300,3.0,                       we have a new two story home  for whatever reason  the  electrician wired the av to enter at the second story  when the cable company did their bit  they of course installed the cable box and internet router upstairs  being a concrete block home  florida   wifi downstairs  in some reasons is a bit spotty depending on the device being used  so  i researched wifi extenders and purchased this unit  bottom line  the original router provides a stronger signal  even downstairs  than this extender installing the unit is a breeze  i recommend using the smartphone method  worked like a champ  i used the location feature to determine the best location downstairs  and that worked beautifully  the device indicates a perfect strong signal so then i reconfigured the wifi settings to see the extender s wifi network and the signal strength on each device downstairs  even    feet from the extender  shows less signal strength than the original router  how can that be  i tried both   ghz and   ghz networks  and there is absolutely no improvement  and in fact  degradation  devices  kindles  fire tv  that were having trouble before  continue to have the same issues i will give it more time and play with settings  but since the install and configuration went so smoothly and everything  works   i am not confident there will be improvement so i guess the spectrum router  florida  is one heck of a router         
301,5.0,                       i had used and still do a tp link light bulb  no issues in more then   years seem the tp link wifi extender and figured since the light has ben working great  i ll try it you see i had already purchased another extender  but the directions were confusing  so i ordered the tp link wifi extender  the best part is you get it setup via the app and it s saved  just determine your application and a couple selections later your all set the app is awesome  it has a guide for placement that helped so much  i intend to use it for my security can  and i know it will work  i just need help to do it  being disabled is sure not what i intended to be  anyway  this was one product that i will continue to endorse  so easy  and setup is a breeze      
302,5.0,                       ditto to the other   star reviews  couldn t get continuous good signal on the front porch to watch streaming sports  started looking for a signal extender  expecting to have to pay much more  set up using the tether app which walks you through the process clearly and easily  took only a couple minutes to create another  network just inside the porch  with    ghz and  ghz signals having the same identifier as the routers  except with  ext added  tested the strength of both signals  with my phone  full bars just like from the router s signals when in the room with the router  the real test will come tomorrow evening as i attempt to watch a streaming baseball game on my tablet on the porch  after which i ll add an update   update  streaming on the porch is great  the signals for the extender links show   of   bars  while the signals from the router show   of   bars  indicating why streaming on the porch directly from the router was erratic  go ahead  buy this device      
303,5.0,                       let s keep it simple   these devices are quite complex on what they do   still set up is as easy as plug it into a socket and find the signal in your device   if you follow the instructions it works perfectly   note  normally wall sockets are low on the wall  so mine i used an extension cord and set it up in the wall   what a difference   it picks faint signals from another access point far away  broadcasting pretty good on   extra rooms   very happy  will buy again   on tech support  you ll speak with people with heavy accent but understandable  and they have all the patience in the world to get to the bottom of the issue  experience on another different tplink device       
304,5.0,                       maybe would ve loved  but unfortunately i live in a community that has free wifi to residents with huge modems i can t access so if you can t access your actual router box like i this will not work on wifi signal alone  my property has   wifi names  but none of them worked customer service was amazing trying to get it work then finally issuing a refund return      
305,1.0,                            not not not recommended  for starters this product is very difficult to set up  there are three options to set this device  however  the most secure options for you and your privacy are impossible  hard and frustrating to set up  it seems that they are pushing you to create an account and download apps    once you are in  in my opinion  you are still with the same of slow and laggy connection i recently spoke to my isp who advise me not to waist my money in this and go with a mesh service  by then  my grace period to return this had expired so i guess i ll use it as a christmas ornament final comment       not not not recommended     
306,5.0,                       i really need wifi for zooming classes and the signal just wasn t strong enough for reliable internet use  this little gem has solved the problem  it was super easy to install  just plug it in  set it up with the app  and go  all my computers and phones and tvs now have reliable signals  no more freezing and crashing because the signal is too weak  and it hasn t affected the speed of my internet at all   it s still blazing fast  i wish i could give ten stars      
307,5.0,                       overall    description accuracy   pictures accuracy   quality    worth the price    tagline works well wifi extendermy summary i wasn t getting enough wifi coverage in my bedroom so i bought this  i plugged it in between my router and my bedroom  you set it up with their app  there is a process to it  once complete it worked like a charm  it does set up another name for both     and   ghz wifi  if your wifi name is  my wifi  it will create  my wifi ext   you connect to the new name for the extended reach  a little clunky if you have a dual band router that splits the names  other than that  works as advertised      
308,5.0,                       i was surprised at how easy it was to set up the device and what a good signal i received from a remote section of the space i m in so often  one comes to find that the  quick start  of a product is much more involved than described   with this product  a free downloadable smartphone app walks you through the entire set up after the set up  however  i started having doubts because my laptop showed the same weak signal strength that i had before    only two bars   despite the two bars  i indeed had a strong and fast connection   it is just as fast and strong as when i am at my other computer  which is only a few feet away from my router      
309,3.0,                       on the plus side the tp link ac    had no issues connecting to my original router  it seemed happy almost no matter where i placed it  on the other hand  devices struggled to connect to the extender unless they were in the same room  passing through     walls dropped the signal strength to almost the same level as the original wifi network adding an extension cord to the device and perching up high on a dresser mirror increased the range enough to get a decent connection in an adjacent room  i wish i could have just left the device in the outlet      
310,3.0,                       even though the signal is fine  what is missing is the internet speed   it still has to communicate to the wifi router and that is the weak link here   and the signal seems to go up and down on its own with nothing being moved   if the speed were closer to the wifi router speed  that would be something that would make it actually useful   i find it better to just bypass this extender and connect to the weak signal of the wifi router      
311,5.0,                       we were having issues with our apple tv located downstairs  basically on the opposite side of the house from our router   the signal was very spotty  especially if someone was on their phone or downloading something at the same time  we plugged this in just at the bottom of the stairs  where it indicated it was getting a good signal  the wps method is easy to get setup with since it s just a button click  i did end up going into the interface and changing the ssid to match my existing router so that i didn t have two distinct networks in the house that i had to manually flip between  but that was super easy as well   they have a button that simply says  match host said  that you can click  all in all it s doing a great job   signal is great for streaming downstairs  easy to set up  haven t had any issues so can t speak for the support aspect of it      
312,1.0,                       easy install but doesn t matter if u still get weak signal  i m desperate for some good wifi coverage in the detached garage across the house  the house got strong expensive wifi coverage  but once install this the wifi gets reduced significantly as well  i put the device in the best location  i get only one bar if opened garage door fully  if close it i don t get any  the garage is just       feet away from the device across the door hallway  the router is set up nicely in the middle of the house too  i talked to friendly tech supports but gave me different information over the phone versus the email info they sent me  and that didn t work as well to amplify the signal  not only that now my wifi is dead  when it did work for a little bit everything is slow and laggy  i really don t know what to do here and need help  i need wifi asap to study and work  the only way maybe to daisy chain it but someone in review said maybe not to do it  however when i asked manufacturer tech support they just said maybe helps but saying there s interferences  of course there s basic interferences for everybody  that s why we need better wifi extenders      
313,5.0,                       i m not sure if there are a lot of people just like us  our house is not super big nor small        sqft  but one router cannot serve the whole household as there are some dead spots  but buying a set of more than   hardwares to build a mesh network seems going too far  and of course very expensive  if it s the case  just try this wifi extender and it will resolve the issue right away  it s super easy to install  you can setup everything with a mobile app or web browser  wifi signal is strong and stable before having this extender  our study on the other end of the house was only getting     of our subscribed bandwidth  but after adding the extender  it significantly increased to over        of what we are entitled for  i would recommend this      
314,3.0,                       using a wifi strength app  it increased the wifi signal outside on the patio from normal to strong or max but when i connected to the new  ext network  i had more audio dropouts than before  i admit that i m asking a lot by bouncing the signal around from plex  ios airfoil satellite desktop airfoil satellite desktop airfoil airport express  but it seemed to work better before    edit upon further testing  connecting to the stronger  ext network outside and switching to the stronger host network inside was annoying   there is a way to clone the host network name and password to the  ext network so you  see  only one network  but that caused all sorts of havoc of dropped wifi  internet dropouts  inability to access router modem web admin pages   i spent an entire day getting my internet and wifi back up and working after finally disconnecting this thing  sorry  this thing is going back  not ready for primetime      
315,5.0,                       this works exactly as advertised   it is fairly easy to set up  and gives a good signal  also my phone can automatically switch between this extender and my primary router it might take    minutes for you to find the best place to plug it in  but that is time well spent   if you find it isn t working or covering the area you want  try a different location      
316,3.0,                       set up was irritating note  if you need tech support with set up  the model number is not the same as the collection of letters and numbers on the box also  trying to get help is a pain  that may be because they ve furloughed staff during the stay at home orderi did get chat help  eventually  but the chat page disappeared as i used the app  i was mad enough at that point that pure mule headedness kicked in and i figured it out myself      
317,4.0,                       works as expected  nice to have integrated antennas   box is marked as      model re      i get   mbps on    g with the router  tested with iperf  using re    ethernet port     g router has poor signal in my location so i use  g for the repeater frequency   picky stuff   the box indicates speed of    mbps on    g   and    mbps on  g  so    i m wondering why the re    ethernet only supports    mbps       the location of the ethernet port obstructs the adjacent wall plug  see photos   so i had to use a travel adapter which detracts from the nice design      in my setup i d like to disable the wifi repeater   i m only using this as an ethernet port   but the settings don t seem to provide a way to disable wifi repeater   so three things to improve  add gigabit ethernet  move the ethernet port   software update to offer disable wifi repeater      
318,3.0,                       update             increased to three stars  i am using it as an ap now  it works fine in this mode since i can select channel  my previous complaint still stands initial review   i got the re    in order to connect nest outdoor camera at location too far for my wireless router  i got it all hooked up but finding so so performance  i then realize it is using channel   for    ghz band  since i am using channel   for my wireless router this is going to reduce performance all around  tp link needs to provide a way to select the channel and it certainly shouldn t auto select one up from the strongest signal in the area  so disappointed      
319,5.0,                       the main concern i had was people s reviews about the smartphone app setup option  the one with the severe privacy user agreement   i bought the product anyway after searching around for non smartphone setup options  the setup involves connecting via wifi directly to the extender  the range extender wasn t broadcasting when i first powered it up  my next instinct was to do a hard reset  holding the red button for    seconds with a paper clip   after the hard reset  i found the wifi signal and proceeded to access the extender settings through a web browser  as you would when setting up a router the second concern i had were people s reviews about this product dropping connections often  particularly when the device had aged a few months  i haven t experienced any such problems yet  one of the things i do to prevent my devices from confusing the extender and the main router  which is far  but can sometimes appear in range  is to give the extender a wifi broadcast name that is completely different from the one my router is broadcasting  that way  the devices paired with the extender don t attempt to pair with the main router directly  my guess  big guess  i m no expert  is that people s connection dropping may be due to their laptops or smartphones trying to flip back and forth between connecting to the extender and the main router      
320,2.0,                       i won t say there s anything wrong with it  it does what it should  but switching between the networks is cumbersome  if you have homekit   another smart home set up having devices on different networks is an inconvenience  in short   these are ok  but i feel the way to go is mesh  it s a bit more expensive but i would say well worth the investment  i returned the two extender units  and got tp link deco whole home mesh wifi system instead  it was     more  but now all devices  and all smart home lights   accessories are on the same network  and everything flows seamlessly on a single unified network  it s hard to quantity but it seems coverage is better too      
321,5.0,                       i bought this because i purchased a new smart tv and it seemed like the wifi on it had trouble connecting to my router  i was able to install this and hardwire and ethernet cord from this to the tv  it has worked great with zero issues since  i haven t connected any other devices to it other than tv  router is relatively close so no need to really  so i can t tell how it works with multiple devices connected but i would assume it d work just fine  it took   minutes to connect and install  with no issues arising  if you are in need of a wifi extender this product will be perfect for you   i did not need to contact customer support so i left that unreviewed  tp is pretty well known thought and i doubt you would have any issues with support if it were ever needed      
322,5.0,                       i had to buy this as our wifi signal was weak and wouldn t reach my nieces room in order for her laptop to work for her school lessons during covid to be honest  i didn t have high hopes as we had another one that didn t work and do what it should  but after reading reviews  i went with this one i m so glad i did   not only can she now do her lessons on her laptop  but the entire house has a better signal everywhere   i would absolutely buy this again and have already recommended it to a few people      
323,1.0,                       i thought surely the reviews must not be correct as most were so negative   believe them  this is a waste of money  it not only does not extend the wifi signal  it decreases it  i wanted to extend my wifi signal downstairs in a finished basement as the wifi was spotty down there  i also hoped it might extend the wifi to the patio just outside the door  not only does it not extend the wifi  it slows it down  my wifi went from download of    mbps to       mbps when it went through the tp link ac    wifi extender      
324,1.0,                       i use the acl  access control list  as a gatekeeper for my home wi fi   i entered the extenders mac address and the spoofed address it uses into the acl   no luck in connecting   i disabled the acl and the extender worked  but it got very hot to the touch and reduced the speed from   mbps to single digit mbps   with the acl disabled i was bombarded with spam and was hacked   the acl is now enabled  and this extender is in transit back to amazon for a full refund      
325,5.0,                       for     of the people  this is super easy to install    give it your wifi info  and it extends your signal with new ssids  since our  weak spots  still technically have a signal  we kept separate ssids because the devices won t  automatically drop  the weak one  for the  nd device  i m using it as an access point from a lan cable run from my main router  so the set up was different  i fumbled around with it a bit and finally got it to work  once i got it configured right  it works great just like my other one  i now have   different ssids for wi fi which is a little annoying  but i didn t want to spend the money for the mesh networking      
326,4.0,                       this thing works fantastic  we have a medium sized ranch house with a new tp link router that finally replaced our old apple airport  we put up with crappy coverage for too long  can t believe i waited this long to do something about it the extender once paired with the new router now allows wifi out into our backyard and more importantly the garage for streaming good tunes whilst working on projects  great coverage and no complaints on performance only nit  thus the   star rating was setup  i m savvy enough in the electronics world but for some reason setup wasn t entirely seamless  can t recall my exact issue  but needed to reset the extender twice and do a manual setup through the ip config page if memory serves  but  now that it s up and running no worries at all  we ve even unplugged for extended periods doing electrical work on the house and fires right back up every time  nice when something works      
327,5.0,                       i have a detached garage with a wifi enabled garage door opener  which supports amazon key delivery  the problem was that the garage is so far detached from my home and wifi router that it would lose the connection multiple       times every day  i d get alerts through the myq and key apps that  your garage is offline  at all times of the day   night  not only would it be possible to miss my precious deliveries from amazon  but i also couldn t open my garage with my phone while it was offline  so i bought this wifi extender hoping it would extend the wifi to the garage  long story short    it did   all it took was a    minute set up via the tether app  i have a google router   placing the extender in an outlet closer to the garage  and my opener has not lost wifi connection even once in   days   i m very happy  worth every penny      
328,1.0,                        buyer beware   privacy policy very invasive      i was all ready to install this extender and had downloaded the tethering app and then their privacy policy loaded  when i read it i freaked out  they basically said they could use any info that went thru their extender for themselves  their affiliates  their subsidiaries  china  the list of personal info they were giving themselves rights to were everything from name  address  phone numbers  browsing history  purchasing history  including account numbers  it was all fair game and you have to click  i agree  well  i don t agree  i checked on linksys belkin extender policies  nowhere near as invasive as tplink this device is being returned i ll spend my money and keep my privacy  thank you      
329,2.0,                       the product is sleek and goes unnoticed  the easy set up via the tether app was great  unfortunately  from a range and speed perspective  it really leaves a lot to be desired  i have a     mbps connection with a standard att router  we wanted this to help some dead areas in a     sq ft home  it accomplished that but the speeds once connected are horrible  even via the  boost  option   it barely reaches between     mbps when connected to the  ghz wifi connection  i don t get it  there aren t that many options to manage the extender via the app and via the web you get a few more options that do not really help diagnose the speed issue      
330,1.0,                       first one worked for a few hours then would constantly disconnect  would get one antenna maybe two bars for signal strength   the replacement has been on for about    hours now and working well  full strenght on the antenna  huge difference between the two units  addition  replacement unit getting close to    hours working now and still going fine has not dropped connection at all  i m thinking the quality control of these wi fi extenders are managed by clowns      
331,2.0,                       it installed alright   i got this because one bedroom of my house has a poor spot for speed   after installing this  i tried it in   different locations upstairs and downstairs   i got worse speeds than even with just the router  half the speeds even   with the rotuer alone  that bedroom gets around   mbps   sometimes less   after connecting this device  the best i got was   mbps   even that was not consistent   it would drop to    often   now  this is the second one i have tried over the years   neither i tried were worth anything   are these devices a scam      
332,5.0,                       i had a dead spot pretty far away from my router  down some stairs and way in the back of another room   the flat panel tv would constantly buffer  you couldn t use it  i put this in the same outlet of that tv and now the tv works perfectly  clear screen and no buffering   i didn t put it half way between the router and tv like they tell you to do  i literally put it as far away as the tv is   my theory is that the wifi antenna in the tv may not be nearly as good as the one on this extender  i also plugged my tv directly into this extender using a    ethernet cable  a direct connection is always best  which is something many of these extenders don t offer   my outlet is already on the wall behind the tv  so no wires show   last  the lights on the extender are not bright so they don t distract you   really happy with this extender      
333,1.0,                       i tried it in multiple positions and even with a clear shot to my wifi when i connected to this extender the speeds simply were not acceptable at roughly     of what my router could put out  i ended up buying another wifi router and running ethernet to use it as an access point  also this thing was a pain to setup with me wasting a lot of time with the app and browser  which ultimately didn t work  i ended up having to use the old press the button on the wifi router and extender method  which was simple enough but damn i wasted like an hour or two on the other methods for it ultimately to be super slow and useless anyways  wifi extenders feel like a scam  just spend that hour or two running an ethernet cable if you can and using a second router as an access point  much better solution      
334,3.0,                       i would not recommend this wi fi range extender  i have been told that the tp link range extender is the best option out there  the big mistake i made was that i purchased the wrong tp link range extender ac     i in return purchased the tp  link ac      what a big difference  it is the best wi fi range extender that i have purchased  my modem is a spectrum modem but does reach full capacity upstairs      
335,1.0,                       i have mac restrictions on my wi fi router enabled  so when a new wi fi device needs to connect to it i simply look find the mac address of the new device and i add it to the whitelist to allow that device  but to simplify the mac entering i simply   disable the restriction    so that the device connects with no problem  and the router simply lists the mac addresses of the devices that have connected  then i just copy and paste the address to the whitelist  and later re enable the restriction after adding the mac of the re     labeled as such when connected  as seen  and the same  in the box device and router connection listing  it still would not give me internet  so i decided to check if theres another mac and i my router tells me its a da        no vendor id   but i checked and re checked by connecting disconnecting and they show up together and whenever the re    re connects i said ok  i ll just add that  no label  mac to the whitelist restiction and re enabled the restriction  but still no internet conclusion  there is not only one mac  re      there s another which starts with da        no vendor id  and there s at least one other that is connecting to my router question why does tech support deny this what nefarious reasons can they use these hidden mac addresses for how can i determine all mac s tp link is using  possible from windows       
336,1.0,                       this is an update   changing from two star to one star now   i bought this extender after looking over the positive reviews and because i also have a tp link wifi router   after installation  with some troubles   it appeared the wifi signal becomes stronger in certain areas  however  one major problem soon began to appear  wifi signal dropping of   it had never happened before having this extender   basically my iphone suddenly turns to lte mode  using large amount of data   it happens more frequently when two or more cell phones are in use in the same area   i relocated the extender to various locations within the house  without any improvement   i would like to return the device if possible      
337,5.0,                       it took me about    minutes to get this connected and running   i used the wps button on the router   this worked great   btw   i only had a power strip slot available to plug into next to the router to get the set up started   wasn t sure if that would work   but it worked fine   after i moved it to the final location  the wi fi in the extended area worked great   fast and strong      
338,5.0,                       our work wi fi can be spotty sometimes and we run everything on wi fi now  from out point of sale to our music system    it s all wireless so if our wi fi goes wonky  everything starts to act weird  before switching providers i thought i would give an extender a shot first  i didn t want to go all in on an expensive item  so when i saw this model for less than     i went ahead and ordered it  it came today and so far  so good i was a little worried about the installation after reading the reviews here  but when i got it and opened the instructions i saw there were three methods that could be used  i went with putting the app on my phone and going from there  this unit was up and running in less than ten minutes  most of that time was just me re checking to make sure i didn t miss a step first i installed the app  next i plugged the unit into an outlet fairly close to our router  then after it was on and running i connected my phone to the tp link wireless connection  after that i added a password for the extender  then backed out and reconnected to the router wi fi  that was it  the next time i have a moment i will connect all the devices to the extender but i checked their network connections and sure enough  i see the new network option listed and ready to connect to for reference  our business uses a local regional provider called all points broadband  they use cambium products  specifically cnpilot routers access points  our modem is pretty new  less than six months old  and is fairly reliable on its own  i just wanted to improve uptime to     or better if you are not technically inclined  just follow the quick start guide and this extender is a great  cheaper option to improve wi fi coverage in your home or business      
339,1.0,                       i was skeptical when i placed this order and was not disappointed   the repeater continuously acquires and drops the host signal even when placed within   feet of the router   by the time the wifi enabled device reacquires the signal  say  an amazon alexa product   the signal drops again and the process repeats   the alexa isn t the only device with this issue   my ipad also gets sporadic reception     again  when i m using it withinn   feet of the extender  and the extender within   feet of the router    i upgraded the firmware thinking that this might alleviate the issue but no change was noticed   i can t wait to get this back in it s box and returned to amazon for a refund      
340,3.0,                       the quality of the product is good  it was easy to find the app but had a try a few times to get to run on my network  i finally got it to connect on the third try  only issue i have is when i come home it automatically connects to the extender  i have it plugged in upstairs so that it can connect to it when i m upstairs in my room which is about    feet away from my main wifi  the extender sits about    feet away from my main wifi making it the halfway point  when i m upstairs and connected to the extender reception is great and fast  but when i come home and hooks up automically to the extender it tends to be slow and have to go back in my settings to reconnect to my main on when i m downstairs  both are set for automatic log in but for some reason it overrides my main wifi  i will look into it and if i can configure it and figure it out i will update my review      
341,1.0,                       i ended up returning this and bought a netgear wifi range extender for the same price   the tp link device was a disappointment  as sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn t   i ended up contacting their tech support via chat   times  with long waits each time   in the end  we thought a firmware upgrade was the solution  as the version sent by amazon had older firmware  but i was unsuccessful after   tries at getting the latest      firmware onto the device  but surprisingly it updated to a later      version   still the device would only provide a wifi signal for an upstairs pc part of the time   i also rebooted the unit twice   bottom line  i invested a lot of time  and gave up in the end   the netgear unit is working much better and in the end  was easier to program      
342,1.0,                       couldn t be more frustrated   worked quite well for   weeks and now not at all   there is no customer support   have been through multiple set ups to no avail   i suspect that amazon will not approve my review  i find more and more they are censoring poor reviews   i would not purchase this product again and i would not recommend   doesn t seem likely they will accept a return at this point  even though i am  still within the return window   like a naive idiot i threw thr packaging away after a couple weeks   almost lime they have the range extender programmed to work long enough to get you confident enough to throw package away  then the product quits working   shame on me      
343,4.0,                       pros no tech support needed easy to setup  especially if you have a button on your router to pair this with your primary wifi signal      sqft range  multiple devices connected  no issues  peleton works in the garage  wifi security cameras work  i can sit in the front yard and browse internet cons no wifi  but you don t need it in     cases in           
344,5.0,                       well worth purchasingwi fi on  nd floor while television is on  st and there are dense items blocking wi fi signal to tv add that wi fi signals have difficulty communicating between floors and i was having issues with signalstrength and speed  i placed the extender high near  st flr ceiling where signalcould be sent from router through extender to tv with minimum of materials interfering signal is now much better and reliable      
345,1.0,                       unit installed easily and worked well    for about   weeks  and then the trouble started   the unit wasn t receiving the signal from my router unless i moved it withing    feet  which defeats the purpose of an extender   i contacted customer service and they helped me re flash the firmware   unit worked for another week  the failed again   contacted support again and got the run around   agent  blamed my wifi router  even after i explained    times  that all my other devices worked at that distance and greater  so the fault was in the extender   ignored multiple requests to deal with a supervisor  and multiple requests to replace or refund   insisted i change the channels on my wifi router  even after explaining i did not have that access   if appears the goal is to waste customers  time  about three hours for me  until they give up   it worked   i cannot afford to spend any more time on a     device   i will find a different extender    any suggestions out there      
346,5.0,                       ordered this despite negative reviews about the set up process   i am not tech savvy and i was able to have this completely set up and working within a matter of minutes  the wifi signal in my bedroom has always been poor and we ve struggled with watching tv in our room as a result  the wofi strength went from poor to fair  i know to some this may not be that great  however  we did not place the extender very close to our room l to maximize wifi in more than just one area of the house  will report back if i begin having issues  but so far  so good      
347,2.0,                       the undocumented  proxy mode  changes the mac addr of devices which are connected to the ac    from their real mac addr while this may not affect may sites  it does for me as i use dhcp reservations for my devices to get specific ip addrs to use with my firewall my firewall will not allow multiple mac addrs to have the same ip addr on dhcp reservations   so i end up with different access capabilities when connected to my main ap and to the ac    no way to turn off  proxy mode   with the current firmware tp link doesn t see  proxy mode  as am issue      
348,3.0,                       the set up on this device was unnecessarily difficult   the website url didn t work  the ip only worked once  and the app for my phone was an utter disaster    i m an it guy so this was within my wheelhouse  once set up the coverage is excellent and the through put is really good for the price point   i get     mbps download when connected directly to my router modem   with the range extender that drops to     mbps  but if you need more then     mbps you re are in a very small minority  and it     mbps better in the  room that had no coverage at all overall it s worth it but the set up could be a lot simpler      
349,5.0,                       i absolutely love this range extender  i switched it to be a wireless bridge by connecting it to ethernet downstairs as my router is upstairs and in the opposite corner of my home  i have previously run ethernet to all rooms of my home  but wifi was an issue downstairs and furthest away from my router  i hard wire everything possible  but for things like phones and tablets it works great in my dead zone  and it just so happens that my ring doorbell was right on the edge of that dead zone causing intermittent connectivity to my router  this product remedied those problem   and now i have flawless connectivity to my ring doorbell as well  great product and great price       
350,1.0,                       this thing is a total piece of junk  the signal that came out of it was so slow nothing worked  the signal couldn t pass through a brick wall    ft  away  the     ghz signal is as slow as the old dial up and the   ghz signal isn t any good unless your standing in the same room as the device and it was slower than the     ghz signal on my router  what a waste of time and money  another amazon miss  i guess i ll burn my gas  use my tape  and my printer  with my paper to repackage  print a label  and take this thing to the ups store to return it  seems like i am returning most of the junk i buy off of amazon these days      
351,4.0,                       i will start off by saying that this product does help out with wifi dead zones by increasing the range  the speeds  however  are not very close to what the router and ethernet give me naturally       and     mbps  respectively   through the wifi extender  i am getting around        mbps  which is passable  but no where near the expected speeds  that being said  it was easy to install  if you aren t in need of  fast  wifi         this extender will be perfect for you     
352,5.0,                       i don t often write reviews  but every once in a blue moon  i buy something that completely blows my mind in the best way possible  for context  i live in a separate  walled off section in the back of a house that i rent  and in my section of the house  there are no modems  routers  ethernet cables  nothing  i had just recently bought a new computer to use at home but found that the wifi would give me  at best  internet speeds of around    mb s and  at worst     mb s while being very unstable also  however  i noticed that just outside my room in the kitchen  i would be able to get internet speeds of      mb s  that s when i decided to buy this wifi extender  set up is a breeze  i thought i would have had to go ask the homeowner to go to his router  plug in the extender next to the router  press the wps buttons  etc  this is one way that you could set it up  but it also gives you the option to set it up through your browser or through tp link s tether app  i chose to do the latter  all i had to do was plug in the extender into an outlet in my own room  find the extender s name on the tether app  then choose which networks to extend  and it ll automatically create the extended networks  it s that simple  didn t have to go through all the hassle of going to the homeowner  especially in this pandemic  now the extended network gives me internet speeds of    mb s with vpn on       mb s with vpn off  while being stable at the same time  this is definitely one of the best investments i ve made in a long time      
353,5.0,                       worked as described   i ended up setting up the extender as a separate network for the extreme area of the house where i was getting  one bar  from the router   once i did it  i now get full set of bars on the extender indicator for those of you like me with limited experience  make sure your extender is connect and set up with password and being used that way otherwise it only shows the  on  light which doesn t mean a router connection   i had to go through several tries to get it connected due to my lack of working knowledge   i now get set full bars on both router and extender from where they are probably    feet from each other   i am now able to look at youtube videos and others without interruption or delays   very satisfied   if at first it doesn t work keep trying different alternatives before returning it as a defective item      
354,5.0,                       great product that works as advertised  i received the re    and read the instructions  after down loading the app i had it up and running in less than    minutes  my house is long and i was able to eliminate the dead zones at the end of my house and even get a nice   or   bar signal in the upstairs where there was previously no signal  it s like having the whole house wired for internet   i even connected it to my old router from frontier to check compatibility  it worked great  but it really made the cheap frontier router seem even slower and less capable so i purchased a tp link ac     router and set my frontier router to bridge mode and wow what an improvement  it s a match made in heaven  it is super easy to configure all of the tp products from the app and not have to use a browser  i love it  if you need to use a browser however you can and all of the instructions are in the booklet  i fully recommend the re    especially if it is paired with another tp router      
355,3.0,                       easy to install  but all the tp link stuffs are perhaps gimmick while range increased  speed improvement was    the mentioned speeds is not what you will get out of this avoid if u want to game or watch  k videos meh   buyers remorse  it s okay for browsing  not okay for gaming  no speed improvement than using without any extender for my setup which is far away from router     
356,1.0,                       precis  gave absolutely no increase in speed and  in some test cases  likely internet variation  showed a    decrease in speed description  regional monopoly inhibits choice in isps  so the most reliable provider here  at a reasonable cost  provides only    mbps  which typically streams at about       forty feet away from the router  down an open hall with a slight bend  with open hallway and office door  are two office computers  one a mac  the other a pc  both with up to date wifi cards  and both running ssds  with       ram   internet speed at this short distance from the router is only     of speeds near the router   the tp link  which set up easily  was plugged into an outlet about    feet from the router  with a near direct line to the office   absolutely no difference in internet speed   none   but the lights on the tp link sure make it look professional      
357,4.0,                       i bought this to connect our tv to our wifi  the tv is in one corner of the house and our router was in the other  the instructions seemed to imply that you could just connect it to the router and then move it to another outlet  this was not true for us  it showed us connected to the extension  but we didn t have any internet  luckily using the manufacturer s tether app fixed it and we can now stream on our smart tv better than ever installation was easy once we had the app      
358,1.0,                       delayed data from beginning but i lived with it for   months  then it went to no internet   contacted chat support   slow to respond from chat to chat    like   minutes   told them wanted a replacement or refurbished   made me tried moving it closer  are lights green  is the source on  reset   etc   after   hour  i lost my patience and left the chat   bit the bullet and vowed myself to not to buy tp link again since can t return without them giving you an rma      
359,5.0,                       we have four people in our household currently working schooling from home and using the wifi  our house is not large but there are a lot of walls and doors  and the bedrooms where my kids use their school chromebooks have never gotten great reception  i didn t really know what i needed to buy  but the reviews on this extender made me give it a try  it was cheap and such an easy setup   it was working about   minutes after i opened the box  both kids noticed a difference immediately  and it helped with a weird corner of my bedroom that had always had unreliable reception  i should have tried this sooner      
360,3.0,                       super easy to install  definitely not rocket science  the tether app is an app that is used to make the installation process so easy and seemless  i had it up and going in under    minutes my only complaint is with the  g wifi signal  this extender does not give the best signal so i would not recommend it for someone looking to use it to extend their wifi for security cameras  etc    other than that  really a great product  worth the small investment      
361,5.0,                       i am so happy with this product   we can finally watch tv in our living room  our only previous wi fi dead spot in the whole house   after years of using our ipads to watch movies or having to watch tv in the cold basement  we can now have normal family movie nights in the living room   a few years ago  i had tried the netgear extender  but it only worked for a few minutes after a crazy and difficult set up  this one was easy to install after i read the instructions  along with a number of amazon reviews that gave installation tips  i couldn t believe it when all the lights on this extender lit up when i plugged it into one of my living room outlets   i had absolutely no hope it would actually work    it was a very happy moment for me   i no longer have to hear moans and groans from my family when we get a tv notification in the middle of a movie saying we don t have enough wi fi to continue it   no more hearing   mommy  i hate this tv     to which i always reply   it s not the tv s fault  it s the internet        
362,5.0,                       i bought this to help extend my mother s wifi connection from the router to her living room  it works perfectly i have a tplink router  but unfortunately it s an older model so i can t test the one mesh network  if a repeater is all that you need though  it s an excellent fitworks as a repeater though  when i eventually get an updated router that is one mesh compatible  i will update this review      
363,5.0,                       before i decided to purchase the tp link ac    wifi extender  re      i did some research online and read some reviews  i certainly trust reviews from cnet more than other online sites as they are very professional  the tp link ac    wifi extender  re     was on top of their reviews and with an unbeatable price  there was no say about getting it  i had my  work from home temporary office  set up in the basement but the wireless signal i was getting from my router  which is set on the main floor  was very weak and the connection kept on dropping quite often to the point of frustration  after connecting this wifi extender  the signal boosted remarkably and i have not seen any more signal failures  i attached pictures of both the signal strengths for illustration  the set up was very easy and in less than    minutes  it was done business  the instructions are very easy to follow  i used the wps button connection choice which seemed to be pretty straight forward  and if your router is dual band  you can have both signals extended  i have the regular  g and also  g and you can choose whichever extended signal suits you better  the extender itself is pretty small and compact  the led indicators are great and guide you easily  one important thing when relocating the wifi extender is to set it where it receives a strong signal from the source router  the led light changes to red when it is too far from the source router  this is a great feature  no doubt      
364,5.0,                       we use a mobile netgear nighthawk router so it can go with us when we travel   unfortunately with that flexibility comes a very small range of signal   my kids were constantly stealing the router and moving it around the house with them to game and online schooling was a struggle because only the child in the room with the box had clear service   not anymore   one of these boxes solved our problem   our router is in a central location downstairs   this extender is directly above it and easily covers the upper level of our home   my son downloaded the app and had it set up within minutes      
365,4.0,                       i bought this in hopes that it might help my computer load web pages faster if the signal i got was a bit stronger  this definitely improved the signal strength  but i also noticed  like other reviewers  that the internet load speed decreased when using this  if you re looking for something to help a device get a better signal  this works fine  but do not expect faster internet speeds  it was very easy to setup though  only took me about      minutes once i figured out what i was doing      
366,4.0,                       i was getting extremely irritated with my video doorbell which suddenly kept losing connection after   years of good service  i decided to try a wifi extender and this was ranked very highly for value and performance by a third party so far so good  after   weeks  it s still doing what i wanted it to do  maintain my video doorbell s connection   it was very easy to set up  though a bit confusing at first because you have to set up a password for the app as well as individual passwords for each extender you install  and remember your own wifi password through the whole process   everything is done through the app  and the app is very simple to use  you do need to have a pencil handy to jot down all those names and passwords  and when you go to connect a device  you connect it to the extender  not to your wifi   so that was a little confusing also  and good to know up front  i initially connected my doorbell to my wifi  thinking this product was just a signal booster  and was frustrated it still didn t work  but when i connected it to the extender it worked fine i really like that you can custom name each extender  upstairs  basement  etc   so you can easily identify each one inside the app and don t have to remember the product code or serial number   i also love that there at no parts  no cords  no extras  no need to find a table  this makes it perfect for hallways  like your upstairs hallway to serve all the bedrooms  i didn t give it   stars because i can t measure the signal  so i don t know if it s  strong   i just know it works  also i don t recommend trying to set this up yourself if you re not petty fluent in smart phone app tech  i e   don t send it to your elderly parents  go and set it up for them  at     i m pretty fluent and it still had me confused until i figured out what it was actually trying to tell me  that s when i had to go back and redo the whole process and write all my passwords down and reconnect to the extender signal   this is one of those products where the instructions are technically clear  but you need to understand the whole process before you start  it makes the whole thing easier      
367,1.0,                       i am pretty knowledgeable with tech stuff  this item may have been returned and was not ready to be installed configured  in my attempt to follow directions on the enclosed paperwork  i found myself on a website that offered help  but ended up being an off shore sales person wanting to get control of my laptop to see what the issue was  don t ever let anyone get control of your computer  i decided to further investigate on my own  this is when i reset the range extender and was able to set it up with my router  this was necessary because someone had already set it to be used by a previous owner  after setting it up  i was very disappointed in the range of the range extender  it was weak in receiving my router signal  and it was weak sending out a signal  i am sending it back  and will look for a better rated product      
368,3.0,                       ok number one  it does work  it does extend the signal beyond your normal range  you might have to work to find a plug that is in a good location to extend the signal from but again it works  there is some lag every now and again and of course the speed is not what you see out of the router but that is to be expected  i dont game so i cant speak to that extent but we have no real issues watching netflix hulu  have another pc going  a tablet and   phones connected not so easy to setup  i followed the instructions which were not great and it took me   tries  i had to press the little tiny reset button for the device   you don t have to be in it to set this up but if your not familiar with electronic devices or do not have patience this may be something you need help with overall its ok  its what i would hope for for the price that i paid      
369,5.0,                       so far the tp link ac    re    dual band wifi extender       release  has worked great and suits my needs perfectly it s small and visually appealing so you don t need to worry about hiding a bulky or ugly device  it actually resembles an plugin oil diffuser like a lot of us might have   it is very light weight so it shouldn t sag from the outlet when plugged in  you will lose an outlet plug and if that s a problem you can always use an extension cord and put it where ever you want  the front of the re    boasts   easy to understand leds informing you of its status  power  ethernet  wifi      ghz and   ghz bands  and a wps button  the bottom of the device has a high speed rj   ethernet port  this is absolutely golden for wired devices  and a reset button which is recessed so you don t have to worry about accidentally pushing it and ensuring that you have to mean it when you do use that feature  it is supposed to work with any wifi router  the mobile app and web user interface also give you management options like enabling the high speed mode  restricting particular devices for a specified amount of time and it even lets you turn off the leds if they might disturb your sleep or distract you  i personally have not used the extra features as of yet but they sound like they might be pretty useful  especially being able to turn off the leds  i think everyone has noticed blinking lights from various devices and they can be super annoying if they re in your bedroom or visible when you re trying to focus the re    was very simple to set up with easy to follow step by step directions in the box  which guide you through the process and inform you about your options for setup  wps  mobile app  web ui   where to find the app  a qr code for the app  this is also printed on the box  and the web ui address for setup if you opt to use a computer instead of the app or wps feature  i chose to use the app which is also very simple which made the process all the more enjoyable  all you have to do is follow the on screen prompts and it goes smoothly  it has you setup your     ghz and   ghz wifi bands separately as they each have a password although it s usually the same and it s also true that not all networks are dual band  i didn t have a single problem during setup  it was quick and painless the only setup issue i did have was mine  in my haste to get the re    going  i didn t rename the extender s wifi signal to match my home network so it caused conflicts with my iot devices that were trying to talk to each other because the network is password protected and i had actually created a second password protected network  this caused some communication issues  the instructions even tell you that you may want need to do this but i was in a hurry so i could get other things done and overlooked that  once the signal was renamed and the password set to match the original network it worked great and without issue  this was very easy to do within the mobile app but could also be easily done using a laptop or desktop computer i bought this to solve an issue with a device i got a great deal on  i stumbled upon a used sony media streaming bluray player for      i couldn t believe it and couldn t pass it up  i didn t really need it but i was tired of using my phone or laptop to stream movies and video to my bedroom tv  it was always a hassle and the only alternative was a wired connection directly to the tv and that in itself was a pain and more so if i wanted to play any of the discs that i have since my laptop doesn t have a built in disc player and i have to connect the usb br dvd cd player  the problem was that the player required a wired network connection and not wireless  i can t complain since it was practically free  i don t know about you but my house does not have wired ethernet  i could do that myself but it s time consuming and the money needed cancels any value in my purchase  in fact  it probably would have exceeded the cost of a brand new media player and i didn t want to make that kind of investment just to get a media player on the network  my tv is a few years old and it doesn t have wifi or smart apps itself and i m not ready to spend a few hundred just to get that kind of experience there either  not when i can work around it for much less  this network extender allowed me to connect the bluray player to the network using a spare network cable that was laying around from an old printer or maybe it was an outdated gateway from an internet old service provider  regardless  the cable was brand new in the package and all i had to do was plug it into the tp link re    extender and my bluray player and bam the player was on the network and asking me to install updates  to top it all off  the wifi signal in my bedroom is much stronger and everything using the re    signals have a much more reliable signal  that s not to say my arris gateway didn t give me a good signal to begin with  it s just a stronger signal the speed of the tp link re    ac    wifi extender works great for watching prime videos in hd  i get full     p just fine  there is always a loading delay but i think that s the player which is a few years old so the memory and processor speed is not top of the line but it was     so again i m not complaining  if you plan on watching  k ultra video  you may want to do some research to see if the tp link re    ac    wifi extender meets your needs speed wise  but it claims     mbps for   ghz and     mbps for the     ghz bands which should be fast enough but it s not gigabit speed for sure  i don t have a gigabit speed router so it wasn t a concern  my tv isn t  k ultra capable so i didn t worry one bit about it  i did notice that when i watched a movie using the amazon prime app on the player  it checked the connection speed and displayed the result and it s exactly what i see on my samsung galaxy s   on the home wifi so the re    does not seem to be slower than the arris gateway my network is running on to begin with and the only speed issues i ever see are when too many devices are simultaneously using too much bandwidth  multiple hd tvs  cell phones  laptops  remote set top boxes  etc   first world problems   am i right  the only solution there is a faster internet connection and router which hasn t been necessary and saves money and even if i did upgrade i think this wifi extender would still suit my needs      
370,1.0,                       this device works fine as an extended  however the company cannot be trusted  after buying this thing and using it with no issues for a year  suddenly they change it to require a cloud login  no company should be allowed to sell you a standalone device  and then decide later on that they want more profit and force you into a cloud account so they can track you and your data usage so they can sell it do not buy products from shady companies  do not support the endlessly increasing number of companies who want to track you and sell all your data      
371,1.0,                       was excited to get this and set it up with all the working from home going on  the set up was easy and then the app  they push using their app  has you sign off on a privacy policy giving them access to any and everything that comes across your internet  uh  no thank you  i understand my internet provider has that  but to have a third party accessing that to sell off to other parties  nope  sent this back immediately  got a refund and just bought extenders from my internet provider  albeit at a much higher price  as sometimes it s better to go with the devil you know than the one you don t      
372,4.0,                       the set up was a little difficult with this   i went through the set up and it said it was complete and ready to go   i moved it to an outlet to help extend our wifi and i couldn t connect through the internet   i did the set up a second time and then it worked great this gives us better coverage of our wifi and it has a good connection speed   the set up issue is my only complaint   stars      
373,4.0,                       the signal is definitely boosted and tested faster on speed test   however it does no good streaming iptv in fact worse than the signal i am trying to amplify you have to connect to the extender to get the amplified signal  example   home network is your wifihome network    ghz ext is your little tp link extender that connects to home network so in order to get the amplified signal  in my case  i connect my firestick to home network    ghz extrun speed test  super  a big boost and noticeable faster speeds than being connected to home network as soon as i launch my iptv app  on firestick   and stream that s the end of it my cell phone connected to home network    ghz ext just fine and was able to browse and even stream the same app as on my firestick just fine without any buffering  but it can do that anyway on the original networkmaybe it s just the firestick but having a hard time believing that   i have another one that works in another room with about the same wireless speeds so for my intentions this did not work well for me  stream iptv well tonight paints a different picture   everything is working fine cool      
374,5.0,                       i purchased this wifi extender as my wifi coverage on the opposite side of the house from the router is a bit weak  after receiving my extender i went through the install process and the extender had trouble finding my signal  after several attempts i called tech support and unfortunately they didn t offer much help  i continued trying and finally got the extender connected this extender does a fantastic job of boosting my wifi signal  my signal is      and i no longer have issues on that side of the house  if you have weak wifi spots in your home  i would strongly suggest purchasing this extender       
375,4.0,                       works well  but the latest version of the firmware actually removes the option to disable broadcast of both wireless networks   we actually use these only to provide a wired connection in an area currently only served by wireless   so  we don t actually use the wireless  repeater  option   in previous firmwares  you could turn off both  ghz and    ghz repeating    so that it did not broadcast an ssid at all   that way  you could use the wired ethernet port without re broadcasting wifi if you didn t want to   in the latest firmware  you can only turn off  ghz or    ghz  but not both we ve worked around it by turning one off and hiding the ssid of the second that has to stay on    but we d rather have the original functionality back to be able to disable both      
376,5.0,                       i bought this to help my coworkers and myself gain a stronger signal in our breakroom from a public wifi signal around the corner from our breakroom   the public signal is weak in the breakroom   i added this booster nearest to the public wifi in our breakroom   what a difference it made   both of the dual bands are max strong in our breakroom   everybody can now use the public wifi system and save their data   there have been  no  issues with disconnections   there are usually about   people at a time in the breakroom   it handles everyone s connection with no problems   i now intend to buy another one for my home the app works great and is very easy to use   you can choose to create your own password  or it offers to use the same password as you use on the signal you are boosting i highly recommend this product      
377,1.0,                       we followed every instruction several times through   we had other more  techy  people try setting it up   every time it got to the final stage of set up it would say that it couldn t detect a wifi signal  even though it had no problem when we started the process    grrrr        disappointed that it doesn t do what it claims to do as the description claims we ended up buying  a larger   more expensive tp link which worked the first time and has worked well for over a month now   i guess bigger and better is just that      
378,1.0,                       this device is not as it advertised   it is advertised as a dual band up to     mbps device   right next to my router where instructions say to set this device up i average around     mbps with out this device   i tested this device before moving it and received only    mbps   when i moved it farther away halfway between our  dead spot  and the router i was down around    mbps   even at    its only giving me   percent of the advertised speed capability   i worked with the settings and all those did was make it worse   contacted tech support and received   assistance   according to them its working as expected   either the advertisement is wrong or tech support is wrong   this is a quick return for me      
379,1.0,                       an absolute nightmare to set up  i went through every option for set up in the included instruction manual  and not one worked  i will say that the instruction manual is written in clear  concise  grammatically correct english  which i appreciate  but whatever i tried  i was not able to connect this wifi extender  despite having all of the correct equipment to do so  i contacted customer service and first tried the  live chat  option  which was an absolute joke  the computer you are typing to cannot recognize full sentences and will give you a list of options to choose from to help you  from the few words that you re allowed to type  ridiculous  that was no help whatsoever  so i called the     number which the instruction manual gave  and was on hold for an hour  with repeated interruptions telling me to use the amazing  live chat  option  so  i stayed on hold  and after one hour of waiting  i was hung up on  i m returning this thing  it s utterly useless  as is the company s so called customer service      
380,5.0,                       was having trouble getting wifi back to kids rooms  even after had router moved to central location in house   was reluctant on trying the various extenders  bought this for the price just to see and after two days it s working great   one room that couldn t hold a zoom mtg was good all day and tried this in on another side of house for a kid to hardwire gaming into the ethernet port and that worked great too   once i downloaded the app and setup the account  everything else was easy install   so far so good   i ordered a  nd to flank both sides of house      
381,1.0,                       i have a very consistent issue with this device  every once in a while  i am unable to connect to internet  and i have to reset it or unplug it to make it work sometimes  my desktop and phone work  and at the same time my work laptop don t have internet  or the other way around and i need to take another reset and unplug ordeal again every time i reset it or changed it s network name  i need to pair it up with all my smart devices all over the technical support team told me to move it closer to router   the problem persists  and worse than that  the wifi range gets diminished   the speed is slower i live in a basement  the router is right on my upper floor the original speed i got when i had it in my room was    mpbs after i followed their advice to put it closer to router i only get   bars of signal strength down here this device really suck      
382,5.0,                       i am very pleased with this tp link product as it works flawlessly and without any problems  the software is very simple to operate and to setup and configure the device which in my case is the tp link ac    wifi range extender  i live in a   story      square foot house and this tp link extender has brought great wifi signal to every phone and computer in the house and a really nice feature is after you have configured it by your router you then unplug it and use the app and keep plugging it in to different dead spots away from the router until the application tells you to close to the router or to far away and that is a great feature for discovering the best possible spot for it s placement to work at it s best and to top that off the tp link company emailed me persnally to ask about my experience with the product which is also to me a great part of a company with great customer service  thank you tp link  a completely satisfied customer      
383,1.0,                       this is a common problem i see in wifi extenders  especially the cheap kind  but this one worked great for like a solid two weeks  then suddenly stopped doing its job  it was weird  good thing it stopped working within the return period cause that s exactly what i did  i returned it and invested in the google nest wifi router and points  i waited for a costco sale or amazon sale and got it for a good deal  the google nest wifi router and points have been working great      
384,1.0,                       we purchased this extender to give us better coverage in further out areas   it reaches those areas with no problem   the issue is that it constantly drops the wifi signal   we have to unplug and replug at least once every    hours to reestablish our internet connection   amazon has been no help in getting another unit and sent us to the manufacturer which of course is no help either   if you re looking for reliable internet  this extender isn t going to be the one for you      
385,2.0,                       not much of an extender  i am trying to get coverage      from existing router  after multiple tries at different ranges  had to locate extender about     from existing wifi for it to connect at all  now have great wifi where i already had great wifi  very marginal improvement where i needed it  now add the pita of having to switch wifi networks for a slightly more solid connection  i have a wifi security camera over      from existing router  it connects no problem but the extender could not  guess they are using cheap low gain antennas in the extender      
386,2.0,                         stars because it does work  but doesn t really help much due to it s limited range  my main router is the tp link archer c   the white one   which has very good range  however in my garage  the signal is not as strong as i liked for my security camera  so i was trying to improve that with this wifi extender  using the extender makes the situation worse  now there are skipped frames in the video live stream  so i just unplugged it and not use it because i was too busy to deal with it  now i finally have some time to play with it again  i tried using it in access point mode just to test its range  at about    feet away through a couple of walls  i am only getting speeds of  around   mbps  compared to the full speed of     mpbs for my main router at the same distance and location  unfortunately it s now past the return period  there might be some limited situation where i can make use of this device in access point mode  so i ll just hang on to it      
387,5.0,                       prior to buying the tp link ac     i was not sold on wifi extenders as they never worked as advertised  the tp link ac    is an exception to the rule  the setup wasn t as fluid as i liked as many of the set up options did not work  i was thankful for all the suggested set up options as a few didn t execute  my extender was placed in a room approximately    ft  from my router and obstructed by several walls  at first it seemed that the extender wasn t transmitting a strong signal  after about   minutes  the signal solidified and the results have been as if i was next to the router itself  this is an inexpensive and solid product given other connection alternatives    stars      
388,4.0,                       this works pretty well for me  but i did have to try it in     locations before i found the best one   very easy to install   but what they didn t say was       if you have  g and  g like i do  set the extender to  g   also  on my ipad  under  wifi connection   i realized i had to set it to the extender  listed as wifi  g ext    without that it wouldn t work right   once i did that  i was fine   but if you have a big house you might want to get something more powerful      
389,1.0,                       so i really  really wanted to like this product  i use a tp travel router when out on the road for secure wifi in the hotel and hoped i would be as pleased with this product  actually bought    one for my workout room at one end of the house  where i stream with a firestick tv and one for the opposite end of the house where my wife steams her youtube videos  the side of the house where my wife watches receives a medium signal  with buffering while watching videos  i get a much better signal my side  but with the occasional buffering so upon receipt i only opened one device and set it up  was moderately easy to set up  but there were some challenges that had to be overcome  primarily with the tp network  regardless i got there when fully up and running went down to my wife s end of the house  plugged into the wall outlet about half way to her room and linked up  with her chromebook  after settling down the signal went to medium  to very good then back to medium  the thing keeps going back and forth randomly  tried it on  g and  g  the  g seems to work best  but again it stays mostly at medium signal strength attempted to gain a possible better position by plugging into an outlet in her room  no difference  strong light signals on the unit  but not really any better signal strength than when not using the extender so  took the unit to the other end of the house and tried it  my exercise room is about the same distance away from the router  located in the middle of the house up high about  ft    but upstairs and above it  signal strength without the extender is very good  with the extender      very good  no difference  on the firestick i m able to cycle between the  g   g and  g ext and see the signal strength  all three show the same signal strength based on what i ve observed so far it looks like i ve wasted my money      
390,1.0,                       this review is regarding the tp link ac     re      new version ordering and receiving the device okay so i have connectivity issues with some devices in my home and if you are reading this  you most likely have the same issue  more specifically  i wanted to connect my ps  to a  ghz network extender via ethernet cable for faster download speeds as the original ps  only supports     ghz  i ordered this extender because it states that it is dual band and supports  ghz frequency with max speeds of up to    mbps as the description states  that being said  the box states hat the max speed   ghz  is     mbps  right  that s the first clue setup this part was very simple and straight forward  tp link has an app which makes things very simple to setup  i had no issues navigating the app and setting up the extender with my home wi fi  the device also has a wps button for quick connection to your home network  but i can t comment on that as i didn t use this feature for the initial setup  after setup i updates the firmware as i always do with all devices i initially setup  the firmware version i am running as of this date is        build          rel        testing speeds here s where things go to crap  my home router is only about    feet away from the extender  the signal strength is at full bars  i tested the ac    extender for both    ghz and  ghz  moreover  in the tp link app  under  tools   it shows an option for  high speed mode   the descriptions is as follows  router to extender in  ghz only and extender to client in    ghz only  my professional background in it work immediately triggered my it senses  at this point it s more then a tingle  i performed multiple speed tests  tests were performed with the  high speed mode  on and off  i performed speed tests on both the     ghz and  ghz frequencies   the results were very poor  fastest speeds achieved were under the  ghz frequency at     mbps  each test was performed   times to ensure that the speeds were generally accurate  i then performed speed tests on my home  ghz network for comparison and to make sure that the network was functioning properly  i have taken screen shot outlining all my findings  please see the pictures attached to my review conclusion do not buy this extender if you are looking for a fast  ghz extender  this is not the one to get and you will be thoroughly disappointed  tp link is misinforming the public by marketing this device as being able to reach speeds of     mbps  it doesn t even come close  as stated above  the highest speed achieved was      mbps  so  do yourself a favor and don t buy this extender      
391,5.0,                       i have been using several different devices over the years for attaching non wifi enabled devices to a wifi network  i have tried netgear  iogear  and now this ip link device that doubles as a wifi signal extender booster  netgear and iogear were more complicated to set up and they were not always reliable  this ip link device has an app called tether  that makes setting it up a breeze   i read all the positive reviews and am so glad i bought it   once connected to my network  i plugged in my non wifi device to the rj    ethernet jack at the bottom of this wifi extender and boom  instant network connection simple to setup  and more importantly  it works like it should      
392,5.0,                       this product was shipped fast and arrived as expected   thanks to the wps feature  set up was very easy and fast   i let the unit sit in an outlet near the router for roughly   minutes before engaging   from pressing the wps button  it took roughly   minutes to connect  set up and for the light to become solid   once moved to the middle dead zone area and plugged into an outlet  the xxxx ext network signal was quickly established   my distantly located device  outdoor camera  found the signal and began working again  re establishing the network connection using my original network password was required  the signal strength is not    bars   did not measure actual speed  but sufficient for the application required in my case   happy with the purchase      
393,5.0,                       these devices seem to have great and horrible reviews  so it was risky buying it   but in our case  it has worked great and i wish we would have had it years ago i didn t know there were wifi options like this out there   so glad to discover it  especially with the whole family home in      doing work   school online we placed the extension wifi on the  nd floor on the opposite side of the regular wifi and it s working great   the reception on the opposite ends of the house is now much better      
394,1.0,                       i figured   thousand reviews couldn t be wrong  it had to work  plugged in the unit to a wall socket and  silly me  thought that was all i needed to do  then wife said  you have to read the manual  okay  did that  didn t work  name showed up in network option list  but no indication of what to do after that  so  manual didn t help at this stage  so  used online chat  tech told me  download tether app from app store  couldn t find it  i m a busy guy  really not interested in chasing the tail of this product  even if it s only       on amazon  so looking for other options  but thought  hey    thousand reviews can t be wrong      
395,5.0,                       i ve tried orbi  eero  and google home   none of them had the comprehensive controls that the re    has which allow you to make changes to your settings to fit your individual network environment   you also have the option of using the re    wirelessly or with a wired network   while the tether app could be a little smoother  i m sure tp link will improve on it as they go   with onemesh  i have one wifi network throughout my home  and in the garage and outdoors  that my phones and devices connect to automatically as i move around   i love this system      
396,1.0,                       installation was easy  i have around   mbps down running from my wi fi without the extender  i set the extender up  downloaded the latest firmware  plugged this up right next to my router and it gets a maximum of    mbps down  i then plugged this up in one room over from my router and i get     signal with    mbps down  i then tested it all around my home in different locations and found that my router actually reaches farther than the extender will  this unit is advertising a maximum of     down on the  ghz band and i can t get no where near close to the speeds i get without it  this unit also is also advertising      square feet of signal  but i get a     signal loss from about    feet away from my router  i have searched online on how to fix this with no luck      
397,1.0,                       i bought this hoping to get wifi in my garage because our current wifi drops to nothing as soon as you walk into my mudroom  i saw claims of it working in giant      sq  ft  homes  my house is      sq  ft  and the garage is   feet away fro my house  i tried plugging it into an outlet in my mudroom  and it had a red light  so i moved it to the next closest outlet barely    feet from the mudroom outlet  i have a green light  cool  i thought  i walk into my mudroom  wifi bars start fluctuating rapidly    bars  then   bars    bars    bars  it can t make up it s mind  garage was a total loss of signal  basically  this did nothing  i need something because i don t get cell service where i am at and my husband is a first responder  we are depending on wifi calling      
398,3.0,                       this is a good extender with a good range  the ability to have it direct traffic the way you want   g from the router to extender only then    g to the devices only  makes it really nice  drawbacks are you cannot configure which wifi channel it uses  tplink says it will use the same channel as the router but that s bs  mine is stuck on channel   onemesh is garbage  rather than simply mimicking a single network it uses a specific protocol that individual devices have to support  your echo speaker group will not work  it also causes lots of latency as devices seem to constantly switch between connection points  it s really crap  don t enable it      
399,1.0,                       our current internet before purchasing this extender was slow  especially on the second floor of our house  after installing the extender i was hoping for less buffering with our tv shoes and faster speed on our tablets and computers  however  nothing changed  our speed is still extremely slow and we still have to sit through buffering during every show we watch  this extender didn t help at all      
400,1.0,                                 i was very excited to get this product until i realized it doesn t do what is advertised  not happy with my purchase  immediately started the return process see attached photo   the tp link ac    was wired to my xbox and got a download of      mbps and upload of      mbps   the wireless connection from my router got a download of       mbps and upload of      mbps the tp link ac    actually made my internet connection slower      
401,5.0,                       so far  nothing but i m not taking credit for the effectiveness of this little piece of tech  previous reviews were pretty clear on its limitations no  it doesn t see through lead no  it can t write in cursive legibility    d    z  and   g  are fun to write  though and unfortunately  no  it won t deliver pizza to     and    th but forgiveness is divine and i ve found plenty of redemption because i got a wireless extender to extend an existing comcast gateway  modem router   and it works well for that purpose and the install was less than    minutes i read the reviews that said the app didn t work   my experience was fairly painless   plug in near the router   download app on mobile device sign up for an account  name your tplink extender set password  the same as your router if you aren t concerned about dual band mixing with devices or use the default  yourexistingroutername ext    relocate to where you have a dead spot and look for the happy little green lights  or sad little red non existent lights and move closer   app will be mildly helpful if you need to relocate or run speedtestsi really appreciated the ability to set a timer on the status lights to turn off at night  nothing is more convenient than not having to see hal and the rest of the technological community from      forward pulsing all night long reminding me that i have too much stuff connected across the property silver lining   i didn t succumb to the pod mesh money pit   apologies to my isp  they do look terribly precious but not  pk for      precious  all in all  i got stream the live action tmnt during this review for a little bit  saved enough cash to buy a pizza to celebrate a solid purchase  and haven t messed anything up   yet tp link wins  so i win   in your face           
402,5.0,                       so far this thing has been stable compared to a more expensive four antenna extender that keeps on dropping signal  easy to install as well and i now have      signal strength the only thing is from the repeater with  ghz i m only getting about half the speed of what the extended router can give  but my cameras that needed the signal from outside don t need the high speed  what it needed is the strong signal and that is what s important to me      
403,1.0,                       this product works when you get it connected but the problem is connecting it  i had to use   different devices to get it to work and when i tried to connect it with my cell    my phone went haywire and started rebooting every time i would unlock it  i had to get a new phone and i threw the extender in the trash  you also have to give your wifi password and information to the company that makes it because their method of connection is web based  do not buy this unless you want to pay for your device to be loaded with spyware  i don t trust it      
404,3.0,                       it s easy to install  if you use the tether app you should be aware that you are giving away your router details  and password etc to tp link  they can snoop in your network if they want to  and or if they get hacked then your network too  now coming to installation setting  you can choose a new ssid if you don t like the default router ssid ext format for the extended network  but the password remains same as your main router access password  very unlike other extended routers like netgear etc   this is a very big issue if you want to create guest network now about the speed  the extended network is less than half of the main router whether you choose     or  ghz cheap and easy to create a extended wifi zone by sacrificing speed  zone separation  guest  and privacy       
405,3.0,                       it took me an hour and a half to realize that i had to disable mac filtering on my router because this thing did not give me the mac address of the wi fi signal  it gave me the mac address of the ethernet port on the bottom  once i disabled mac filtering i was able to obtain the mac address of the wi fi signal from this extender  i then entered that mac address into my router s allowed devices  re enabled mac filtering and everything seems to be working ok  and as others have noted this is not necessarily a direct repeater because it creates its own network with your original network suffixed with an  ext  i hope my pain and suffering saves somebody some time and aggravation you are welcome      
406,5.0,                       purchased this for my sons room because he was always complaining  our wifi is garbage  despite having one of the faster internet packages through comcast xfinity    we own a      so ft colonial and already had one wifi extended upstairs  our modem is on our main floor  but adding this additional wifi extender solved our problems  my son never complains about the wifi lagging anymore while he s gaming and i have noticed increased speed of the wifi on my phone while upstairs as well  great purchase   the price was right  the size design are ideal and it was so easy to install my    yo son did it on his own without help  i highly recommend this product if you re struggling with a slower wifi connect     
407,1.0,                       i could not get this thing to work  first  it would not connect to my wifi  so the instructions directed me to use the tp link extender network   did that   still would not connect   the faq s suggested turning off my cellular data   did that   returned to the login trying set up a new user    i would get to the point where it asked for my email address and then it would say  invalid email format   very frustrating   there is no number on the directions to call for product support   only an email address  so  i googled it and found the number online   i was on hold  due to covid  for over twenty minutes without getting a live person to talk to   needless to say  this product is on its way back to amazon for a refund      
408,4.0,                       like the other reviewers  the basic setup is super simple   i was able to get it connected at    g        g  pretty easily with the one touch wps setup  but using the same setup process to connect to       n and ac modes over the  ghz spectrum didn t work  even with the extender right next to the router  the wps light kept flashing and eventually timed out with no  ghz signal  not a problem  had to login to the interface via the built in webpage and connect to the  ghz hotspot manually  but in the end  i ended up disabling  g on the extender to router side because it was actually slowing the connections down because the  ghz band has a harder time going through walls than the    ghz band  overall  this range extender works as well as one can hope for the    dollars it cost  was able to expand the indoor range of the router s signal by at least    feet in a brick  wood and stucco house      
409,3.0,                       it says very clearly i can use the same wifi ssid and password with the onemesh feature as the router i m connecting to to extend the signal   it also says it will work with any router which is true  but i can t use the same ssid   it just appends  ext to the ssid i want to connect to and creates a new one   so the advertising is not fully clear on the fact you also need a onemesh compatible router to be able to use the exact same ssid password   my router is not   now i have to buy a onemesh compatible router      
410,5.0,                       literally took    minutes to set up using wps  followed the instructions for my router wps set up   plug unit in  pressed wps button on both the device and my router simultaneously   wps button blinked green  then went solid  waited a minute  did it again because i have a dual band router  setup complete  looked at available wifi on my phone  both new  ext wifi channels were available plugged it in the wall     between my router and roku tv  enabled new network on my roku and bam  better signal for my tv signal strength is excellent   set up was a breeze  highly recommend this device      
411,4.0,                       this product works great  this allows my laptop to get full connection as if i was next to the router  i recommend this product to anyone that has a dead zone in their house  even though this product is great i honestly recommend you look into a mesh network system  a mesh network system is a better  range extender instead of putting multiple range extenders in your house and having   wifis    it would be better er to get a mesh network as it works better then a range extender and its only   wifi that is all over your house that way you don t have to connect and disconnect to different wifi connections but instead have one for your entire house with no dead zones and full data  so my final verdict is if you just need a quick fix a range extender is the way to go but if your installing more than   in your house then it would be better to just get a mesh network as the multiple range extenders would ld get confusing      
412,4.0,                       i received the product within    hours   great  the wifi extender comes with   different ways to connect you your router  i had some issues and contacted tech support  at first i was impressed but then i was connected to a foreign tech support person who wanted to remotely log into my computer  he then said i had problems because i lacked a firewall  not true  and then wanted      to  fix  my computer  i just disconnected from the remote login   scam  i went back and tried the android app one more time and suddenly it just worked the wifi extender picks up my home s signal and rebroadcast it in both  g and  g on different channels named the same an my home network names but with ext added on the end  this makes it very easy to know you are connecting to the extended wifi channel which is very helpful now that i have it working  i really love the product  but beware of the company s tech support if they try to charge you to fix your computer      
413,5.0,                       wow   i opened the box  followed the instructions and    minutes later  i m rolling i bought another item on amazon from boss for     and it said  plug and play    well  not so much on that one   this one has great instructions  including using an app called tether  which works great   you simply plug the small device into a plug near your router and connect through the tether app   once you set up that connection  bring it to another location where you need a little boost   for me  my router is upstairs near our home office and bedrooms  so we put this device downstairs   after it finds its connection near your router  you simply have to bring it to the other location  plug it in and wait a couple of minutes   all lights lit up for me and i am now connecting my downstairs devices to the ext networks  which are listed separately i was so nervous after the     repeater extender failed to work  but you never know   this     one looks nicer and works great   i am using motorola mg      modem router upstairs if anyone is interested   i don t think that would make a difference      
414,5.0,                       so my router  tp link archer    is at one end of our home for reasons i don t need to get into   while the router has great range  i would occasionally drop my signal to my pc at the other end of the house  and my wireless printer often had no connection   using the tether app  i was able to install in about   minutes and have a great connection to both my pc and printer   speedtest showed no loss of download speed  as this is a dual band extender  and will use one of the bands to give you wonderful coverage and download speeds   i was ready to spend money for a mesh system  but for under     this was a great alternative for me      
415,3.0,                       my router is in my living room  i purchased this product in hopes of getting faster internet speed in my bedrooms  before and after setting up the product i conducted several speed tests in all of my bedrooms  i determined that the speeds were significantly slower when using the wifi extender  the only place that made a difference was in the farthest corner of my house in the garage  the speed went from   mbps to    mbps  in the bedrooms the speeds went from approximately    mbps to    mbps  maybe i misinterpreted the product and it is more geared for larger houses to extend a little bit of wifi signal to true  dead zones   maybe it isn t intended for smaller houses to increase speed  for that reason i ll give it a        
416,3.0,                       not a bad product as it does extend the range of a wifi signal and it is cheap  installation was not hard but seemed more problematic than indicated in the how to videos and the quick instructions provided seemed to lack some important steps  it does repeat the signal and extend the wifi but you need to find the right spot for your situation in order to maximize the effectiveness  there are some general guidelines on where to place the device but i seem to be getting only a small extension of range   m   all in all  this does help and is a good product but not a great one  given my experience with this i would probably look to getting a booster of my signal or rewire my network so that i would have more ethernet ports around the house to plug other devices into      
417,1.0,                       i bought this wifi extender because of my positive experience with the tp link ac     wifi router  which i loved due to its strong wifi coverage in my house  the wifi router was on one side of my house  my study room is on the other side so signal strength is not ideal but not bad  with this wifi extender  i tested internet speed multiple times  with multiple devices  the wifi extender actually contributes nothing to internet speed and even slowed down my speed  returned it the same day i got this  people  if you really wants to know if this one works  you need to test your internet speed  you cannot just judge the signal on number of signal bars on your device      
418,5.0,                       my husband has discovered the internet  more specific online poker   while downstairs he always complained how we  the family  was using the internet all up while he played his poker games   we explained that the connection downstairs was weaker than upstairs where the router was and an extender was needed   he didn t believe us and kept saying we were  sucking up  the internet   i saw reviews for this extender and thought i need to get this   my daughter helped set it up  she a lot more tech suave then me  it only took a few minutes and da ta connection is fantastic downstairs   i use to never get full bars on my phone downstairs now i do   my husband ipad went from  a connection speed of about   mb to    mb just with this little puppy   thank god i don t have hear him complain about how he just lost    billion dollars  fake money  in an online poker game anymore      
419,5.0,                       excellent little device  the wi fi signal is much improved  it was pretty easy to install  but not the quickest  it s similar to setting up a modem  it s very plug and play  if you view the picture attached to this review  you ll see that i have full bars on my wi fi wi fi signal  that is unheard of in this part of the house  it s upstairs above the garage  through the kitchen  which is a signal killer   and then down more stairs into the basement that is underground  my phone would often be switching to lte because the wi fi signal was so weak  so glad i got this little device  upload is not as fast as next to the actual modem  but my zoom meeting tonight was no problem      
420,1.0,                       they say  simple set up   it is anything but  they give you several options for set up  we tried them all  i  personally am not real computer savvy  but my wife is  after i got frustrated with the  simple one button set up   she took over and tried all options  an hour later  she was as frustrated as i was it s being returned to amazon if you do buy one  good luck      
421,5.0,                       the product is excellent  it works for places where internet hub is distant and needs signal boost  it was delivered in   days and i think that was simply remarkable  we have a very powerful internet hub and distance was not our problem  the signal weakens as we go to the third floor in our house  this product provided me       mb sec on the third floor but the wifi router itself was providing similar through put  i guess  there s a significant speed loss when there are in between devices  we figured  we are okay with what we have  we receive over     mb sec on the second floor  the wifi is in the basement  but i have nothing less than satisfactory to say on the product  it does what it is supposed to do      
422,1.0,                       the product arrived with setup instructions which included a url  which i typed into my browser   when i didn t get a login  i went to the chat button on the bottom on the site   a guy who claimed to be in chicago took over my computer and  sold  me a service package for      then added an additional     for his work   i got suspicious and asked him if he worked for tplink   and he said he was covering during covid   when i challenged him  he agreed to refund      but kept      for the work he did   the device doesn t work  and i returned it   tplink takes no responsibility for the issue      
423,4.0,                       for the price  it s hard to not like this wi fi extender  i paid like      keep in mind in this price range you re not going to get miracles i live in       sq  ft  cape cod style house with modern wallboard construction  it allowed me to strengthen my  g upstairs so i consistently get a strong signal  the speed isn t nearly as fast as sitting right next to my router but obviously there s drop off sending signal through the floor and at least one wall  ballpark     setup is super easy though i didn t try a mesh setup so i can t speak to that      
424,2.0,                       i bought this because the tech web sites rated it as a great unit for the price  it was easy to install and worked right off the bat  i use a roku  k express with sling for a service and an air tv   for my ota channels  after a couple of weeks it started to drop the connection constantly and i eventually realized that it lost it s  ghz ability totally  i tried a factory reset but it would only do    ghz  i returned it with one day to spare and bought something from a different company  it is working very good and i hope it lasts  i should have read more reviews because it looks like i m not the only one who had this issue      
425,1.0,                       i really don t understand how  but this device lost my connection entirely  before i bought this  my wifi would take a minute to connect if my boyfriend s playstation and tablet were connected at the same time  both the playstation and tablet are not currently connected and from the moment i plugged this in  my tv has said  error   cannot connect to wifi  and i ve attempted to restart everything via the google home app and nothing is working  i unplugged my chrome cast to start it over   i just paid to lose my internet connection  stunned      
426,4.0,                       i needed a wi fi booster upstairs in our master bedroom and the kids room for the cloud cam  our router is on the main floor and opposite end of the house so our bedroom was a deadzone and the kids room had a weak signal  camera would go out frequently a bit of a pain to install setup the network the wps button set up didn t work so i had to go the app route but once i did that it was very easy from there  so learn from me and download the app  don t bother with the wps button thing signal is now great upstairs  only caveat is that sometimes you have to manually select the ext network from your device settings  my phone will only auto connect if it loses the main router signal  my advice is to sit near the extender and connect to both ext networks    i have a dual band router so i have     and  g networks    since you ll have to put in the password to your wi fi when you first connect  but then your device will remember the new networks and you can switch between them pretty easily  sometimes i can even go back downstairs and stay connected to the ext network it s that strong so if you are an average guy like me that just wants a decent signal in some rooms that are far from the router  this is a good product  you don t need to break the bank if you aren t too concerned with overall speed and stuff   so i don t think this would be the right extender if you do a lot of online gaming      
427,1.0,                       i ordered this wifi extender and based on previous experience with tp link i expected it to be hassle free  i was wrong  i tried to set it up multiple times with   different extenders and both times it did the same thing i was able to get through all the steps for set up  but when it then tried to re connect me to the extender  after the networks were created  it couldn t  i would either get cannot connect to network or network password incorrect errors  even when entering the same password  i contacted support and all they did was walk me through the process a couple times  they were literally no help at all  my guess is that the extender has a problem with a special character in the password  my router has a special character in the password and when setting up the device it sets up the slave networks to have the same password  and you cannot adjust that   however when you first start setting the extender up it asks you to set up an admin password for the device  you cannot  through the app  use a special character  so i think the device doesn t know how to handle that  but support was at a loss to explain it  it s the only reason i can think that both devices would fail but my ring chime extender can connect just fine      
428,1.0,                       this product is terrible  but the worst is their customer service  i could not get it installed by following the directions so i went on their website looking for helpful hints  a chat box popped up and after telling  lisa  about my problem she said i would receive a call from a tech within    minutes  i did  and his name was  mark stevens     direct from mumbai  he said he needed access to my computer  which i stupidly granted  and proceeded to tell me how my computer was compromised and that     people were using my internet and i needed a firewall which he could sell me for         for a year   or i could get a special deal at      for two years  so the  tech  call turned into a sales call and left me with a feeling of being violated  i said  good bye  and called my son in law who is a computer tech  after laughing at me he remotely fixed the changes  mark  made in my computer and i have been spending all morning changing passwords  etc  stay away from this company      
429,5.0,                       overall works great for what it is being used for   works great in adverse weather in a weather sealed box for an outdoor projector installation for my holiday light shows   really easy to get setup with the teacher app and so far has worked well with speed and everything when out in my yard   have not tried out one mesh yet with my extender and router since i do not like to change too many things during my light show season   i will work on one mesh after this holiday is over and then change my review accordingly      
430,3.0,                       i definitely have mixed emotions about this particular extender i purchased it to replace my old netgear extender that pooped out    the main selling point was that you use an app to manage it rather than having to go through all the web address connection bs that i was used to with the netgear device  major anxiety inducing headache  setup was easy enough and quick  but for whatever reason  it had issues finding the device and didn t  stick  so i had to set it up a second time right after finishing connecting the darn thing the first time  facepalm   so maybe not so quick and easy lol   anyway  since the initial issue during setup  i haven t had any problems with managing the app the signal and speed seems decent  i have centurylink so i wasn t expecting any miracles as far as improving loading speed and whatnot  there might be a little bit of a speed increase as far as loading pictures in emails on my phone  i get daily emails regarding discounts on ebooks lol   but i m not tech savvy enough to notice anything major i d really like to give this product   stars  but there s one key factor i m not happy with  the signal dropping    the extender will drop signal multiple times a week  when i go to look at it  all of the appropriate lights are present  but the signal cannot be found by my various devices  phone  tablet  laptop  firestick  etc   admittedly  it s an easy enough fix  just unplug the extender  give it a few seconds  then plug it in again    it only takes the time for me to walk from one end of the house to the other to power on and work again  however  it s still inconvenient and annoying overall  it s a decent enough device  but the constant signal dropping is a pain in the kazink  do with that what you will      
431,4.0,                       well this product does exactly what is advertised   it helps extend the range of your router things i liked  setup was fairly quickly using the app extends both    ghz and  ghz networks the range of the new network works well   my tv that was on the other side of the house can finally stream movies without buffering every    minutes things i don t like  this extender basically creates a new wireless network  which means that all devices need to switch to the new network and new password   this is a pain in the butt initially  but after you ve switched all devices that were too far from the router you should be all set   this was the only reason i knocked off   star      
432,1.0,                       update       ok     so i thought it was great when i first installed it    very easy to set up and get going  but it would drop my connection every    to    minutes and if i was playing a game like world of warcraft it made the whole idea of playing useless   i decided to troubleshoot my net gear and although i m still not happy that i would have to pay for customer service i was able to figure it out myself and get the security updates and once again it works flawlessly it worked fine without the security updates too but i m happy that it is now up to date      while the tp link customer service was very nice they could not help me with the problem so i dropped it from five stars to one star    original review  i had to replace a netgear unit that i liked very much  but it was unable to get security updates  and even going to the netgear website i couldn t manually download them because it wouldn t let me log in   password and log in name were correct     security  questions confirmed this   netgear failed me miserably and you can t talk to customer service without paying for the customer support in advance      this unit was easy to set up with the tether app  using my cell phone  and now i am once again secure  as confirmed by avg        
433,1.0,                       i bought two of these  and both were unable to complete the setup  in both cases  i tried the quick  step by step setup routine  but got authentication failures when i tried to connect to the extender  so i did a factory reset and wired my computer directly to the extender with an ethernet cable  then did manual setup through the web interface  on both extenders  it would fail to save my network password   a message pops up for a few seconds that says failed   and at that point it would lock up and not accept any more input  it would still by locked up after rebooting the extender  in fact  it wouldn t even let me do a factory reset until i figured out that i had to do it while the extender was booting  but before it was finished      
434,1.0,                       after purchasing and successfully putting into service a tp link ac     wifi extender  i had high hopes for this ac    wifi range extender   the ac     had easily connected to our home lan using tp link s tether app  and then easily connected to the various devices that were in the area where i wanted to extend wifi signal no such luck with the ac      i should have been warned when  even after setting the ac    less than   feet from our router for setup using the tether app  the ac    could not  see  either the     or   ghz signal from our router   i directly connected the ac    with an ethernet cable to the router and completed setup that way  but it fought me all the way to connect to the   ghz signal   after disconnecting the ac    from the ethernet cable and placing it where i wanted to extend wifi signal  the ac    will not connect to any device in that area  it won t connect to our cell phones  it will not connect to our wifi devices or switches   in other words  the ac    will not extend the wifi signal to anything because it won t connect to anything furthermore  the ac    constantly disconnects from and drops off the tether app  making it impossible to revise any of the settings that might possibly address the connectivity problems this device obviously has i will be re boxing this item and returning it to amazon   a wifi range extender is only good it it works  and this ac    doesn t work later edit   when i unplugged this range extender to return it to amazon  the range extender was hot to the touch    no led lights were showing   quite obviously  this unit was defective      
435,5.0,                       after a good deal of research  i landed on the tp link ac    wifi extender to help boost my internet signal  i have a computer in my home office which is located two rooms away from my modem router  we live in a home with plaster walls which means there is a metal grid behind the plaster on each wall  this metal grid extends from floor to ceiling the entire width of each wall and it restricts the internet signal from traveling from room to room when the tp link ac     arrived  i decided i would plug it into an outlet in the living room between the family room where the modem router is located and my home office  after a fairly straight forward easy set up  i was pleasantly surprised that the new extender was registering a strong signal from the modem router  once i found the tp link in my list of internet connections on my computer and made the wireless connection  it has worked flawlessly over the past several months i have been extremely pleased with the quality of signal i now get in my office  no more dropped connections  which used to happen on a daily basis  for the investment  i don t believe you can go wrong with this wi fi extender      
436,1.0,                       the setup and all went easily  i have done this before  i noticed first that the signal strength from less than   ft away was not  full bars   but maybe that is ok  my host wireless is stronger than that from further away   did an xfinity speed test for both the     and  ghz connections and both downloads were pretty much identical  i don t know if they are playing the mbbs naming game  but the product does not perform to what you are probably expecting      
437,1.0,                       not worth the postage to ship it   had it sent to our vacation home  didn t arrive until   weeks after purchase due to covid   set up using the tplink   a trip     would be ok for setting up if the extender worked   if it doesn t as this one didn t  its a pain to reset  reset  reset   you get the picture   it picked up the signal we wanted to extend  both the   and   g  they were showing   bars  however it wasn t capable of resending the signal   at all  ever   this extender was sending a red signal  nothing  for transmitting or extending   the     number to call wasn t a valid number  etc  etc   have owned router extender and used for years  this one is capable of picking up router signal from maybe within    feet  as far as transmitting  forget about it   total rip off      
438,5.0,                       ordered this range extender to boost my signal upstairs  my modem is only a year old  so i didn t want to buy a whole new system to setup a wireless mesh network  which is the better option   the extender is easy to install   can be set up by anyone  i was hoping to plug it up in the hall  but the signal was too weak  it has a signal strength detector on the app   i plugged up closer to the modem   i connected fine  so far everything is working fine  definitely recommend if you need an inexpensive range extender      
439,5.0,                       i set this up with ease the day of delivery but noticed no apparent strength of signal in the back room of the house  today  i happened to notice i had two network names for my home network  the original one plus one with the same name but with an  ext  after it  i connected to it and  lo and behold my signal increased from two bars to between   and     the problem i had been having getting a good  strong signal was gone and downloads and connection to the internet was much better  the only caveat about this extender is the lack of clear instructions in intelligible english plus the assumption that everyone has a smart phone to download their app onto  much clearer instructions are needed  eg   need to wait a bit after pushing the buttons to connect to allow it to acquire a signal  etc  all in all  a good product which should work well for the price      
440,5.0,                       i m not not tech savvy  but always seem to have a nightmare of a time when setting up our wifi or changing out routers   so  i was kind of dreading this after reading some of the reviews for the      version of this product   to my delight  the setup could not have been easier   it took all of   minutes and we were up and running with our extended network   we did some remodeling last year and added a lot of natural stone  granite  tile  walls  etc  where there previously had been carpeting and an open room   these materials drained the wifi connection we get in the new areas  and  the wifi range extender has brought that back to life   we re excited to see if this helps to extend our signal onto the front and back porch  too very pleased so far      
441,5.0,                       after getting fed up and frustrated because the wifi didn t reach upstairs  sheet rock from      blocks all signal even cell signal  i looked all over for the best extender and this one came up at the top of every list  there s a newer version  but even the      lists show this one as the best  i ordered it and when it arrived  i struggled to figure out how to connect it to the router because the app refused to accept the password or perhaps the log in  i used the button on the modem instead so it s connected to the modem not my router   i think the modem has a built in router feature  but i am not tech savvy so i have no idea  i had to use a power strip and hold the extender directly next to the modem  this is important so make sure you can get them super close to each other to connect  finally after struggling with it for about    minutes it connected  i left it in place for a few more minutes just in case  then i brought it upstairs and plugged it in  it took maybe   more minutes to have the proper lights lit up before i could connect the fire stick and the xbox to it   it comes up as the name of my modem with ext after it  i was a little confused as to how to connect because it needed a password to connect to it  the password is the same as my modem  i connected it and after   years of living in this house with sketchy wifi that cuts out in the middle of movies and games  i have signal upstairs and it doesn t suddenly cut out  i can finally watch an entire movie on the firestick  without having to come completely out of the app i m using and log back in to finish the movie  i wish i had bought this years ago  had i known it would be this easy i would have installed one the day we moved in  we connect our phones to the wifi when we get home and i currently pay for   mbps and speed tests show up to     mbps  which is amazing  the photo with my review is the speed test i just ran  it is over    mbps for downloads and uploads  this was worth every penny i paid  i have fiber internet with a xyxel modem and a lynksys router      
442,1.0,                       the tp link family  was  what i usually purchased when i had network installs that needed extenders or for my own personal use    i have purchased    in the last   years  as a tech  i needed something dependable and this was the only brand i trusted   all of that changed when i purchased one for a client in june of this year and it failed   not only is it only   months old however  when i went online to replace it  the site wasn t user friendly at all   so i used the chat feature  and told the first support specialist that i was a tech and not only had i reset the extender   times and ran the wizard but  i had also used their knowledge base to no avail   it would connect but everything would give me the error no internet or poor signal   she wanted to take me through her own companies  pd   problem determination     ok  i get it   what made thing difficult is she would and continue to leave and come back  after   mins the system would warn you it would time out   after      mins of going back and forth and telling her i already did that  she asked me to hold on yet again and took so long  despite the fact i kept typing i am here to keep the chat open  it timed out and closed  very frustrated now  i called and told the  nd specialist all i had done and also the previous tech rosetta  and this imbecile wants to start the process all over again   their attempt is to frustrate you until you considered it a lost   needless to say  i reimburse my client  tried something new and returned the two tp link usb wi fi adapters i just received which falsely showed on the box  big as daylight     year warranty   the product  was  good  but if the company does not stand by the warranty it so boldly highlights all over its product  then it isn t worth pockets with holes in it      
443,5.0,                       have fios in the   story house  router is on one side in the living room  wifi was petering out on the opposite side when doing video conference calls the installation took about    minutes total and once the extender was plugged in at a central point in the house  i was able to get     signal strength on the other end of the house and even in the concrete basement      
444,4.0,                       while this device does give you greater wifi coverage once it s set up  the setup isn t as smooth as i d hoped i downloaded the app to set up things  but the app refused to send me an email to create my account   then i moved onto the manual method   i have a dual band router so i had to go through the sync process twice  but the unit s light didn t inducate the sync to the  nd band worked   after repeating the process a few times it eventually sync d just not as smooth as expected      
445,1.0,                       we live in a track size two story house that is not large   the dual band router provides good wifi but the signal is a little weak  not a dead zone  in one corner of the second floor   after reading the reviews i bought this unit to improve the signal in that corner  i liked the wps method of installation and the promised       phone support   i installed it quickly and it worked for   weeks  then one day the ipad and phone said  no internet  when attempting to sign into the  ext wifi networks for both bands  the ipad and phone could sign into the slightly weaker wifi signal from my router in that corner of the second floor  i called the phone support but it is not available  covid     but i thought asia had recovered    so i went on chat  spent   hour and    minutes  response was  slow  several restarts  location changes but the problem remained   then i tried email   they said i should use the tether app method of installation etc   again several resets and setups  sending photos showing the unlit  g led light       email exchanges   my perception is that tech support people are overworked  undertrained and basically cut and paste scripts to respond to you   they don t have time to read your emails completely   finally i asked to replace the failed unit under the    month warranty   there was no response to that   i bought the unit in may and it failed in june   i finally gave up and returned the unit with     restocking charge   so my conclusion  unit is ok if it works but warranty tech support is poor      
446,1.0,                       product offers no benefits in extending the wifi signal strength or range  i needed to extend my range to go thru an outside wall    feet from the router  the router signal at the propesed location of the outside camera unit was   dbm  too weak for a hd  camera  i followed the instructions to place the extender     the distance  at    feet with direct line of sight  the extender showed it was out of range  but the router signal at that point from the router was    dbm  plenty adequate for my printers  etc  the signal from the extender on the outside was     dbm  worse than the router s signal of    dbm  i tried a nuber of ways to make it work  and the tp help desk had nothing else to offer than what i had tried  i even had a professional look over what was done and tried several different techniques to work  none enabled a good use for this produuct  product was returned      
447,2.0,                       update after about    days  i was using this adapter just fine then out of the blue it just stops working  the wifi part works fine  still get internet  still connect to main network  but the ethernet port off the extender stopped working  it ll blink like it s connected  but i can t access network locations and i have no internet  i was in the middle of a download when it stopped working  so it s not a software issue  pretty sure it s the ethernet port on the extender itself because it s extremely loose fitting  went back to my netgear extender i bought   years ago and it works fine this tp link is trash original review so after an hour of frustration i finally got this thing to work by using google if you want to use this to connect a device to your wifi via an ethernet cable  like  if you have a computer that doesn t have wifi  then listen carefully when you go through the setup process  the last page says  connect to the network and verify the internet is working   here s the catch  if you check the box saying it s connected and working  it will disable internet on the ethernet port you ll get all the network functionality  seeing other devices  able to transfer files and such  but no internet access once you get to that page  simply close your browser  do not pass go  do not collect      even still  there s something screwy about the ethernet port  i disabled the    ghz connection  disabled the    ghz extender  and still i get    ghz speeds on the phone with wifi  connected to this extender  i ll hit     mbps download  on the computer i get       mbps     
448,5.0,                       my router in the house is three rooms over  i kept losing my vpn for work and have to reconnect  our tech support could not find any issues with the laptop and i work   am to  am so there is no one else browsing or using a stick  i have two other pcs in the room with me for a total of   machines  put in this device that was recommended on the internet as the best buy and it works fine  no more disconnects and it installed in minutes  great buy     
449,5.0,                       i received and installed this device yesterday i used the wps button on the router and the corresponding wps button  with   arrow symbols  on the tp    to link these devices installation of a new tp link model tp    range extender seems to have resolved the wifi portion of network problems i was having in this condo unit with interference from other devices in the building   there are still intermittent problems with the comcast service  which any range extender can t touch   the network name through the device is  router ssid   g    gext for my office computer  the device apparently receives the  g signal and then makes it available at    g for devices like my computer which cannot receive  g   the full router ssid has the    g  suffix to indicate that it is the  ghz signal in my wife s computer she can select  ssid   g ext because her computer can receive the  g signal performance is notably better with this device note  because my receptacle is horizontal  the device is installed horizontally and apparently works just fine like that i recommend this device      
450,1.0,                       this is my second of this device  first one lasted me a few years  in an apartment  and was very reliable until complete failure  this device  in a house  has been giving me more and more issues as time goes on and i ve only had it   months  the lights randomly go out and the signal drops frequently  so that i have to unplug the device to reboot or reset to factory settings completely  not reliable  do not recommend

452,1.0,                       do not waste your money  this would work if you only had a small space and you wanted to boost the wifi   i followed all instructions  the router is about       ft from my room  so i placed this thing about    ft in between  it took a while for it to connect and it was a little confusing but easy enough i don t understand why it s not working  my phone shows it connected to the  ext  network and it shows full strength on my phone but i can t open a webpage  i ve tried moving the extender around to a couple different places but no luck with any of them  my laptop and xfinity box are all connected to the main router just fine  it s only my phone that can t connect so i know the wifi can reach that far  this extender was just to give my phone a little boost which it did not  it changed the wifi status on my phone from   bar to   bars but still no internet connection  wtf      
453,1.0,                       i really love this sexy little wifi extender   it is a sleek design  and has a lot of nice features  such as being able to name the wifi and control the unit that said  it has a very poor range   i was using it to extend my wifi to the garage   i already had an old extender there which worked well  but i liked the features this one had   first off  it would only let me place the extender about    feet from my  whole house  router   secondly  unless i put it in the center of the garage  it will not reach any devices   i tested the signal with my phone and    feet from the extender the main router    g signal was slightly better than the extender signal  i may have to send it back update   the seller  jane conley  emailed me and offered me     to remove this review   original item was only       i said no way   that would circumvent the review process   therefore i decided to return the item      
454,3.0,                       i am on    of this product   first one came and it would not work at all    nd one came and worked for a month and a half   i m on    now   if this fails  i will ask for a refund set up is super easy   plug it in near your modem  hit the wps on your modem  then within   mins  hit the button on the extended wifi   wait  which can take up to   mins for all the lights to come on   unplug and relocate it to where all lights light up again we live in a one story house       sq  ft  and i have it located in a straight shot from the back of my home to our kitchen   if i place it around the corner  say closer to a bedroom  the wifi extender will not work this was mainly purchased to extend the wifi to a bedroom with a tv   if i close the door in the bedroom  the signal diminishes tremendously seems to only work good if it is in a straight line with no walls or appliances in the way not impressed with it      
455,5.0,                       i am so happy with tp link ac    wifi extender   i always do extensive research on almost every product i buy so i know what i m getting for my    our modem sits in a back room and in the living room the every time i was on a video call on my cell it would lag and drop the call  i would have to run to the back room for better reception and more times than not it was very frustrating  the same thing happened with the  roku   my lab top  now we can use all   of our devices  in the other parts of our home at the same time and no more signal drop      
456,1.0,                       setup was pretty easy with my existing router  it seemed like a few too many steps and reboots to finally make it happen  but ultimately it worked  the wifi strength in the back yard was vastly improved   strength that is  it seemed odd that i had a strong signal  but the usability of phones  computers  security cameras  etc  was not great  i changed the extender to be  high speed  which means it communicates with the router in  ghz but will all devices downstream in    ghz  no improvement  the main router started doing weird things  too  the usually highly reliable internet connection was being flaky  even my desktop pc which is hard wired to the modem router from the cable company had no connection  we rebooted things and mentally blamed the cable company  the next morning  i picked up my phone off of the charger and found that it had no throughput despite having a signal  i found that it had grabbed the extender instead of the base router modem  i unplugged the extender from the wall and in some seconds emails and notifications began flowing in after my phone grabbed the base router  i dug the box for the extender out of the recycling bin and promptly submitted for a return via amazon      
457,2.0,                       update  read original review below if you want context i really wanted to like this  and i did at first  it worked amazing   for about a month or two  now when hooked up to it  wired or wireless  i get frequent disconnects  this is solved by unplugging it  and plugging it back in every    minutes or so  this is very annoying as you may imagine  i m not sure if cheap hardware is going into this device  but i suspect that is the case  i am really disappointed in this product  i recommend you buy a more well known brand  such as netgear or something comparable  i won t be buying another product from these guys soon  and i m going to go ahead and knock off   stars for this                                                                                     original review like the title says  you really can t beat this product at this price  this is how i set it up   download their app  hook up the device to your wifi  name your new wifi from the device itself  i named it the same as my old   then  plug it in to the wall near your computer laptop console etc  finally  i plugged an ethernet cable to the bottom of the device and ran it directly to my computerthis was netting me significantly closer to my advertised network speeds  went from    mbps on a  ghz wifi band to over    mbps over ethernet  with my advertised speed being    mbps   not perfect  but it s waaaaaaay better and i couldn t be happier i tried using it without the ethernet cable  just using the device s wifi signal  but there was no significant change in speed definitely utilize the lan port at the bottom for maximum performance      
458,5.0,                       i was skeptical about buying a dual band wifi extender for less than     including free two day shipping with prime    after a set up process that had to be followed precisely and took about    minutes  i plugged this unit into a kitchen wall receptacle    it picked up the signal from my comcast dual band router that is in a different room  and it pushed out a strong signal to another room separated by two walls and metal doors  i really didn t think it would work considering the distance and all of the walls the signal has to go through  but it did  and now i m getting a strong  uninterrupted signal for my smart tv  laptop and iphone three rooms and multiple walls away from my comcast modem  i do have to switch networks when using this booster to ensure i m logged into it  noted as  ext  network  and not my comcast network      
459,2.0,                       i have had this product for a few months   i purchased it because of the reviews and my personal experience with other tp link products   we started experiencing wifi dropouts shortly after adding this device to our network   initially i thought that it was because of the router  so we replaced the router with a higher end product from tp link  after a few months of  detective  work  i noticed that the drop out happens when the unit heats up  customer support agreed to exchange it but they wanted me to send the unit back  my expense  and wait until they ship another unit  which meant being without a repeater for up to two weeks   i replaced it with another brand and all is okay   i don t recommend it because i think the  heating  problem is likely to be common to this line of product      
460,1.0,                       the booster extended internet to an area of the house that did not have consistent internet  but the speed was     of the advertised bandwidth speed   the product boasts that it will extend the     ghz band at    mbps   i get between     and    mbps in the spot where i placed the booster   the extended wifi from the booster had speeds between      mbps   that is not nearly enough for internet working nor video meetings      
461,5.0,                       although i saw a lot of negative reviews  i purchased this wifi extender because it was a good price and i checked other websites with reviews and overall this extender does pretty well for customers it took about    minutes to get it going   i was disappointed i could not connect using wps only   but  i re read included instructions and followed them to hook up the extender  i also downloaded the tether app and will use it for settings and updates  etc  when needed we have a      sq  ft house and the extender is about in the middle   we get   bars throughout the house now and  bars clear into the backyard it is a good price and so far works as advertised   i recommend it for anyone who needs better wifi coverage for a budget price      
462,5.0,                       i ve bought different brand wifi extenders where the reviews claimed they were easy to install and effective  most were wrong this extender is both easy to install and is effective i have a wifi connected garage door opener  but the garage door opener wouldn t connect  something i should have thought about before i fell off the ladder and broke my arm trying to install it  but i digress  so i bought this bad boy and i now have full service wifi in the garage  and a casted arm  definitely recommend      
463,4.0,                       i had an ok signal but things would often take several seconds to start loading or they might lag out in the middle   my router is on one side of the building next to my computer and most of the wifi devices are on the opposite side    feet away through multiple walls   after adding this extender halfway in between this happens much less often before buying any product i read the negative reviews because i know they can be incredibly serious or they can be minor   for this one i noticed half of the poor reviews had a really terrible signal and this didn t help them much   it can t salvage a disaster  you stil have to have a good router but with limited range   the other half it didn t seem to do much at all and even interfered with the existing signal   maybe that s a compatibility issue  or i dunno why  but it looks like if i had that problem i would usually know right away and otherwise i ll be fine   a couple reviews about privacy seem to be misreading the terms   it s hard to make sense of the huge document  but it doesn t say at all what those reviewers say it says   at least not at the beginning as one says   the beginning only describes what info you may or may not voluntarily give to tplink  everything you type in   not what they might do with it signal will still cut out at times  a few times in the past couple months   just now i had to reboot it  unplug  plug back in  to get any signal at all   by comparison my main router needs a reboot every     years   it would be better to save yourself the frustration and blow the money on mesh wifi   with all the time spent messing with a bad signal it will be well worth it in the long run   that s what i ended up doing and it s way better   high speed  almost no loading time  strong signal  never dead   still the extender did help quite a bit and it s really cheap  so i can only dock   star for only being a band aid solution for an insufficient router      
464,2.0,                       i have used this product since i got it and wanted to have a good idea about its effectiveness   last night i decided it just wasn t providing enough  if any  benefits   tried to return today and found that yesterday was the last day to return   my own fault   you can benefit from my mistake however   i have used in my   story home for a month  and   day  and just don t see any benefit or increase in signal over not using it      
465,1.0,                       i installed without any problems  it worked just fine for about   weeks  then the connection started dropping every now and then for about a week  and after that it stopped working completely  i spent hours reading online reviews and watching youtube videos  i reset it a several times but nothing worked  extender is connected to the router  all lights are green  but it s no longer putting out internet signal  my laptop and phone show connected to the wifi but there is no internet  at this point i just gave up
