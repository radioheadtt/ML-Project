0,1.0 ,                       i tried  moved it to three different locations in my house and tested it longer than the allowable window for returns  unfortunately  it was definitely easy to set up  but as soon as i set it up each time my kids were yelling at me about lagging zoom classes and video games  and i found my phone burning through data because it couldn t find wifi in my own house  maybe it was just a dud  but i m giving up and looking elsewhere      
1,5.0 ,                       extending my wifi from my room on the corner of my house to my living room on the entirely other side of my house  i have a great connection even in my driveway or when downstairs in the garage to search how tos or listen to music  great repeater and would recommend it to all     
2,3.0 ,                       the connection drops a lot  i would recommend looking for a different brand     
3,2.0 ,                       the set up of the route extender was not that bad  was aggravates me about this item is that it knocks my imac totally off the router signal  my laptop is getting a signal but it is not any better than before  my roku keeps requesting a wifi log in when i use it  as soon as i unplug this router extender  everything is working just fine with the exception of the slow internet speed  the reason that i purchased the extender   i thought it was my imagination  i plugged it in and got it to sync with my router just fine  but the same issues occurred again  returning it   i work from home and am an online student  i don t have time to play around with this struggle      
4,1.0 ,                       this extender was okay for what we were using it for which was extending our wi fi from one room to another  we were having trouble with the built in router on the cable modem reaching our living room which is only about    feet from the router to the computer  we purchased this extender so that we could get a better signal  it worked satisfactory for about   months  now our computers are telling us that the extender is using an older security standard that might not be secure and won t allow the computer to connect  the original router still works and we can connect to it but not the extender  we expected the extender to last more than a few months      
5,4.0 ,                       works fine once you get it in the right place      
6,5.0 ,                       i m retired and one hobby i have is online poker   the problem i have is that often i was shown to have a poor signal and then dropped during the game   i have only had this for   days but i have yet to be dropped or even once had a poor signal   that is amazing to me   this was not an expensive unit but it did have good reviews   i didn t have much faith that it would work but i was wrong   i m not tech savvy either but all i had to do was press the button on top of the modem and then the one on the unit   i m old and a skeptic but either this is the best thing that i have bought in awhile or it is one heck of a coincidence      
7,1.0 ,                       this made the wi fi i had worst   i followed all the directions  then i connected to the  wi fi clone  the internet speed this wi fi clone had was super slow  it loaded a few videos but not without a agonising wait  the hole process of buying it  getting it  then testing it  then finally returning it just felt like a huge waste of time keep in mind i had a ethernet cable connected to it  and both lights were blue  it had direct wi fi yet it still failed  big thumbs down from me      
8,1.0 ,                       didn t work   was missing a part or something     
9,1.0 ,                       it kept shutting my router off     
10,5.0 ,                       i am thoroughly impressed with this wifi extender  i ve used extenders in the past with success but this one takes the cake  i wanted to stick with tp link since i have an acher c    x router already  we moved into a new house with a large detached garage roughly    yards away from the house  the router is in the center of the house and i have plenty of coverage  but i have spotty    ghz coverage out in the garage i bought this extender because it was tp link and to help extend my     signal  it worked better than imagined     it was super easy to setup  i used the tether app and it basically sync my c    x and the extender    clicks and it was done     i actually placed the extender on the back wall of the garage as a test  the extender picked up an excellent    ghz signal  how    idk  but it does  so i left it there  i normally place an extender between the location and the router  but in this case i put the extender at least    yards away from the router in a totally different building and the extender got an excellent signal     the tether app is extremely useful  you can use it to test the location of the extender  so basically it will run a signal quality test between the extender and the router  you can also manage the devices connected got the extender and a host of other tools and resources i m very please with this extender  i get    mbps which way too much for my needs  all i really needed it for was to run my roku in the garage lol  well my roku hasn t buffered since i installed that extender pro tip   clone the name of your    ghz ssid  that way you devices will seamlessly float between your main router and extender without you having to reconnect your devices to the extender when in range      
11,1.0 ,                       i purchased this extender so my whole house would have wifi  it worked perfectly fine while we had frontier communications  but frontier was a horrible communication company  my tv only worked    days out of    and waited    days between techs trying to figure out why it kept dropping my signal  so i changed cable company and my husband has been trying for two days to get the extender to connect to the new company  he has been on the phone with a tech that wanted to sell him a product  he s been the company website chatting with a tech  and it s still not working  i would really like a refund and be able to purchase some other product      
12,5.0 ,                       i have a multi level dwelling and like probably everybody else in a multi level dwelling  i have reception problems with my wi fi net at the far ends of the router s range  no more  these babies really juice up the signal  i had another range extender a couple of years back and i never got it working and the tech support web page had been hacked and gave a bogus overseas phone number whose operators tried to engage me in a scam that could have had serious consequences for me and the manufacturer didn t even care when i informed them of the problem  anyway  the off shoot of that drama meant that i just tried to live with the problem of barely adequate range  then i saw these tp link devices and they were cheap enough to give them a try  most of the users were reporting good success with them  well  those  five star  guys were right  these things work and even a moderately tech savy  classification used loosely  guy like me can have them running in less than ten minutes  consider me an advocate      
13,5.0 ,                       i bought this and the net gear extender   people  buy this one  oh my gosh    the i buy power computers i have kept disconnecting from the netgear one   this one has been solid so far no disconnects yet   and check the out the speed      
14,5.0 ,                       so i intentionally waited before posting a review to see how this will work  it has now been a month and this is as great and works as perfectly as almost everyone states  i do feel bad for those that cannot connect right out of the box as it took me literally about   sec to connect  press button on router  pressed button on range extender  waited for them to connect and done  my wifi router is located in family room but i now have full bars in all the upstairs area in a single family home  now for the first week or so it seemed like it would randomly lose signal  i kept seeing my wifi signal on tablets go from   bars to   randomly  i did have to unplug the extender and reconnect at various times to find the signal   but after about two weeks it has been working perfectly all the time  maybe i m an air head for thinking machines need to get used to each other but has been two weeks now where i have full wifi signal at all times  anything i am connecting from laptop to tv has full signal  and at this price i can t imagine anything else being better  my wife and i laughed that by some mysterious mystery about a week after this purchase we got an ad from our internet provider for their own range extender for the low low low price of    a month or purchase for       thank god for amazon and for this product      
15,5.0 ,                       help me a lots     
16,2.0 ,                       i constantly had to reset it by unplugging it and plugging it back in  bought another model and works fine in same spot      
17,1.0 ,                       doesn t work  you have to connect to the thing and once you  do  your signal is slower than the actual modem which is further away  piece of trash and i bought       
18,1.0 ,                       extremely disappointing product  the connection is slow and unreliable  the one i received was also dirty dusty looking when i removed it from the box  and it sounds like there is a loose piece inside it      
19,5.0 ,                       i read the reviews and didn t have any of the problems others did  textbook for me and it works as advertised  i was pleasantly surprised how easy it was      
20,5.0 ,                    excelente  justo lo que necesitaba        
21,5.0 ,                       our dsl comes into the finished basement    so the modem is there    coverage to back of the house upstairs iffy     the vz cell signal has deteriorated in the last few years so we use the wi fi calling feature of the phones a lot    first extender i bought caused access point issues and the phones would disconnect between up and downstairs    if i can t have the same ssid on the extender then the advantage of having it goes down a lot    this device solved the problem    setup is easy    and the copy made of the parent signal appears to be perfect    renamed the extender to the parent ssid and have no issues all over the house    what i see is a seamless transition between the   signals    and as an added  unexpected  never before seen result    i have a usable wifi signal in my woodworking shop located    feet from the house    it has been installed a little over a week so we ll see how long my euphoria lasts    but so far  so great        
22,2.0 ,                       there is no difference     
23,4.0 ,                       muy buen producto  la calidad vs el precio esta muy bien  f cil de configurar y el rango de alcance es muy bueno  la presentaci n me gusto bastante  ya puedo andar libre por la casa sin estar pensando en que punto tendr a se al incluso hasta fuera de la casa tengo cobertura  la app  tether  no cuenta con tantas herramientas en resumen  es simple  f cil de instalar y configurar  las instrucciones son muy claras      
24,5.0 ,                       just want i needed for my dead spot in the basement   was gonna buy a mesh router but  i saved my self     to     bucks  not bad for the price      
25,3.0 ,                       this most awesome boost still relies on your internet connection      
26,5.0 ,                       i had trouble with my wifi stability for the longest time before purchasing this extender  i used usb wifi adapters and a pcie wifi card to no avail  i couldn t use ethernet due to my distance from the router either i took a shot at this  not expecting it to do much  not only did it cut out my in game connection issues  but my internet speed improved significantly  i personally use the ethernet option to connect to my pc  which is extremely simple to set up through the app  i am super satisfied with this purchase  and i m just glad that this was able to provide me a solution for a reasonable price  dorm wifi is notoriously bad  but this gets the job done and then goes the extra mile      
27,5.0 ,                       yes  i bought this given how very reasonable the price is compared to the other  name brand  wi fi extenders out there  at the time of this review it was         i saw   k reviews on it and thought   well    k and   star rating cant be all bad   so i made the plunge even though i have more expensive ones in my cart ready for purchase  bought it  received it and plugged it in and it pretty much set itself up the wi fi is in my office next to the garage and i placed this booster dead center from where the tv and xbox in the basement and where the signal originates from on the second floor  all of the sudden i can stream hd movies and kids can jump on multiplayer games with no hiccups  the speeds are not as fast in the basement  but that was expected  doing some basic speed tests on the booster  it drops roughly     if you are connected to it    but hey  im totally cool with that now that my deep dark no wi fi basement now has internet service      
28,1.0 ,                       absolutely worthless garbage   i have a   bedroom apartment  only     square feet but somehow the tp link router cannot extend to my bedroom and this sucker wont boost my wifi even after i moved my router so that it is less than    feet away with an unobstructed line of sight   the light is green  it says its working  but neither my smart tv nor my phone  nore my tablet can get wifi      
29,5.0 ,                       it was an easy installation nothing complicated to follow on setting it up  loved it and works wonderful      
30,1.0 ,                       it didn t do what it said it will do  the internet speed did not change not even a bit      
31,5.0 ,                       it worked right out of the box  using the wps button on my router  i then re positioned the extender in the family room near the sliding doors that lead to my backyard patio  and now i have very good coverage in all my backyard patio area  previously  i had poor coverage just walking outside the sliding doors and no coverage at all in most of the patio area  the router is on the opposite side of the house  behind   walls  the speed is decent  about   mbps when sitting by the extender and   mbps in the farthest section of the patio  about   ft away from the door  the standard  un extended  home network delivers        mbps when you re sitting by the main router and about   mbps when sitting where i placed the extender  some may argue that an output of      mbps out of an input of   mbps is a bad value  but you need to consider that this is an extender so your  child  network will always be slower than the  parent  wi fi  due to the double hop that your data transfers need to do to reach your router isp you buy this device if you need to extend your coverage  not to boost the speed on an area with low  but stable  coverage i m pretty happy so far  i m looking forward for video and tv streaming when i m relaxing in the hot tub      
32,5.0 ,                       this has worked perfectly and is super easy to set up and manage with my iphone i had a couple dead zones in my rental house that caused the wifi to be awful   now with this  i can use wifi everywhere again   there are a couple of downsides to any range extender  if you re gaming on a console or pc  you might have a higher ping or slightly more lag  but i have been able to play most of my games now without problem   sometimes webpages are a bit tough to load sometimes  but once they do  the speed is fast the best part about this is that if it s set up according to the directions  your devices will seamlessly switch between your main router and your extender pros  kills dead zones seamless transition easy set up and maintenance  doesn t need very much at all  fastcons  can sometimes add lag to webpages and gaming  as any extender would      
33,2.0 ,                       honestly this doesn t really work for me and i m running out if options  i live in a trailer so my house is practically a straight line  my mother and i both work from home but we work on conplete oposite ends of the house  she needs to keep the router in her room because our comcast was given by the company so obviously  we cant move it  this is why i decided to buy this extender it had good reviews  so i decided it was the best for me since i m on a budget and it was easy to install  it worked well for   days  then all of a sudden it stopped working  my pc started disconnecting from it randomly  my xbox has trouble connecting    nothing was working  i cant even play on my xbox in the comfort of my own room because this stupid thing doesn t work most of the time  it actually pains me to say that these connection problems have made me almost put down my xbox entirely i havent played for a month and this is because for me to have a decent play session i would have to take all of my consoles  chairs and monitors out of my room and play in the dining room  that s what i have to do to get reliable connection now if you want my honest to god review  this thing is terrible  spend your money elsewhere  if you re looking for something cheap  just save up until you can spend a little more cash for something worth your time  do not get lured in by all the reviews saying  oh it s easy to install  don t let them fool you like they fooled me  save your money and get a better one      
34,5.0 ,                       easy to use     
35,5.0 ,                       my son wasn t getting wifi signal in his room to play his ps  games online with his school friends  so i ordered this  my son actually set it all up  it works perfect and he gets the signal he needs to play with his friends      
36,5.0 ,                       was having trouble getting wifi to reach my room  installed in less than   minutes and works perfectly      
37,1.0 ,                       i used the app to install since written directions were poorly written  the app confirms it is properly located but i can see absolutely no  improvement as far as distance is concerned  actually it interferes with my wf fi  if i am in the garage i get better reception by  turning off the extender link  often i get no signal at all when i use the  ext option but turn is off and my connection is restored   very inconsistent results but  for sure  no improvement in my reception  generally better off without it  product support was unprofessional and twice failed to call me back at the time they promised and then failed to call back at all as promised  wasting my money is bad enough but wasting so much of my time is insulting  not worth packing up to return is so i till probably just toss it in the garbage and eat the deal  they have had far more than  a fair change to make good  caveat emptor      
38,5.0 ,                       there is another review on here that says  this product did not work at all  no difference whatsoever     and that was my initial thought also   then i realized that it wasn t set up correctly   even though i had a solid blue connection light  and i was able to get sync with my router  it didn t make any difference in signal   then i realized that it wasn t really set up correctly quick check   if you see  tp link extender   no internet access  on your list of access points  then you didn t set it up correctly   that was my situation   i needed to pull the instructions and go to  option    of set up instructions   five minutes later  it was working correctly  and the tp link extender was gone  replaced with  mywifiname extender  when i walked into the room with the dead spot  i connected to the   extender  access point and immediately had full coverage   in my case  it is transmitting through   concrete walls  and about    feet   our routers couldn t provide a four bar signal in this room   with the extender  we no longer have drop outs or poor signal so it really is an easy product to install    if you take your time and read the instructions correctly         
39,5.0 ,                       i ve been in it for decades and while this is not my specialty  i ve dealt with wifi stuff like this a number of times  my original purpose was a fairly close distance  but ended up having to add another   ft    m  or so and the reception is great  getting the same down when it was next to the wifi router  it s probably    feet away now  setup was as simple as could be  press a button on the wifi then the router  wait a few and move the repeater to its new location one thing to note  it took seconds to connect when next to the router  but a few minutes when it was far  not a big deal  but at first i thought it didn t reach as long as it lasts  would definitely buy again  it is in the location the original wifi was located  verizon home wifi   with the original relocated  the reception is definitely better than what the wifi broadcast      
40,5.0 ,                       we live in a three story home and the router being in the basement means that the third floor and opposite sections of the home were without reliable wireless  thanks verizon fios    anyhow  with this nifty little gadget  we now have great wireless coverage in the home  we had previously been unable to use our amazon firestick on the main floor  away from the router  but we ve now placed it on a different floor and it works great setup was super easy  too  just pressed the button and synced it with the verizon router that we have  easy peasy     
41,2.0 ,                       does not work as promised  nothing but issues with wifi once connected      
42,1.0 ,                       works but greatly reduces speed      
43,5.0 ,                       works well      
44,4.0 ,                       i  must  have  really  great     
45,2.0 ,                       it worked great while it worked  just a month later all of a sudden it had no signal  tried resetting  reconfiguring it turned on but would not broadcast a signal  wifi works fine in the rest of the house so it s not my router      
46,5.0 ,                    exelente extend  de un   piso a un   piso        
47,5.0 ,                       i live in a really old building with patch reception so didn t really have much hope in this working so great   so far so good and i love it   i have it set up nearly   ft away from the router  it s a big space so that s the best i could do with half way away  and even being separated by an elevator shaft it still manages to work   in devices i was getting   signal from i now have full bars   setup was fairly simple but because the original signal is so weak i had to use the plug in method to activate register the extender   it works brilliantly but every once in awhile may cut out briefly for a bit   i noticed that is reduced to nearly none if when i get up in the morning i shut down and restart the router altogether and freshen the signal   sometimes if i m being lazy i ll just unplug the extender for a few seconds and plug back in and everything works back to normal again   this little device is much more powerful than expected so it defintely deserves my   stars      
48,4.0 ,                       the tp link range extender model re     was easy to set up following the provided instructions to sync it with my router using the sync button on the tp link and the sync button on the router   i had to repeat the syncing procedure twice  which the instructions advised could happen  but both    gb and  gb bands connected on the second try    the well written  clear instructions described three ways to sync with a router   i did not try the other two    following the instructions on placement in my home after syncing  it connected to my basement router on both    gb and  gb bands from the second outlet i plugged it into on the floor above   had i tried the second location first  it would have connected on the first try   the device caused static on an fm radio plugged into the outlet i chose  so i plugged in the radio elsewhere in the room  eliminating the static   i plugged it into an outlet in the back wall of my house to optimize its reach to my back yard patio   it expanded my wifi range from the basement router enough to cover my patio with a signal strong enough for all uses but live video chat   incidentally  it improved my signal strength to devices on my second floor  a welcome improvement  though not why i bought it i had meant to buy the newer re     which amazon listed for the same price  and was surprised to receive the re      probably my error   i returned the re    and bought the re     which has a greater range   i now get my best wifi signal by keeping my devices logged into the wifi extender rather than into the router  and it s great to enjoy a video chat and all less demanding wifi activity from my back yard      
49,5.0 ,                       very easy to set up and works perfectly for what i need it for  very happy with it      
50,2.0 ,                       didnt work for me in very densely packed apt     
51,3.0 ,                       this is the lowest rating i have ever given on a product  and i feel badly doing so but the reason i am giving only   stars is due to the lack of features that i feel really should be included in the software   it is easy to set up  and works pretty well from what i can tell so far  but the one major disappointment is forcing me to use the same password on the extended network as i am using on the main router connection   i don t like that   i like to assign a different password to the extended network as that is the network i share with any friends or family that come over   that way i am not allowing for anyone to know the password to the main router and therefor restricting access to it   we all have that geek friend that thinks he she can set things up better than you can   and this normally is not an issue for me as i said i don t normally give out that password   now i am forced to   and it makes no sense   this is the first extender i have ever used that didn t allow for a different password and it really kind of breaks the product for me   i went to the tplink sight and updated the firmware without issue hoping the functionality would have been included but nope   my only hope is that ddwrt is compatible on this little guy because the performance really is pretty good      
52,1.0 ,                       although this device is super easy to set up and it worked great for the  st couple months   now it constantly drops the wifi signal   kids are complaining that they cannot use wifi and essentially the device is not performing it s intended task   boost signal   huge disappointment  here s the deal  if you use the super easy wps configuration  it defaults to an old firmware which does not work   i was loosing     of my bandwidth after the signal boost  after    hrs with tp link tech support the process is lengthy and complicated   you have to unzip the firmware file  follow a ridiculous sequence of steps to configure    i gave up on this     dollar piece of junk   oh  btw tp s   yr warranty is useless too   proceed at your own risk      
53,4.0 ,                       great product      
54,5.0 ,                       it works     
55,5.0 ,                       for the price it s better than the expensive extenders and works good enough to run my xbox one     
56,1.0 ,                       i don t like it  where the issue with that thing is  easy to explain  easy to understand no problem connecting the extender to my wifi network  even nice you can choose bridge mode or its own ssid  works both ways  that was the good part which i rated with   stars it connects to the main network over    ghz channel     mhz wide  can t be changed  plus if you are using an extender you can t vary h with the channel widens anyway because of interference  duh everyone connecting to the extreme are using that channel and overcoming it in seconds and the extender is becoming useless because of it if you are going to use the extender for only a single device or even two not high traffic devices  you wanna buy it  otherwise  please don t waste your money and invest in an ap and a cable   sorry  and it pro here with decades of knowledge  if tot have questions  shoot      
57,1.0 ,                       this was an absolute waste of money  i set it up according to the instructions it worked for an hour or so then the trouble started  the wifi extended connection kept dropping randomly while i was streaming videos or gaming  i thought it was maybe just a one time thing but it is consistent no matter what i do it randomly drops the connection  do not buy this item a complete waste of money spend a little extra and get something that works      
58,5.0 ,                       i am amazed at how well this works and how easy it was to install  i am on xfinity and out side of my house and in my attached garage the signal is spottyor non existent  i pluggeg this unit in  pushed the wps button on the router and it was done  i then relocated the unit to the first floor  the modem is in the basement  and instantly i had a strong signal  even outside  the network is your current network and it carrieers your password with it  if it gets any easier or better than this i cant imagine how  if you need a simple inexpensive solution this is it      
59,1.0 ,                       i bought this without hesitation based on the product reviews and could not wait to get it connected  i have a town house upstairs i get     percent signal  but i needed it for gaming downstairs i was at    percent and was lagging alote  so purchased this thinking it would help me  i went from    to    percent which is horrible i connected the ethernet cable and followed all the steps i was supposed to and nothing      
60,1.0 ,                       doesn t work crapola     
61,4.0 ,                       we have ours in our garage  the  ghz signal does not reach the garage in any usable way  the     reaches the garage at about      so  our re    is in  high speed mode   that is to say  it grabs the     signal and extends it on  ghz band exclusively  we routinely get on the extended  ghz ssid       mbs on our download  that may seem slow  but for     bandwith  that s just  ok   if you are in the room with the main router on     ghz  you may punch up to    mbs  pros    options in advanced mode to receive on one band  extend on the other  thus  not losing much bandwith    extends reasonably well    small footprint   signal covers a room or two cons    no dfs  ghz channels    no more firmware support    no  router  mode where you can extend a wired connection to create a hotspot  this little unit does some things very specifically and does them decently well  if you are in an area of high traffic on the original  ghz band s   channels  you could be in for a bit of interference and congestion  i recommend configuring it in high speed mode to get as much bandwith as possible out of it  don t expect massive coverage especially on  ghz  due to having internal antennas  the best use for the re    is to augment a corner of your place that s on the fringe of the signal  ours i s in the garage and covers that area in addition to the driveway and front porch  by the time your are in the house  the re    becomes very weak  summation  if      mbs download is good enough from the extender  at a cheap price  it s a viable option  if you have a    mbs package and want that full speed into other parts of your property  i d look at another option that supports an access point mode that you can get your full bandwith     
62,5.0 ,                       this has worked great for keeping a stronger signal on the main level of my townhouse  i moved my router upstairs due to working from home and it started making it more difficult to stream netflix and have the kids on their tablets on the main level of the house because the signal was not strong enough  this is totally solved our problems  very glad i took a chance and bought      
63,1.0 ,                       these did not work at all for us  i bought two of them  and for two specific reasons     to extend wifi to my son s room  xbox  and    to extend wifi to a wireless security camera on the side of our house my son not only received an even weaker signal on his xbox  he had problems logging on to anything at all  we unplugged the extenders and sure enough  he got right on  so basically it seemed like the extender was just sucking up the wifi and not actually dispersing any at all or extending it at all same situation with the second  i tested the wifi strength in the camera with and without the extender  and with it  it was at percentages lower than without it  so at least for us  these are useless  id rather spend more    and for reference  this is a      sq foot   story house  im not trying to run wifi to the  west wing  of a mansion       
64,5.0 ,                       now there s  little bit of controversy when it comes to this wifi extender    you have a lot of people that will say it worked for them for like   weeks and then it stopped working  but for mew it works like a charm after i set it up i haven t had to touch it once    i love it     
65,5.0 ,                       i had no problem setting it up and the wifi boost helped so much in the weak part in our house     
66,1.0 ,                       i got two of these for my house to help boost wifi mainly to some security cameras i have around the house set up was pretty straight forward with the computer and worked relitively fast to connect the extenders to my network after getting both extenders going i moved them to their positions near my cameras  check to see how the signal streagth was improving and found a minimal difference from     to     bars  with it place about    away and only one door  no change of door was opened next within about       minutes i lost all the camera feeds for my system  unplugging the extenders fixed the problem  tried to reset and redo the set up but had the same issue  not sure what is going on here  says i have good connection to my router also speed test with phone next to camera without extender was faster  with extender speeds dropped     
67,2.0 ,                       i recommend some other company  i have had   for a couple of years and progressively they have gotten worse i tried to update the firmware today  but it was a logistic nightmare and the tech support person pointed me to firmware that was about the same date i bought the second one and all of this was not user friendly to update since i had to reach out to tech support  i recommend finding another extender and spending more  read the internet reviews of tp link      
68,3.0 ,                       not sure    calls are still not great   but maybe it s my network      
69,5.0 ,                       great  wifi booster  now i can stream in my back yard      
70,5.0 ,                       i was a fios customer   this extender doesn t work well with vrizon router   don t know why   already follow the instruction step by step   my xbox in basement needs stronger signal   got this extender  set it up  no wifi signal   unplug it  and plug it back  there is strong signal but problem is i need to do it every time i turn my xbox on   i was thinking its this extender issue and about to give a  one star comment     months ago i change to spectrum and got a different router from them   then  no such problem anymore  the extender works super well   so i conclude its the router in my case      
71,5.0 ,                       i live in a residential part of socal where one of the local cable companies has seen fit to flood all of the     ghz wifi channels with their  free  wifi transponders  i tried and failed to get a reliable wifi connection from my local wifi to a camera outside on my garage  about    feet away  i connected this thing today as a network  ext using the android phone app  the setup was fairly simple  the camera on my garage now reports      signal strength  this device is located in the garage one of the neat things is that i can connect to this device  as  ext  while sitting right next to my main router  i love it  the price is great  i would absolutely recommend it to a friend      
72,5.0 ,                       helps w  my wifi  my internet was raggedy it would work good in my room and my daughters room but the living room it would buffer  after i bought this and connect the living room to this device it doesn t buffer      
73,1.0 ,                       i bought this  installed it in a few short steps and it was all great  until i ran a speed test      ran a speed test connected with the extender download mbps       with full signal  then reconnected to directly to my router  only   bars signal strength ran the test   download mbps            i literally lost more than         tried the test three times  connecting and reconnecting between the extender and router  tinkered with the extender   not that many setting to be changed    no improvement  it is going back in the box and back to amazon  i am better off with a high speed  weak signal than rock solid  dial up      
74,2.0 ,                       the positive for this device is that it was very easy to setup  the instruction manual had three ways that you could setup the device and the directions were plain and simple the negative is that the device did not extend the range of my wifi  i have one room in my house that has poor wifi connection and i set the device up first in that room  i tested it  and my speed was slower than before  then i had the device set up   ft away from the router and i still couldn t get it to boost the range into my room and the speed was even slower than the first time i tried it  i thought this would be a simple quick fix for the problem but it did not help      
75,1.0 ,                       maybe it s because i m not very tech savvy but it was not as easy to set up as the product was advertised  i ve had for over a month now and never use it because it doesn t work well  again as it was supposed as advertised  i m glad i didn t spend a penny more  as i will most likely cut this as a loss and order a better quality product update  i decided to give it another shot and purchased a better modem router  thinking that would do the trick  it did not and unfortunately  i m no longer within the return window for amazon  i reached out to the tp link customer service and they do not offer a return process  only a replacement process in which you pay to return the item  and wait while they analyze the product  they will only replace it if they determine it is damaged   way too much work for me  so i ll just cut this as a loss      
76,5.0 ,                       i didn t want an expensive or complicated router upgrade so i tried this   for      what could go wrong   wow   my wifi signal reaches effortlessly outside the house and to the spot i like to work outside   i placed the device between the router and the farthest place i wanted it to reach   works great   shows up as a second network connection   plug it in  push the connection button on your router   done   very  very glad i tried this   working at home just got more flexible update     as i was driving away from my house  the extended network connected my phone and continued for about     yards down my road   wow      
77,5.0 ,                       great product  easy set up  my garage is not attached to my house so i needed signal to run my garage cam and it works perfectly      
78,2.0 ,                       i have had this since           i located a convenient spot for the extender  plugged it in and set it up  the coverage i get from it is good but over the course of the year it randomly drops connections on everything   ps   laptop  desktop  cellphone  updating the firmware when new versions come out has not helped this issue  it will sometimes also totally stop broadcasting a signal which requires me to unplug it in order to reset it  i am finally tossing in the towel and looking for a better  reliable range extender      
79,3.0 ,                       it connects to your wifi network and broadcasts it s own  it is simple to set up and configure  although  if you have a network with static ip addresses or anything advanced  this isn t for you  if you use basic settings and dhcp for everything  it should help extend a wifi network to you with better signal but at the cost of download speeds in my speed tests  downloading large files from an ethernet connected server  i got about   mb sec download when connected to the tp link  i got   mb sec when connected directly to my main wifi router  even with a much lower signal strength   when i put the tp link into it s  high speed  mode  my download speeds were cut in half to about  mb sec i would recommend powerlink networking over this for speed and reliability      
80,2.0 ,                       it lasted   months before it completely quit working  during the time it had great wifi signal and it was easy to install  but didn t last long      
81,1.0 ,                       this extender does not support  ghz  as other people mentioned in q a  it did not come with the default password as stated in the manual  must have been returned from previous buyer  returning the item      
82,1.0 ,                       do not buy this product  dont waste your money and time i try to  conect for hours with no resultsi am very upset with amazon for sell this  poor quality items          
83,5.0 ,                       as my room is the only dead spot in the house  i hated having to use my data on my phone     of the time  this really made a difference      
84,5.0 ,                       my asus rt n  u router never had great range  weak to no wifi signal on the second floor  i added a liftmaster garage door opener to a detached garage with a wifi function but couldn t connect due to the weak signal i was inclined to buy a new and better router  but thought to try this range extended first  so far  a couple months later  it s working great  beyond my expectations one fellow showed a picture of his turning brown  the plastic body  from excessive heat  mine so far is warm to the touch     but not hot  based on his experience  i will keep an eye on it  the lower portion of the plastic body of my older sonicare toothbrushes turned a little brown too with my positive result  i ll keep my asus router until it breaks as this  fix  is working fine      
85,4.0 ,                       it does extend the range of my wifi so that i can get in my front bedroom that has trouble picking it up from the router  sometimes it needs to be reset and other times it will pick up what appears to be my wireless printer so i ll have to turn the printer off to make sure it s repeating my router signal  very small print on the device that s hard for me to see  easy to plug in and set up though  many videos on youtube to show you how  good device that does a nice job especially for the price      
86,1.0 ,                       don t buy this  i had to return it  i m a professional network installer as my side job   think hospitals  large facilities   i bought this for my parents  network because they can t stand anything that isn t perfectly matched to their decor  so no visible antennas  it couldn t hang on to the main wifi network s  ghz signal for more than    minutes  i factory reset all their hardware thrice  and it still failed      
87,4.0 ,                       added a security camera at the far end of the house from my router computer room   the camera could connect  it s wifi only  when i had the camera just inside the kitchen window  preparing to mount it outside the window  but when i mounted it    it could only reach the router      not enough  bought this  directions were pretty clear and comprehensible   got it set to  talk to  my router  but had not electric plug in the best midway position  still  it works  the camera is getting        signal  and can talk to my phone through the wifi the nice blue  i m on  light  isn t annoyingly bright  but serves as a nice nightlight in the hallway where it s plugged in   pleased with  s pose it also extends the wifi for my phone  no useful cell signal out here  so i expect i get better reception in the end of the house  haven t checked      
88,4.0 ,                       really made a good difference  nice price point  was easy to install  set up     
89,5.0 ,                       i got the ac    to replace my old netgear n     i have moderate to busy wifi usage in my home i would guess    fire tv s    phones  laptop    echoes  a few smart switches  some plugs  a dozen or so smart bulbs  cameras  nest  etc  having a   gig connection with a router in the basement meant my little single band extender was bottle necking hard trying to handle my upstairs  this gets my    for   reasons  st  the set up was shockingly easy  i already had my router set how i wanted it  i used the wps method to clone my networks  instructions could not have been clearer and simpler  i plugged it in  pushed   buttons  watched the led s do exactly what the instructions said they would  and that was it   done   i was floored  nd  the performance  instantly a noticeable difference  most of my devices instantly recognized the  new  networks  a couple didn t  switches and cameras mostly   i manually connect the ones that didn t and they were up and running a moment later  this uses beam forming for a faster response for deligating data between both channels and avoiding bottle necking  not quite as fast as newer mu mimo tech but still very precise and comes at a fraction of the price  and the tether app that comes with it lets me see if anything needs to be tweaked for the best overall performance if you are hardcore tournament gaming  need massive up and down handling to work from home  or have a basketball team all trying to watch their favorite streams all at once then you probably want to drop       on the biggest and baddest  for what i need in an extender this exceeds my expectations      
90,1.0 ,                       this would not set up easily  i followed the directions using the downloadable app  and it took several tries before our xbox was able to see the new  ext wifi signal  it worked for a couple of hours  then the signal disappeared  i did everything i did in the beginning  repeatedly  to no avail  called customer support  who to their credit answered the phone within a few minutes  and on new years day  but the woman had a strong accent and did not speak english well  and i did not speak her language and had trouble understanding her  she walked me through several steps and eventually told me the serviceable range of the repeater is less than that of my modem  which is a standard comcast supplied modem with a range of       the repeater must be located within     of the modem  and the signal travels      so  a     range      less than the modem itself  why make such a weak repeater to begin with      
91,2.0 ,                       update   this is an update after more than a month of having this in my home   i downgraded my review to   stars and here s why   i am having a lot of issues with this thing maintaining  g connection with my router   it continuously drops out which then causes everything downstairs connected to it  to lose connection   there is no reason why this should be losing its wifi connection  it is only about    feet from my router  nearly directly downstairs   i actually moved it closer to my router and i m still having these problems   i may just get rid of it because the bottom line is it is causing more problems than it solves   most of my major devices downstairs do a better job of staying connected to my router even though the signal strength is low   the only thing i will lose my getting rid of this is the extended range  but it isn t much anyway   maybe i will try a different brand   be warned  during setup if you change the name of the wifi network for this device  you will essentially be creating a different wifi network in your home   this is not what i expected and probably not what you are expecting   i thought that this just extended the range of your current network  well   not exactly   you are actually creating another network with this device  and like i said if you call it something different  you will have to select that network to connect to it   therefore you are much better off leaving the network name the same   that way it shows up as the same network name on your devices that you connect  they will just show whichever has the strongest signal   the directions that are included don t specifically explain this and they probably should besides that it was very easy to setup  only took a few minutes and if you use the connect buttons on your router and this  it will literally take seconds   once it is setup it can be moved from plug to plug and will automatically and quickly re connect you can hide it pretty much anywhere  it kind of looks like a nice plug in air freshener      
92,1.0 ,                       this review is for the tp link tl wa   re     mbps wi fi range extender  i notice many reviews under this listing are for other products    background   we have a large area to cover  i bought the nighthawk router to give us the best possible signal  but there are still areas where coverage could improve the tp link wifi extender was easy to install   i gave   star because it doesn t work  but installation was easy enough   i plugged it in   ft from my router  paired it with the wps button on the router and the wps button on the extender  after going through the expected indicator light changes described in the instructions  i got a steady blue signal indicating successful pairing  i then moved the extender to three separate locations in the house  each time getting the successful pairing steady blue indicator  i shut off my cellular data on my phone  and using the speedtest app on an ios device  check the signal with without the tp link wifi extender  on both    g and  g bands   there was zero indication of any improved signal i then ran through the pairing sequence again to ensure the wifi extender was properly paired with the router  then i tested the signal with and without the wifi extender  again  there was no indication of any improvement some reviews indicated that there would be a duplicate virtual wifi network rebroadcast by the wifi extender  and this would be visible as  yournamednetwork  ext   the instructions  which are brief  did not suggest this would be the case with this iteration of the device  i searched for new network connections with the  ext extension  there were none this device is simple to set up  the form factor is not obtrusive  it s easy to visually check the network status  if it actually worked  i would love it  but after many tests and even running through setup again  i found no indication that this improved my wifi signal      
93,5.0 ,                       i have a   story house with a very frustrating wifi signal up on the second floor  router is on the  st floor  i have moved the router   or   times to different area of the home with no success of getting decent signal through out the home  i have had at t out here   or   times to rectify the situation and all they do is slap another router in and then leave me to pay someone to set back up all the network perimeters we need set here as we have a home office that is more delicate than the usual home network setup as they don t support the network setup we require   i asked them numerous times if there is something i can add onto our router to boost the signal and they always told me no  they kept saying their new router should have no problem reaching through out your house  and even suggested i don t buy an add on well i have had enough so i purchased this very inexpensive product thinking what can i lose  if it doesn t work at least i didn t waste a bunch of money like they told me not to do so i just plugged this in by wps setup  very easy  and then found a solid place to plug it in on the second floor where i get strong signal and bam  i now have signal in one of my rooms i could never get signal in no matter where i put our original router  if this just solved my problem i will be making a formal complaint to at t  i am tired of so called professionals not knowing what the h    their talking about now this is a little early to say it has fixed all my problems and will update this post if this little jewel has any problems with my office network setup  but if it continues to work so easily  so quickly without any future problems i would say buy this as quick as you can as i just had one of the easiest  quickest  setups with     percent results on a    dollar piece of equipment i have ever had  i hope this was my answer to my frustration for   years now      
94,2.0 ,                       updated  got it working  still a piece of junk  says  strong  signal and is apparently higher than my router yet can t load videos nearly as fast as going back to my  medium weak  router signal  this thing literally makes no sense the whole way through the manual mode straight up doesn t work the website mode is so backwards that i keep getting errors  it ll tell me everything is set up ready to go then requires me to check a box to  finish  which causes all of my work to undo completely and reverts back to nothing there is no support really  the videos online are the wrong models for the videos and don t tell you how to troubleshoot if you have any issues  it s like they tried this on one type of router and went  well that s it  it works just fine  i don t even care if i get it working  the review is staying this low because of all the wasted time when it should be as simple as pressing two buttons      
95,3.0 ,                       it lasted exactly   months  took an act of congress to get it programmed and connected but once connected  it worked great   for exactly   months  now it will locate the modem wifi but won t connect through it to the internet  the return window is only    days long  so  i can t return it  live and learn i suppose     bucks down the drain  my unsolicited advice   don t buy this one  you get what you pay for      
96,1.0 ,                       i bought this hoping to get better signal upstairs  and it actually made it worse   sitting next to my router  i get    mbps see pics  when i go upstairs  where i m hoping to increase my strength  it s at about   mbps   after about    min of trying to get it linked  i ended up with less signal    see pics  ok so maybe the extender isnt close enough to the router   so i sit in my front room not where the router is   link to my standard wifi  i get    mbps  so i know where i m at has great signal   i put the extender in that room   sitting in the same spot  where i just got      i link to the extender  and i get   mbps   so out of curiosity i bring it upstairs  i got   mbps where i used to get     this just wasted an hour of my time oh and as far as customer service line  i waited on hold for    minutes  just to have them tell me  i won t get a speed increase in my dead zones i ll just get a connection   which makes no sense at all      
97,5.0 ,                       yes  this was a perfect remedy to my bandwidth woes  i m on a voice over ip working from home and have to share bandwidth with all the members of my family during this covid epidemic i was having call quality issues and slow responding internet  i thought i would have to buy all new equipment to try to maximize my internet signal and then i came across this little gem  what a difference this made for not only my internet speed but also my call quality  got it for    bucks with taxes but for me it s priceless my kids can play fortnite and i can get my work done all at the same time without any bandwidth issues  god bless these nerds       
98,3.0 ,                       the description says it s good for    sqft  this means that the signal will reliably travel about    feet from the antenna and they aren t lying  the speed is also pathetic  standing next to the extender  i get about   mbps connected to it  in the same location connected to the router i get over    mbps  this is with the latest firmware  of course  before i updated it i could only get about  mbps  setup is easy  though  so i guess that s a plus  if you only need to get a signal around a corner i guess this will work      
99,5.0 ,                       i purchased this wifi extender after installing blink security cameras around my home and realizing the wifi wasn t strong enough to provide a signal on the outside walls of my house  this was one of the cheapest extenders available  so i thought i d give it a try  i plugged it up in an outlet in my garage and began the installation  to begin  you need to download the device s app onto your phone  it gives you the option of setting up directly on a website too  but i chose the app option  it was easy to download the app via a qr code they provided  the app walks you thru the installation process step by step  from start to finish  unboxing to operational  the setup process took me   minutes after it was installed  my wifi signal was full strength throughout my house  in my garage  and around the perimeter of my home where all my cameras were installed  cameras that received no signal previously are now fully operational with no issues  this is definitely worth the money to ensure no weak signals or breaks in signals  especially if you rely on it for something as important as your home security system      
100,5.0 ,                       we just got this and i was anticipating an tricky install  it took me only a few minuets and was pretty easy here s how i did it plug it in next to routerpress wps on the router and extender and let it do its thing  once it s solid blue  and you can find the extender on your wifi  you can unplug and move itplug it in between the router and the dead spot  i hit the button on the extender again and waited a minuet boom  done  full wifi in my dead room      
101,5.0 ,                       a lot of reviews complained that this is just a  repeater   but this is exactly what the purpose is supposed to be   if you need something different  you should not be looking at something in this price range   this product works exactly as it describes   it connects to your existing wifi and broadcasts another network  which by default is the same name with  ext added to the end   you can change the name if you want to as well   you can also run a wire to this extender  and make it work at a location where you have no wifi or weak signal i used mine in the default manner  to connect a smart oil gauge that had trouble connecting to my wifi router   now i have no issues and it connects reliably   definitely worth the inexpensive price to make things work   i plan to use this only for  utility  like iot devices  no phones  computers  etc      
102,1.0 ,                       update  it s been three days after their customer service said they would send me a replacement request email  nothing  no email responses  no help  their customer service is terrible  i am extremely disappointed because i bought this based on the wirecutter recommendation it worked great   until it didn t  i ve had this device for   months and it just stopped working one day  it was in a safe place and no damage  i tried resetting it several times  when that didn t work  i called their customer service and was on the phone for   hours  they just kept telling me that my computer wasn t compatible  it was compatible for   months   i didn t think so at first but now it s obviously a cheap product if it just stops working after a few months  waste of money      
103,2.0 ,                       only works half the time      
104,5.0 ,                       short version  when used appropriately  this is a great device at a great price  simple installation options and useful features  stronger wireless transceivers than my netgear cable modem router  the key here is a lot if not most people don t know how or when to use these devices   so i ll try to help with that below long version  let s assume you re buying this for your home to extend existing wifi coverage  before you do anything  conduct an analysis of existing networks in your area and what frequencies and channels they are using  on    ghz  channel       and    do not overlap  ideally  you want to be using one of these channels without anyone else nearby using it so go ahead and reconfigure your router to meet that criteria  there aren t any overlapping channels on  ghz and it may be used less by your neighbors so that could be worth pursuing for you as well  next  try moving your wifi router around to find the ideal spot to cover the entire house  if your router has external antenna s   you can try using a more directional antenna if you think that ll help and your router has connections for it or reorienting existing antennas  if you find a perfect configuration with this that works everywhere in the home  run a new cable to that location for your internet if necessary and you re done and didn t need this device now on to tips for setting up this device  use a different ssid than your existing one by appending something like   ext   this will help you troubleshoot any issues in the future and help get you on the right network at the right times  do upgrade the firmware on it after initial setup  keep in mind  no affordable repeater seamlessly bounces you to whichever device has the best signal at any given second  that is handled by the client  i e  your phone  laptop  etc  and it s not always perfect  i haven t tried it  but i think this device can be wired to your router  that is the best way to use this  but may not be required depending on your situation  if extending it using only wifi  put it somewhere that has decent signal already and will reach to where you re lacking signal the power schedule and led on off schedules are nice touches  it increased my coverage and bandwidth  x where i needed it to after an easy      minute setup including getting the firmware and applying it  i am a former networking professional  i didn t go in to extreme detail because this is a review  not a blog   research anything i mentioned where you have questions and the info is out there  or have a buddy help you with it or a company that does residential on site work and don t let them bill you more than an hour and a trip charge      
105,5.0 ,                       worker for my simple setup to move my home phone base station to another location      
106,5.0 ,                       i use this unit to stretch the wifi signal to my detached garage   works great   i chose to use the same network name as my main house router   you can name it to another network name too if you like   wish i bought this years ago instead of struggling with poor signal      
107,5.0 ,                       i read the brief instructions  followed them and voila    this took less than   minutes to install and it works great  it solved my connectivity problems  i guess i should tell you i am    years old and i had no problem installing this  that s how easy it is  my husband was amazed since he has no experience with tech stuff and was positive i would have to call someone to help me   well  i didn t and now the internet is mine       
108,4.0 ,                       i have to jiggle the setup process several times because the onemesh thing they have with the router  onemesh integrates the extenders and the main router seamlessly  is awesome but doesn t play well with security systems that use the wifi i also have a router filter that has to be configured with all those things  it still works it just isn t super intuitive and easy if you have iphones and computers and don t have a router filter or security system  this works really really well with a tp router  i have the archer a    a  or      tp link router everyone s situation will be different but i think the signal extension works great  but not as far as i initially expected   i was hoping for   ft more of strong signal and got     it works for what i need just had hoped to get more  house material and placement have a lot to do with that i m happy with it overall      
109,5.0 ,                       this improved our wifi speed     
110,5.0 ,                       this extender is fantastic if you need a little extra boost in your signal  we have a router in the living room and our office is pretty far away so we put this in the office  we always have full bars on our desktop computer with this and it s never faltered  strangely we even get a quality signal from our extender when our actual wifi signal is weak  on occasion so i sometimes connect to it instead from far away  it also has an ethernet connection just in case which i like  i have also moved this around to see how it reconnects and we normally have no problem just plugging it back in and pressing the button to reboot  it is however a little difficult to initially connect to your router  but if you read the instructions thoroughly it will work for you      
111,5.0 ,                       the best     
112,4.0 ,                       i m not a tech person so it took me some time to figure out how to install      
113,5.0 ,                       i own a number of tp products so have been pleased with their performance  i ve had an issue with wifi upstairs as my router is in the basement style  the unit is sleek and relatively sikish so i don t feel bad having it out in the open since there are no ugly antennas  the plugs are non grounded so if you have older outlets without a ground plug  no fear as there is no additional  rd pin setup   i ll start by saying that setup is  breeze  if you have wps then it s a simple button click to pair  my router did not  since it s ancient  but the extender came with very clear  easy to follow instructions which allowed me to set up in about    minutes tops via a quick website login range  most important is the range  this worked fansastically  with the router in the basement i was never able to get wifi outside in the backyard or strong service upstairs  with the additional of the extender i am able to get wifi a good way into the backyard for phones  comps  etc  so it passes the range and speed test networks  this will offer both     and  ghz networks despite whether you have both neworks offered with your router  though also has disable options for eithe   in other words  my ancient router only has a     ghz signal and this extender will take that signal and then broadcasts the same network in  ghz  alternatively  during setup if your router already has a  ghz signal  it will ask you to select that network  my suspicion is that if it is acting as a  ghz extender of a    ghz network it ll have to convert back to     at some point since the router is the main hub to the modem  that said  not      here but it does offer great  ghz options as wellwired connectivity  did not use this feature but also offers wired connectivity for devices such as xbox which need a wired port  in other words it ll draw signal from the wifi and create a wired port to plug your device  a neat feature device modes  there are two modes  one of which will act as a range extender which simply is a booster of signal and repeater  using this keeps your wifi network name and password and all your devices won t know anything changed  so no need to change your passwords or re log in  the second option is using the device to create a second network  which  while i didn t use this setting  would imply that a new password and network would be set up  potentially for guests   but use your old network behind the scenes to connect   that said  no connection issues on the booster and extender feature website app  easy to navigate  easy to use features and good design  also offers tether app to control and manage the device from your mobile device so very convenient ad well  will leave it at thisoverall  very happy with the purchase and wound highly recommend to anyone looking for extender or booster      
114,5.0 ,                       needed an additional boost to my wifi signal  placed this bad boy right in the middle of my home and i have extended wifi throughout  very easy to set up and i felt like i got a bargain on this item  would highly recommend      
115,5.0 ,                       this extender works great  install took me an hour only because i didn t realize my wps was off on my router  once i turned it on the extender connected immediately and i couldn t be happier with it  i recently redecorated my bedroom and moved our bed which made the distance the furthest in the house from my router i was seeing   bar on my ipad  i located extender    from my bed and boom i had full bars  and let me tell you my house is  not small at      sq ft  i didn t even put extender at     way point between router and my room as recommended   the extender picked up the very weak signal and bumped it up to full  iam still in shock at the result and glad i didn t have to throw     away ona fancy over priced extender      
116,5.0 ,                       two of our upstairs bedrooms have never had good wi fi strength  our home is a little over       sf so the one router just never reached the farthest rooms  but we just  lived with it  for years however  i recently converted the rooms to a craft room and a nursery nook for grandchildren and along with that installed two tvs with amazon firesticks  echo dots  use of my laptop  etc  and really needed reliable wi fithis product arrived on a sunday afternoon   i had it installed in under    minutes and immediately one tv firestick combo went from  good connection  to  very good connection  and the other tv firestick went from  fair connection  to  very good connection  laptop  while located in area of concern  upload speed went from     to         note  as others have stated   this extender is not meant to provide speeds greater than your service provider supports  but it does allow you to have the full benefit of your wi fi speed in all areas of your house would highly  highly recommend this product      
117,5.0 ,                       i ll admit i ve only had this for one day  but what a day it s been  i d previously gone about    days with limited to no wifi in my room  for context  my room is the farthest room back in the house  and it s on the second floor  our router and modem are located on the first floor  close to the front of the house  where the ethernet port is located  though my other two roommates  whose rooms are closer to the front  were able to get full wifi without this extender  i just couldn t  i spent a grand total of ten minutes  not even  honestly  installing the extender yesterday  and since then  it s been lightspeed fast in my room  i missed this  if this somehow stops working properly  i ll update this review  because it s only been one day  but wow this is nice      
118,5.0 ,                       my wifi coverage on my patio was hit or miss  i would often get cell phone calls dropped when talking on the patio   i use wifi calling at home because verizon coverage sucks here in my urban neighborhood   verified by verizon who told me to use wifi calling   i thought adding this wifi range extender was just the solution i needed  i continue to get dropped calls and spotty service on the patio after installing the range extender inside the patio door update   after writing the review above  i decided to check in depth as to why the coverage was so bad  i unplugged the extender and checked the wifi coverage without it at the patio door inside the house  it was one bar out of three  i moved the extender closer to my router where i have two bars of coverage   obviously in the room with the router is three out of three bars   plugging the extender into the outlet where i had two bars of coverage  increased the coverage to three bars  i walked to the patio door and still have three bars of coverage  outside on the patio it now shows between two and three bars  where before it was between zero and one  this is what the instructions say to do   don t put your wifi extender right by the place where you need coverage  but put it between the location where coverage is needed and the wifi router  this worked for me and i m increasing the rating from   stars to   stars      
119,1.0 ,                       i have an l shaped brick rancher  our office with the router is at the far end of the l  there is a brick   season room at the center  the bedrooms are in the other wing of the house  in the end bedrooms i kept dropping wifi to my phone  no probs with installation of the extender  but no matter where i placed it  i would get the red led and sometimes it would go green  in the bedrooms i would only get wifi for a few minutes at a time  not worth the frustration  the signal is much better without the extender  so i have removed it  the cause of this problem may be all the brick in the house   not sure      
120,4.0 ,                       we purchased this wifi extender to be able to stream hd video  netflix   prime video  etc   to tv s at the other end of our house  setup was fairly straightforward  but there were a few setbacks  the first attempt was using the app recommended by the seller  it had connection issues  a call to tech support resulted in being put into a queue for  the next avaiable  person   so while waiting we went to our laptop and did the setup there without issues   never did speak to support  the extender supports both     ghz and   ghz  once setup  we were  able to connect the roku s at the remote tv s and stream away  happy with the extender  setup was less than trivial  but not bad once we were able to connect to the extender      
121,5.0 ,                       it has worked great for about   hours now  my router is downstairs and had worked great upstairs with full bars on my phone for over a year  suddenly even with full bars or almost full it often doesn t work and i ll get msgs on my phone saying i have no internet  i purchased this extender because the reviews are good and it s so affordable  prices in local stores are about     up  initially it didn t work for about a week  set up was easy  i got the two lights on on the extender and i could connect to the extension with my devices but there was no internet  this was confirmed by connecting my laptop to the extender with the cable and using the tether app which showed no connection from the router but that the router was working  a restart of my router worked instantly and the wifi speed has been great upstairs  tomorrow morning i will try outside to see how much signal i get out there      
122,1.0 ,                       so i had this product for about a month now and i used it so that i can plug my computer in upstairs and have it tethered to the downstairs router and a bit of wifi boost is always a plus  however while the tether part worked wonderfully  it created issues with all my wireless equipment upstairs  it never wanted to release any devices that linked to it so now instead of extending the wifi through out the house  it made all the devices connect to it instead of my downstairs router and thus making the wifi incredibly slow  if you have a smart house  smart bulbs plugs  alexa  etc  do not buy as it will slow the network down to point my google home kept glitching itself out tl dr  only worth it to use as a wireless router  not worth it for wifi tether     
123,5.0 ,                       we have some guests coming in a couple of weeks from another state that s going to be camping on our property  what s a wi fi extender so that they could actually have internet access if they needed while they were chanting from the tent outback  the picture represents approximately     to     feet of distance from the wi fi extender  i think for the price that is an excellent value since our current louder only gives us about    seat maybe    feet and radius from the house actually not radius but circumference from the central location of the router  we live in a tiny house which is a metal pole building so that may prohibit some of the distance of the router signal  however i m sitting typing this review at the range of i m going to say at least        i will be trying out wi fi projector to see how it operates with the wi fi extender so stay tuned i may update this review      
124,5.0 ,                       while this extender is only shown as good  above  it works fine for me  i set it up in my shop     feet from my wifi router  i have a very slow internet connection    mps down   this extender not only picks up the signal but allows me to watch videos and stream music in the shop  when i run a speed test in the shop  it s   mbs down  the udp transmission compensates for the slowness and with only very minor lag      
125,2.0 ,                       update            really not very good  it s only    ghz and goes down a lot and has to be turned off  i tried naming it the same as my existing wifi name and that created all kinds of problems  it really has to be named to something else which created a new network which sucks  don t buy it i bought this thing to add an extender for my existing google wifi network  i didn t want to buy another google wifi device for my network because it s another        i bought this at a fraction of the cost because it had free returns   super easy to setup with the tether app that was a free download   extended my network just fine   i would definitely buy this if you want a simple wifi extender that works and works with google wifi at a small cost      
126,1.0 ,                       i found the set up to be very easy  press two buttons and wait for the light to stop blinking and then login to the extended network  i tried it in all kinds of different places around the house and in every single case except for one the wi fi signal from my router was much stronger than the wi fi signal from the extender  the only time that they were similar was when they were in the same room  i finally went to the room where my office is to test it the two signals  as you can see  photos  the higher one is with my router and the lower one is when i connect to the extender  the router basically makes my signal worse and i m better off without it  i m very disappointed  i know it was only      but if it makes my signal     of what i could get without it what s the point  i ve already arranged to returned it  maybe it will work for you  are you feeling lucky      
127,1.0 ,                       looses connection every couple days have to unplug and plug back in     
128,5.0 ,                       i am not one to leave reviews  but after seeing how this little guy works  i headed straight here to leave one my son upgraded his computer to a nice gaming setup  and because of our home layout  we rent  so not much we can do about it  our modem router is on one side of the house and he is on the other   needless to say  constant lag and spotty connection   i was prepared to ask the landlord if i could pay to have a line installed on the other side of the house when a friend recommended this it is easy to set up  with multiple ways to do so   i used the wps option  which literally involved pushing a button on the router and then one on the device   in   minutes  it was ready to go   moved it to a halfway point between the router and his room and within another   minutes  this little dude was showing full signal strength and was fully functional check the bedroom computer and he s at full signal as well   i expected it to make a difference   but this far exceeded my expectations easy to set up  effective signal boosting   this item is worth every penny      
129,4.0 ,                       it was hard to get this working  i tried for over an hour and looked at other reviews for advice  i restarted it multiple times and followed the instructions  i finally found a solution that involved going to their website and downloading new drivers  after that  it s worked fine  i almost paid over      for a different solution  glad i got this to work  it was very reasonably priced and did what it said  but it shouldn t be so hard to get going as other reviewers have said     
130,2.0 ,                       i couldn t get it to work right so i went to tp link website and contacted customer support through chat     the a phone call and after they checked my network  they said they had to fix a few things on my end and they even had access to my poaypakl account so i felt no choice but to pay them     they did get the extender to work correctly  even though i still get buffering on my wyze pan cam  the v  works fine but my nest thermostat keeps going offline  and it s on the same wall as the wifi extender  and my ring doorbell now has about a       second lag    all in all  i probably could have lived without this thing and saved      unit plus tech support      i was really worried about tech support because they aren t actual tp link employees  my payment went to an email  back work usa  that obviously wasn t a tp link company email and i allowed them access into my computer which then lead to total access of my network      i changed many of my passwords afterwards but i still wonder if they can gain access     
131,5.0 ,                       like most wifi devices  it takes a little to get it on your wifi network   like bluetooth headphones  it has to do this without a display or way to  see  what its doing while you do this   this device was easy to connect with the wps option on it and my router  it immediately came up on my phone and tablet and uses the same password as the primary router you are connecting it to   the signal is very strong  the only drawback is that it now extends off of my property and out to the street  so a hacker driving by will now have a strong signal to try to get into my network  my main router is in the back of the house  but my bedroom is in the front  so its a risk reward issue  plus i have good security on my network   so it was exactly what i was expecting  and worked just the way i wanted  very pleased      
132,4.0 ,                       easy to install   must move when i move   boosts the wifi signal as i had hoped      
133,5.0 ,                       install was easy  wifi signal is strong  everything i needed  my apartment gets no cellular service and my wifi calling and whatnot just wasn t cutting it   love this product  it saved my life  i highly recommend      
134,5.0 ,                       yes  i literally am so glad i came to amazon    looked this up   my home is about       sq ft so i only needed the one for     sq ft  most of my wifi has coverage yet the end of my home doesn t too many windows   loss of some coverage due to the area of my ethernet router  i plugged it into my hallway toward the end where coverage gets weak    success we booming      best part is we can finally watch our tvs in our room    price was   times better than walmart in store price of      plus tax order now     primequeen     
135,1.0 ,                       this extender is a real life saver  but it s annoying because i have to reboot it everyday  it s a mild inconvenience  but an inconvenience nonetheless  for some reason  when i first connect to it the internet won t work unless i go into the app settings and reboot it  then it works just fine update  changing my score to   star  it s way too much of an inconvenience to have to go into the app and reset the device everytime i want to connect to it  gonna toss this as soon as i buy a replacement      
136,4.0 ,                       would highly recommend this product  works amazing     
137,4.0 ,                       the tp link n    was super simple to set up  assuming you have a wps button  plugin the extender close to the router  hit the wap button on the router and then on the extender  wait for the blue light to be steady and it s programmed  now go put it where you need your signal extended and plug it back in and you re done  it will create a new wireless name   original ext   that you ll need to connect to i have a metal shop that is     from the house  i didn t have any signal inside the shop  i put the extender in the garage  closest point to the shop  and now i can get     bars in the shop  my download speed is about     of the speed from my home router but that is sufficient for my needs      
138,4.0 ,                       works well for the price     
139,5.0 ,                       spotty signal problem   router located in fr on shelving  and using a laptop in lr which was located on an  l  path of     and then a     right   signal was spotty on any given day and web pages would crash   bought extender knowing it will divide bandwidth in       plugged tp link into power bar near router and pressed wps button on both router and extender     minutes later both bands were lit   unplugged it and moved it     to an outlet and within   minutes i had   green lights and laptop appears to be happy   n b   the laptop is a yoga  ultrabook with win   and in the fr a speed test running on battery would score             in the lr            the extender trades off speed and yet its location is far from perfect with a grand piano adjacent   it appears the router delivers a bit more than     to the extender and the extender delivers roughly     to the laptop   or a    rd     rd of bandwidth available   roughly   the upload speeds are not diminished in any way   remember to use wps right out of the box adjacent to the router and then re locate and think line of sight for optimal performance      
140,2.0 ,                       stopped working after   months  so disappointed  i have to keep resetting it but it stops working  it keeps getting disconnected to my wifi  so annoying     
141,5.0 ,                       i ve been struggling for a couple years to find a reliable wifi extender at a reasonable price   after   months  no complaints which puts this one leaps ahead of the other   i ve tried      
142,5.0 ,                       does what it s suppose to     
143,3.0 ,                       the documentation  app and web interface is extremely lacking   it works once you are able to get into the configuration  that alone is a nightmare  the tether app tells you to  connect  through the web interface and go back to the app  well  the web interface doesn t work on a phone  you create a password then it tells you to login with the password you just created and it just keeps prompting you for the password over and over again  the app tells you that you are not connected  the way i got around this was to connect to the device through my pc s wifi and use a regular desktop browser     there is zero documentation on the access point feature    hours and numerous factory resets later it is in place and working fine      
144,4.0 ,                       this is a great little product  it works fairly well  though it has issues where a strong signal must be maintained like with gaming or wifi calling   also  it uses a dedicated channel and so my wifi will often switch between this and the other channel when a channel is lost  but then not connect back  despite being very weak even when i return to the room with my main router  then i m left with a very weak signal and must manually switch back  i m sure they would make it all one network if that was easy  but it is probably impossible  still a nice product      
145,4.0 ,                       the extender definitely works better than trying to just use a router from another room  i do have to point out that setup via web browser does not work  but i was able to setup my wifi extender using the app      
146,1.0 ,                       i bought   of these at once a while back when they were on sale and for the first week or so of using one of them it worked fine but  then as time went on it started randomly losing connection and then after a while it would reboot itself or start working again on it s own   this has been a random thing for the past   weeks   then i decide last weekend to open the other new one and set it up to replace the first one that wasn t working reliably   the second one is not acting right during the setup process for some reason   the first one set up super easily and i was impressed with how easy it was to set it up manually simply by using a laptop connecting to it over wi fi   super easy to connect it to the wireless router and then create the extended network and easy to update the firmware   i have reset this second one several times trying to get it to where i can just update the firmware which i hope will resolve what ever issue it has but  i can t get it to cooperate   i ran out of time this past weekend and will mess with it some more this next weekend but  i don t hold out much hope   so my words of advice are to spend a bit more money for a more reliable wi fi extender      
147,5.0 ,                       i needed an extender to boost the signal to one of my blink xt  cameras   first i tried an extender from netgear at the whopping price of        after two frustrating days of repeated setup it would drop the backhaul signal within    minutes of moving to the desired in  range location   i returned it to the retail store completely frustrated   i found the tp link re     bundled with a wyze camera at an unbeatable low price   i added to my cart with very low expectations   setup was a breeze   i held my breath and moved it to the garage   the location function in the app showed it was in an excellent location   i used the high speed option to use the  ghz connection as the backhaul for the    ghz channel   along came a firmware update which i reluctantly installed thinking this extender is working so well i don t want to mess it up   it has run flawlessly in my garage   not once has it lost the signal from the router   the signal to the camera is now five bars instead of one   my car easily connects to it for navigation updates  my iphone connects when located closer than the router   even my ring doorbell has a strong connection reporting a rssi of      all using one network ssid   i m considering buying another one for an ethernet connection required where i can t run cable     
148,2.0 ,                       so i ve had wifi extenders before anybody even knew they were a thing  not a brag just saying i ve had years of experience with them  the early ones could be a hassle to get it connected to your wifi but when they did oooh doggies boy did they amplify the signal   so tplink has taken care of one issue but added another all while skimping on the whole reason to buy the thing  amplified wifi coverage   i get worried so to be brief  they simplified connecting your router to the unit  they made that very easy   the extra issue they ve added is one of the ways they made it easy was to use their tether app  it connects quickly and lets you monitor who all is connected  the problem is you have to agree to a privacy policy that would choke a horse but you can always use another method to connect and not use the app   as for wifi coverage i need this  because i m in a guest house with the router in the main house  in the past the other wifi extenders i have used in the same house with the same router i was able to connect them in the middle of the house no problem allowing them to amplify the wifi everywhere  although this unit was able to connect to the router and get set up where i normally keep it it  when it came time to use it i could not get the solid red light  too far from router  to turn off and turn solid blue  close enough to router  until i took it outside and had to run an extension cord to the garage for it to work  so yes it extends the wifi but only to half of the house i could get a signal from the main router from anyway  not as strong a signal but i could still connect   overall i ll trade the easy set up for a real wifi extenders that can latch onto a weak router signal  pump that baby up and blast it across the house   this is the equivalent of low water pressure in your shower  yeah it gets you wet but barely and not in the places you need it to      
149,1.0 ,                       this keeps going out  i finally just gave up and unplugged it  it s too late to return or get my money back  i kept trying  it seemed hopeful but it is definitely hopeless  i m s o l and can t return or get my money back for this product  it arrived on time but i gave it too much time and it would work then fail miserably  dissatisfied and disssappointed  don t buy this product and wait for a miracle  if it doesn t work  return immediately because it won t work in the long run  i tried everything and customer support is not so supportive  really wish i had returned this   oh well  money down the drain and taking up space      
150,5.0 ,                       the wifi signal is great and strong     
151,5.0 ,                       it is only a    ghz band which if you don t know the     is range and a  ghz is for speed  my samsung tv usually disconnects from the internet the next day and its a pain to enter the pass  so i use this extender downstairs with a ethernet cable connecting the tv with this extender to keep it connect to the tv  while the modern is upstairs usually downstairs has slowing connection speeds  so  i can also connect to the extender that is downstairs with my devices to get the best internet   pretty good device to extend the internet range  if you want to extend for gaming get a dual  ghz and connect it with an ethernet cable with your pc and it should work if the internet connection isn t reaching that far      
152,4.0 ,                       once i broke down and called tech support  things went a lot easier  what i mean is the directions could have been a bit more detailed as far as trouble shooting they should say to definitely change the name of the tp link ext from your networks name to something  anything else  that was a big part of the problem  also to just go ahead and reboot your router  i think that would be much better than messing around with the guesswork the actual setup was pretty easy it does seem to have made my internet somewhat faster  at least on my ipad  the reason that i bought an extender to begin with was to strengthen the wifi signal to the front bedroom television  i ll be able to tell more later in the day when i turn that on      
153,1.0 ,                       installed as directed  but zero difference in wifi     
154,1.0 ,                       this was very easy to setup and provided full signal strength in the location i placed it  however  it only provided minimal speed  my tp link archer c  router provided      mbps at    ghz  i immediately switch over to this extender and get    mbps  i finally had my high speed internet installed and functional yesterday i test my connection throughout my home and find that my download speed is terrible when connected to this device  to make it worse    i am   day past the return period    day this device is great if you simply want connectivity without caring if the speed is consistent with your router and service  but i doubt many folks are ok paying for      mbps service and only getting    mbps      
155,3.0 ,                       instructions are pretty straightforward and easy to understand  i tried the   different ways to pair it to my home modem  using my cellphone was the easiest and fastest way to connect for me  make sure to rename your device because the instructions will not tell you to rename it   moved it to an area to cover my weak wifi spot in my home  connected   devices in that room and connection was easy and no issues   two days later my devices are not working and can t use the wifi  they are connected to the extender but  there is a problem with connection   i easily fixed this problem by unplugging the extender  my   devices are connected again  but this issue keeps happening every few days  i m okay with that but last time it happened i can t connect no matter how many times i unplug it  i even reset the device and then going through the whole thing of setting it up all over again   this temporarily fixed the issue and the same issue kept happening every few days  i can t take this because my devices that connect to the extender are wifi cameras and they are pretty much useless if they can t connect      
156,2.0 ,                       i was obviously looking to extend my isp provided wi fi signal to help with some outdoor security cameras i installed   the extender is on the main floor of my home about     away from my router pros  very simply to setup  it helps my wi fi to reach the exterior camera that was struggling to detect my router cons  doesn t recover from a power blip well  has to be unplugged plugged back in and of course only when you notice   another exterior camera that is roughly     away with nearly line of sight  isn t able to detect a strong signal so the range of the extender seems pretty limited which is an obvious bummer considering its purpose overall  i was able to accomplish my purpose but based on other reviews  was hoping for a much stronger signal at greater distances   would recommend if trying to extend a signal in an open space but am skeptical it would function well through multiple walls floors of a home      
157,1.0 ,                       i bought this after having read the reviews and i m not sure why  but it simply didn t work for me   i bought it for an outside room   it did have to reach beyond a washer and dryer and maybe that was just too much   i noticed that even walking outside the house  the signal was very weak already  even with the extender   by the time i got to the outside room  it was mostly gone   i tried different outlets  as it is suggested  and to no avail   i did return it  and that was pretty easy  just took some time out of the day   but the return process was over all pretty easy      
158,1.0 ,                       bought this to extend my signal in my bedroom and my backyard   setup was very easy   the app makes that process go quick   it defaults to create an extended secondary wifi network not for instance my main wifi ssid is micasa and after setup it created micasa ext   so that means if you want to connect you d have to select that ssid from any device associated to your original   not very useful right   but i thought maybe i can balance my devices and help speed   for instance all kids devices go to the ext signal here s the bottom line  whether ext or if i make the device broadcast the same ssid as my main router the speed sucks   like really bad   netflix buffers  pages take long   it s like you can see in your mind nytimes com jump from your phone through this device  think  then go to my other router  then my internet router and out to the world and then come back   it s slow   it s bad   i wish i could return it and get my money back   but i just don t have the energy     down the hole   i wouldn t suggest this   you get what you pay for   if you have internet speeds slower than    mbps you probably won t see a difference   otherwise invest in something more expensive with a reputable name brand      
159,4.0 ,                       easy setup after loading required app and so far works for my application  wish i had the choice of it being a mesh type extender  reasonably priced though     
160,4.0 ,                       i was extremely surprise at how easy this thing was to set up  you have three different options  by pressing the wps button  using the app  i personally recommend using this method   or via a browser  it s super easy to install  i think anyone could do it as for the wifi signal  don t expect this to be as fast as your router  using this will also create a lot of latency  so loading things make acutally take longer even though you may have a faster download speed  i totally do not recommend this for gamers  the ping you get with this is unbearable  however  for the average user who needs a better connection somewhere in their house  i totally recommend this  there are a few things you should keep in mind though     it is only up to    mbps  so if you are paying for anything more  you won t be achieving full potential  even though i have    mbps and the most i got with this thing was   mbps  with a ethernet connection from the plug into my computer       it only emits a    ghz signal  if you did not know there are two frequencies wi fi operates at  there s      and           is much faster but does not travel as far or as efficiently  and     is much slower but has a much larger range  so again  if you need anything more than      mbps this is not the product for you  for the average joe  who just needs to browse his email or maybe watch a video or to  this works great for any dead zones of your house all in all  i would recommend this to anyone who doesnt need blazing fast speeds or good ping latency and just wants to patch up any dead zones of your house      
161,1.0 ,                       didn t work very well  signal wasn t enough  in fact  why device i tried to connect just kept searching without end for internet connection      
162,5.0 ,                       this is a great product and easy to use  it is very effective in amplifying your wi fi signal which clears up a lot of signal problems when you are streaming  i started out with the later model which works just fantastic  then when they came out with this model i had just bought lg new oled tv as well as an xbox one s  both of these units need great wi fi speed to bring you the clearest picture possible  and this unit was just the trick  it works fantastic  i have never had a problem with it  my streams are flawless  it has his work cut out for it since we have about    devices in the room for it to magnify the signal  but it does it beautifully with its dual capacity  the indicator lights give you an idea on how well the unit is operating  it syncs up with your router with just a press of a button  once all the indicator lights have litten up then the extender is ready for relocation  once you get to your location just simply plug it in and it does the rest  fantastic flawless streaming or any other applications that you may wish to do with it  a     great product and buy  btw these are good for one large room at a time      
163,3.0 ,                       did not meet my expectations little to none in difference streaming from router      
164,5.0 ,                       easy setup     
165,5.0 ,                       i wanted this so i could get wifi coverage for several electrical outlets with wifi plugs so i could  for example  say  alexa  coffee on  or  lights on off   etc   it s not hard but took several tries before i got the hang of it because the instructions  hah  were unclear   i to link each plug device to the extender by its id number and then link the extender to my network   i m not sure i d use this for additional coverage  for example  for a laptop or ipad tablet because i can t figure out how to secure the wifi from the device to the extender and my network   if someone sees the extender wifi  they might use it because it s unsecured and then somehow get into my otherwise password protected and secure wifi   i m not sure   but it seems like a weakness   if someone taps into my wifi on off plug   no big deal unless they get their jollies messing with a coffee pot      
166,5.0 ,                       i write a lot of reviews  i ll write something off substance here  we bought several extenders because we installed a bunch of wireless security cameras around our house and in the alley  of the   we bought  this was the cheapest  the easiest to set up  and extends further than it claims  we use a nighthawk router and the extender is about   ft away through a brick wall and through a aluminum sided garage wall   it supplies wifi to   cameras   the furthest camera in the alley is   ft away from the extender all on the outside of the aluminum sided garage again if that sounds even remotely like your situation  i say do it  set up took less time than it took me to walk from the router to the extender      
167,1.0 ,                       this product is pretty awful  literally did zero to help with wifi deadzone issues in my house  would not recommend     
168,4.0 ,                       setup went well   no complaints one disappointment   i had expected the extender to function anywhere that i had a usable wifi signal to work with   i had thought i could place it in a weaker area of our house  two or three bars  and have it boost the signal to a full four bars   this is not the case   to be fully functional  both lights steady blue   the extender must be in a very strong  four bar  area of my primary router   perhaps within       feet   this limits the useful range   also  confusing  is that beyond the four bar range of the primary router  a steady blue and red light state may be present   and in this steady blue and red state  the extender still seems to function   this may usefully extend the range of the extender  but the instructions do not discuss blue and red lights   what does steady blue and red mean   i do not have the tools to determine if this blue and red state is fully functional  so i am placing the extender in the blue blue range   a little farther from the primary router  one or two bars   the signal light goes out completely   three states  blue blue  all is good  blue red     and blue only  does not function otherwise  the extender seems to solve my problem      
169,5.0 ,                       so far only been using it one day  but i love it  took me a max of    minutes to set up using their app  my home is     sq ft and the router is in the basement  i put this upstairs in the middle of the house and i finally have wifi everywhere  went from   spotty bar without this to full bars with it  i ve streamed netflix on it for a couple hours and had zero speed issues  especially for the price i d definitely recommend it      
170,4.0 ,                       it works really well for amplifying a wifi signal the only downside is that it creates a second wifi band  as a result  i need to switch logins between the regular wifi and extended depending on what part of the house i m in i have the wifi router in my office and due to a thick wall in the uniquely shaped house  i was getting an insufficient signal to stream content on the living room tv  after using this  the signal in the living room is awesome doesn t stutter or pause anymore      
171,1.0 ,                    compre este aparato hace ya unos meses y jam s he podido conectarlo  ni con asistencia de amazon al intentar comunicar con el fabricante registro mi email como me pide y nada m s  me siento estafada        
172,5.0 ,                       i only have one place to put a router and that s on the opposite side of the house from the master bedroom  which is where out second tv is   our internet speed is   mb   running a speedtest with my phone at the exact location my roku is mounted to my tv  the speed is somewhere around  mb   and as low as  mb   videos take awhile to start and sometimes become pixelated   i saw this on sale  and figured i d try   i plugged it into an outlet that is basically line of sight from the router  but just on the other side of the wall to the bedroom   setup was simple and quick   i went into setting on the roku and made sure it was connected to it   boom  super strong signal and a solid   mbps when running a speed test   roku runs great now and on the plus side  a better signal for me cell and the wife s ipad when we re in bed   i may buy another for my parents home  they re signal pretty much dies on one end of the house      
173,5.0 ,                       super easy to set up and extrnds the wifi really well      
174,5.0 ,                       i have the tp link   n    wifi range extender for my computer  this is working great after having   days of trying think why there was no difference in reception with it versus using my router without it   i suggest watching the video on their website first before installing the product   my mistake was i entered the same name for the extender as for the router   so the device acted as though just router was available   i did use their chat service   times but you end up getting disconnected from them when you have reconnect to the router   anyway  had i watched the video first then read the direction not vice versa  i would not have made the mistakes   now it works great   i use this for my all in one computer that only as a     ghz       b n capabilities   i did reset my wi fi router to       n to help give a little more speed   i am averaging    mbps download with anywhere from          upload speeds   can now watch hd movies without any hiccups along the way   i had to place my extender on my desk behind my computer   this was the best optimal receptivity for my situation   for this older version and the price   it does the job   i would get the newer model as you might have better instructions   good luck     
175,1.0 ,                       doesn t work wellsignal isn t any better     
176,4.0 ,                       i recommend this product to anyone  it works great  i could easily have given   stars      
177,5.0 ,                       works amazing     
178,1.0 ,                       tried in three different configurations    plugged it into a wall half way between router and  dead spot   devices far from router     degraded connectivity by        plugged it into a wall right next to the router    degraded connectivity by        plugged into a wall directly near the devices in the  dead spot  and ran an ethernet into the device  this resulted in killing all wifi in our entire house  regardless of whether we used the extender or the original router  the connection was at     mb s or would not connect at all complete failure  don t waste your money      
179,4.0 ,                       use the cell app  sure works easier for set up      
180,5.0 ,                       wow   this is a game changer   we have a dead spot and in all places our office   with my husband working from home he has had to work in the kitchen  now he doesn t   but the best part   we have an rv on our property for family to stay in while they visit and we haven t been able to offer them wi fi because the base is to far   on a whim i plugged this puppy into the garage wall closest to the rv and viola   we now have wifi in the rv   super cool      
181,1.0 ,                       bought a couple tp link wifi extenders that you plug into the wall  requires application installation and agreement to an outlandish privacy policy  did amazon inform me of this prior to purchasing it  nope  this isn t much a big deal  the real issue is the ridiculous data harvesting they require for you to use the product  needless to say i declined and removed them below is a copied and pasted portion that i disagree with in that policy privacy policy    information we collect automatically second paragraph other information automatically collected may include your ip address  location  mobile device information  operating system  browser type  demographic information  application information  url information such as click through paths  identity of pages you interact with  time spent on those pages  and other information associated with how you interact with the pages and services      
182,1.0 ,                       it doesn t work  don t waste your time and money      
183,1.0 ,                       it sucks  made no positive difference in my reception and i had to use a whole nother wifi password  i bought a second google nest  no need for another wifi password and it actually boosts my signal as described  before i got the second google nest  i couldn t even use many of my smart devices in the opposite end of the house as the initial router  now they all work without fail      
184,3.0 ,                       wi fi network not secure in windows   applies to  windows   you might see a notification that tells you that you re connected to a wi fi network that s not secure because it uses an older security standard  for example  this can occur if you connect to a wi fi network that uses wep or tkip for security  these security standards are older and have known flaws to fix this issue  do one or more of the following   if there s another wi fi network that s in range that you recognize and trust  disconnect from your current wi fi network  then connect to the other one  for more info  see connect to a wi fi network in windows      if you re connecting to your home wi fi network  consider changing the type of security that your router or access point uses  you can do this by signing in to your router using the software for it  and then changing the security type for your home wi fi network  for more info  see the documentation for your router or setting up a wireless network   if you have an older router or access point  you could also consider getting a newer router that supports the latest security standards and improvements will update review if i end up getting help that causes these things  we bought    to function properly      
185,3.0 ,                       gets super hot and signal sucks     
186,5.0 ,                       i ve installed this booster in my bedroom  as i currently have a kiddo living out in the camper  out back of my house  and his wi fi was not consistent  talk about a great fix for a problem  my kids can now do their schoolwork  online  thanks to covid  anywhere  in the yard  in the camper  where ever they d like to  on our property  it s a nice  inexpensive fix  and most importantly  it works  i would cheerfully recommend this to anyone needing just that little bit more reach with their signal  it s great  installed quickly  and it s effective  if you re on the fence  don t be  it s worth every penny      
187,1.0 ,                       got this because my room is far from the modern and i needed a stable internet connection for my zoom classes  it worked the first month but after that it stopped working  even though it was connected i didn t have any wifi connection every time i went to the tether app it would disconnect me and even after connecting again i still wouldn t have any connection even though i am connected  i restarted it multiple times  uninstalled and reinstalled  changed the extenders position as well and nothing  doesn t work anymore really disappointed because it was working perfectly the first month and now doesn t work anymore      
188,1.0 ,                       it was easy to setup and really did extend the range well  when connected   i finally setup a simple test case to eliminate potential blockage and any doubt about range  i am sitting in my family room with the extender in the same room   the router is within    feet  nothing but a couple sheet rock walls in between   about half the time i cannot connect   i keep getting the no internet connection   in every case  i unplug it and get connected immediately   kept restarting and it works for a while but devices that almost never have a connection problem are not connecting   it is great to get a signal boost  but it does not mean much when your connection reliability is in the cellar      
189,2.0 ,                       first of all  as some others have said  this does not  boost  your wifi signal  it allows you to create a second point of connectivity  which means a different network you re going to have to long into with your devices  it ll take your existing login and add   ext  to it  but you have to connect each device to that alternate network  that being said  smart tvs  at least the vizio i have  will not connect to it  that was the entire reason for my purchase was to connect my smart tv and also my playstation to it for streaming and gaming  neither device will connect  my phone connects to it  but i don t have any existing issues with my phone  the only reason i gave this two stars is due to the fact it would work to create wifi from a wired connection if someone didn t have wifi already  the setup is easy enough  but i was alerted on my phone that the connection is not secure even with an app password they make you create  i got a couple warnings on my phone about security risks from an unsecure network  as you can see in the photos  it says weak security      
190,5.0 ,                       awesome booster   it works just like it s supposed to   very good for only            
191,3.0 ,                       i ll update my review should anything change  received this item two days ago  set it up for the first time last night  set up was reasonably straight forward and easy  the instructions give you three methods  i used the app  and i think the device is working  the app says there s a connection  and i am connected to this new  extended  wifi network  i just don t think that to this point it s giving me a very good signal  in fact  i think my normal non extended wifi network works better than this new one  so  that sort of defeats the purpose of the item  as i purchased it to improve the lackluster signal i receive in the back of my house where my bedroom is located  again  i want to be fair and i ll update this should the signal improve  but so far it s not great      
192,4.0 ,                       well my goal was to use a new echo dot second addition out in my husbands shed out back  i wanted one out there so i could use the music from the echo to reach the yard  i bought this and proceeded to follow the directions but they just seem foreign and it was not clicking on how to even find the spots on my pc to even attempt to get it to work  obviously i had tried option   to go direct and it never turned solid green  option   was where i needed to go   i had to call nikki from the help page and she walked me right through it   my problem was i was trying to setup option   using a wired desktop  i needed to follow the steps on my laptop wireless   duh   on my part  but none the less  she got me green and i went out there and asked echo to play music and it does  so all i know is    this little extender got me to my goal with the help from nikki     
193,5.0 ,                       i wasn t sure if this was going to work  but i ve used this brand before in the past  and their products haven t failed me yet  the cost was really low and it was returnable so i gave it a try  i m so glad that i did  the rest of the house my speeds are great  the problem room was my bedroom  every device when used in the bedroom the signal strength was    mbps  very weak and slow  streaming on my smart tv would buffer and lag  now after using the extender my speeds have more than tripled to    mbps  i didn t think it was possible so for a week i kept testing it to be sure  and each time the numbers were consistently up  the instructions were clear and connecting was a breeze  took me about    mins for the entire process  i plugged mines up in a surge protector that is hidden under my shoe rack  works great and still going strong      
194,5.0 ,                       i m really really hoping and praying that writing this review isn t going to jinx me   which is typically what happens with me and routers  i bought this extender because my router is on the back side of  my      sq f house   my security cameras were finicky being outside on the opposite side of the house  this solved the problem  plus the rooms in the dead zone finally get a signal  so my guest room streaming stick doesn t buffer like crazy anymore one down side is that it s basically a separate network so depending on where you re at in the house you ll need to manually change to the nearest network  frankly i just don t use this network for personal use  as i m rarely on that side of the house so it s not a big deal to me  but if you re looking for a repeater rather than an extender  then this isn t the right product for you  however for the price i am very pleased      
195,1.0 ,                       read what i left below  but add another hour and a half on the phone and they still want more from me  i will never buy a tp link product again  there is no warranty  they just tie you up on the phone for hours with people that probably make a dollar an hour wo you give up  never  never never againi had given this rave reviews until   months in  then  it failed  ok things break  but now to get service omg as they say  first of all  you need to register you device to get service  so i go to register and it tells me my serial number does not exist  after searching online  i find this is a regular problem with tp link  so the get this cleared up they tall you to call  forget about calling them  very long waitso i tried a chat  the chat process does everything they can to avoid you chatting  but after several things i did  i got through  then the person you chatting with must be having    conversations going on at once as there is about a   minute wait between answers so now they want a picture of my product showing the serial number and proof of purchase  hey  no problem right  but i get it done  and now i am told  they put my serial number in  but i have to go back and register it before i can start the return process  well  that took   hour  i can imagine what the return process is going to be  so i think for    bucks  i will eat it and avoid tp link products for ever  you should too  update  i had time to register my product and now i tried to return it     minutes on the phone with a tech support person doing all kinds of stuff for them and still not working  now instead of letting me return it  i have to wait as they are escalating this to a higher tier support person and they will get back to me  this is a joke and so is tp link      
196,5.0 ,                       easy to operate and works great      
197,4.0 ,                       i bought this wifi extender to help get a stronger signal to the upstairs level of my   story townhouse  the wifi router is literally right underneath the new extender upstairs  i barely managed to get    mbps when i run a speedtest with my phone practically touching the extender antenna  change or plans  i decided to keep this extender downstairs  run an ethernet cable from my wifi router to the new location for the extender so it can receive high speed up to that point and the rest is wifi to my kids rooms above the extender  for reference  my wifi router speedtest shows        mbps  at the extender with my phone literally right there  and it s hard wired to my router  i hit a max of   mbps short of it is  does it work  yes is it as fast as claimed     mbps   no i can t imagine how it can ever hit    mbps considering that with my setup  it should be able to hit that speed easily  since it s literally hardwired to my router with cat   cable  but it can t  when i measure the speed upstairs in my kids rooms  i m hitting max      mbps if you re not using a gaming consul and simply streaming music and such on alexa  then no problem  i have no other experience with extenders to compare  all i have are my speed measurements and my expectation was it should hit    mbps      
198,1.0 ,                       this pretty much did the opposite of what it s supposed to do   i tried moving it to a few different locations in the house but with the exact same results   setup was easy  but that doesn t really matter when it cuts your speed in half i moved into a two story home where the hookup for internet in my office turns out to be non functional   i may have it replaced down the road  but on the second story of a house it s expensive   i thought this would be the perfect solution as i m having to run my pc off of wifi when i m used to using it hard wired   the location where i had to plug up the modem is downstairs and opposite part of the home from the office   go figure   i m paying for    mbps  and get about that when i try hardwiring my laptop onto the modem directly   but my desktop in the office gets   mbps on a good day which is awful   it s not my pc as i ve tested this with other devices with the same results after looking at several of these extenders i thought this one would be great to try as the cost is so much lower than most  now i know why   i got it hooked up and was super excited to try it out   ran a speed test and came up with under   mbps   i then unplugged it and put the pc back onto wifi connection with the modem and right back up to around   mbps   tried a few different spots in the house with exact same results   going to spring for a more expensive one in a different brand now that i ve returned it      
199,1.0 ,                       set up on these devices is pretty straight forward   i managed to extend my wifi using one unit on the top floor  then drop a second unit downstairs to extend the first unit   after a week s worth of use  i no longer had internet connectivity   reboot   ahh    there s the internet   no useful info in logs as to why the devices went autistic   nothing helpful on the support site either firmware doesn t match the support articles  dated       so that s no help when you re trouble shooting as complete menu options referencing the  solution   no longer exist in the current firmware nas devices don t stay  online  requiring several seconds to reconnect every few seconds making streaming impossible   don t see what anyone would use these for as i can t think of a use scenario when i require intermittent or random connectivity cycles yeah   these are garbage and utterly worth the sub     price   will be pitching these into the trash where they belong and looking for another option   preferably  one that works as advertised  update well  devices no longer issue ip s which is kind of what they re made for   new devices connecting to the tp link  just hang indefinitely   plus it seems like there s a limit  single digits  to the number of devices you can attach   every time i boot an extender  it s a random event to see which of the six nas devices won t make it onto the network seriously   save your money   or  go out to the back yard and scoop up a small handful of dog droppings and plug your devices into that   it s more honest that way and you ll maintain the functionality      
200,5.0 ,                       i m not one that fellows instructions very well but this was very simple and easy   to setup  signal seems to be fine      
201,5.0 ,                       my experience with wifi cameras is that they need strong wifi to connect rapidly and stable  i put this in my detached garage along with two outdoor hd cameras which only work on     ghz  my gateway has static addressing for each camera  it takes about   seconds to bring up the phone app and view a camera  this extender is a perfect match for this application      
202,1.0 ,                       the positives are that this is easy to install setup and the signal is strong   the negative for me was that it interfered with our modem and caused out internet to go out every few minutes   the day i installed it we had a bad storm so i thought the storm knocked something out and went the entire weekend with no usable internet because the modem would reset every few minutes   finally pulled the extender on monday morning just in case it was the issue   had uninterupted internet service the entire day without a single modem reset   as long as it s compatible with your router  it should be a nice little device   too bad i threw out the box so i can t return it      
203,4.0 ,                       it seems to be working well     
204,3.0 ,                         update  the tether does seem to be picking up any devices that are on our wi fi now  if you stay on the  client  screen for too long it says  session timed out  original review my husband reported that the set up was not very intuitive  it was a pain and the directions were not clear after my husband installed this  we were both very excited to get it going  he was able to get it going on his phone  however  when i also tried to get on  we both started having issues i had to make a separate account for my phone  ok     but then it kept kicking one of us off  then the other i tried to get my laptop on the tether and the website provided in the directions isn t working at all   this site can t be reached  now  my phone is saying  no devices found  in continuing to try to figure this out i have come across more messages like  unable to connect to the device  please check your wi fi connection   i am sitting in a space where i have always gotten a signal as i am typing this review  i keep trying to get it to work  i think it knows    because now it sees our router  it is now showing my iphone and a desktop computer under  client   i have no idea if this is my husband s computer or my laptop this was not nearly as easy or useful as i thought it would be and i have no idea if it is actually extending the signal   we got a crazy cold front in texas this weekend and i do not feel like braving the freezing weather outside to check if this thing gives my phone a signal in my driveway  which was why i bought it in the first place      
205,1.0 ,                       i followed all the instructions  connected with the app  then went to plug it in to where i wanted it to boost from  at first  i couldn t connect to the extender  i reset it and tried to reconnect several times  it kept defaulting to the extension name on the wireless signal list  so i m not confident that resetting it actually cleared the data out on it  when i finally thought i had it all figured out  i tried to connect to it again and the option for the extender vanished from my wifi connections list  i looked for comments with similar problems and the manufacturer says that the names merge  so it will just look like my regular wifi connection  i was running a connectivity app the whole time and saw no improvement over my connection  except when i pulled the extender out of the wall and it bumped my connectivity up a smidge      
206,3.0 ,                       took a while to set up  i ve had it for a few months and most mornings i have to reset the whole thing and it randomly disconnects throughout the day  anyone who has the main wifi password can use the extender and when they do i get kicked out  they allow you to block   people from using it but there are so many people in and around my house it s always changing   i m about to buy a more expensive one      
207,2.0 ,                       i have a    year old   floor  house so the wifi signals bounce all around and isn t great especially on the  rd floor  i keep my main router on the  nd floor and plugged this in the staircase on the  rd  immediately it blinked red saying it was out of range  i moved it closer and it still said it was out of range  only when i plugged it right near the router did it pick up a signal  it hasn t made the connection upstairs much better because it needs to be right near the main router or it won t pick up a signal      
208,5.0 ,                       this was an amazon warehous purchase  so of course  it came without any instructions  still  using wps setup should have been easy  it wasn t  at first i couldn t get the wps button to illuminate  so i finally did a reset and tried again  still no luck  i finally did get it to illuminate after a few more tries  but it refsed to link to my router  finally  i tried holding thereset button while powering up the unit  and that was the magic combination  got it linked   moved it to the area i needed a stronger signal in  and now all is good  i should note that i did go online to look up the manual for the unit  but  quite frankly  tplinks instructions rather stink  despite being rater long  ther  quick steup  is actually of no help at all and trying to access setting on the extender is not at all intuitive or explained well  but  hey  i got it working anyway      
209,1.0 ,                       cant make this work  ive followed all the steps with no success     
210,1.0 ,                       i know  i know  i should have known better  it s so inexpensive  but my wifi works really well all over my house with the exception of the far corner of the den where i had  foolishly  moved my work desk  so  i thought a tiny boost to get it a few more feet wouldn t warrant an expensive fix  i was wrong  this product literally does nothing  sure  all the devices can jump on it but that s where it ends  doesn t work  useless  and i m so annoyed at myself for buying yet another piece of plastic  destined for the dump  don t be like me  spend a little money  don t believe the effusive positive reviews  don t flirt with the  useless junk  shame spiral  help mother earth out  get something that works and lasts      
211,4.0 ,                       i have done multiple tests in terms of the download speed as the followings     the signal or speed is approx     of the router if sitting beside      setting in the midway is not working or useless since router is even more powerful then the unit     after i moved the unit as far as from router but as closer as to laptop  as long as the signal stays in blue rather than red   the extender increased speed from    mb  without unit  to    mb  with unit  in comparison to my router at    mb download speed  so i would say it worked out but depending on how you use it and how much you expected it      
212,2.0 ,                       it works but i didn t see any improvement in my wifi it s still the same      
213,5.0 ,                       took a bit to set up  but the error was on my part  finally got it  provides a great booster to bump up the range      
214,5.0 ,                       super easy to install  needed it because my wifi router is on the first floor and i had a dead zone in my son s room on the second floor      
215,2.0 ,                       for testing purpose  i connected directly to the wifi signal and later connected through this range extender within close range to the wifi router and tested the download speeds both ways  when connected directly  i had around   mbps and when connected through this device it was   mbps  the box says up to    mbps  so the one i got is not working up to mark  returning the device also  the device only supports    ghz networks only  if you have two bands like i do    ghz and  ghz  you can only extend the    ghz one  the setup was very easy with their tether app  it was cheap but does not meet my needs as it was throttling the download speeds      
216,5.0 ,                       this is handy especially working from home with my husband pros   easy install  reliable and works well for our situationcons   the bulky design takes over the entire outlet but other than that   no complaints i work upstairs and my husband works downstairs so we got this extender to help with my not so stellar connection and it s been so helpful  no longer have issues with having to reset the router constantly  we also use it with out ring security camera and it s been fantastic  had trouble with that connection too  but not since we got this extender  highly recommend   we re not very  smart house  but this would definitely be something to use of you have a lot of  smart home  products we re very happy after   weeks of use      
217,5.0 ,                       improved the signal in my rv  made watching prime movies so much nicer      
218,4.0 ,                       i had to move all around house till the systems excepted the product to increase range     
219,1.0 ,                       this only works on the     ghz band  when i installed this it uses the exact same ssid as my verizon router s ssid  as a result  my network of nest thermostats  cameras and smoke  detectors became confused and would go offline periodically  my netgear extender establishes ssids that are based on the verizon router ssid with an extension added to the ssid so that when i scan my wifi network i can distinguish among the various     and   ghz wifi signals and set the nest deices  or any other wireless device  to whatever signal i want  do not buy       
220,3.0 ,                       tried the setup numerous times and could never get it to work as an extender to my wifi  i ended up having to set it up as an additional network which is a real pain  what ends up happening is my phone hops on this network which is only  g and leaves my  g network  unfortunately  i have to manually go back to  g when coming back to the other side of the house  it is much slower than my main connection  i wish it would just extend my network rather than being an additional one  oh well  it was cheap and it does provide an extra signal in the back part of my house      
221,4.0 ,                       this came as an add on to the myq wifi garage door opener   i wasn t even sure i would need it  but the price is right  i first tried linking this up to my wifi system via the app  option    on the install list  and it didn t really want to link up properly   took it inside and just plugged it in by the router and did it that way   took a couple of tries anyway  but did finally get linked up   when i moved it back out to the garage for the myq it took a couple of minutes to reconnect to the wifi when plugged back in  but then it was linked up and running strong   seems to be adding a pretty good signal out in the garage so it s working good so far   only one day so i can t attest to the durability      
222,3.0 ,                       doesn t make any difference     
223,5.0 ,                       let me first say that this thing saved my sanity  my husband has been working from home since the covid pandemic started back in march  i myself have continued working   outside the home  essential  i would get home from work only to find my husband had sat up shop at the island in my kitchen  doing zoom meetings  conferences etc  mind you  he has an office area upstairs  i would not be able to get a glass of ice or try to start dinner etc  without getting  be quiet  looks      so i asked one day why aren t you upstairs   he said he would loose wifi sometimes and it would drop him out of meetings unexpectedly  so     i had to do some researching in order to keep my sanity and save my marriage   this device has been amazing   my husband was very skeptical because it was only      but let me say  he is extremely happy with it  he has been using it for a week now and has had no issues at all  he has told all his coworkers and friends about this wifi extender  thank you thank you for such a great product at a very reasonable price         
224,2.0 ,                       purchased this to extend the wifi to during corona virus lockdown  set up was alright and quick but performance wise this extender leaves so much to be desired     ghz band has such a low speed compared to my router  even thought this thing is like    ft from it  main router gives    mbps but the extender s  ghz gives    mbps    the range extender doesn t increase the range as expected  devices    feet from the extender shows just one bar overall  i am not that happy with this device  may be i got a defective one  not sure  but point    is a big disappointment  i won t be able to return due to lockdowns  but would not recommend this      
225,5.0 ,                       i was being disappointed by sluggish respionsiveness of my ring doorbell   though my router is on the same floor as the doorbell and perhaps    feet away  there are a number of intervening walls   per the ring diagnostics  my rssi value was      a measure of received signal strenth  the less negative the better    this isn t  terrible  but i decided to take the chance on improving it by purchasing this unit for          it was very simple to set up and i was able to plug it into an outlet about six feet from the doorbell  and separated only by a glass pane    at first i saw no change at all   but checking it today  several days after the installatiion  the rssi is now      which is considerably better   most importantly  accessing the ring doorbell via my iphone app seems to be a lot more responsive   so  at this point i am very happy with this purchase  especially since the ring wifi extender is              
226,5.0 ,                       i have to admit i bought this without really understanding how it works  i started using a back bedroom as my office but i ve been disappointed with a very poor wifi signal in that room  i bought this device to boost the signal but the only place to leave it plugged in is this back bedroom the directions say to plug it in somewhere between the  dead zone  and the router   but i had no place in between for permanent installation  i followed the directions for setting it up first by the router  easy   and them temporarily halfway to my back bedroom  but  reasoning that the signal in my back bedroom is weak  but not dead  i decided to try the device in there taadaa    it worked  i ve now got a great signal for steaming in the back bedroom  very happy  set up was a breeze  i m pleased with my purchase  i would buy another one if needed      
227,5.0 ,                       a      
228,5.0 ,                       i have a tp link router so i specifically purchased this product thinking that being from the same manufacturer   i would have less issues   so prior to arrival i went on line and down loaded the instructions for set up and reviewed how to setup the product   when the product arrived  i plugged it into a power source near my router  pushed the wsp button on the router and then on the product and waited about    seconds for both lights on the extender to turn solid blue   then i moved the product to the new location upstairs  plugged it into the wall socket  waited about    seconds and it was connected   the tv  computers and music devises all showed significant improvement due to the enhanced wifi reception so after all that  i would highly recommend this product   it works very well and the setup couldn t have been easier      
229,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          very happy with this product  i have a       sq ft home and our router is located near the middle of the house on the second floor  my office is at the far end of the house on the first floor and i was only getting about   bars of wifi signal  i needed a better connection for online virtual work meetings  and this extender boosted my wifi signal to full bars super easy to install  plug it in  push the wps security button on the back of all wifi routers  push the button on the extender    and done the extender creates a new network name to log into by using your existing network name and adding   ext  to it  mine is  netgear   ext  for example and it uses the same password as my main  netgear    signal this isn t as nice as a mesh wifi network  where it automatically switches to the network in your house with the best signal  allowing you to roam without switching signals  i have to specifically log into the  ext network when i go out to my office on the other end of the house but for    bucks  this was an awesome solution  mesh wifi is a couple hundred dollars and up does exactly what it says it will  i may eventually buy a second one  but upgrade to the dual band option  this one does not broadcast the faster  ghz signal from my router  but    ghz works fine for zoom meetings  if you re into gaming  you may want the  ghz signal      
230,1.0 ,                       totally worthless  not worth the paper that was used to make the box in came in     
231,5.0 ,                       bought   to use in my house        sq ft flat  helps with my cameras to connect to the wifi  have had them for about   months and no problems     
232,5.0 ,                       i have used tis product repeatedly to provide wi fi access where there is weak or no signal  as well as a means for providing a wireless access point after installing a wireless bridge to connect two buildings  it s dual operation mode  signal booster or wap  make it very versatile and a very economical solution a number of configuration options are available  such as hiding the ssd and creating both white and black lists  as well as adjusting the signal strength i have purchased and installed several of these for different types of applications and i continue to use them negatives  i have found the need to reset  plug and unplug  some when operating in wireless repeater mode  but none when using it in wap mode      
233,1.0 ,                       tried to clone my current wifi  this garbage said it was a success  this thing caused issues across every device on my network      
234,4.0 ,                       even a top quality wifi unit can use an assist   with the wifi router at on end of the house and our tv  entertainment system at the other end   and on the lower floor   even with a dir tv hook up the wifi connection appeared weak  slow  or was being ramped down by the provider    i d like to think that the house is well constructed and insulated  leaves me to ask   why when the tv  entertainment system   dir tv connection was  st hooked up did the wifi channels load almost immediately but now   during the day  when every one in the neighborhood s at work   why are the wifi channels timing out before the show loads    it wasn t too long before the same thing happened in the evening it s frustrating   rhetorical questions  personally  i was always thinking of purchasing a wifi booster  again  is there a wifi router package that manufactured that sales the main router with  multiple   wifi boosters so  to the review  the tp link re     had good reviews both on and off amzn  the price listed on amzn was better than what the local merchants are asking for the same unit tp link set up was simple and it was easy to integrate the unit with our main wifi router  the tp link can be relocated  to another electrical wall outlet  after initially set it up is completed  we chose to place the tp link at the opposite end of the house from where the main wifi router is installed and on the same floor   the tp link is located approximately  directly above the tv  entertainment system  after changing the wifi login settings on our tv  entertainment system to connect to the tp link   we were able to enjoy our  non cable  shows  the show loading speed is never immediate but is quicker than it has been  although there is no need for another wifi booster   we d purchase this unit again for it s ease of setup and price      
235,4.0 ,                       once properly connected  this extender really did improve signals to parts of the house with weak wifi  however  setup was not that easy  i am not a techie but have learned a lot since buying this device  first of all  it connected flawlessly per the instructions but in the process knocked out our roku express thereby eliminating our video streaming capabilities of netflix  several resets of the device did nothing and tp link customer service was of no help  eager to deflect questions to their diy tutorials rather than provide trouble shooting advice  if you have the patience to read their faqs and other instruction material  you can get these devices working properly lessons learned  aged dual band routers at least mine can present connectivity issues for this extender to operate correctly  as in our case  conflict did occur and it take some fine tune adjustments on the extender settings to get the two bands correctly segregated and aligned to devices that use a    ghz signal versus     ghz signal  once this is all figured out  the extender works great and really enhances the signal the placement of the ethernet jack on the unit could be better  as it is on the top of the unit  partially creating an obstruction limiting use of the second electrical receptacle  the ethernet would be better served on the left or right side not on the top of the unit all in all this is a good extender but its got its quirks but does work well once correctly setup      
236,5.0 ,                       works well   didn t comment on tex support because i did not need them so far  good price  picked up the rest of the house and the basement from the back bed room       
237,5.0 ,                       i live in a   bedroom   bathroom duplex apartment  after i paired this unit  which only took around five minutes  i just simply had to plug it into my downstairs living room and push the wps button again  waited like   mins for everything to pair  then connect my downstairs devices to the wifi signal through the extender  u may have to refresh your wifi list to see the extender  but it s usually your regular router name with ext at the end      
238,5.0 ,                    es lo mejor que he tenido en mucho tiempo  lo enchufas  bajas la aplicaci n  configuras la aplicaci n seg n los pasos sencillos que te proporciona y listo  me encanta    ahora tengo excelente calidad de internet en toda mi casa         
239,1.0 ,                       i plugged it in and followed instructions but i noticed absolutely no improvement in my wi fi range   i went past return window so i still have the unit      
240,3.0 ,                       i bought this wifi range extender after reading a lot of positive reviews here on amazon  i thought that  given its price  i could not go wrong if i just bought and tried it  the range extender worked well for the first few weeks  but it was not as great as some people claimed  i have had this product for over a year now  but it is not being used at the moment  it dropped the signal from the main router too often  when it was connected and working well  i had no issues  however  it kept dropping the signal  i would suggest that you purchase a mesh wifi system rather than any of these range extenders      
241,5.0 ,                       i m always wary about  wifi extenders   but i had an issue where i put in a new netgear cable modem that sacrificed wifi for speed  see  the modem is in the garage  and a hardline runs through the house to the wifi router that serves the house  well  the house except the garage    so i have the cable in the garage but no signal  and no option to hard wire it without running    ft of ethernet cable  and figured i d give this a try  it s just on the other side of the garage door  and the download speed is approx    x faster now  upload is    x faster  according to various speed tests  a must buy if you have out of range devices only potential drawback would be the re named network  but honestly that s probably easier for devices to manage automatically now than it was even in recent memory      
242,5.0 ,                       the price is great  and it s been working out  it sends the wifi signal to my ring video as advertised  perfect product and easy to install      
243,1.0 ,                       i purchased this extender some time ago   i unpackaged it and follow the instructions carefully setting it up   i am not a technology person  but thought it was working fine   not long ago i upgraded my at t wif   the technician from at t checked  all  of my wifi enabled devices and found that the extender was not working   later i went to the tp link website and closely followed the instructions  however  while setting the extender up i could go only so far and it would not complete the set up   i went to tp link s online chat and informed the person the issue i was having   i was asked for my phone number and was told tech support would be calling me in a few minutes   after just a few minutes i received the call from tp link s tech support   ultimately  he wanted to access my computer which i reluctantly agreed to knowing i had no important info  on  this  computer  the technician explained everything he was doing as it was done which was essentially the same thing s  i did from their web site   after several attempts he told me i needed to have a different tech support person talk me through the set up  however  it was going to cost me        for a six month support policy   i told him i was not interested in this policy and i took back control of my computer and i hung up   i feel i should not have to pay for something to work after purchasing it   based on this i give it one star   it is totally useless to me and to be told it was going to cost to set it up was ridiculous   i might add that i have other tp link products and have had no issues      
244,2.0 ,                       so i did end up going from     signal strength  about    dbm   to      signal strength  i thought this would be great but a speedtest net check with the same laptop in the same spot and switching between the original and original ext ssid dropped the internet speed from   mbps   mpbs to about  mbps  mbps imo this is maybe good for extending the range to get some barebones reception but at severe cost of throughput degradation i guess it makes sense since it has to receive and repeat i e  rebroadcast and this constant switching introduces significant enough latency to drop the speeds to useless speeds for things like video streaming or any real work  it s workable for emails light browsing but otherwise practically useless      
245,5.0 ,                       works well     
246,4.0 ,                       i wanted a wifi extender that would give the family better access on our screened porch and around the yard  this device is adequate to the purpose  giving us three bars in those previously weak areas  this device is n rather than ac speed  like our main router  but for email  browsing  and most apps  it s fine  not for hi def video streaming  however  but not a lot of that going on outdoors  so no biggie  i tried to set it up on a mac  but was unsuccessful  i don t think they tested it that well on macos  or the documentation wasn t correct  fortunately my wife has a windows    laptop  and i was able to set it up as documented for windows  for the price  this is a good  not great  product      
247,5.0 ,                       i try to use wired whenever i can however my video doorbell is only wireless and happens to be outside in front of a brick wall  not the best for wifi signal  the connection to the doorbell was spotty and would take forever to come up when the doorbell was rang  typically over a minute  sometimes even     i bought this hoping to fix that issue  i plugged it into the closest plug to my front door and connected it to my wifi  i set this up by plugging my laptop into the ethernet port on it  you could also download their app but i didn t want another app on my phone  setup was pretty straight forward and walked you through it  i changed some settings  mainly not having it change the ssid  by default it wants to add an  ext to it s ssid  but i didn t want to have to go to my other devices and choose which ones to connect to this extender  by keeping the ssid and password the same my devices would just connect to the one that has the stronger signal  either my router or this extender  once i got that all set up  i rebooted my doorbell and it automatically connected to the extender since it had a much stronger signal  i tested the doorbell and was able to get it to come up within about    to    seconds  significantly faster than before without this extender  so in the end this solved my slow issue and i can use my doorbell as it was intended  another use for this would be if you have a device that is only wired you can plug that device into the ethernet port on this extender and have it connect to your wifi that way  either way you use it this thing is great      
248,5.0 ,                       my workshop is a concrete building located about    feet behind our house  to see the wifi it needed to be set by the window on an extension cable and gets a solid blue led for signal  now my duet wifi controller for the  d printer and be ran from inside the house as well as the octoprint for the other printer  before that neither worked unless i moved them to the window  this allows me to run them from the other side of the workshop where they fit better you can set up this device with the exact same ssid as your router so it will allow any device already recognized by your router to use it with no additional setup      
249,1.0 ,                       update             i get frequent drop offs  or other issues where it ll be like i have no internet even if the device is showing multiple bars of signal strength  rebooting doesnt always help and is tedious i was already unhappy with how much the device throttles down internet speed but this is a different issue  the device is barely useable now and i have gone back to connecting to my main wifi this item easily bridged the gap and solved a problem i had in my home relative to my smart phone my router is in the first floor north side of my home  which means when i m on the second floor south side of my home  i barely get a signal and forget about having a signal on the patio upstairs or downstairs i plug the tp link upstairs and now i have at least   bars of signal everywhere the one considerable downside is that data speed reduces quite a bit when using this  for my purposes  i don t need a lot but i know that my wifi speeds are a lot faster without the tp link  for example on my  g wifi network  i may get    mbps  on the tp link network  i get about    mpbs  which is about      mbs per sec   that s quite a drop but still adequate for all of my uses  however  this item is supposed to be able to delivery up     mbps  so there s something wrong here      
250,4.0 ,                       update         had issues with radio com connections  moved tp link closer to the router  better now                       original             plug in tp link close to your router  wait till led turns solid   press wps button on your router   see picture    press wps button on tp link till it blinks then solid  you re done now go plug it halfway to where you need and wait for connection   solid blue lights   if your walls are thicker  then you may have to move around and try different areas  perhaps your router too   i took   star away because  tp link doesn t help my most demanding wi fi app  which is  yi home camera   my second demanding app is radio com and youtube and tp link has made their connection much better      
251,4.0 ,                       i removed   star as i got the device in used refurbished condition instead of new one   it took me extra hour to figure out how to set it up as it was already configured to someone else s network   and i had to go thru factory reset to get it to acceptable state overall  good value for money    easy setup with iphone app with clear step by step instructions     once you get the device to factory condition  plug the device near your existing router  login to default  unprotected  wifi  connect to your home wifi and get     ext network created  relocate the extender to another location it is very nice to have signal strength indicator directly on the device   so you can try it in different locations around your house      
252,1.0 ,                       take it from the box  plug it  press the button on the router  press the button on the extender  done i  downloaded the app to check the connection and change the ssid  very easy great product updatei noticed that my signal was getting intermittent in my new place  i figured that a bump in the sign of my router would fix it  then i changed from     to   and bingo  i lost the connection  only then i realized that my extender wasn t a dual band  no where in the title or in the box it shows that information  i found it at the bottom of the amazon page  after a very long series of beautiful pictures without that information  after a lot of very well written information about how it is easy and great  really is   unfortunately for me  it was misleading and i can t return it     
253,1.0 ,                       dint see a difference at all but it does add one more thing to your wife lol so     
254,5.0 ,                       i read the reviews  they were all over the place so i decided to try this item  i have been using my computer on my front porch and my router is at the back of my modest sized old home    i thought it would be a fast and stable connection  however there are many times that my skype zoom meet gotowebinar  etc  loaded very slowly  buffered and i received messages saying my internet was unstable  maybe it s the thick plaster walls  but anyhow  i happened upon this product and even though there were mixed reviews  i bought it    i am moderately tech savvy  not an expert by any stretch of the imagination  but can follow directions and troubleshoot to a small degree  you don t need to be any kind of expert to set this up and get it going    you do need to be able to plug it in near your router  push a button on the router and then within two minutes push the only button on this device and look for blinking and then solid lights     before i ordered it  i did check my router to make sure it has a wps button  because if it doesn t then you might have to do some of the fancy installation processes  if the router has this wps button  you should be able to do the easy setup    plug in  push router button  push device button  wait for solid light  unplug  put in outlet halfway to dead zone  open computer and connect to your network  ext   my connection on my porch is solid now on two computers and my phone   woo hoo for under               
255,5.0 ,                       it works     
256,4.0 ,                       i decided it might be nice to get a wifi extender for our house to improve the wifi signal upstairs  with the whole family working and doing school from home right now due to the covid    lockdown   this one had good reviews and was pretty inexpensive so i decided to try it   set up was ridiculously easy and literally took about   minutes   unboxed it  plugged it in near my xfinity router and hit the power button   waited a few seconds until power light stopped blinking  then hit the wps button on my router   pushed the wps button for a second or two on the extender and waited a few seconds for the light to stop blinking and turn solid   took it upstairs and plugged it in and checked on my laptop for my network name with the  ext next to it   connected to the  ext network   typed in my password  same as my regular network  and done   it just took longer to type that than it did to completely set up this extender   incredibly simple and painless works like a charm and definitely extended the range of my wifi signal   i get a much stronger signal up on our third floor now  router is in the basement family room    i walked around and compared the signal from my regular network to the  ext network and found i could connect to the  ext network outdoors in the yard and in places where i couldn t get a signal from my regular network the only reason i give this   stars vs    is that i ran a bunch of speed tests comparing the regular network from my router to the  ext network from the extender   my tests showed download and upload speeds were only about     as fast from the extended network connection as they were from the regular network connection   i found this to consistently be the case in various rooms around my house where i could get signals from both the router and the extender   for example   my download speed from my wired connection to the router in my home office downstairs averages about     mbps   using wifi on the main floor on my laptop it s about         mbps on average from the regular network   using the  ext network connection from the extender on my laptop in the same location it s about         mbps   that said  i did get a signal from the extender and speed of at least    mbps in places where i could not get any signal at all from my router alone conclusion   the extender provides greater range  but slower download   upload speeds than my router alone  but still adequate speed for my needs    since what i was looking for was greater range for my network  i am quite satisfied with this purchase and it was well worth the     i paid   i definitely recommend it i did not rate tech support for this product since it was so easy to use that i had no need for tech support      
257,5.0 ,                       we have xfinity internet and live in a two story colonial house  not huge but definitely not tiny  connection upstairs can be a bit spotty at times but there is one room that the wifi simply doesn t reach  trying to stream videos or watch youtube isn t even worth trying  i had it set up in less than a minute and the difference is unbelievable     i sat in the farthest corner and youtube loaded immediately  i tried it connected to my regular router and it never loaded even a single second of the video  just remember  you have to log on to the network with each individual device for it to work      
258,5.0 ,                       my son uses it in his room and the wifi is so much better now      
259,4.0 ,                       not compatible with my router for some strange reason      
260,5.0 ,                       this extender solved my problem with no signals in certain parts of my house  i have a   story with at least    different devices that use wifi  it was getting to a point where i could not use certain devices because of poor signal  i wasn t sure if i needed an extender or a booster this device was not too expensive so i thought i d give it a shot  it s easy to setup and i plugged it in upstairs  it creates an extension of your current wifi connection and i was able to connect my upstairs devices to it  have had it for a month now and no issues or dropped skype calls  i work from home full time and constantly had issues with my skype conference calls  none since i got this extender      
261,5.0 ,                       i purchased this product because my wi fi signal to my ring pro doorbell was not strong enough and i felt that my received signal strength indicator  rssi  was not up to par on my standards  this extender was easy to set up  especially if you get their app called tether  from there you can set it up on your network and manage what devices you want to keep that were previously were connected  before purchasing this  my rssi level to my ring pro doorbell was around        which is fairly high  after installing this  my rssi dropped and hovers to around        which is significantly lower what i will say is that positioning matters  i tried it in almost all the outlets i thought would be beneficial and was able to find one place to keep a consistent lower rssi level  and they do instruct that you want to place the extender half way to where your dead zone area is  great product      
262,5.0 ,                       i bought this as an extender for my blink security cameras  it took a second to set up  but i think i was doing it wrong originally at first i named it the exact same name as my network  because that was suggested by some  unfortunately it s signal isn t always the greatest and a lot of my electronics were connecting to it and had very poor signal  so  i renamed it as  ext  and only have my cameras linked to it it does what i needed it to do and it was a great price all in all  if you need an extender   i d totally suggest this one

266,1.0 ,                       i have a network extender  netgear  in the rear of the property that works beautifully for that quadrant  but i needed something for the front by the garage  so i order this  i finally got around to installing it while i was cleaning  it was with my  get to  projects   after i wrapped for the night  i turned on my ps  and had no internet connection  hard wired lan   i noticed my wifi had no internet also  my main network     ghz  was gone from the wifi list and only the  g and other network extender and this device were showing up  but nothing had internet  i restarted the network and still nothing  i unplugged this device  since it was the only thing that was new to my network setup and my internet connectivity came back along with my main      it s sad to say  but this device  somehow  took out my internet  i don t want to install it again to try to disprove my theory  i ll just stick with devices i trust from now on      
267,5.0 ,                       never down  very easy and reliable     
268,1.0 ,                       did not work     
269,4.0 ,                       this review is for      tp link ac    dual band wifi range extender  extends wifi to smart home   alexa devices  re                           product works great on extending both    g and  g hz wifi  once being setup the way to setup    ghz wifi was relatively straightforward  especially through  wps     by pushing the  wps  button on the extender first  and then pushing the  wps  button on the router within   minutes     which unfortunately did not work for  g hz in my case my problem was  the extender was not able to detect  ghz wifi signal  being broadcasted from my verizon fios router  and being picked up by other devices  such as laptop  iphone and ipad  without problem  no luck with the manual setup process through  wifi setup page  on the web ui either    the  g hz ssid was not listed on the  wireless settings  tab after spending some time on google  searching through  g wifi signal specs  i finally found out the root cause    the incompatible signal channel the channel setting on the fios router was  automatic   and the actual channel being used was in fact one of the  dfs  channels  no problem for cell phones and laptops  but obviously not being recognized by the extender  so  i changed the channel number to      and after the router rebooted  the extender was able to pickup the  ghz signal easily  i suppose  other lower channels                     and     should also work  but i did not try i hope this trick would be helpful to other users with similar problem      
270,5.0 ,                       worked perfectly  super simple to install and worth the money     
271,1.0 ,                       save your money  this did not work     
272,5.0 ,                       easy to install  great range      
273,1.0 ,                       so  i read all the good reviews and thought it would be great to help my outside cam with dropped connection while recording  dropped connection and the cam would stop recording  came in a new box and package  great  followed the instructions  simple  so  i plugged in   feet away from my wifi router and was hoping for great things to happen  waiting for the blinking light to stop blinking showing connection was made to the router  so i could unplug it and move it maybe    feet away in my   bedroom house  the cam is outside of course  well  forget that it keep blinking and then no light  ok  went to step    tether  now i m worried  wtf  tether  go through all the steps and no go  that s it i m done  now i have no connection to the devices i wanted to be tethered  yep  got to reconnect my devices and go through all the bs again  the tp link device is in the garbage  oh yeah  u think i would call tech support  lol      
274,1.0 ,                       completed the setup using wps nutton on both devices in the same room less than   feet away from each other  ran speed test a dozen times on the host router and the average speeds were between         mbps down and      mbps  connected my mac to the extender in the same location without obstructed view  less than  feet away from host router modem  and i was in awe at the difference in speeds on both bands      mbps down and    mbps upload  i was certain i messed up somewhere so i reset the device and started from scratch  this time i went through the step by step directions found in the tplinkrepearer net page  ran the tests again and got very similar results  i m curious as to what i m doing wrong or what other customers are doing differently      
275,5.0 ,                       this extends the range of our wifi and improves our reception       
276,4.0 ,                       i had difficulty setting up the device  i had to use the app and the app is not user friendly or the instructions do not match very well   anyway  it finally was connected  it does extend the wifi range  but it is not helping the signal in my home office   i think it may be an issue with my television and not the wifi   anyway  the device works fine  it is just a little difficult to set up if the first option to connect does not work and you have to use the app to connect   overall  there is nothing wrong with the device it does what it is supposed to      
277,5.0 ,                       i got this for my ring video doorbell  which was telling me my wifi was bad  all my other items worked fine but this plugged in right on the other side of the wall from the doorbell  i had to hire someone to install it  i looked  and didn t understand the directions  my rssi  for ring doorbell users  was     and after this was installed  ranges between    and     now the doorbell works great and so do all my other wi fi gadgets  very reasonable price but get someone who knows what they re doing to install to avoid frustration  great product      
278,1.0 ,                       constantly drops signal      
279,4.0 ,                       waited for a month before reviewing this product to give it a fair test  router is on the first floor and upstairs tv roku wasn t getting enough wifi signal to keep up  the setup for this product is extremely simple using the wps button   just push two buttons and it is working  there is an iphone app tp link tether you can use to monitor the device  you probably want to change it s name as it sets itself to the same name and password as the router  so if your router network is called mary you might want to name this maryextender   then go to your device and have it connect to maryextender  in my case it improved the signal to the roku from     bars to     bars  this was enough for it to operate properly in high definition and without pausing to download  so it is fair to say it works  on the other hand  wifi networks and devices do not seem to be robust and the network capability will degrade from time to time for unknown reasons  in that case restarting the router and this device seems to help sometimes   other times who knows  this extender is very simple and inexpensive and it works   it is worth a try  however  it may not permanently  fix  the problems with your wifi   and maybe no extender can      
280,5.0 ,                       n    did exactly what i hoped it would do our wireless router is on one side of our    foot long three story house  with my computer  upon which i am writing this here review  on the opposite side of the house on the third floor  so  as far as you can get from the router  and still be in the house   i had irritatingly slow internet access  and frequent dropped connections i installed the wifi extender on the same floor as the router  but on the opposite side of the house     feet away from the router  in direct line of sight of the router  under a buffet  so  if it had eyes  the extender could literally see the router  all the extender had to do was send its signal straight up about    feet  through two floors that did the trick  and now i get fast internet with no drop outs  it s great      
281,5.0 ,                          second install  used with xfinity cisco xb  cable modem  this modem has both        g as does this re    ac    extender simply put extender in nearby outlet  press wps on modem  press wps on extender  you will be connected very quickly extender can then be moved to another location as per instructions love it   quick and easy      
282,5.0 ,                       so  i have been having issues with my internet for a while now  my computer couldn t seem to remain connected to the internet for anything more than    to    seconds  as anyone who is a university student knows  accessing the googlesphere is incredibly important in order to provide quality analysis  so having a computer who couldn t stay connected to the interwebz was causing me no end of frustration  naturally  my first call is to my isp as they provided the router in       i know     the ancient thing was begging for a retirement    they came and replaced the router this past thursday but the problem only became worse  and there was a quiz  thankfully i aced the quiz and ordered the range extender first thing this morning  the setup was very easy if you know how to do technology stuff  the unit itself is nice and small with no wires  due to it s size  i am easily able to hide it behind a storage rack and still have the quality signal i expect from my internet      
283,5.0 ,                       i bought this due to the weak signal i was getting in my living room  the router is in the closet of my master bedroom which is about     from the living room  i was getting very weak signal on my roku which made steaming terrible  the signal would be so weak that when i watched basketball games it would be blurry and freeze on me  this solved that issue  the roku device would show weak signal and now it show excellent signal  basketball games are so much clearer now  the i just installed the tp link n    and it took about   mins total  first you plug the wifi extender to a receptacle near the router  then you press the wps button on the router and press the wps button on the wifi extender and wait till the blue light stops blinking and stays solid blue  relocate the wifi extender between the router and dead zone area  wait till the blue light stays solid blue  now you look for the wifi network which is the same name as your existing wifi but with  ext  it uses the same password  i would recommend buying this if you are having weak wifi signal around the house      
284,5.0 ,                       after having so many problems with my tv that was not connecting to wifi this helps fix the problem i can now use my tv without hurling it thru the window even the manufacturer could not help me fix the problem thank you so much it is awesome        
285,4.0 ,                       in the hopes that i could get my crappy internet to be more steady in the back of my apartment  this works well enough for that purpose  i think  when we first plugged it in  it made everything go super fast  later in the day  we suffered from a snow storm which always seems to muck things up  yesterday was no different  i ve not noticed any difference today  but there s a foot of snow on the ground and much on the wires as well  i didn t lose signal on my smart tv last night  but i did have to disconnect my phone from the wifi in the house as it was not moving well when connected to the extension  we will see if it gets better when the snow is melting      
286,5.0 ,                       great product   wifi signal is strong and easy to install      
287,1.0 ,                       this loses wifi connection all the time     it is so frustrating trying to reconnect it all the time     
288,1.0 ,                       it does not get good signal after awhile     
289,5.0 ,                       i don t often give reviews  but his little thing is amazing   i have a wifi security camera mounted on an outbuilding that barely worked due to the weak signal at it s location   i would get an updated view every   to    seconds and trying to pan or tilt was painful  to say the least   i didn t have a  halfway  location to install this at as recommended   so i put it up in the same outbuilding as the camera and hoped for the best   the result is that the distant camera now performs as well as the camera on the other side of the wall from my wifi router and the camera settings page shows a full strength signal rather than the one bar it showed before   setup was very easy even though i needed to use the web browser method shown in the instructions because my wifi access point does not have a wps button  but it worked first try   very happy with this device   one caveat to mention though  is to make sure you differentiate the signal from this device with a unique name such as adding  ext to your wireless ssid name   i didn t the first time and just named it the same as my wireless network   when i went to connect the camera i couldn t tell which access point i was connecting to  as the both had the same name     did this in the house so the signals were both strong    i went back and added  ext to the name and it became obvious which was which   i now have glitch free streaming of the video to my monitor and the pan and tilt functions are instantaneous   highly recommended      
290,3.0 ,                       my router is upstairs and there has always been a major drop off or even a complete loss of wi fi signal down stairs and out on the back patio  so i theorized that placing one of these extenders down stairs in the living room and just inside the patio door might help with that  well while it isn t effective in boosting the signal in the house  actually weaker  it is apparently helping out on the patio which is what it is intended for  so this device seems to be doing what i bought it to do with several speed tests going back and forth with this and my regular wi fi network i can see a consistent      mbps increase using the extender and while that s not blowing my socks off at least i don t loose signal completely and that a nice improvement      
291,4.0 ,                       update    oct     the signal has improved over time  it is much faster and steady now  sometimes it still falls and becomes slow  but most of the time the signal is pretty good and around the same speed of the original router  i did nothing to change this it must have been an upgradenor something  at first i almost threw it in the garbage but let connected in th living room for the use of the guests and weeks later it all seems to improve  now  most of the time  it is working really well changed the rating to   stars original review way too slowwwwitem came in pristine conditions  very easy to install and manage  but the signal is way too slow  from around   mbps that gives me the router  the repeater only gives me max    mbps  that s the best i could get out of it read through the help section on the original tp link website  but nothing worked now i have internet in some parts of my house that were completly  dark   but the speeds sometimes becomes pretty unusable  can only hope for a future upgrade that could solve this issue  i could understand that the signal wouldn t be as strong as the original  even half of it or less  but less than        it doesn t makes any sense  by the moment it is only there conected sucking electricity i bought this to give signal to a couple of iot cameras that i have installed were the original internet signal did not have any reach  but it is almost pointless  the signal is strong  but has no quality at all      
292,5.0 ,                       consider me  mind blown    i setup the range extender in my house on the  nd level to support my sons pc  he was having lag issues on minecraft   i wasn t expecting to much from this item  just hoping to boost the signal in the      square foot house from the main floor to the second floor   to my surprise not only did the tp link boost the signal to the  nd floor as desired but it also increased my signal strength in the basement on my primary pc   now  when i say increased i mean increased      talking going from  mbs to   mbs  download speeds    this was a huge surprise to me and i am ecstatic about this product   i would recommend this item to anyone who has a weak signal from their primary router   never thought i would get more from a range extender then i do my wireless router   great product   pictures video to come confirming speeds      
293,1.0 ,                       horrible        don t buy it    i mean it s cheap and works  sometimes    it s constantly losing signal from the main router    also this is supposed to be a  range extender  maybe for like    feet    i ve moved this around and it still doesn t pick up the signal very well    i constantly have to unplug it and plug it back up just to get it to sync    the app that it has works well    tech support is horrible as well   and i m very tech savvy    i guess that s why it s so cheap    if you need it to go through a wall or something it works but you ll have issues    just not worth the money even though it s cheap or the effort    find another product so you won t be constantly messing with this thing   i want to set it and forget it except when i need to fix something or the power goes out or something like thy but nope    literally everyday reboot    in me picture the thing is les then    feet away from the main router that reaches hundred of yards    this thing still has a weak signal    my phone and all my other devices picks up the signal when this thing won t    and no mines not defective it s just cheap and doesn t work well at all        
294,4.0 ,                       i can t give   stars because i ran into some weird issues with my xfinity xb  and xfi pod mesh setup   i have some cameras that need a dedicated     signal as they were getting  confused  with the dual band       of the mesh network support was fantastic and after i contacted them they emailed me regularly with suggestions and to see where i was at   you can t beat that   they wanted to get things working there is a firmware update to allow you to control the dhcp service  better  the device would connect to my network  but nothing connected to them could get out to the internet for some reason it was acting as a dhcp sever even though it was off   even with the firmware update still could not get things working   i would suggest you update the firmware before you add any devices and redo the setup i tried two units thinking maybe the first was wonky  it can happen   but ran into weirder issues when i attempted the second one   it caused the xfinity router to freak out   it stopped issues ipv  addresses to my devices   wired devices could no longer connect unless i manually configured the network settings on the wired adapters   wifi was on getting ipv  address and not all of my     devices liked that i had to do a hard reset of my router and after that i was able to get my network back up with all my devices also i was able to get my picky cameras online so i no longer need these and returned them   i thanked support  email  if i have any future needs for network devices  switches mostly  i am going to go through them   i have flipped between netgear and dlink for my devices over the years   and when i have to reach out to support then  they were sort of a pain   they may be better now  but i am goin with tp link because of how receptive their were to help with what is an older device  of sorts    thank you tp link      
295,3.0 ,                       this extender drops wifi non stop  it rarely connects and has weak signal  the install was not fast or easy and you will need an app to run these  the app also didn t work well  it wouldn t load the extenders and did not give accurate readings of their signals  we ended up buying   to help with signal in our single story home and returned one but we re stuck with the others as we passed return date  went with a different brand wifi extender for the same price and what an amazing difference  i couldn t recommend this extender as it did not do what it was intended for  which was to extend the wifi and stay connected  pay a couple bucks more or go with a different brand if you need a reliable wifi extender      
296,5.0 ,                       works great   extending wi fi through out my home     
297,5.0 ,                       this extender works amazingly well  for some reason the back of our house has wifi issues this cleared them all up i don t hear anymore complaining of lagging wifi  definitely recommend      
298,4.0 ,                       honestly  i think this made my network slower somehow  than just using the wifi signal coming from my main router after being degraded from all the walls and distance perhaps i set it up wrong too  i don t know  what i do know is  this thing was inexpensive enough  i didn t bother returning it  i just don t use it right now i plan to keep it around for now until i feel like giving it another go  maybe in a different location in my house too next time  i think i d prefer to go with the linksys mesh network  it seems more appropriate for what i d like to accomplish anyways  which is streaming steam games on my network      
299,4.0 ,                       bought this wi fi extender for a friend who used to complain that she does not pick up internet on the upstairs of her home  as a result  she would not receive messages at nights the extender has been serving her well  it definitely serves its purpose      
300,3.0 ,                        edited          i ve played with more settings  for those interested in technical details  i realized the dhcp server settings defaults to   minute leases for connected devices  i think this was causing problems for my devices and reconfigured it manually  had to enter gateway and dns settings  to give out leases for      minutes  which was the maximum time limit allowed it is working as expected now  providing connection speeds of  mb sec  half of my true internet speed at the router  for this small success i upgrade my rating to   stars  but it has still been a long and arduous journey to get this thing working  original review i ve been using the product for about a year now  and it has consistently underperformed  setup went well  i just followed the instructions and used suggested settings  i have about   mb s download speeds from my isp that comes through my router  the tp link has a good connection displaying a green light  multiple different devices connect  desktop  laptop  smartphone  and all have strong strength signal  yet all devices are experiencing slow speeds as bad as   kb s per second    i have tried rebooting the extender  resetting its settings  repositioning its antenna  reducing the number of connected devices  updating firmware  changing ip settings to be statically set for my router  and moving the router so that it is closer to the extender this tp link extender  always  underperforms and often provides a      x slower connection than my true internet speeds   i give it    star for technically doing what it is supposed to  it does extend the network  it just does a very bad job of it      
301,5.0 ,                    bueno        
302,3.0 ,                       i purchased to use as a wireless access point  meaning the re    is connected to my internet router via ethernet cable    once it was properly configured  much trial   error   it works great for this purpose  and i am not restricted to using it only at my house     can be plugged into a router anywhere you need it   i am only rating   stars because the instructions for access point setup urgently need improvement  and i found their documentation to be misleading     the manufacturer needs to rewrite the instructions  i build robots for a living     but could not figure it out  for use as an access point  the following setup steps are what finally worked for me based on advice from the  rd techical support person i spoke to on the telephone    plug the re    into ac receptacle  and then plug an ethernet cable from a laptop computer  not your router  to the ethernet port on the re       once this is done  open a tab on your browser and go to                 this will open their setup webpage    the first thing to do at this point is create an administrator password  hit enter  and then immediately click on the mode button in the upper right corner and select access point     this will reboot the re    and open the correct configuration steps on their webpage for setting up passwords and other parameters pertaining to this application of the product    once you are finished with the online set up  you will save and click finish  wait for the changes to load and reach         now the the re    is ready to plug into your router and use as a wired access point    if you need to go back and change passwords  simply plug the re    into your laptop as described above   when finished  save settings and plug the re    back into your router there has been much controversy and disagreement among buyers of this item about whether or not it can work as an access point     i assure it can     but it took   calls to their technical support and much wasted time to accomplish   sad     that a good product with excellent packaging and great warranty does not have better instructions  i hope you find this review helpful  however  please understand that i do not work for tp link and do not consider myself part of their technical support team     i am simply trying to provide some useful advice to other consumers   if my advice does not work for you  call their technical support toll free                    
303,5.0 ,                       i have ethernet run throughout my house  and frankly i hate using wifi due to emi considerations mostly  so the majority of my internet devices are all hardwired to my home network  however  i still need wireless access for portable devices like phones and tablets  this device fits the bill for an access point perfectly  my only complaint is that the ethernet port is only    mbps rather than gigabit  but as my wan connections is only   mbps i can live with it  this device replaced a defunct  st generation apple airport express  and i have to admit it works much better with a significantly stronger signal than the ae  using a wifi analyzer standing about     away from each device  i found the tp link n    has about   db greater signal strength than the apple ae  for     i am completely satisfied with this product      
304,2.0 ,                       the only reason i still have this extender is because i purchased a mesh wifi system  using my basic router modem it didn t matter where this device was placed in my house it always disconnected from the internet  tech support only wanted to ask a ton of questions and have me go through troubleshooting options i already went through using my own knowledge  after purchasing the mesh internet system i have now the extender no longer disconnects from the internet but is still useless because my mesh system reaches further than it does  basically what i m saying is don t waste your money on this wifi extender or any wifi extender and buy a mesh internet system which will save you the time and frustration update           as of now the extender is useless they have taken away the ability to use it on their app  shows up as an unsupported device and will not connect to the internet  hoping to contact customer service for a refund     
305,4.0 ,                       good     
306,4.0 ,                       i minus   star because this thing is bulky and takes up both my outlets  so i had to buy an outlet extender in order to use this a product like this you really have to think about your living situation  i live in a large apartment in nyc  but my living room is like a dead zone for wifi  this extender really worked for me  i have it plugged in an outlet in my livingroom  not even near the router and it still works  my signal strength in my livingroom is strong and the only time it kicks out is if my router itself kicks out  so instead of blaming this device  check your router first  again  take into consideration your living situation      
307,1.0 ,                       this did not work for me at all  in fact my speed was slower with it than without it   we live in an older home with thick walls    maybe there is something else i need to do  but i pulled one in almost every room going down our hall and nothing worked      
308,1.0 ,                       waste of time and money  wifi signal works  but does not connect to the internet  although the wifi is password protected  this extender keeps allowing unauthorized devices to connect to it      
309,5.0 ,                       works good with my router and makes the signal strong on the other side of my house  easy enough step up  nothing difficult     
310,2.0 ,                       useless  we bought this because wifi speed is    mbps in the router room  but drops to    one room over     feet away  and by the living room     ft away  it s down to      comcast couldn t diagnose anything remotely  all looked fine  and can t send a tech right now so figured i d try an extender this just makes it worse  bedroom drops to   instead of     and living room goes down to a pathetic    kbps  multiple tests yield the same result we also can t get it to connect to our  g network  which is more powerful but even more affected by walls  it just doesn t show up at all  other reviews made it seem like  g would work but it doesn t sending it back      
311,4.0 ,                          wifi devices are connected in a     sf  story home through tp link cr     cablemodem router  sporadic connections to some of the devices forced me to investigate wifi extenders and mesh systems  i started with   tp link re    extenders  they helped but not enough  added a tp link re    which i centrally located on lower floor directly below the modem router  this was a major improvement but still had some weak dead spots in the house  thus  i just added a  rd re    lower floor far corner which seems to have solved the issue my isp is cox cable delivering    mbps  using   of the re    units to extend wifi and connect to   android tv boxes using ethernet cables  speedtest app says i am getting from    to   mbps at the   re   s which is more than enough to deliver hd tv shows via cbs all access app without any buffering mesh systems  prior to relying on the tp link extenders  i tried linksys velop and tenda   piece units  neither of them ever delivered more than   mbps via wifi or using their ethernet connections so both those systems were returned for refunds  unless something changes negatively  i m sticking with tp link extenders  which cost about     the total price of linksys and are      easier to install  simply plug   play             update  the  rd re    i added says v    on back  my existing   re    s say v    on back  since receiving the  rd tp link re    i noticed erratic behavior  it would go from having the strongest ethernet signal to having zero signal  despite showing the same green lights on the front  thus  i am returning the defective version     device  bottom line  i ve yet to discover any factory in any industry with      quality control and my other   tp link extenders have been totally reliable so i ve only removed   star for this defective device encounter      
312,4.0 ,                       does exactly what it says and after   day it does it well   i ve extended my wifi signal  att  wire modem router  to my entire basement with this device   currently my att router is single band so that s all i really get to use now but will be adding a dual band router soon my signal is very strong in the house and i ve very pleased with the device overall setup though was not simple for my experience using the web browser   following the directions i was easily able to connect to either the     ghz or   ghz signal after plugging it in   but the internal setup page was an awful experience   took many refreshes to get to the first page and start the process   it first let me get up to the  ghz scan and then stopped responding   multiple refreshes were needed to start over   i spent a good    stubborn minutes refreshing and getting to various states of the setup process   used   different laptops during this process trying to get the webpage setup to work   finally gave up and used the wps button and it setup the device within a minute  after i turned wps on in the modem router setups    att defaults it to off    so i d recommend going wps based on my experience   i am not a novice at all  pc   technical support for     years  so i could see how worse this would be to someone with little to no pc knowledge   may have just been bad luck with my specific device since i see others had no problem with the web page setup at all i would still highly recommend this device for someone needing to extend their wifi coverage      
313,3.0 ,                       this thing took almost an hour to set up  i used all three methods of trying to connect it  and none of them were working for various reasons  it would appear to be connected  but that little blue light   that  censored  little blue light    just would not come on and stay on  because it wasn t actually connected  one method just wouldn t work  another claimed i was using the wrong password  the third just gave me the middle finger or something  i was just about to throw it all back in the box and give up when the blue light  grrrrrrrrrrrrr  finally blinked once  twice  thrice   no   no   it stayed on that last time  i tried connecting my laptop  success  and it has been working ever since  so now i can watch   cat videos   in my bedroom any time i want without all the buffering and interruptions  best of all  i don t have to storm into my internet provider s office and raise holy heck because their signal is so weak  i just hope this thing never goes down  because i don t know if i have the patience to go thru all that again      
314,5.0 ,                       great price  works excellent     
315,5.0 ,                       all i know is i m happy  i have an old frame house in an area of florida that is pretty country  no real reception  i have a screen in porch built onto my garage  it struggled to get reception and on some devices couldn t  but then i had the brilliant idea of finding a name product i have had good experience with and a price range so it was worth the try  bottom line is i m extremely happy with what i got  as long as you are not going thru block walls   my guess is that might limit the signal  otherwise it s wonderful and does the range it states      
316,1.0 ,                       i bought this thinking it could help boost my wifi in another area in home home and it just made it worse      
317,3.0 ,                       great price  install was super easy  pressed the wps button on main router and on this and i was done the issue is speed reduction  the speed on my main router on download is    mps   the speed coming out of the extender is   mps right next it  that is one tenth the speed further away  the speed at the spot i needed coverage on is  mps  the coverage is good  it has full bars but much lower speed  now  for me this is still ok for what i need  but keep in mind if you need lots of bandwith usually extenders will reduce speed by about half but one tenth is really slow imo      
318,1.0 ,                       did not work i  connected this to my ps  cuz i would alway lag but it didn t do anything it stayed the same     
319,1.0 ,                       this thing is a piece of crap  literally all it does it connect and show      connection with zero speed  my original router is in the same room  i just wanted to boost the speed for my big screen tv which is    feet away  it didn t work  it shows that i have   blue lights  great signal  shows on the app that the signal is great and it literally does nothing  it s garbage  i tried getting help from tech support  they were clueless  wanting me to set it up closer to the router  it s already been set up and shows that it has      signal  doesn t really get any higher than that  does it      
320,5.0 ,                       i am very happy with this little device  my dtr and sons room would never have good and stable signal    until now both of them are busy one playing on line the other watching netflix no lag     i will say i never received any green lights when working on the initial set up    i just plugged the extender near my router pressed the wps on the router then on the extender both lights were on initially flashing     light to left was red then both both lights turned blue   once it is in this paired mode i unplugged the extender then plugged it in a mid point in the house lights pulsate for a quick sec then they are solid blue     ready to go nothing complicated at all   and at the sale price     nothing to loose     well worth it     
321,5.0 ,                       i ve been having buffering issues streaming content to one of my tvs for months  i decided to try out this wifi extender  now i m kicking myself for not doing this months ago  i like that when plugged into an outlet  the second receptacle is still usable  setup took about    minutes with the easy to follow instructions in the box  once that i was done i switched my tv and roku to use the ssid of the extender   my roku used to detect my signal strength as fair and now shows it s as excellent   all my buffering problems are gone on both my tv and roku using plex  amazon prime  netflix  and disney  glad i got this thing      
322,5.0 ,                       the  plug and play  instructions will not work if you have an xfinity router model xb  t  current new router as of        it initially appeared to set up and connect  but we still had our dead zone issue  i called xfinity customer service and explained the situation that we purchased the tp link wifi extender and we were not able to  extend  the wifi to our dead zone  i also explained that the tp link states that this extender is comparable with any wifi router  after going through all of the set up instructions with xfinity  she came back and stated that this extender will not work with our router and we needed to purchase their xfi pod extender via their website which is      for   pod    wow  i am not into proprietary devices and did not accept this answer and decided to contact tp link for support  they were so helpful and although it was a little more complex than  plug and play  they were able to walk me through setting up the extender and we now have wifi access in our dead zone   saving me      in not having to buy xfinity s little money making pod      
323,5.0 ,                       i really like this wifi extender for the fact that it is extremely simple to install  took me less than a minute   you literally plug it in next to your router  press the wps button on the router  and then the wps button on the device  and wait for the signal light to light up  which took mere seconds   you can then unplug it and move it around to various outlets to try and get the best signal for the device you want to use it on  it even has an indicator light that will come on if it s plugged in too far from the router to get a signal that being said  i was using this hoping to get more than one bar of signal in my basement bedroom  and now i sometimes will get a whole   bars  but that s it  i don t blame this on the device  however  i think concrete walls definitely don t help in letting the signal travel far  no matter how expensive of an extender i get  i would recommend this extender  just not for basements with concrete walls  it just isn t very effective so  in summary pros  extremely easy to set up and figure out how to use  seems very durable and high quality for the pricecons   doesn t work well in basements with concrete walls  which is somewhat to be expected      
324,1.0 ,                       it arrived on time  and i was excited to put it to use   the price seem perfect so a win win  in my book   the  directions are somewhat  vague   you ll have three options for set up  so hopefully you ll have better luck than i did   i couldn t get the passwords to work in  their system   finally after hours i got it set up thinking i was good to go   it was set up i sat down  and bam       i had no internet   peroid   everything shut down   i stream my tv  through the firestick  and to say the least it seemed like a hostile take over of my  network    i reset everything  and omitted  the tp link  extender and everything worked fine like normal   i had to rest everything to make sure i had not been compromised    becareful       maybe just a faulty unit but idk its going back       
325,5.0 ,                       i m very pleased with the tp link n    unit  the installation is very simple   just plug it in  press the wps button on your router and then also the one on the top of the unit  after a minute or two  the signal light will stop blinking and become solid  the one that i have has two blue lights rather than green as earlier models  but it works the same  my laptop computer is used in a room that is over     feet and three walls away from the router  the unit is mounted on an electrical outlet in a stairway near the room where the computer sits  whereas formerly i was getting less than    mbps  now i m seeing    mbps and the signal is very stable  considering the modest price  it has fixed a problem that was very annoying to me for a long time  what s not to like  i recommend this unit      
326,5.0 ,                       i needed some coverage in my basement office for a printer that was regularly losing connection from the router in my living room   i have a fios quantum router but wifi signals don t go thru steel and concrete well if at all   i tried to use the wps feature but to be honest the pc way is just as easy and allows you to set it up right in front of you   this one for the    seems to be just fine and it copies your ssid name so you don t have to change networks like other extenders   you will have to assign a diff name to a second one if you want more than one of these otherwise the new one could search for the extender rather than the modem   the ethernet port on the bottom is a nice feature as well   it also has power management features if you choose to have it cycle down when not in use but i have it for my printer so i just leave it on all the time   seems great for the price i paid  and i like the internal antenna too  it looks much cleaner      
327,5.0 ,                       we have att internet and have to use their equipment which is trash  wifi coverage of their router modem is t very good and basically drops off in any other room than the office it s in  we bought this and set it up in less than   minutes  real simple instructions  instantly boosted the wifi signal throughout the house  no more dead spots  we live in a     sq ft home and this extender was plenty to get signal to the rest of the house      
328,1.0 ,                       bought it  tp link ac    re     last year based on high ratings on amazon    years warranty offered was a plus my home network works great powered by a triband linksys router  all bands works fine and very stable  to cover some dead spots in the house  got this  installation was easy and soon i had extended network on     and   ghz bands  first few days  worked great  signal strength increased and i got good speed in previous dead spots  then started having intermittent connection issues on   ghz band  signal strength would be great  but would get  connected  no internet  error  checking the device  ip was not allocated  unplug replug would restore service  contacted technical support  they couldn t find much  since issue was really intermittent  i didn t pursue further few months later  it has become unstable on all bands  i have to constantly unplug replug to get service  sometimes when devices are connected  it would drop signal for few minutes on all bands and then reconnect automatically  other times  it would display  connected  no internet  error on devices  did some troubleshooting  the  system logs  don t tell much  figuring the extender is having issues in dhcp interaction with router  i gave static ip address to tp link extender  that didn t help  slowly  i started give static ip addresses to my devices as well  that didn t help either contacted the technical support  its overseas  the    hours live agent chat  doesn t work  it says  i am first one in queue but no one responds  emails take a day process due to time difference  the first level of support gave me a new firmware to try  it didn t help  then i was sent to advanced technical engineer  he gave me the same firmware to try  i flagged that to support and since then they have gone awol  multiple follow up emails have been unresponsive with work from home in place  a stable network is critical  have been many instances in the middle of meetings my connection would drop  would waste minutes and rejoining the meeting after rebooting tp link extender unfortunately  the return period is over otherwise would have sent back cutting my losses and throwing this in trash  will either get a new extender or go for mesh network      
329,5.0 ,                       ya     
330,5.0 ,                       my tv wouldnt connect to wifi  for some reason  ordered this  linked it to my wifi   plugged an ethernet cord in it and plugged it into my tv  i can now enjoy wifi and a wired connect on my tv      
331,3.0 ,                       update after months of use it works well except it seems to be over heating  one computer on it and things work great but if i am watching netflix and my wife is streaming something else it gets over loaded  unplugging it and plugging it back in after a minute seems to reset everything just fine  it is actually rather warm to the touch when i unplug it  probably when i unplug it other devices get thrown off and don t log back on if i buy another one i will not purchase this item  it is very easy to use and setup but more for a loner who has only a couple of devices                                   arrived in just a few days with prime opened the box plug a network cable from my laptop into the extender plug the extender into the wall selected my network entered the password finished can t get any easier than that     well i could have walked to my router and pressed the button and that would have been easier this product is exactly what i have been needing  no more barely connecting while i am on the third floor  i might buy another one for the detached garage      
332,5.0 ,                       this item is marketed as a  range extender   however  as a  range extender  being a single band and all  this never fulfilled my requirements in terms of bandwidth delivered to a number of clients  also it was inconsistent   one of the other option i tried was as a wireless bridge  and it performed inconsistently as a bridge to support a   port        ethernet switch  however  most recently i ve deployed this as an ap  and it has been great  i ve hooked it up to a powerline adapter tp link s own tl pa    p  and with the about    mbps that adapter is able to deliver  this so called  range extender  in ap mode  delivers the full n    bandwidth that it s capable of  with great range  serving about    clients  perfect for my use case      
333,2.0 ,                       it s poor quality   i don t get strong wifi signal i don t recommend it       
334,5.0 ,                       i ll preface this by explaining the layout of my house  we recently bought a     sqft ranch with finished basement  the front of the house is the living room and kitchen  the back half of the house is our kids bedrooms  and our master was an addition to the back of the house  thru the smaller bedroom  this is where we keep our modem and router since our game systems and desktop are hardwired  one of our kids bedrooms is in the finished basement  that runs under the living room and kitchen and also has cinder block on either side  bcuz of this  the living room  kitchen  and basement bedroom have terrible wifi connection  i couldn t even use my google home in the kitchen bcuz it couldn t find our wifi  for a few months we ve just been dealing with it  but now that my kids are all on virtual learning its just not cutting it  so we got this wifi extender  i set it up using the directions and recommended app  then relocated to the livingroom  on the wall between it and the kitchen  and immediately we had full connection in the living room  kitchen  and basement     bars in all rooms  it was only      so i didn t have high hopes  but i seriously can t believe its such a great signal at such an affordable price  very very pleased      
335,5.0 ,                       i think it is working well          
336,1.0 ,                       doesn t work good     
337,1.0 ,                       i have had problems with this extender from the beginning  i wish i would have returned it right away  but ended up not really needing it until after amazon s return date when i started using it i had problems  so i contacted customer support  i was on a chat with their tech support  india accent   and allowed them to access my computer remotely  i got a sales pitch about how much unauthorized activity was on my wi fi  and they could clean up my computer for          i said all i want was my wi fi extender to work  when she said yes it will work but your wi fi overall will also work much better  he said it would take about an hour  i would not have to pay if i did not want to  but they would assure me that everything would work fine  after    minutes i got a phone call from someone else who was the  technician who has been working on my computer   hispanic accent  and paying      for services was no longer an option  he pretty well demanded payment  so i used my paypal account  he wanted me to use a charge card and give him a charge card number  i wouldn t do it  that did not make him happy either  thenthen he requested that i login to my email and when i did he typed a email  from me  to  support globalcaresolutions   to authorize payment to  which macro web solutions  of          i would not allow the email to go through  i ended up with a charge on my account to a company called  fastspring   the whole thing was very sketchy i contacted the head of cyber security at my place of employment and found that what they were recommending was not necessary  and if i wanted to deny access to my wi fi   extender  all i had to do was change my password  any  unauthorized activity  listed was probably guests of our kids using the wi fi  i bought into their scare tactics the wi fi extender worked for a little over a week  now it shuts down randomly  i unplug it and plug it back in and it will work for about    hours and then quit again  i tried going back through customer support online chat and they said they do not accept returns or refunds stay away from this company      
338,5.0 ,                       if you are at all tech savvy  this is super easy to set up  the wps button on your router allows for instant set up it s a cute little device the internet speed isn t as fast as the main router  but it s fine for office use  video games or multiple video streams might be a problem  this device will not speed up your existing network  i haven t noticed any latency issues with video calls note  this  extends  your existing wi fi network by creating another local network with a different name  name of your wifi network plus   ext    so you have to set your devices to use the new wifi network in the spaces served by the extender  it s not a deal breaker for me  but i had thought this would just  boost  my existing wi fi network this works great for a home office where you are working throughout the day on wifi  as your device will continue to use the extended network throughout the day  it wouldn t work as well if you roam throughout the house all day  as you would frequently need to adjust which wifi network your device is on      
339,3.0 ,                       once you get the range extender up and running it does as expected  the biggest gotcha with setting up this device is the firmware  on my device it was many months out of date  this caused me to have major problems attaching the unit to my network so it could be extended  i tried all three recommendations for setup with the old firmware and was not able to get the unit to get out to the internet  a common issue reported on these units  when i updated the firmware i was able to use the tether app to get the unit on my network and get out to the internet  the url based gui and the options with in are sparse but adequate for many folks   also if your looking to extend    ghz this is not the device for you      
340,3.0 ,                       i was hoping to improve wifi speeds for my xbox  but this is definitely not solved that issue  we have    mbps wired      mbps wifi speeds  connecting to this gives us around   mbps  so almost half the wifi speed when connecting directly to the router  it works as an extender  but  up to    mbps  is a reach  will return      
341,5.0 ,                       it gives a great wi fi signal even outside the house      
342,5.0 ,                       bottom line  good quality wifi extender  easy setup  great internet access and speed on multiple devices  would recommend to a friend we live in a split level apartment and had super slow internet upstairs and even slower speed in our bedrooms  our smart tv s struggled to pull up streaming apps and our phones stayed on data mode  our internet provider said we d have to upgrade     mo for the  premium  plan which allows for more devices on  g  instead we bought this  installation was easy to follow  we placed it in the hallway upstairs  router is downstairs  and it works wonders  super fast streaming on all devices and works well with multiple devices  save the headache and order one of these      
343,3.0 ,                       didn t work like advertised  still didn t extend wifi signal from front of house to back     
344,1.0 ,                       after a month  it stops working      
345,1.0 ,                       i have one corner of my house where the wifi signal drops a little   in my boys room  they do xbox gaming  watching videos  etc so i just wanted to extend the signal so it wouldn t drop out  i was able to set up the tplink extender in a matter of minutes  but the issue arose when i started testing the speed  near my original router  i get speeds of    mbps   and speeds range from     to    ish back in my boys  room  when using the tplink extender  speeds never passed   mbps   no matter how close i was to the router  the box says    mbps wi fi   i d be happy with even half the wifi speed if the signal was going to be constant  but getting     th the speed is not acceptable      
346,2.0 ,                       not strong enough to get the wifi signal      
347,5.0 ,                       great and help extend wifi in dead zones of our house      
348,5.0 ,                       i was on the verge of literally tossing my ring spotlight camera thinking it was faulty  it would never do a live view  it barely ever recorded anything  it was pointless  my neighbor said they bought this and it made a difference for them so i figured for the price it was worth a try  i m so happy i actually have a camera that i can see recordings on or open up and look when i need to   this does     ghz only which is what the camera uses  it worked great for the one thing i needed it for      
349,5.0 ,                       our wi fi signal was poor in the second story of our house  this wi fi extender took care of that problem  worth buying and very easy to install      
350,5.0 ,                       our wifi in our condo is nearly    years old and frontier will not send us an updated new unit  with one in college who needs strong wifi it caused a big family fight with girls  one works full time and needs her sleep  the price is so right that i really read through reviews   nearly paying     times more with the thinking that if i paid more money  i d have a better product  so glad i was wrong  i highly recommend this product  instructions are easy to understand  i m not a tech person at all  and there is a tech support line if needed  that was important to me  thank you so much      
351,5.0 ,                       this worked so well for me  i used to not be able to play online anymore but this worked perfectly  it was also super easy to install      
352,2.0 ,pretty much an internet killer  if it extended the range at all it would be impossible to tell as it also dropped the siglal strength to such a low level that it was irrelevant  here is the transcript from my tech support call so you can see how you might expect to spend an hour or so of your time after buying this product   good day to you  we will be glad to help you out with your inquiry   thanks  may i know the model number of your tp link product  it is located on the bottom back label of the device                       tl wa   re                      thanks  what s the speed result  from main router  and from extender                       i am getting a speed of   mbps from the router and only   mbps or lower from the extender  however i am getting full bars from the extender and single bars from the router                      that s correct  the extender seems to decrease the signal while increasing the bars displayed  because our extender can t boost the speed  only the signals  that s correct because when you move the extender to another location the speed will deducted due to   wireless interferance                        i am in a remote corner of the house  why should the signal from the extender be lower than the signal originating from the router  i bought the device because the signal in this area is insufficient  what exactly do you mean when you say  signal   how far are they connected from each other                       router is downstairs    ft  from the extender   device is another    ft from there in a bedroom  in the bedroom  the device gets a stronger signal from the original router than from the extender                      okay  so which means your connection was fine  the extender only extend the range but not speed                       shoukd the extender be decreasing the speed   yes  that s correct                      so   despite buying this product i should expect a reduced signal than i already am getting   correct                      it may increased the range and signal but speed was not   so why did i buy this product   to extend network and have a nother wi fi name                       my device is at the end of the routers range and keeps cutting out  my intent was for this device to address that  however the signal is worse through your product than without it                       hello                       hi  we can install the tl wa   re again and change the name  if you want                       what should that accomplish                       it will determine and to compare if the router or the extender having low signal                      ok   what do i do  reset the tl wa   re  while plugged in please kindly press the reset hole for   seconds using a pin                        at the moment speed test shows     mbps through the extender and   mbps through the original router  is that normal                       so your device is receiving a   mbps signal and exporting a  mbps signal     how many led lights on tl wa   re   we reset the extender so it s not yet installed   two   both are lit  okay  please unplug the extender                      and run a speed test again  no   i have not reset it yet  i will reset  unplug  and plug in again                      thanks                      ext speed is    mbps   native speed is   mbps  okay can you send me the

in the extender again  and we will reset it                      i get   mbps without the extender and less than  mbps through the extender  it is plugged in now  okay please reset the extender  we will check the firmware                      unplug and press the reset button                       it must be pluggeed in                      ok   reset                      thanks  please join the

how far is the extender from the route  unable to support streaming video                        ft   one staircase  please check if the image is filtered by browser ads                      can you move it closer just for test purpose and try doing speedtest again                      pretty clear line of site  speed test at the device is   mbps                      can you move it beside the router then connect to villa villekulla  ext and do speedtest                      plugged in right next to router now   wifi signal is at   mbps   extender is   mbps  do this on your router  change the channel to   and channel width to   mhz then click on save then turn off and on the router then observe it atleast     minutes   if the issue still happens open the page again then change the channel to   and leave the bandwidth to   mhz and save then turn off and on the router again and do the same if still have the issue change the channel to    and observe again if still same chat us back                      wtf                       i have an arris wireless roter modem  are you saying i need to reconfigure it to make the extender work                       isn t this supposed to be an out of the box sort of device                       hello   no you dont need to reconfigure it  you just need to change wireless settings on the router  it wont affect other devices connected to it  its just a wifi channel                      ok   working on it  but definitely not  chatting you back   took me   min to get through the first time                      all right we haven t received your reply for   minutes  please kindly note that the chat will be closed automatically if there is no response within   minutes                        idk                         what happened now                       probably for a cheap extender it isn t worth the hassle  your device seems to simply kill the signal  i feel like ive already wasted far too much time with it                      pretty frustrating and disappointing   sorry to hear that  is there anything else for the meantime                       what should the speed drop be through the extender                       it should be     from the roiuter                      yeah ok   so the unit is garbage  what percent of the devices don t perform to spec in your experience  should i replace or change brands                       do what i said earlier change the channel to   and channel width to   mhz then click on save then turn off and on the router then observe it atleast     minutes   if the issue still happens open the page again then change the channel to   and leave the bandwidth to   mhz and save then turn off and on the router again and do the same if still have the issue change the channel to    and observe again if still same chat us back  ok  then that should do it
353,4.0 ,                       easy to install      
354,5.0 ,                       works as expected      
355,5.0 ,                       we use my dad s house across the road but didn t want to shell out nearly        month for wifi  bought a wireless bridge kit  but the router is in the back of the house    feet away and didn t want to crawl under the house to run an ethernet cable for the bridge  decided to try this  since it has an ethernet port  using the tether app  easily connected it to the main router  then hooked up the wireless bridge to the range extender  works almost perfectly  and keeps nearly half the original wifi speed  i did have to reset it once  unplug  plug back in  otherwise no issues      
356,5.0 ,                       good easy to install router seems to be providing much better signal to my bedroom tv     
357,2.0 ,                       it doesn t work    waist of money     
358,5.0 ,                       our house is      sq ft and although it is not huge  it is very long  our internet provider ended up installing our modem in the master bedroom which is on the polar opposite end of the house from where we keep the office living area and the signal was so weak or non existent  the extender works amazing and installation was so simple  i now have full connection all through the house  keep in mind  you will have to switch between the networks if you stay on either end of the house for the best connection  but that is an easy few clicks vs having bad wifi  i highly recommend this extender      
359,5.0 ,                       works great    i have   to boost the signal throughout my house   great value      
360,5.0 ,                       i am a remote worker who works entirely from home  we use zoom meetings  my video would cut out occasionally  in my opinion  that is not professional  people would ask me to repeat what i said  i work out of my bedroom as an office space and keep the door closed  i purchased this  then put it in the room right next to my bedroom  no problems at all  at one point my internet stopped working  but it was both the extender and my regular internet  therefore  it was the provider and not this device  i am so happy  i almost purchased other extenders in the     to      range  my place isn t large  so this price point is perfect  i m not sure how far the signal travels but do know that i was notified that the location i chose was a little bit too close  i don t really have many options based on the size of my   bedroom apt  bedroom  bathroom  kitchen  living room   my internet connection is in the living room  this was wonderful  i am so happy      
361,5.0 ,                       i had serious doubts that this would work because it seemed too good to be true and inexpensive  bottom line  it s nothing short of amazing  it literally took me longer to read the instructions and to set it up you simply plug it in the vicinity of your router  press the button on the router  wait for the light to turn blue on the tp      unplug it and then find an outlet about halfway between the router and the problem area we had trouble getting netflix in my daughters room upstairs on the other side of the house  the pictures of the before and after tell the story    i don t understand how the tv indicated that it was getting data but the netflix wouldn t work  it doesn t matter  it works now and has more data getting to it       
362,1.0 ,                       first of all  i should have returned this extender the moment i realized that no matter what i did the extender just did not deliver on its promises  it s likely either a bad one or just a cheap one  who knows    but i don t get the good reviews then although i bought it a year ago  it was used barely for a month and only because i still thought i was doing something wrong buyers beware that i only was able to get just over   mbps out of this thing  no matter where i placed the device  and i tried   different spots in the house  my router s speed is over    mbps   mbps is also not that bad if one uses it specifically for a dedicated device  here comes an interesting part in one of the rooms with the signal problem i have a fire tv stick that i use for streaming  get this  with the signal status  fair  from my router vs  very good  from the extender  my router outperforms the extender anyway  it s as if the extender could not  sustain  the signal  it says   mbps  but the delivery is as if it was  oh i don t know  maybe like about  mbps  and it s the same story no matter where i placed this extender  i tried using wps configuration  then i tried browser based configuration  it did not matter  the results are always the same     mbps per speed tests  but my fire tv stick  while streaming anything  was constantly interrupting and i would get a  waiting for a good signal  spinning wheel i contacted the support recently  diligently took screenshots of everything that was happening  and the response was   our range extender is just a product for network expansion  it will provide significant wifi signal strength and extend the wireless network to further areas  but it is unable to improve the wifi speed  so that is the reason why in the room with the signal problem you will get strong wifi signal from the extender but the speed is similar to the router s wifi speed in that room   this reply from then ignored everything i described to them which pretty much the same thing i wrote here  they did not get that for some reason the extender s speed keeps capping at   mbps and that it has a problem transmitting the signal that yo yo s between   to    so  in the end      wasted  no biggie  but i am now not certain other extender don t have the same problem      
363,1.0 ,                       this product does not work very well and shuts off every ten minutes the thereby cable doesn t work and the connection is horrible     
364,5.0 ,                       stronger wfi     
365,5.0 ,                       i was not sure how this little jobber was gonna work   i got this for a home office during covid as my internet connect was week due to moving computer further from the router   easy to set up allowing you to create your own wifi internet connection by naming and putting a password on it   i have had no issues with this   i reside in rural america where high speed internet is not like it is in the city   i was impressed it is able to maintain a connection thru two walls and a door   i like that i was able to give this little jobber a specific name and password to keep kids out while i work   it works so well  had to order another one just for the kids they use for their gaming system and in a world of connectivity  everyone is able to do what they need and want to at the same time      
366,5.0 ,                       strong signal for my two story house  i didn t think it was working and i called support and they were very helpful  it was working the whole time but i thought there was going to be a different name on the network  good thing they helped me  highly recommend this extender and this company      
367,1.0 ,                       what a joke  i have a small apartment there are two walls between me and my router  so i figured   of these would help daisy chained to my room from the original signal  the closest room got about  mbps on speediest  original wifi is   mbps in that room  then in my room it was a whopping     mbps   normal signal does     mbps   so needless to say this product was a huge waste of my time  it was easy to setup but  don t like that you need an online account for setup      
368,5.0 ,                       easy to install   now get wifi reception in an area where it was very spotty before      
369,4.0 ,                       july      updated from   to   starspurchased  nd during prime deals      after about   month of use  i noticed that the  st extender seemed to erase or override the router signal for several of the devices set further away from the modem router  showing no signal or connected with problems    so i got a  nd extender to keep closer to the router and with a bit of creativity set up a manual ip address for each device separate from the router  i recommend two different passwords for admin access so you know which device is which and don t forget to change create a password for the router  i have restricted which devices can use which signal and this has seemed to make a difference with wifi strength consistency  i have not had to reset either of the extenders yet  if anyone has any thoughts on security  privacy risk associated with using these extenders with the router or ways to improve security please comment june    i paid     so thought it was worth a try  compared to belkin the customer service for this is terrible  i used other comments reviews on amazon to finally get it set up  st  i have a dual router  so this little guy only works on the     so don t bother looking for the    nd  plug into the wall as close to router as you can  and look at your router settings to find out what the ip address is so you can use that ip address to access the settings on the extender and enter password protection for the extender  rd  i renamed the extension so i could see select which wifi signal is stronger  th  unplug and move to location were the extender light is not red but as close to the areas you need the wifi signal boosted functionally this little extender had made a huge impact on my iphone wireless  for some reason the last os update made my wifi unstable  this extender has resolved the issue for the most part  for the upstairs it seems to have improved the signal strength  however i have signal issues with the fire tv  i have yet to need to reset it and it has been about a week  hopefully it will keep working      
370,2.0 ,                          setup more difficult than expected  pressing tps button on router changed my existing wifi password  as well as giving it to the new  ext device  with no word to me about what that new password was  had to query my original router  edit the password back to normal there  then manually do the setup on the new wifi device  if in doubt  i recommend doing the manual setup from the start    device needed to be unexpectedly close to the original wifi router  out the office door  down the stairs  directly across the small family room  about     as crow flies  even     further  at other side of fireplace in family room  would not work    amplification  as shown in bandwidthplace com upload and download tests  was good only in the family room itself  it was actually poorer than the original in the adjoining dining room  where we d most wanted it  this was     from original router  only     from the extension  the original had twice the bandwidth as the extension      
371,5.0 ,                       tp link n    wifi range extender seems to be a very well made product as well as being easy to setup and us pros   ease of configuration   the quick installation guide simple to follow   it has   methods of installation to chose from      via wps button      via web browser      via tether app  setup complete in less than   minutes signal strength from device is very good able to lock onto weak primary wifi signal to be able to extend range significantly   sustains multiple video channels being played on multiple devices at same time   additional configuration settings available via web browser login to tp link device   ability to  copy  or duplicate the sid of primary wifi device to create an always on effect no matter where you re at in our campus network  reliable wifi extension    i ve yet to experience any issues with my wifi via this range extender  it works and simple to use cons     methods of installation    choice can be confusing for some   it s not evident to average person which route to take   the simplest is via wps button  method      no additional information manual about functions available to manage via web browser  gnu general public license booklet    so what  does anyone even read this stuff   save the tree and include a link in the quick installation guide and have it electronically available i ve use multiple devices to achieve wifi range extension in the past   most with success  but none have been so quick and easy and reliable   i m actually using this device to extend range of a  private  campus network that i manage  it enables a classroom access to an otherwise unusable wifi network and where ethernet cable is not able to be run at the current time would i recommend  yes  without hesitation   it does exactly what it is designed to do i even bought a second for my house      
372,5.0 ,                       just installed it and it appears that it will be awesome setup info easy press wps on the router then press wps on extender    the two units do the rest how to find the network if your network is named  john s home     then you will look for john s home     ext  use the same password my situation townhome with router upstairs i placed the extender downstairs i did a speed test with my laptop without the ext it was    download then i connected to the extender    download more than double      
373,1.0 ,                       this wifi extension is constantly dropping out while all the lights are on  and there is no problem with the settings or firmware  it will simply say  connected  no internet   and this happens at least a dozen times a day  i finally had to put it on a wemo switch so i could remotely reset it  that way it works without me having to get up in the middle of the night while trying to watch netflix  i have contacted customer service  they have provided speedy replies  but essentially just ask you to repeat the same troubleshooting procedure over and over again  not worth the shipping price  let alone the actual cost      
374,1.0 ,                       i got this to extend wifi service into a back bedroom and main dining area  as it had great reviews  after using the wps feature on my router to pair it to the unit  as per the manual   the lights did what the manual said they would do  i plug the extender into a wall socket that has line of sight with both the router and the devices that need wifi  in an l shape configuration  the devices that need wifi are at        connection strength  with the extender plugged in  or not  both lights are on solid blue on the extender  which the manual states means it is working  so obviously  something is wrong  i they try method    in the manual  yet none of my   devices i tried were able to locate the extender s network  i reset the extender  and still it isn t broadcasting a network  so i gave up  it s  sunday  in a long holiday weekend  and there is a category   hurricane about     miles off shore  maybe i will try tech support next week      
375,5.0 ,                       this thing works so incredibly well and it was so simple to set up i m kicking myself for not buying one sooner  i had an entire section in my house that had spotty wi fi at best  you would literally have to turn the wi fi off on your cell phone or the pages would never load up for example  now all the pages load up with lightning speed and there s no more buffering on the roku that s in the guest bedroom  this thing was kindergarten simple to set up  literally plug it in push one button on each end of the set up and wait for the solid lights  then you move it to a permanent location wait for the solid lights and you re gtg  most important thing do not forget to find your new ext and login with your old password  i hope this thing lasts because otherwise i can t find anything negative about it whatsoever      
376,1.0 ,                       worst piece of tech i ve purchased in years i like it s design  i even like the app available to help properly configure it  i want to like the device  but it won t stay connected for more than    minutes at a time  and when it reconnects after several minutes  the app tells me i should move it further away from my main router because it has a  strong  signal well  i agree i should be able to move it further than     from my main router  especially considering i can see my main router from the location of the extender  i mean  there s not a single wall between the two  and yet  as i ve been typing this  the extender has been offline  back online  offline again  and back online  and when i do move it further from my main router  as suggested by  tether   the configuration app  it will drop offline immediately and stay offline for hours  days  or seemingly indefinitely  i have spent hours unplugging and plugging it  resetting it  reconfiguring it  etc   and each time it is just as unreliable as the time before currently  there is only one client device to which i need this extender to provide a connection  my ring pro video doorbell  located about five feet from  and on the other side of a wall from  the extender when i checked the ring app a moment ago  i found that i m missing the last two days of footage from the doorbell camera amazing please read other reviews before you purchase this product  this is my experience and it seems to be vastly different from that of most others who have purchased it  compare your situation to those of amazon shoppers who were pleased with the performance of this device  or maybe just note that there are more highly rated extenders available in the same price range and consider one of those when making your decision  just remember that  in the end  an unreliable range extender may cause you far more frustration than the wifi deadzone it s meant to bring to life full disclosure   as i continued writing this review  the extender seemed to maintain its network connection the whole time  mayne its not as terrible as i ve made it out to be  but   all things considered  over the four months i ve owned it  it has been nothing  if not consistently unreliable      
377,4.0 ,                       i paired mine utilizing the wps connection method   as noted in the instructions  i had to repeat the process to achieve     and     ghz connections   i stumbled a bit on this as the first attempt went smoothly  however it seemed i had to fuss a bit to get the  nd band to connect   the upside to this is  it configures the device with the same ssids passwords i then moved the repeater to the garage  which is about    feet from the router  source    the     ghz signal is rock solid  however the     is right on the edge   sometimes it is red  sometimes it is green   it s understandable given the higher frequency band is more sensitive to obstacles   even with that  the     ghz is working well   i was getting about    mbps on the download  which is quite sufficient for my needs      
378,5.0 ,                       very easy to install and gives a great boost to my wifi signal     
379,5.0 ,                       nice product  as others said  it is indeed easy to setup and configure as there are detailed instructions  it boosted the signal pretty good both for a pc and mobile phone  i took one star off as there is no information about the manufacturer or the website where a firmware upgrade file can be downloaded  the manual says download  from our website   but none is provided  that s odd  when i searched by the device name   wf       i found only a closely related  by item name  samsung washing machine and epson printer in top results    when i attempted to go to slopehill com  the amazon seller  slopehill    this web address was not valid  actually listed for sale   so it must be not the manufacturer name  no clue from the item itself  its box  enclosed instructions or description on its amazon web page  fortunately  a firmware upgrade is optional step  and the wifi signal was boosted already  there was a couple of other minor issues     the installation guide says that before starting  check if there s anything missing in the package  and contact your dealer of purchase to claim for missing items   xwiteless n repeater   x rj    networking cable   x quick installation guide  rj    cable was not included  but i don t see on the amazon product description page  this option  using a a cable  is optional  and you can configure a new network wirelessly  or use your own rj    cable  but the guide seems outdated as is  ok  the repeater is cheap already  fair enough        there is a  usb charging interface  on the repeater from both the amazon product page and installation guide  but it s function is not described  i presume it is not required for charging the device  but possibly provides an option to connect to a usb port to power this repeater if there is no ac outlet     the amazon product description listed   other features    guest mode  and  fast charge   but these are not addressed in the quick installation guide  and no website address as i mentioned above  within our apartment we lose signal in one of the back bedrooms which just happens to be the master bedroom   this obviously creates issues if we want to watch youtube while laying in bed which is why i wanted to get a wifi extender to see if we could boost the signal   upon plugging the booster in and running a speed test we saw great improvements in both upload and download speeds in that room  purchased this wifi extender to help get a stronger connection for our skybell wireless doorbell  we were getting laggy videos and slow alerts when we had a recorded video  my husband purchased this wifi repeater to hopefully get the skybell functioning at at least        for better videos and faster alerts  my husband was able to set up the repeater as an extender very easily  the instructions are easy to follow and within    minutes we had it completely set up and plugged into the outlet nearest the skybell  we are now getting      we tested the videos and alerts and all are working as the should  before getting this extender we were thinking of returning the skybell  this extender was what we needed to complete the doorbell upgrade at a great price  i recommend this repeater to anyone needing an extender or access point to add to their existing wireless network  you won t be disappointed

381,5.0 ,                       i am a tp link guy   my whole house has become tp link over the past two years based upon the quality and stability of their products   my tp link archer c  router came with the ability to use the tether app to manage the router   this range extender replaced a belkin i had and this range extender is also managed through the tether app i have tp link smart plugs  smart bulbs and smart switches and i use the tp link  kasa  app to manage those items  i note that some newer range extenders are listed in the kasa app as well    so while i need two apps to manage everything i dont usually go between them as they serve two different sets of functions specific to this range extender the setup was easy  ish    once i connected my device  chromebook  to the range extender and set my password i was able to set the  host  networks     ghz and  ghz    i had originally tried using my phone but the chrome browser on my phone didnt let me set my password   from there i plugged and un plugged the range extender and using the tether app checked the signal levels  using location assistant  until i found a good place   through the tether app i know which devices connect through the range extender and which go through the primary router of the many smart home hardware software manufacturers i find tp link to provide an overall more stable and secure product  i work for a fortune    company in software security and evaluate such things professionally    they continue to invest in the product line and are adding features  and security patches  at a reasonable rate      
382,4.0 ,                       this review is on   purchases that arrived at the same time  i ordered both to compare    netgear ac     wifi extender   t p ac     wifi extenderboth about same pricenetgear  st  connected with wps button  but could only connect to  g only  had to dig out the laptop to set it up with each band   g    g  pretty straight forward  took around    minutes  i mounted in garage    feet away from home router  i m using fios by frontier          on  g  it does       on  g up and running so its time for speed test  i tested both bands   times to get an average   g was    down     up   g was     down     up tp link ac    wps took   minutes to marry up  i did the double wps but didn t get the  g band  had to go to website   set it up manually with passwords  no big deal  still an easy process  time to test speed  unplugged netgear   put tp in same wall plug  tested again like above  both bands   times for average     down     up on  g     down and    up on  g the netgear outperformed the tp by almost   times the speed  my purchase was to speed up reaction time to   isp cameras  scrolling thru both cameras  the netgear extender made the reaction time much faster both extenders were mounted    feet under the cameras  so the signal strength was      on both every situation is different  that s why i bought   different brands to test  i ll put the tp in the bedroom so the wife can have it  i m sticking with the netgear for performance         
383,5.0 ,                       easy order easy set up works well amazon good for small stuff save home improvement items for big box as returning large items to amazon is pita and often broken refer to swiss madison toilet reviews on amazon      
384,4.0 ,                       we hooked this up back in my wife s office that has a few walls between her desktop and the router   she had pretty low speed back there at about    mps   on wifi  this bumped it up to about    mps  which is hardly worth the effort   that said  it was close enough to run an ethernet cable to it and it bumped it to    mps   still not close to the     mps that is available in the rest of the house  but she s thrilled and it s all she needs  so i m happy too i tried hooking up a second one elsewhere in the house but both signals had the same name and so there was no switching  and often the phones and tablets would catch the weakest of the signals      
385,1.0 ,                       followed instructions step by step and the signal that was  well received was scrambled  bloc ed     
386,1.0 ,                       title says it all  i have a gb line and i am pulling  mb while all other devices through the house even the weak spots pull     mb  its a total waste of money and ill be asking for a refund      
387,5.0 ,                       easy to install  app is very user friendly     
388,4.0 ,                       we had a weak signal  which meant slow internet speeds  in one of the rooms furthest from the wifi router  so we purchased one of these wifi range extenders set up was more complicated than it should have been  as the  one touch set up  didn t work  but logging into the wifi extender using a web browser and following the instructions was pretty straightforward   tp link also offer an app  but i didn t try it the signal is now strong in all areas of the house  and i have no issues with internet speeds   it creates another wifi signal that you need to connect to separately  but that wasn t a problem   this only worked with the    ghz signal  which is fine for us  but might be an issue for others      
389,4.0 ,                       this ac    dual band network extender works well and made it possible to stream tv to my sony  which is situated in a dead spot   the product works well and i have ordered a second one   i think it is a workable alternative to the far more costly mesh systems but  i was surprised to find so many reviewers remarking on its  easy installation    it took me two days of patient experimentation and troubleshooting to actually  get it going as a first step  i would recommend that you locate the tiny reset pinhole next to the ethernet socket   you can reset the device by jamming an opened paperclip into this hole and holding pressure until the status lights trill   the reset returns the extender to its innocent  fresh start  just out of the box condition  erasing any failed attempts to get the thing programmed and running  i  probably reset it   or   times altogether you can establish communication with the device via a computer or a portable device   there is an app called  tether  that will run on your iphone or ipad   i installed tether on my ipad and found that it could not  see  the ac     there is no fallback other than a reset of the ac     which i tried   it had no effect   i then moved to a dell laptop  which worked much better   it was able to find the ac    and communicate with it   but if you feel your way through the installation process without the tether app  you may find you have made subtle mistakes that keep the system from working   after a long period of online chat with a well meaning support tech  i realized he knew less that i did about the ac      back to experimentation   the installation via the dell laptop went nowhere   finally  as a last resort  i went back to my ipad and the tether app   by some miracle  one the second or third attempt  tether actually discovered the existence of the ac      from that point the installation was pretty easy   only one more reset and i was home once you get through the installation the device is impressive   before the installation of the extender  at my tv  i was reading download speeds of    to    mbps   after i installed the ac    i could get pretty consistent  results in the range    to    mbps  more important  it became possible at last to stream tv   lessons  learn to reset  try to use thetether app    if you can get it to work  it does a quick and accurate installation   and don t give iup  keep trying this and that  eventually the thing will work      
390,5.0 ,                       this range extender actually works great   installation was simple  you do not have to use the one touch wps button unless you want to   a lot of us have our own network name  ssid  and password   power it on  wait for the solid blue and then plug an ethernet cable in from the tplink to your computer and type in the command   its on your installation sheet    follow the simple instructions and you are up and running in   minutes   be sure you know your network name and password ahead of time  makes life easier   after you get the   solid blue lights  unplug and install it in a electrical outlet approximately halfway between your home router and the  dead spot  in your home   numerous speed tests convinced me this is working great   mbps before and    mbps after installation   i now have wifi in my backyard for streaming music and sports radio      star rating for a product well under    bucks   btw  i am just a consumer like you  no affiliation with the vendor  amazon or anyone else   good luck     
391,5.0 ,                       i have a weird problem that inspired me to buy the tp link n     i have three active surface devices  a og surfacebook  a surfacebook   and a surface studio that are setup in an area of the house that s not the best for wifi reception  regardless of this  the og surfacebook and the surfacebook   connect to wifi without problems  a high speed  ghz fios connection  and the connection is stable even if the signal strength isn t the best  the studio though is the absolute worst when it comes to wifi reception  some days it connects fine and will run reliably for days  then there are times when the surface studio will lose wifi connection requiring repairing the connection through windows     sometimes  it s so bad that the studio will lose connection again    seconds after wifi has been reestablished  repeating this cycle for days  this is annoying to say the least  initially i thought maybe verizon was jerking us around with shotty service  but after putting the og surfacebook and book   as well as a nintendo switch through a series of wifi tests over the course of a week or so  it was clear that the problem was specifically with the surface studio as every other device was able to maintain connection even though the signal strength wasn t the best consulting with other surface studio users  as well as some surface pro users  it seems they were having the same problem with wifi  microsoft doesn t seem to care because the solutions they ve provided that i ve tried  including typing code in a command line  didn t work so that left me to address the only sensible option  move the studio closer to the router  which isn t feasible due to my current set up  or extend the wifi signal so the studio isn t struggling to maintain connection tp   link n    to the rescue so  while browsing the news feed a few days ago  i saw that amazon was having a sale on wifi extenders  great timing  exactly what i needed  the reviews for the n    were awesome so i decided to buy two because they were so cheap  they arrived and setup was super easy  another win  but then i hit a snag  the n    is only a    ghz extender  i needed a  ghz extender  suckage      not quite what i needed but good enough for now   since i ve already committed  i decided to test drive the n    with the surface studio and it s working great  signal strength is much better  as i type this   no loss in connection  of course download speeds are going to take a bit of a hit at    ghz but that s not the manufacturer s fault  that s my fault for not reading the device description more thoroughly conclusion   it works and setup is easy     if you are still using    ghz and need a wifi extender with easy set up  you absolutely can t go wrong here  i used the browser method to setup the n    to avoid monkeying around with the fios router or a mobile app and it s been great  but if you re strictly using a  ghz wifi connection then i can not recommend this device because it doesn t support  ghz connections  i had to re enable    ghz on the fios router at home because verizon in what passes for wisdom  disabled     ghz some time ago as if no devices use it anymore  protip  some still do  exclusively   fortunately  re enabling    ghz so long ago makes the n    viable to me today when it would not have been otherwise      
392,2.0 ,                       the signal is still stronger from my wifi router than this extender no matter where i put it      
393,5.0 ,                       i ran a hard line cat  from my router in my office across my house via the attic into my master bedroom where this unit is plugged in  it took just a bit of online searching to find out i needed to go into the device settings and change it to access point mode in order to make use of my hardline  which was super simple once i found the instructions  you just go into the management page which the instructions direct you to  and there is a button on the top right that says  mode   you click this and select the option  access point  instead of  range extender  and it reboots the extender   that is all there is to it to make use of a hardline and create a signal as if you were sitting right next to your router  you do have to create a new network name and password  after researching  my understanding is that you can make it the same as your current wifi login name and password and the device will  somewhat  switch on its own  but creating a new network name and logging in manually is the guaranteed way to keep a strong signal   try them both and see what works for you  i named this one  master  and manually connect to it whenever i am in bed or our master bath  takes a few seconds and guarantees max signal  we always had trouble with the signal in our bedroom and master bathroom  this fixed that completely for    bucks and   wire  awesome  i mainly wanted to post about my experience with the hardline because most people just use this in range extender mode  extending the range of existing wifi without any hardline   figured this review may help someone out that intends to use it wired like i am      
394,5.0 ,                       it helps signal to ring device much appreciated     
395,4.0 ,                       seems to be working well for its intended purposes  one thing i didn t realize immediately was that do to the nature of how extenders operate  they run at     of whatever your good signal regular wifi gets   so our internet is   mbps  so the extended network pulls as perfectly solid   mbps down connection  for the user on the extended network this is totally fine and perfectly fast for all kinds of tasks so works great here extender is basically at one end of the house and the router is at the other  both on the same wall  on the same floor  and with direct line of sight  intended user is on the floor above  and then on the exact opposite wall parallel to these devices  signal is excellent  no issues at all  i found the setup very easy and away we go without the extender we were getting    mbps down with very low signal  and bad consistency in speed  with maybe occasional spikes to    mbps with the extender  as mentioned its a solid   mbps with perfect signal  given our internet speeds the extender is operation      perfectly all for a super low reasonabele price  very happy so far      
396,5.0 ,                       very easy to setup works fine as an extender it basically creates another wifi signal  i live on a  rd floor and it reaches the first floor ring   perfectly  you do lose some speed but not much     
397,2.0 ,                       we just recently setup our spare bedroom as an office  and the wi fi coverage was not great  we got this range extender thinking it would mesh with our existing network  the setup guide actually tells you there are two methods to set it up in extender mode     copy the existing wi fi ssid  or    create a new ssid to broadcast  i e      main wi fi name   wifi abcd   extender name   wifi abcd  vs      main wi fi name   wifi abcd   extender name   wifi abcd ext    although we were able to  see  the improved signal strength  we started to have daily issues with all of our wi fi dropping out intermittently in both the main and extended network coverages  sometimes our devices would still be  connected   but have the  little or no connection to the internet  warning  it isn t our isp either because the connection issue disappears when we use a wired connection  i tried optimizing our wi fi in a congested neighborhood  and i discovered that nobody was on the    ghz channel    when i set our main wi fi to broadcast on that channel i discovered the extender started broadcasting on that channel as well  it was only then that i realized there was probably some destructive interference going because the two wi fi radios were broadcasting the same ssid on the same channel frequency  i looked through all of tp link s settings and documentation  and there is nowhere that you can change the extended network s broadcast channel  the only setting i found is if you switch it to ap mode  but that won t work for us because it is a distance problem not a  we don t have an existing wi fi network  problem i just can t believe the creators of a wi fi extender radio didn t consider the basic lesson about destructive interference that every electrical engineer learns on like day     we have had moderate improvement by switching the extender to broadcast a completely separate ssid  i e  option   above    wifi abcd ext    but it was never our intention to have to create two separate wi fi networks that we have to setup twice on every device      
398,1.0 ,                       it worked fine for around     months  and the signal provided after is horrible  almost useless to even try to connect to      
399,5.0 ,                       this doesn t boost your signal it just extends it to other parts of the house where the signal is weak     
400,4.0 ,                       works well but not quite what i was expecting   so this device does not really extend your range of wifi it makes a new connection for the simple explanation if you have devices like tv  computer etc that will stay in location where the extender is then it works fine  as you can connect direct to this instead of the router for detailed read below for example if your using both     and   and say you have them named a and b for the ssid on your router this device is making a new dual connection so you would have now   visable connections so now you would see abcd yes you can keep the naming the same and essentially program the extender with the same name and same password  but by doing so i was getting reduced signal because sometimes my devices would connect to the extender and then sometimes to the router      
401,5.0 ,                       tech support was able to get this up and running in no time      
402,2.0 ,                       i received both of the products yesterday  one in an open box with grease smooch on the front and the other brand new but i was charged the same price for both  this is very poor practice      
403,3.0 ,                       i most likely didn t need this wifi extender but got it as my signal strength was weak in my home office  but would still connect and be stable i bought this affordable extender in hopes  but this only connects at half the speed of my wireless router unfortunately it connects at a speed that is choppy when using some online software and video conferencing all connection speeds were used using speedtest net and google s embedded speed test      
404,5.0 ,                       i almost got sucked into buying a razzy  and expensive  wifi extender unit  i realized  i don t need dual band coverage  i just need a wifi signal in my detached garage so i don t waste precious dolla bills listening to podcasts over cellular data  my garage is about    feet from the house  i plugged the unit into a socket near the backdoor in the house and  voila  wifi in the garage  it s really at the max though  and i have to keep my phone near the front of the garage to ensure coverage  but for    bucks  it s way cheaper than going over my allotted gigs of data every month  well worth it for a fast and dirty solution      
405,1.0 ,                       the connection was poor i was better off without it     
406,5.0 ,                       we have verizon fios for our internet supplier and unfortunately it doesn t throw out much of a signal past   ft  these things  tp link n     save the day  not sure how much they put out but it s plenty for roku and cell phones  going to buy my third one right now and our whole house will be covered including outside  bought a projector for our yard and hooked it up to a roku  our signal was terrible  so i took one of these extenders and plugged it in our mudroom and the roku picked it right up  problem solved and now we can easily stream netflix  prime video and locast  tonight we watched nfl on a giant outdoor screen and it worked flawlessly  no lag  no buffering       these are    bucks and work fantastic        
407,5.0 ,                       great wifi extender  our wifi wasn t wanting to reach the back half of our     sf home  upon using this super simple  easy extender we are now covered all over            
408,5.0 ,                       i had been getting a weak signal in my bedroom and no signal on my outside porch  so i thought i d try this unit  easy and quick to set up  the lights all blinked correctly  but at first i wasn t getting the boost i had expected  i had a slightly better signal in my bedroom but still nothing on my outside porch  then i noticed that my iphone had a new network option i could join    actually an existing network  with verizon  with   ext  added to name  once i chose that network and re entered my password  i suddenly had a signal on my porch  love it      
409,5.0 ,                       i needed help like many  my router is downstairs on the main floor and all the hungry devices are upstairs  i have   of these and looking to make another purchase for my backyard  plugging in right next to the doors that lead outside  with the two that i have i was able to divide the house almost in half and have no complaints about throughput  speed  or ping rates  my son has his computer connected on wifi  mostly the     ghz and gets a great ping rate for his games and gaming console  my other son uses the ethernet connection for his game console in the bonus room and doesn t  glitch out  like other do  his words not mine  we work at home  have our computers  mobile phones  a few tablets  two wireless printers and then the kids mobiles and computer game consoles all connected  we only slow when our provider feels the load of everyone getting home and connecting  these little things work great       
410,5.0 ,                       i bought this to go in my new house  as it is two stories with pretty thick walls and i have a somewhat cruddy modem router combo  sbg      i believe  that i got on sale and worked well enough at my old house  unfortunately  while my computer is only around the corner  the  line of sight  to it from the router goes through two exterior walls and my signal was horrible  the upstairs barely got reception i set this up using the wps first  and it worked quite easily  i just waited for the unit to boot up     seconds or so   hit the button on it and it flashed  then i hit the wps button on my modem and the unit cloned my wireless setup after i could tell it was working  i decided that i wanted to be able to tell if i was on my main router or the extender network  so i cleared the unit  held down the button for    seconds or something like that  and then plugged into it using an ethernet cable and set it up manually  this was also very easy  with a simple interface that worked without any issue  it automatically recommends the custom name of  your network  ext which i decided to use when i m most places downstairs  the main router seems to have the best signal  though occasionally it s the extender  when i m upstairs  i get full signal at all corners of the house just a note  this does not require any powerline hardware  i originally bought this along with the tp link powerline adaptors  thinking it was going to broadcast the powerline signal wirelessly  instead this is a simple repeater amp that doesn t require any other hardware  aside from having a functioning wireless router  of course      
411,1.0 ,                       update          changed to   star  this product has been randomly disconnecting from my wireless connection for the past few months  considering i bought this to use for wireless surveillance cameras  this means that routinely i have an error from my app stating that the base station is offline because the extender needs to be unplugged and plugged back in  while i m at home  this proves to be an annoyance  when i m out of town  this is unacceptable and makes an expensive security system useless  will have to move base station next to modem  which negates the whole reason i bought this item  return window closed  frustrating original  purchased this product because my router is in a room far away from some wireless cameras i have  and this allowed me to run a cat  from the camera router to this extender in a room closer to the cameras and increased their ready times in my viewing app this product also had the added bonus of increasing my overall internet speeds on all devices  one of the pictures i uploaded is of my home network and the faster speed one is when i connected to the  g extender and ran the same speed test on the same site  i would recommend grabbing this if you re trying to extend your range but also if you want to see a small increase in your speeds      
412,1.0 ,                       this product does not work  it actually interfered with our wifi and took it offline  don t waste your money  i didn t bother to return it  i threw it out      
413,4.0 ,                       i ve had odd problems with wifi signal in my bedroom  it s about    feet away from the router however i get intermittent wifi and needed a solution for this  this extender seemed cheap and would resolve my issue  install is really simple and got it hooked up in a couple minutes  as far as speed  i have fios gigabit internet so i m accustomed to    mbps  speeds  while this one is rated for up to    mbps speed  i get no where near that speed with this extender  after a couple speedtest connection tests  the best i got was   mbps  in most cases this wouldn t be acceptable  speeds are dismally slow compared to what i should be getting  however  i have stable wifi connection in my bedroom now so i guess that s the biggest benefit here  rather than having the internet cut out every minute or so  this extender gives me a stable connection throughout the day  while the speeds are abysmal  i at least have connection now      
414,5.0 ,                       i installed this today  took about    minutes to install  i bought this so we could use our amazon fire stick down in our basement  before the extender  the wifi just barely reached down there  whatever we would stream would pause or take awhile to load  once i set it up  i placed the wifi extender down in the basement  a solid blue light  connected it to my fire stick and my daughter is currently watching cartoons down there while she plays  very happy with this product  only paid     for it too      
415,5.0 ,                       set up was easy and range is great  now no dead zone in my basement with router on second floor      
416,5.0 ,                       it works really well     
417,3.0 ,                       i live in the county   it helped a little but not as much as i thought   good enough though      
418,1.0 ,                       firstly the model i received is not the same as the one pictured in this listing   mine doesn t even have a led in the front to gauge signal strength like the one in the picture and installation video this is awful to install  in the end after wasting    hours i gave up and it s going back   first tried to install over an iphone browser  but the webpage isn t formatted correctly for safari  really in        next i connected my windows tablet and set it up through the website  of course no windows app    when i got to the last page there was no next button because the webpage wouldn t format to my having my tablet on a higher scaling setting  ok not that big of a deal just sloppy web programming   so after that the tplink reboots   i can see it on my wifi list for a few seconds then it disappears   i downloaded a wifi analyzer and it seems the tplink signal goes  out of range  for several minutes  then it might go into range for a few seconds  and so on   so i can t connect to it at all   i m assuming it s a hardware issue  but it only does it after it s setup  before it s setup it seems to have a good signal      
419,5.0 ,                       i bought this to give a stronger wifi signal for my sens  upstairs  back of the house from the router   before installing the wifi extender upstairs  my sens  would constantly drop the wifi signal and not work to monitor the side gate and back door of my house  after installing this wifi extender upstairs  my sens  has a solid connection all the time now an added bonus of having the wifi extender upstairs is now my netflix doesn t drop when i try to watch tv in bed there are   ways to hook up the extender to the wifi the first and easiest way didn t work for me  so i had to use the website way  neither of them were complicated  and i appreciated the fact that they include instructions for   ways  once connected  it was easy to relocate to a place in my house to extend the signal i ve seen a lot of reviews of people complaining the signal is not boosting the wifi it doesn t do that  it s best use is for technology that is far from the router  that occasionally loses signal due to its distance from the router  think of it this way  the extender just allows for the signal to reach technology farther from the router than normally possible without it      
420,1.0 ,                       i was unable to connect by the wpa settings as i have a older wifi box that doesn t have a wap button   i then tried the app and it didn t work either  last choice was to go to the website and that did work and it was great for   days then i had to change my router password and when i tried to put the new password in and it would not take it  just says wrong password  so i called tech they told me to reset the box and it would clear the old password so i could put in new one i have tried this several times and it didn t work  called tech again and all i was told was that my product is defective then and there was nothing more they could help me with and that i should request a refund for the product being defective      
421,5.0 ,                       easy fix to a poor wifi connection to my ring camera  the extender was installed in the basement and  the signal was strong enough to reach the back porch i was able to set it up in extender mode without physical access to the router  easy set up  but unfortunately this unit isn t supported by the tether app  so the setup had to be completed on the webpage  the entire setup took about    minutes      
422,4.0 ,                       well it does give out excellent signal when it s working   a few times now i have had to unplug and plug back in due to signal loss were it disconnects from the internet but still giving out its own signal with no connection  it s not that big of a issue but i wish i can find a product that does exactly what it says with very low maintenance   i have had it for a little over a month now and had to unplug it   times now      
423,2.0 ,                       this seems to be ok for my tv and mobile phones  but i ve been working from home      for   months  thanks covid     and when i switched to connect my laptop to this unit  about    feet away  same floor  barely any obstructions  my webex meeting quality while working really suffered no one else on the webex reported audio problems  but i would repeatedly experience lag where users would pause  then move very quickly after      seconds or more  sound quality also could be bad at times i switched my wifi back to my router  downstairs  farther away  passing through more walls  and my webex call quality is perfect once again not recommended for a work computer if you have video conference meetings      
424,4.0 ,                       i bought this tl wa   re to use as a wireless bridge only for one of my wired devices   in other words  i use this as a wireless bridge   client for my ethernet device i found the only way to make this work is do as the following these instructions are only for wired client    connect your ethernet device to tl wa   re with the included network cable    setup tl wa   re to use default  range extender  mode    disable dhcp on tl wa   re  so ip can be assigned directly from parent router   and disable wireless signal    reboot only by doing the above steps  i get internet connection on my wired device      
425,5.0 ,                       works awesome  super easy to set up  worth the money fo sho     
426,1.0 ,                       wi fi signal is poor     
427,3.0 ,                       my internet provider says that it s not secure      
428,1.0 ,                       did not help extend wifi internet connection upstairs  i moved extender to   different outlets as i do my best to make things  work out  but this just wasn t helpful at all  just to isolate the issue and ensure it s not other variables like walls blocking signal i logged into extender network sitting right next to it and a speed test was so poor along with general internet browsing  i have decent internet connection upstairs and use the  g network but was just hoping to get the great  g signal i get downstairs or as close to it but no dice  i really  really tried to make it work and hate leaving bad reviews as i always assume user error may be a variable but this was a fail due to the product  sorry but i leave reviews as a great company mitigates risk by identifying issues and addressing them to eliminate deficiencies in a product or process  i m rooting for y all      
429,3.0 ,                       i have a smallish apartment       sq  ft  but it is long with one bend in the hallway  i called the manufacturer to see if this extender would serve my purpose  the rep said it would  unfortunately it has not  it works intermittently and but mostly not at all  there is no obstacles between my router and the extender but there is a sharp bend into the furthest room where i need the extender to reach  my walls are made of regular drywall  there are some large appliances in there that may be a problem  i m not sure  regardless  i do not seem to be able to return the extender  i don t know if the return widow has closed or what      
430,1.0 ,                       i actually ended up returning this item  i purchased it to remedy dead spots in my wifi reception throughout my small   bedroom apartment  not only did it not resolve that issue  but it created a whole new problem  first of all  let me be clear  i do fully understand that this item is not intended to increase internet speeds  i did not expect  nor did i need it to do that  however  it is not supposed to cause my existing ultra high speed internet to slow to a snails pace  however  that is exactly what it did  and i confirmed this multiple times  using three different independent speed test applications   the one positive that i can say is that amazon has absolutely amazing customer service and return refund process  i was able to take the item  in its original box  no other packaging required  to my local ups store  where they packaged it up for me  at no cost to me  and they took it from there  i live approximately    minutes from this ups store and before i even got back home  my full refund had been issued and had already been credited to my my bank account  wow  amazon  just wow  i was not expecting that  i expected it to take several days to a week  so  the product   sucksamazon customer service   rocks        
431,4.0 ,                       seems to help my wifi     
432,4.0 ,                       one side of our house had a pretty weak wifi signal  earlier i had installed another brand of wifi signal extender that gave us a signal  but a dodgy signal  in that part of the house  my spouse had an apple ipad that was really difficult to use in that part of the house  so i saw the tp link     wifi extender   i am pretty sure it was on sale  so i ordered one i unplugged the other extender and plugged in the tp link  it works so much better than the one it replaced  every once in a while it gets a  hick up  and needs to be reset  but it has pretty much resolved the weak signal issues  easy to install and easy to set up      
433,5.0 ,                       this is the first time i have used a wifi extender   all i had to do is plug it in click button  i forgot the name  that the instructions told me to press on my router and wait   minutes and hold down the button for one second on the extender   the blue light went from blinking to steady and the instructions said if that happens it worked   i found the name on my pc settings  i didn t change the name from my original wifi and the signal strength was great    i am typing this review from a part of my house that i normally would never get a signal from   very happy with the results      
434,5.0 ,                       after doing some internet research  and watching a couple of youtube videos  i figured out how to set up the tp link  and i m glad i did   i live in a  k square feet house and the last  k feet  located in the back where the master bedroom lives  along with a roku and a sony tv  showed a download speed of between     mbps depending on the time of day   after installing the tp link  and setting up the equipment to connect at  ghz   i was getting a download speed of       mbps   the improvement in streaming services was immediately noticeable  as was my iphone wireless connection while sitting on my back deck drinking my morning coffee   i ve had this product now for months  and there hasn t been one occasion where the wireless dropped off or the speed dropped below    mbps   the bottom line  highly recommended  with the caveat of doing your research before attempting setup   it will save you a lot of heartaches      
435,5.0 ,                       in my situation  wifi signal before was too weak  like less than one bar   min youtube video      min waiting with this  no worries about signal anymore pro   it is not extending same wifi signal range  it catches the current wifi signal  amplify and making a  new  wifi    which is great for me   i shared main wifi router with other roommates  i don t want to share my weak one little amplified signal to another    i cannot access the wifi router so i m not available to check my router has a wps button or not  but this machine doesn t require any physical interaction with the main router  you can setup thru internet browser      
436,2.0 ,                       update  after   days using the tp link n    wifi extender  i have to reduce my rating from   to   stars i have tested the unit intensively  in different time windows and different days  i measured the download speed frequently and switched between different routers the unit has a big flaw  although the wifi download speed is increased about     but it behaves very strange after every click on a new website link  it has a delay of     seconds before the first elements of the website is displayed  it even causes the same delay on the wifi of connected router i am going to return the tp link n    wifi extender today i received the tp link n    wifi extender  i used the installation via web browser  it was very easy so far it works well  compering to the direct wifi connection of the router  the speed through the extender is increased about          
437,3.0 ,                       had to hard reset the device and plug my laptop into the rj   port to complete setup  since the mobile app kept finding the device but repeatedly failed to complete setup  i tried the app setup via   phones and   tablet before going to the laptop  considering i have several tp link smart outlets  i expected the repeater to work w out issue signal strength received from my router to the repeater is strong  and only about       ft apart  i got it because the walls can sometimes cause issues even though this says it supports    mbps  something as simple as casting to a roku only  ft from the repeater via youtube tv results in video degradation to the point you can t read simple scores from a football game displayed on the screen switching the roku connection back to the primary router immediately fixes the issue even though it had weaker signal when i connect my phone to the repeater  it often will not get web connectivity even though the reception level is      no  i haven t done any speed testing  it s a     device that kinda works for basics like web surfing on my phone  when it decides to show connectivity      
438,4.0 ,                       i have changed my rating from one star to   stars   i bought the ac    and it works with both    g and  g   i would give this   stars except that although the n    does not advertise that it works with  g it also does not clearly say it is for    g only   in the q a section many say that it will work on  g    after reading a couple of these i assumed that it would   your rep s might think about answering these questions and correcting the posters that reply that it will work on  g    i bought this to extend my  g network   it won t find my  g nor extend it   it is possible that i am not geek enough to set it up   if it is capable of extending  g it should come with a warning stating that you must be a geek to set it up          
439,4.0 ,                       works great   i live in an rv park and it works awesome      
440,4.0 ,                       once you get it installed  it works  that s all i can reasonably say given the second rate nature of their  tether  app we have two tp link products and getting them both to work was irritating and unnecessarily time consuming since there was no easy way to distinguish the old unit from the new unit  or even whether we were connection    g or  g without laboriously setting  testing phone connections  turning it off  look to see what disappeared from the available wifi connections  then rinse and repeat i have yet to delve into the confusion of individual  client  settings for each of our   tp link extenders     smh      
441,5.0 ,                       so i have never had any experience with any type of wifi extender  i read the reviews and was looking for something other than contacting my internet provider for the installation of a second device  i decided to try this  because why not    holy signal strength     i am amazed   my router  is located in my living room      the bedrooms at the back of the house received little signal strength  i plugged this baby in  set it up via the app  and boom instant results     i can finally watch netflix from my bedroom without it buffering every   seconds and seeing a grainy image  i cannot day enough feeeeeeeel goods about this item         
442,3.0 ,                       this is an update of the review below   i had success with method    in the instructions using the tether app and my android phone after trying          a month or so ago and giving up   by following the on screen instructions i was finally able to sinc the range extender with my phone and from there it was pretty easy to hook up my computer and roku tv s   actually the signal is very good once i figured the whole thing out   the   stars is up from    as it still took me several hours of trial and error for me to figure out i was unable to sign on using the extender address ext   it sinced up with my router just fine   when talking to tech support they identified the problem but it was going to cost  x the cost of the equipment for them to get into my computer to clear out the problem items in my system  rated a    at this point      
443,5.0 ,                       with all the technology and routers and modems and updates and bugs that i don t even try to keep up with any more  buying this wifi extender proved that it doesn t have to be complicated   i live in a small house  but my existing router signal has to go thru walls  thus reducing the signal strength to only     bars when i m in the livingroom   hard to use my tablet and phone sometimes   took a chance  and am so happy with this product   i plugged it in to the wall in the livingroom  hit the button  then went to the router   rooms away and hit the button   voila   all i had to know was my router passphrase word in order to link the tv  tablet and phone to the extender   that s it   now i have all bars and no delays at all in the livingroom           
444,1.0 ,                       im disappointed i was looking for a booster for my internet  however it s not clear that this one will not connect to the  g in my wifi and that is what i needed i hope this save ppl time there are two wifi connections you can connect to using spectrum wifi  what i have  one is  g and the other is  g  they dont let you know in general not just with this booster how to know what one to use  the  g is going to be faster so good for streaming netflix ex    the  g works ok but it s not as fast   unfortunately this booster only connects to the  g and i need the  g for what i m looking for      
445,5.0 ,                       i saw all the good reviews about this and decided to give it a try and now my signal stays at full bar  though i did have a bit of difficult time getting it setup  but eventually got it setup in     mins      
446,5.0 ,                       i was very skeptical about these things but this one works really well  make sure to place it half way between your router and dead area  once you set it up you just switch wifi channels when you are in the dead zone  no need to reinput passwords like some reviews state  buy with confidence       
447,5.0 ,                       excelente     
448,2.0 ,                       i tried using this to boost  g signal in back of house  but all it did was wreak havoc on my iphone    and caused it to keep forgetting my hidden real  g and  g networks   since this device would not let me hid the ssid  i am guessing my phone kept trying to connect to it instead of the real networks had programmed into it   so even when not in back of house  my phone would forget it could connect to the real network   also my smart devices in my house started going bonkers too  and disconnecting from real network requiring me to re program them the proper network  like my thermostat overall i was pretty dis satisfied with this    and omg  it is slower than a snail   i could occasionally get   mbps  but no where near the    mbps that is advertised   i have super high speed xfinity network  so i am used to blazing fast wi fi  but this device in my house peaked out around   mbps  not    mbps      
449,1.0 ,                       exactly what brittany said in her review  its a  nd wifi with a much slower signal  returning to amazon  gonna try another      
450,5.0 ,                       i m rating this   stars  but please note that i have only had this thing set up for an hour at this point  i ll come back and adjust my review if my opinion changes first  the initial impressions    the box is small  it s a little larger than a light bulb box that would hold a single light bulb    the box is shrink wrapped  ugh  minor inconvenience  and minor amount of non recyclable material   suggestion to tp link  don t shrink wrap it     the device is tiny  it s the size of a stinking night light   i ll include a picture of it plugged in     you take it out of the box  and plug it in    you turn on your computer  select the temporary wifi network  tp link something or other   open a browser  type in an address  and   minutes later you re all set up i purchased this to add wifi to an outdoor area that wasn t getting any signal from inside the house  now  i have  all the bars  sitting outside  exactly what i wanted as a result  and surprisingly painless to get set up and working pros    small   easy to set up   seems fast   all packaging is easily recyclable  except for the stupid shrink wrap    the box design is honestly and obviously brilliant   not that you care  because you just take it apart and recycle it    i checked signal strength using the wifi scanner program  everything looked great cons    the setup process could have been slightly more automated using the automated wifi login feature  like the first time you go to starbucks   so you didn t have to type in a url  very minor    shrink wrap  very minor so at this point  i m very happy      
451,5.0 ,                       no more buffering in my house anymore         
452,1.0 ,                       bad quality     
453,1.0 ,                       i bought this from amazon on feb        it was working good  two weeks ago i bought peephole ring camera i re installed this tp link  feet downstairs far from the rings  camera to get better wifi connection  the camera was so slow  i like to have camera on my front door for some delivery that needs signature so i didn t know that this tp link is defected i opened its app it it wasn t on my network   i contact tp link and i found that they have and they think their product are phenomenal they ask me first to ship the defected item to them then they will send the replacement     on its box says two years warranty lies     i did delete all their emails and i boxed the item  who want it welcome tp link company to have their thing  amen      
454,3.0 ,                         update  the tether does seem to be picking up any devices that are on our wi fi now  if you stay on the  client  screen for too long it says  session timed out  original review my husband reported that the set up was not very intuitive  it was a pain and the directions were not clear after my husband installed this  we were both very excited to get it going  he was able to get it going on his phone  however  when i also tried to get on  we both started having issues i had to make a separate account for my phone  ok     but then it kept kicking one of us off  then the other i tried to get my laptop on the tether and the website provided in the directions isn t working at all   this site can t be reached  now  my phone is saying  no devices found  in continuing to try to figure this out i have come across more messages like  unable to connect to the device  please check your wi fi connection   i am sitting in a space where i have always gotten a signal as i am typing this review  i keep trying to get it to work  i think it knows    because now it sees our router  it is now showing my iphone and a desktop computer under  client   i have no idea if this is my husband s computer or my laptop this was not nearly as easy or useful as i thought it would be and i have no idea if it is actually extending the signal   we got a crazy cold front in texas this weekend and i do not feel like braving the freezing weather outside to check if this thing gives my phone a signal in my driveway  which was why i bought it in the first place      
455,5.0 ,                       good got the money     
456,3.0 ,                       package arrived taped back together inside of another box so i m not sure about how much i trust this product  the extender also throttles our wifi down from    mbps to about    so i m not sure if this extender is even worth using     
457,5.0 ,                       bought this to extend the signal to an area far from the router  located it halfway and it worked great  very easy to setup  this was a inexpensive solution as opposed to the cable companies      a piece device  although the cable company techs said it wouldn t work with their equipment  that was wrong  the only negative is it s a single band     g  as opposed to having both     and  g which is only about     more  as far as i know     g has a longer range but is slower as more items in your home use that band   g is faster and even though the location i bought the extender for shows a full strength signal  the  g signal is faster showing only   bars      
458,5.0 ,                       works great for laptops   phones  gaming not so much     
459,3.0 ,                       i placed this in my bedroom to improve my wifi signal  it does not seem to boost the signal like it should      
460,5.0 ,                       our new home has a few wifi  dead zones  upstairs  as our modem and router were downstairs in the living room  this extender works very well to solve that issue  setup was super easy and took maybe    minutes total  the upstairs now has a much stronger signal and we are able to connect all our devices to stream as needed the only negative is the fact that now something additional has to be plugged into the wall  and it s not very discrete  however i am willing to sacrifice having an additional thing plugged in for the usability that this provides      
461,1.0 ,                       purchased this bc i have a tp link router that s awesome   after an hour trying to get this thing to connect i m quitting and returning it   should have listened to other reviews      
462,5.0 ,                       first of all   i m a real human being  not a bot  and not someone who received this item in exchange for a review  i purchased this because i discovered  during my work from home experience during corona  that my bedroom wifi was weak and would kick me off during zoom meetings  i looked at a lot of extenders before picking this one  i m cheap and the price was right  and the reviews seemed okay  it was a breeze to set up  instructions are clearly written and within    minutes i had a strong signal in my room and got back to zooming with no problems  my house is      sq  ft  the router is on one end and my bedroom is on the opposite end  i placed the extender in the kitchen  the middle of the house  and it seems to be great so far      
463,5.0 ,                       great quality     
464,1.0 ,                       i first attempted to set up the extender with the first option of using the wps button and had no luck  the device would not connect i then went to option   which is done using the tether application with a mobile device  the first try it would not connect at all  on  nd attempt it connected for a short period and then stated it could not connect any more  on my  rd attempt it connected and seemed to be functioning   it worked for a few hours and then the one device attached to it showed poor signal strength i attempted to connect the extender a  th time following instructions for reset and it connected but lost signal after   hour at this point if i can not rely on it to maintain signal it is pointless to have the device   i will be returning it as it doesnt seem to be compatible with my router or is just flat out is faulty regardless of the reason it works for a short period and then doesnt  it isnt functioning for my needs      
465,5.0 ,                       this product was easy to install and extended my wi fi signal outside for my rain bird sprinkler system      
466,5.0 ,                       at first i didn t understand how to connect it but then i saw there s a wps button on top and also on the router there s a wps button when you press both it will have two minutes to connect then there is a tp link app that you connect your extender to the router with the wifi settings then any device that you will be connecting to the extender you change that devices wifi to the extender  it definitely works because my room is at the back of a house where there s metal in a wall my movies and everything used to disconnect and buffer since using the extender the movies play because the extender is halfway between me and the router      
467,5.0 ,                       this is a life saver  great product for large houses or multi level townhouses  this thing actually seems to have better range than my router at times  the only annoyance is that it s a separate broadcast so you have to switch between networks  it doesn t extend the current wi fi network  it creates a new one with the same credentials  so if you are in range of both and move around  you might be on a weak signal  just be mindful of this  it s not a big annoyance  and i still recommend it especially for the price point relative to others      
468,5.0 ,                       easy set up  used this to get better reception for my ring camera outside my house  the connection send to be quicker now that i ve extended the range     
469,5.0 ,                       this was really easy to set up with wps   i bought two  with the primary function as range extenders for our upstairs and out in the garage where i had noticed some slightly weaker signals  love fios but the modem leaves a bit to be desired  the main thing is to just be a bit patient during setup and let it work as intended   it does  just trust the process  i m glad to not have to download another app and just have this work seamlessly it also just looks really nice  form follows function  but nicely  with an attractive profile and compact size  almost worth buying for that alone      
470,4.0 ,                       install was not working that well  but used secondary method of going online to program and worked like a champ  give it a couple minutes to lock in just in case   fast programming  locked right in  happy with it      
471,5.0 ,                       forget about those         range extenders that won t hook up to the router this little guy out performs them all  and i ve been thru a lot of them worked for three days trying to install a         netgear brand and finally sent it back the service tech  couldn t get it to work after trying everything he knew i purchased this one and had it up and running in about ten minutes covers the entire half of the house with a powerful signal it s a clear choice for me          for a unit that won t work  or        for a unit that beats them all      
472,5.0 ,                       works well even in the basement     
473,3.0 ,                       the product is fine   the problem i  and many many many  others had was that the device was losing communication with my router   it would happen at least once per    hours  but more often a couple times per day  so any devices connected through this range extender would not be able to use the internet until this thing was powercycled   so digging on the internet for a lot of my time  i found a work around and finally what seemed like a solution   the work around  according to multiple articles  was to run a constant ping to the extender in intervals of     seconds or shorter   i didnt do that   iam on day   now of it working without interruption   i had to search their site  download the         us firmware  log into the device with a laptop that was connected to it  and manually install the firmware patch   you cannot just run a firmware update without downloading it first   pretty inconvenient now i am not all complaints   it works well when it is working  and the issue now seems resolved   i got it for around     and it came pretty fast during quarantine   i hope this helps people who have it or another of their products and are experiencing the same type of issues   i will probably research and purchase a different brand in the future if i need something like this again      
474,1.0 ,                       using the wps method product install went smoothly  however  my hsi service dropped by     or less when any of my devices connected to it  for example  speed tests  when connected device directly to my hsi modem   provided by the vendor  is   mps up down  when i connect to the extender it drops to   mps  or less  up down  i spent a couple of hours researching the issue  trying to determine if it was an extender configuration issue  results  negative  reached out to their support  person was not helpful  extent of help was  reboot you modem   which i had done before reaching out to their support   bottom line  returning product  thank you amazon for making product returns so seamless      
475,4.0 ,                       update  dropping to   stars  because it tends to need to be restarted at least weekly or it stops working  definitely still better than other options i ve tried though my house is brick  which has given me a lot of issues in getting wifi from one side of the house  where the router is  to the other side  i tried other wifi extenders in the past and had a lot of issues setting them up  and had given up on getting one to work  however  adding outdoor security cameras meant really needing to have wifi on the far side of the house  so i read some reviews and wound up here setup is a breeze  seriously  this thing was ready to go in    minutes  after that  i plugged it in on an outlet i thought would work and set things up now my wifi easily blankets the house  it even works when i m out at the grill  what a great purchase  effortlessly extended my wifi for a really reasonable price  wish i did this a long time ago      
476,3.0 ,                       the price is good but the product it s just ok   the old saying you get what you pay for definitely holds true i have this extender in my kitchen window  i had to use an extension cord otherwise i would not have a strong enough signal  my router is in my living room  the wifi extender is approximately    ft from my router and still has trouble working  when i open my shades in the morning the wifi extender will occasionally fall down from the top of the window  i had to position it here because it s the only place in my house       sqft  that is the closest to my garage  where i have wifi cameras  my garage cameras often fail to work because the wifi signal is too weak save your money and buy something else more powerful  i sure wish i did      
477,5.0 ,                       i got this booster so i had better wi fi signal in my detached garage  it worked perfectly  set up is as simple as plug in and download an app      
478,5.0 ,                       internet kept dropping   or   times a day hopefully this resolves problem     
479,5.0 ,                       so far it s been serving me good  a strong connection all the time  especially with multiple people in my house hold  it truly helps make a stronger connection      
480,1.0 ,                       i say that because of tp link support    the unit worked great for   day and then went out  this is connected to a tv in the sunroom and i don t feel like running ethernet to it  i contacted support a few days later because it is not a tv that is used a lot during the day time  i got the run around of you to need to unplug it and plug it back in again  i told them it is not serving out the dhcp address to the unit anymore  well  we need to get to the gui  i can t log in on my phone  laptop  wired or wireless   tablet  then back to resetting the unit    waste of   hours    i may change my review if i get another one  or i just may hack an old router to do the same and get more ports out of it rather than    if you get one make sure its not ver      that is what i had and it is junk      
481,1.0 ,                       no good for me      
482,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          thanks tp link now i can get a very good signal around the house      
483,5.0 ,                       very good signal   i can watch   window youtube at one time          
484,2.0 ,                       from the beginning of use  this extended the wifi but was always very spotty  unfortunately the extender stopped working all together after just two months  i would not recommend      
485,5.0 ,                       it works wonderfully  i ve try different ones before  and this one is the one for me  i have my router in the master bedroom and the dead zone in the house was in the living room     feet away from router  don t waste your time doing the other connections on the instructions besides the pc one  plug it in close to the router first then follow the pc option to connect on laptop or desktop cause cell might not be good enough after connection is successful  take it to desired dead zone and it will coonect automatically  i got spectrum internet  with    mbps speed  and that s what i get on my living room now  real happy with it  every house is different and have more or less obstacles to get the signal to the wifi extender but this one is worth the try  do not get the  renewed  ones  more likely won t work according to reviews      
486,5.0 ,                       we live in a log cabin and we were having issues with wifi in certain areas of our home  our tech guy recommended this brand of wifi extenders  i won t lie  was extremely apprehensive about this working initially ordered   extenders  one for floor    and floor     the tech guy figured out the weak area and the best place for placement of each upon his visit when they arrived we followed directions and plugged in  expecting mediocre at best    wrong  it was an instant change and as long as our internet is working these guys do their job  perfectly since first purchase i ve ordered   more  one for floor    on the other end of house from where internet box is  garage and shop  the shop is approximately     feet from our residence and it works perfectly  my husband is able to accept payments without coming to the house to process payment you can t go wrong with investing in these wifi extenders  they most certainly do their job at an affordable price  super simple to install  customer service is the very good  as per tech guy  we ve been using them nearly   year now and absolutely no issues      
487,2.0 ,                       this seemed like a good idea at first and for the price  do your homework and pay more for something better that puts out more power i have tested this unit   days in a row  each time i get the same results that end in everything being a ton more slow i will be ordering a more expensive one to test out the only way i was able to link it was through the tp app  i will be getting more cat  hardware so i can hard line it in i will be adding an update in a week or so      
488,1.0 ,                       they don t work most of the time      
489,1.0 ,                       completely useless     
490,4.0 ,                       great product     
491,5.0 ,                       i purchased this after my wifi provider basically admitted that their modems are terrible and that they couldn t do anything to improve my signal  i use it in my bedroom  i live in a   bedroom apartment and the modem is in the middle of the apartment  and it helps a lot with the signal  i tested the wifi before plugging it in and i couldn t even open google  but now i m able to watch movies and yt videos without issues  great product and super easy to install  the instructions in the package are very clear      
492,5.0 ,                       there s a bit of important information that nobody really wants you to know  and that is that wireless range extenders cut the speed of your internet in half or even worse  this is inherent in the deal since the extender has to use at least half the bandwidth to communicate with the base that it s receiving from  i wanted to set this up as a wired  access point  so that the speed would not be cut  after a couple of hours of frustration i finally figured out how to do this  the instructions  of course  are quite vague   you must log in to the extender with your computer s browser  you may have to tune in to the extender s wireless network instead of your own wireless network  then  after setting up a new password you just change the  mode  to  access point   then the extender will reboot  but here s the confusing part   you re done  now just place the thing where it s going to sit and connect it via ethernet to your router  you will now have a new wireless network called tp link wa   re  i guess you can change this to some other name  i m not sure if it can have the same name as your base wireless network  at this point i m reluctant to mess with it i assume that setting the thing up as a wireless extender is very easy as well  but as i said  you will lose a lot of speed  i would not recommend this option if you re trying to stream video  etc      
493,4.0 ,                       i spent endless hours with the amazon engineers trying to figure out why my kindle kept losing connection every few minutes   it turns out that i could not get a signal from my tp link      from he next room on the same floor  maybe    feet away  then i remembered hearing about wi fi extenders  setup took a minute  the instructions are on the outside of the box  the only flaw with the device is it falls out of the plug unless you plug in upright   now my kindle works without disconnection  our cell phones stream without hesitation  best     i ever spent   too bad the amazon geniuses couldn t suggest it   months earlier  if you need the newest technology this isn t the device for you  but it is good enough for most people      
494,2.0 ,                       if you have a high mbps dont invest in this device  overpowers its and doesn t send a strong signal out      
495,5.0 ,                       several months ago we purchased a new dell inspiron      desk top to replace our   year old model that was on its last legs   so far the new dell has been fine except for one minor issue   everytime it went to sleep mode when it woke up it was not connected to the wireless wifi in our home and we repeatedly had to power the modem off and on in order to get it to work   i eventually called dell and the tech tried to correct the problem but his conclusion was my wifi signal was not strong enough   told the tech we never had this problem with our old dell desktop but he couldn t come up with any explanation except the network adapter was not as receptive to wireless signals as my old model he suggested getting a wifi range extender since i was three rooms over from the dsl modem   based on the price and recommendations i purchased the tp link range extender   in setting it up today i found the instructions easy to follow and used method three to connect via a web browser as i could not find a wps button on my existing modem   i located the extender about eight feet from my computer which now shows a much stronger wifi signal available   accessed the new extension network   ext  and so far is working great   have brought computer in and out of sleep mode several times and it hooks right up to the network   extender is small but solidly built   based on my brief usage so far i would highly recommend this if you are having weak wifi issues      
496,1.0 ,                       actually when i connected first day it worked then next day onward its not working at all      
497,4.0 ,                       slightly lower rating due to ios weak security issue to fully resolve the ios  weak security  problem with the following steps    validate that the primary router configuration is set to wpa  aes only  not auto     in ios  forget any network connections created related to the tl wa   re    upgrade the tl wa   re to the most recent firmware    full instructions are on the tp link support website    withe the tl wa   re still plugged in  use the reset button and wait for it to fully restart    download and use the tether app and connect to the default network tp link extender    follow all instructions in the tether app to complete the setup process as normal  this will establish the connection to the main router and name the extender s ssid once all above steps are complete  the ios connection to the range extender s ssid will no longer show the  weak security  warning message connections to the tl wa   re are now secure      
498,1.0 ,                       i m a software engineer  lot of background in networking  we had a weak signal in one room that had an ethernet port and power right next to each other  so i picked one of these up to use as an access point  it worked fine as an access point for about   months  took minutes to setup   then the painter unplugged our router  asus rt ac      and after bringing everything back up we get no internet connectivity and  dhcp detection failed  errors in the re    logs the asus router logs  much more verbose than this pos  shows good dhcp handshakes jul             unknown daemon info dnsmasq dhcp        dhcpoffer br                d   d          b jul             unknown daemon info dnsmasq dhcp        dhcpdiscover br   d   d          b jul             unknown daemon info dnsmasq dhcp        dhcpoffer br                d   d          b jul             unknown daemon info dnsmasq dhcp        dhcpdiscover br   d   d          b jul             unknown daemon info dnsmasq dhcp        dhcpoffer br                d   d          b jul             unknown daemon info dnsmasq dhcp        dhcpdiscover br   d   d          b i tried manual setup  carious dhcp changes to the router etc    still doesn t work  even messed around with it as a range extender jsut to try that out too  i have now wasted about   hours screwing with this thing and am very frustrated  the ui is really poor and the documentation even worse  imo it s not worth spending money on something this flakey because the chance of wasting hours of your life are not worth it      
499,2.0 ,                       does not boost signal at all     
500,5.0 ,                       great product and easy installation     
501,1.0 ,                       it made my signal so weak     
502,5.0 ,                       once you find a location that works it just does the job   easy to install      
503,5.0 ,                       wife working from home because  covid  with laptop in bedroom  i felt guilty seeing her google speed test at   mbps download speed  while i have    mbps in my upstairs office  one day delivered tp link n    wifi extender tl wa   re plugged it into my upstairs office wall outlet  blue power light goes solid went to router and pushed the wps button went back to n    extender and waited for blue blinking light to go solid  took    seconds  both blue lights solid now unplugged n    and went downstairs to bedroom and plugged it in wall outlet waited    seconds and both lights stopped blinking and were now solid blue went to laptop and left clicked on network icon on bottom right taskbar left clicked on new wifi network entry that ends in  ext  new extended wifi connected in browser search google internet speed test and click blue run speed test button   mbps now  old speed was  mbps nice      
504,5.0 ,                       due to the pandemic i am now working from home  i needed to connect my office phone to an ethernet jack but did not want to run a    ft cable from the modem in my living room across the room and into my bedroom where i have my workstation set up  i found a different version of this device on a big box electronics store website  showed it to the manager at my company  small company  who handles ordering office equipment  and he purchased one here on amazon  it took literally   minutes to set this up and get it connected to my wifi  plug in my phone s ethernet jack  and be able to get a dial tone  the signal is great   my connection is just as good  if not better  than my internet connection at my office was  was an excellent alternative to running a long cable across my apartment  i ended up buying one for my son because he was having issues with gaming on his computer and this gave him the ability to connect his computer directly to the ethernet port  no issues at all  very happy with this purchase  well worth the money spent      
505,1.0 ,                       it worked really well the first few times  i even suggested it to a friend who also bought it   about the fourth time it started going  wonky    some nights it would work and some it just wouldn t   but now it will never work   every single night for the past week or more it just says  no internet  connected    what the heck is the point of that  if i had known i was just renting the use of an extender for a week or so rather than using a semipermanent solution i wouldn t have considered it such a deal   a wi fi extender with  no internet  is useless   i m better off with the one bar i had cutting off on me all the time than nothing at all      
506,5.0 ,                       went beyond our expectations  i was sure my   yr old son was just wasting my money but this product had my son saying  i told you so   and  left me with my mouth hanging open and biting my tongue      
507,1.0 ,                       i was hoping to boost my home wifi to my garage about    feet away  it did not work      
508,4.0 ,                       for some reason  the wps button didn t work which would have been the easy way  problem with my modem  the tether app was going well until login to the extended network  the app doesn t provide an  enter  button and for some strange reason  my motorola g  smartphone keyboard doesn t either  bad design in both but i fault the tether app because in all the various things i ve done with the smartphone its lack of an enter key has never been a problem  frustrating because i ran out of time and had to try again the next day  using a web browser didn t connect at first so i connected with an ethernet cable and setup was completed quickly  not much i can do about my not so smart phone  so tp link  please fix the tether app      
509,5.0 ,                       we purchased this to get wifi in another building in the back yard   we use spectrum s wifi  outside we would get one bar from our ap but inside it would drop to nothing   after installing we get max signal and   mbps in the secondary building   now the cool part is you can shut off the leds on the device so it doesn t make an annoying glow at night   we have a long house     x       wireless ap is in the back and propane tank monitor  tank utility  is in the dome in the ground   about      away from ap   purchased another tp link and put in front bedroom   now tank monitor is working correctly for our generator lp tank   plus i get wifi in front yard for listening to music while cutting grass   bonus    this works for    ghz and  ghz wifi   i keep the ssid name the same so my devices don t have to have the new ssid added to them      
510,4.0 ,                       the unit seems to be of good quality  but i could not get it to connect to my   year old frontier router   tried the method by pushing the wsp buttons and it couldn t connect   then logged directly into the network  registered it  and added the new network   i could log in to the  ext network  but the device could not establish a connection with my router tried using the online troubleshooter and it was no help  then tried calling customer service and gave up after being on hold for    minutes not sure if my router is just too old or if the device is defective   router is a netgear adsl  d    d update   after   hours of trying to work with frontier  finally got them to update the router and  was able to get the range extender to communicate with the router   it indeed boosted my signal and worked as advertised   added a star but still not   stars due to their confusing directions and impossibility in talking with customer service      
511,5.0 ,                       i bought this because i have a lot of wifi enabled items and extremely weak wifi with low speeds  i also have a house with all plaster walls  some double thick  and those metal grates in the corners behind the plaster  my signal prior was fine  sometimes it would work  sometimes not  it seemed to depend on the way the wind was blowing outside  haha  i added this in one area of my house and it boosted the wifi way out to my garage and down the street which was cool  however  my devices that were split right between both router and booster  were having connectivity issues and i could tell they were jumping  so i moved my booster to be in between device and router  and my signals are great  no connection issues  everything works all the time now  wife is happier as well installation is as easy as plugging it into the wall and pushing a couple buttons  now i can unplug and replug anywhere in my house for better internet  it s great      
512,5.0 ,                       does the job and well priced     
513,1.0 ,                       there are   huge problems with this    it does not extend your wifi  it creates a second wifi with a different name and password  you have to change back and forth    it is significantly slower than stated  i have     mbps in my house  and this gets   at best  i have tested this at a distance of about    feet from my router  and still have the same results i had to get all my devices to  forget  this network because they would automatically switch to this network and slow to a crawl  so this is not being used at all in my house now      
514,1.0 ,                       didn t work  would not connect   threw it in the garbage     
515,5.0 ,                       this is such a great little gadget  we have a two car detached garage and i could only get one bar on my wifi signal if i stood in just the right spot and held my tablet just the right way when i was out there in my shop and needed to look something up or wanted to stream some music  needless to say that was annoying  i set this wifi extender up and plugged it into an outlet that was close to the garage and facing towards a window and now i can easily get   or   bars consistently  if you re not getting good results try a few different outlets  i originally had mine plugged into what i thought would be the best outlet  because it was the closest outlet in the whole house to the garage but that wall was a cinderblock wall and the signal had trouble getting through even though it was only about    feet from the garage      
516,5.0 ,                       cut the cord about   months ago and since then streaming and signal has been atrocious   spoke to cable rep inferring the signal sent out has been weakened since my cutting   he assured me not and began to run some diagnostic checks on my equipment   hooked my laptop to and ethernet connection  switched devices to  g network where possible  and lastly on his recommendation picked up an extender  signal booster  amplifier   hence this review   went inexpensive not knowing if an extender would work so i selected tp link n    solely on the reviews both quantity and ratings    it took all of   minutes to sync and set up   very simple instructions   originally saw no difference until i realized the extender sets up a new network  yours plus the ext suffix  and you have to switch your device to that new network   voile  signal went from fair to excellent and it was that simple   easy streaming  no buffering and didn t have to spend anymore than       give it a shot there is a very good chance this will help if you are experiencing the same problems as i was      
517,5.0 ,                       i was getting a ton of  buffering  on my roku in my upstairs bedroom   i was only getting a  fair  signal strength but with the extender it was much better and no buffering   it s early yet but i ve got my fingers crossed      
518,1.0 ,                       got this because my room is far from the modern and i needed a stable internet connection for my zoom classes  it worked the first month but after that it stopped working  even though it was connected i didn t have any wifi connection every time i went to the tether app it would disconnect me and even after connecting again i still wouldn t have any connection even though i am connected  i restarted it multiple times  uninstalled and reinstalled  changed the extenders position as well and nothing  doesn t work anymore really disappointed because it was working perfectly the first month and now doesn t work anymore      
519,1.0 ,                       i bought this hoping to provide a stronger network for my ring camera   camera is only    feet from the router but is outside so has poor signal   the extender is about   feet from the ring camera but provided no improvement in signal strength over the original network  sometimes i can see the live ring camera feed  sometimes i can t instructions with the extender didn t match my router  wps button  so the quick setup didn t work for me  i had to download the tether app and create an account which i didn t like  the app worked ok  though it still took many many tries for it to find  see  the extender      
520,2.0 ,                       this does increase the strength of the wifi signal but the speeds are terrible   i wanted to add a little more oomph to the wifi in a basement room   my laptop got around      mbps connected to the network as is  where my phone got about   mbps i put this extender in and the wifi signal is   to   bars higher however the speeds are atrocious   i m lucky if i get above   mbps down   see attached photos    mbps down when connected to original router      mbps when connected to the tplink extender   unacceptable the only use i could see having for this is when i need a wired connection for an older device  like when setting up a linux install before wifi drivers  i am going to look at another model and see if i get the same performance  i plan on returning this      
521,5.0 ,                       my centurylink modem router was not connecting to my printer in another room   this printer had always connected okay before neighbors moving in next door started broadcasting their wifi  i decided to try this little extender  it connected as noted in the setup   but   my printer would not connect   i downloaded the  tether  application and was able to program the pin from my router  into the link hardware to get my printer to connect i am beginning to think my modem router was not working correctly using the wps push button setup   it took awhile messing around with the tether software to get it to work  and i m a retired software engineer   this could be a problem for buyers not knowledgeable with networking      
522,3.0 ,                       i don t know what it is  this is the second extender i ve bought and still horrible results  the first one was a net gear  for some reason i am only getting    mb s    megabytes per second   i thought i could get at least      maybe the settings are off  i don t know what to do edit  from my netgear main router access point i set the channel to    and turned off      mhz coexistence  this improved the speedtest net speed to    mb s which is much better  almost twice the speed as before   however my isp delivers     mb s and i get     on my desktop connected via ethernet  i also get     on  ghz connection  better rating now  but still low shouldn t i be getting the     mb s since the extender can support up to     mb s       
523,2.0 ,                       i received the model with the latest firmware and version number setup was a breeze  followed the instructions and it connected to my network just fine unfortunately  as far as doing what it s supposed to do  it works like crap  constantly drops the connection  has to be rest constantly  one of our laptops  for instance  every day at some point it just loses connection and you have to go unplug this thing  plug it back in  wait for it to recycle  then reconnect the wireless  and     of the time i have to do this more than once in order to get internet connectivity back signal is strong  i can connect to this unit great from multiple devices  it just doesn t  do  anything  i have no internet connectivity  i d like to be able to check the status with the app or through the support website  but seeing as i can t keep it connected long enough to actually read a webpage without having to go do the whole plug thing      i can t figure out what the problem is the xbox  we use it for streaming    once connected  i can stay connected  but if i turn off the xbox  and then go back later to turn it on and watch something  there s a     chance i have to go unplug this and the router and then reconnect and all that the laptop   drops the connection every    minutes it seems  dozens of times  and i m sitting right next to the repeater    sometimes i can just disconnect and reconnect my wireless  but most of the time i have to go unplug reset the repeater the phone   the phone seems to be the only thing that doesn t seem to have an issue with this  but i m not really on the phone that much so i might just be not using it enough to notice any shortcomings yeah  i know it s not the biggest hassle in the world  but the whole point of getting this was to extend my range so i could use things  if i spend all my time resetting the darn thing  and running up and down the stairs to keep resetting my router  what s the point  i ll just go sit closer to the router and not bother using this super disappointed  the tech support looks nice but if i can t stay connected i can t use the tech support      
524,5.0 ,                       it was easy to install and gives me a better wifi signal in my bedrooms in the back of the house      
525,1.0 ,                       got this to connect two laptops via a not so strong wifi connection  constant problems getting both to connect and have internet  one connects to network and internet  the other connects to network  but no internet  sometimes the one not connecting to the internet does and the other laptop doesn t  tried dozens of different configurations and still won t work as it should  which ever laptop does fully connect does get a good wifi signal until it disconnects from the internet  i have used other  more expensive name brand wifi extenders with zero issues  thought i d save a few bucks with this one  but should ve stuck to the better  more reliable ones      
526,5.0 ,                          appearance  it is white and matches our wall outlet it is plugged into  which does not make it an eyesore to look at  and is hardly noticeable  it looks good    installation  easy installation with the walk thru provided instructions  did not have to be super technical in order to setup  complete setup took me   minutes  there are multiple ways to set it up  thru a website or app   all are easy to do with a few steps    functions  yes it works  it covers the area of my home that was lacking wifi connection  devices can connect to wifi now without any issues    worth the purchase  super budget friendly  compared to other brands  this one was on the lower price scale  definitely worth the money for a wifi range extender overall  great buy  doesn t hurt the bank on this tech gadget  works out of the box   didn t run into issues setup  fixed our lacking wifi coverage area  had this product for   weeks now and still works      
527,1.0 ,                       i bought this wifi extender based on wirecutter reviews which praised it for its signal strength and ease to install  i never found out about the strength because i could never get the extender installed properly or at least securely even after a    minute call with tech support  first  extender was difficult to set up since there was no wpa button on our router  which is a new current one   when i finally got it working via my computer  i then moved it from the second floor router to the appropriate spot to replace an older and now broken extender that brought wifi to the first floor of our house  but no matter what i did even talking to tech support the extender did not offer a secure wifi network  to the point that my iphone even refused to recognize it  i tried several things  talked more than    minutes with tech support before i just gave up and returned it to amazon  returned to my   year old extender which continued to work ok until a thunder storm when it then died  so finally replaced with a more updated version of old extender  securifi s almond  and was the simplest thing to set up ever   and works better than ever      
528,1.0 ,                       this device works good but i can t put it a password  so it s visible to everyone      
529,5.0 ,                       this product is awesome  if you have some dead spots in the house  then i d highly recommend that you look into this  its very easy to use and works great how it works connect this close to your router and sync it and then plug it in the middle of your house and you  should  have coverage in your whole house  it creates another discoverable signal for your house with the same password as your own regular wifi      
530,1.0 ,                       terrible product don t even bother  would not work with my wifi said it was not secure even tried customer support they were friendly and tried but never got it working     
531,5.0 ,                       great     
532,5.0 ,                       i was not sure if this was going to even work but to my amazement it works great                
533,3.0 ,                       not what i expect it  i bought this product because my wireless wifi signal was not strong enough for a two story house  the internet shows i was watchin using tv cast were freezing while buffering  as soon as i received it and  follow the instructions and placed it half way between the wireless router in the middle of the downstairs  i tested it and seems to help where i was not getting as much buffering  the signals to my computers and bluetooth upstairs and smart tv seems to increase a little  however  a few days later in watching an internet tv show the same thing happened  freeze of the video and buffering for a long time  that s when i realize that the range of this repeater is not strong enough and i should have bought a more expensive product  maybe their business is for you to buy more than one and spread them all over the house tp link dual band wi fi range extender a big disappointment      
534,5.0 ,                       setting this wifi range extender was easier than i thought  i set up my online account and then followed the instruction and bam it kicked in   it s so easy to set up a  th or  th grader can do this         if you can comprehend adult stuff then you comprehend this  it s very easy an i m a    year old woman      
535,4.0 ,                       bought this for out in my garage to extend the wifi and worked good out there  i had to bring it into the house to use in one of the rooms and boosted the room a lot better  works as expected      
536,5.0 ,                       this wi fi extender is fantastic  i live in a two story house where the main router is located on the first floor in the back part of the house and  my office is located on the top floor in front part house  i followed the instructions to sync it with the main router and then plugged it into the electrical outlet in my office and boom my office computer works fantastic  which is really good for it because i was about ready to throw it in the garbage  i went to xfinity to see about getting a wi fi extender and they told me they had one for       do not waste your money on that one  the tpm link n     i got to say it again  works fantastic  i use zoom and microsoft team to do individual and group meetings all day and the video and sound is consistently great  glad to give a recommendation for a tool that works great      
537,5.0 ,                       a great product   beautifully packaged  easy to set and works so well to extend my wi fi to other rooms of the house   thanks for making such a good product      
538,1.0 ,                       wifi signal strength is terrible  nothing loads on phone  computer  or fire stick     
539,3.0 ,                       compr    de este producto  uno funciona a la perfecci n y el otro a veces dificulta su conexi n  pierde internet  tengo que desconectarlo de la red para que vuelva a funcionar  algunos dispositivos se desconectan de  l  no ped  un cambio o garant a xq soy de costa rica y el devolverlo me resulta m s caro y claramente no me van a dar soporte de esta forma pero el que funciona a la perfecci n no ha dado ni   solo problema  y la red se distribuye supeer bien a lo largo de toda la casa      
540,1.0 ,                           update    i got a higher priced wifi extender that did the same thing as this one  i got more bandwidth simply connecting straight to my router  i now suspect the problem was periods of low bandwidth from my cable provider that led to our smart tvs sometimes not getting enough data to support an enjoyable watching show  fair enough  now i ll have to get on the cable provider if when that happens again    original posting    it was straight forward enough to get the ranger extender connected to my router  move to a location half way in between my router and the target devices  and then connect my devices to the ranger extender  however  the bandwidth available from the range extender is consistently less  sometimes     less  of the bandwidth available from simply re connecting my devices to my main router  i played around with moving the range extender to different locations  i restarted my home router  etc  all to no avail  the whole idea of the product is to boost the signal strength for devices farther away from the router  and this product does not do that  ok  it is a cheap device compared to others  so i m returning this one and will try a different brand      
541,5.0 ,                       due to covid  had to relocate my computer at home  no longer on the same floor as the router so i had to switch from hard wired to the router to a wireless connection  i am in i t  and spend a good portion of my week on video conferences and use remote resources via vpn   sql  sharepoint  helpdesk  file shares etc  cannot tell i am on wireless  was nervous at first  but glad i bought this instead of running cable  had it set up in    seconds  literally plug it in  push the wps on the router  push the wps on the extender and bam  all hooked up  plugged a switch into the extender and   computers into the switch    we moved all the computers to the basement  office   my work computer  my personal and my wife s personal pc  all up and running with no slow downs      
542,5.0 ,                       if you have a dual band     and   ghz wifi router you may find yourself at the threshold between the range of     and   ghz which will cause your device to either switch back and forth or hang on to a poor   ghz signal rather than switch to a stronger     ghz signal   i didn t figure all of this out until after i purchased this device only to find it didn t fix my issue   my devices continued to hang on to the weak  ghz even over the strong     ghz being broadcast by this range extender   disabling   ghz on the original router was really all i needed i will say this is an excellent value if you really need it   it was easy to setup and is easy to manage  the range is good too   though i don t really need it  i ll keep the extender installed in the bedroom to maximize performance      
543,4.0 ,                       horrible  the connection does not stay on  disconnects all the time      
544,4.0 ,                       this device is limited in its ability  but it is priced accordingly  be sure you understand what it can and can t do before buying   you may need a different model it advertises up to     square feet of coverage  i didn t do the math before i bought it  so i ended up having to relocate it in order to accomplish my needs  fortunately  i was able to find a suitable location for those who don t feel like doing the math  i ll share it here  since we re talking radio waves  a circle is the most accurate measurement      square feet is a circle with a diameter of roughly    feet  sounds good until you realize that the device is the center of the circle  translation   you can get a usable signal up to    feet from the unit in any direction  farther away than that  don t expect a reliable connection it will also cost you some speed  i lose about     measured   feet away compared to my native wifi signal at the same location  this is the reason for   stars instead of    otherwise  it does exactly what it says it will do i needed it to give the security camera at the opposite end of the house from my router      feet  a reliable network connection  and for this it is perfect      
545,5.0 ,                       easy to install and works great     
546,5.0 ,                       i m so happy with this  we recently spent      on a ring camera and i was so excited to use it got it all set up and come to find out our wi fi signal isn t strong enough to reach the other side of our steel front door and we are unable to relocate our wi fi router  ring makes its own brand of wi fi extenders for      but we had already spent so much i didn t want to invest another     for it not to work  then i found this only     and on sale for     off so i figured what do i have to lose  super easy set up did it all by myself without my fianc s tech help and our ring is working perfectly  we saved so much money with this product  highly recommend       
547,5.0 ,                       i bought   of these via amazon  one for the inside of my house and one to extend the signal to my garage now i work in it as a network engineer so i normally deal with cisco networking products  they re expensive and a little more complicated since they re generally used in a corporate environment i installed the tether application on my mobile phone and connected to my wifi  tether is the app that allows me to access and configure my tp link devices  it shows the status of the devices in real time i then scanned my wireless network and was able to bridge it and rename it with the network name  garage or  foh  ive been using these devices for a couple years and never had an issue      
548,1.0 ,                       the positive reviews here blow me away because this extender absolutely sucks  first  it has virtually no range when it comes to the     connection  as opposed to the       and  will not connect to the internet using the     band at all  even though it shows that it s connected to the router  second  it actually creates a poorer connection than i was getting without it  i have a tv with a roku stick in my upstairs media room  my router is downstairs on the other side of the house   and when i don t use this extender  i get a  fair  roku connection  which works  and with the extender  i get a  poor  connection  moreover  the advertising for the product is misleading because the supposed ultra fast mode doesn t work at all  i ve wasted   hours of my life today trying to get the thing to work in an acceptable fashion  and it will not  moreover  the  reset  button doesn t completely reset the unit once it s been configured  so that you can attempt to configure things better  i am returning mine pronto  and good riddance  i will try a different model      
549,1.0 ,                       i bought this wifi extender hoping to boost my wifi signal so i would have better performance in my home office   i have had ongoing problems with the signal dropping  but blamed my internet rather than this device   i have had to reset the extender multiple times  which is a pain in the patootie   i recently upgraded my modem and router  but still had issues with the signal dropping   it wasn t until i had another family member connecting directly to my wifi  with no issues  at the same time that i was going through the extender  with ongoing problems  that i realized the problem was with the extender s inability to maintain a connection with my home s wifi network      
550,1.0 ,                       junk don t buy  i never could get it to work      
551,4.0 ,                       update   product does work now and well   seem the error was due to  purchasers  incorrect set up   lol   my mistake even stumped customer service   anyways  setup is complete and i am pleased to report that the blue signal light is constant   reason for the   stars is i haven t tried to distance for the signal range yet   but all in all  worth the money   sorry tp link i purchased   of the extenders  two for gifts and one or me   i am waiting to see if the other two work before sending mine and or the others back   i went online and chatted for information on setting up the extender since  i could not do so by the instructions that were provided in the package   i also called twice and spoke directly with techs that  tried  to help me install   after  over an  hour of technical support via telephone  i decided that i would post this review   customer service was quick to respond to my call but after many attempts could not resolve the issue   it appears that during the initial setup  i was not able to create a password to finish the setup process   what appeared was a  sign in  page for a password that had already been established   unable to resolve after many attempts  i think it was in my best interest to return the item   as i stated before  i will wait to see the other two extenders i purchased have the same issue before deciding to them as well   i gave   stars because of the courteous customer service persons      
552,1.0 ,                       i m very disappointed in this product  i was so happy with how easy it was to set up with wps function  however the delight ended there  product worked okay for a few hours then my tv and phone both lost internet connection  they were both still connected to the extension but the extension had no internet signal  i have moved the device to every available outlet even though the device gave me no indication of needing to be moved  there s a red light for that  and that never helped  second day using device i had to hard reset it and set it up again  device seemed to work for a while again until the signal was lost  so i moved it once more  after many tests  downloading the app  attempting to update firmware  device was already updated to latest  the connection finally came back   for a while  only to drop out again  basically i m tired of the amount of work it takes to get this  effortless  device to work consistently so i m going to have to return and go for another brand      
553,3.0 ,                       i have a very busy house and needed to extend the internet a little bit to the farthest bedroom   with this little guy  my download speed varies between   and     which is okay for what i m doing   however  when i switch from this internet connection to the main one in the house  in the same exact location  my speed tests show         download speeds   did i mention that we are an internet heavy home   i don t understand why such an extreme difference  especially when   other people and a myriad of devices are using the primary connection and i m the only one using this one   it s probably fine for most people   i just demand more   at least it reaches all over the house        
554,1.0 ,                       did nothing  now that i work remotely  i needed a wifi extender booster to the area where i have my work station set up  even after getting the highest internet with xfinity  i still had low signal in my second bedroom and needed an extender to fix that so i can work  makes calls  etc  with money being tight  i decided to go with this item as it had pretty good reviews and what a load of crap those were  my apartment is       so it s not like a huge mansion so this thing should of given me some type of boost  made everything even slower and the internet meter that we used showed the signal was      of what the rest of the house gets even with using this internet extender  don t waste your money  going to have to just bite the bullet and buy the expensive one      
555,2.0 ,                       pros easy to install cons signal is not very strong once you connect to it  your device will automatically connect to it instead of original wifi router   becomes a headache purchasable  no   don t waste your money umifa rating            
556,5.0 ,                       a snap to set up and works great  for dual band  do the simple wps routine twice  first time pairs     band and second time pairs the     band  i like the separate     and     indicator lights that let you know they are working and placement is good  extended my range a couple of rooms and out to the back patio where i can enjoy sitting outside with my tablet      
557,5.0 ,                       great item     
558,5.0 ,                       wifi range is great  exactly as advertised  very easy to install and set up     
559,1.0 ,                    lo recib  con buen aspecto y en aparente buen estado pero el producto una vez configurado no recibe se al  se apaga y se calienta  no me funcion  en absoluto         
560,5.0 ,                       easy to install and work great   had to add in garage to help be my q app to work for garage opening so far great     
561,5.0 ,                       i live in the basement in the furthest possible location from the router   the wifi reaches but on a     mps speed  we tested the speed upstairs  i was seeing   mbps  while everyone was asleep  i used the tp link app and had this thing set up in under   mins   now my speed is up to     with everyone awake and multiple devices connected    for the price this little device packs a punch and i couldn t be more excited   my phone actually works and i can actually game without a fight for internet   i paid less than     and it was so worth it   edit   that speed test was connected to the original wifi   i actually had slower speeds when connected to the extended wifi  but the strength was      versus       i might play with the location of the extender a bit to see if i can t get the speeds up more      
562,5.0 ,                       with a slowish    mbps  broadband speed  this range extender worked great for the age old       n standard that my also cheap tp link router worked with  using it with another tp link router and keeping the ssid the same as the host seemed to offer the best speeds consistency for the phones in my household buyer beware  this uses the old n standard  soon to be called wifi     the  th generation standard  ac   is soon to be obsolete to the newest wifi   ax standard  before buying something like this  you may want to look into simply buying a new router to try fixing your problems      
563,2.0 ,                       this does make it possible for me to get wifi in more parts of my home  but it has incredibly low bandwidth and so has been virtually useless for me  my current top speed from my router is     mbps  but even if i put it in this extender in the same room as my router and connect to it with a computer in that room  the top download speed is around       mbps  when i move the extender slightly further away so that i can use it to get wifi in other parts of my home  the download speed can drop to     mbps      
564,5.0 ,                       after reading reviews about this wifi repeater  i m so glad i decided to purchase it  it performs as advertised and holds up to the high standard that i m used to from tp link products  all the necessary instructions are included with the product  and setup was a breeze   i set up directly from my router s gateway rather than the app  the product itself is roughly palm sized  and is designed thoughtfully to not cover up the outlet above it when plugged in i live in an old row house in a crowded neighborhood  so between other wifi signals around me and physical barriers of various materials  there was a ton of interference between my router in the living room and my office in the back of the house  this little repeater is set up about halfway between the two and i ve gone from laggy  pixelated video calls to perfect clarity      
565,4.0 ,                       very useful and fast  the default configuration and placement i used initially did not help as much as i would have liked but thanks to the options for splitting the bands     ghz and   ghz bands and some playing around with the location  i now get the speed on mobile devices i am paying my isp for  the only issue that prevents me from giving it   stars is that the advanced options instructions were a little confusing even for a nerd so it may take some trial and error note  i use an apple airport as my main wifi router and this worked perfectly with it and had no issues  if you are somewhat technically included  just follow the directions to fill in the  dark  spots in your wifi coverage  excellent price for what it has done for our household      
566,2.0 ,                       product looks nice  the app is nice and easy to use   i have tried all three connection options  pushing wps button on my home router  via the iphone app  and also through the browser on my laptop    the extender does not connect to my home router at all   everything works  but it will not connect   frustrating as i am doing everything according to the directions  plus i have owned two extenders prior to this one   also  the video has some slightly different directions than the direction on the app and the paper that comes with the box   for example  you need to set a password for the extender itself when setting up via the app   the password must be the same password as your home router s password   the paper directions and app directions mention none of this   but it mentions on the video   i am not sure why companies are not consistent with their operating procedures  but this is an example of one   i am writing this after i have purchased a different extender  other than tp link  and it took   minutes to set up and is working just fine   sometimes you have to learn the hard way i guess      
567,5.0 ,                       working from home now due to covid     my home wifi works well enough for average use  but setting up an office in a spare room far from the router caused my video conferences to freeze and pause  thought i would try this wifi extender and it seems to be working great  although i ve only had it for   days   plugged it in the upstairs hall about    feet from my work laptop  the extender was easy to set up  instructions simple to follow and i am not technically savvy  it created an extension to my current wifi  for example  if your home wifi network is called homewifi  the extender creates homewifi ext  then you can dedicate specific devices to just that extension  for me it just my work laptop cause i need reliable video conferencing      
568,2.0 ,                       to start  you need to install an app or use wps to connect to network  another route they dont mention in the manual is to connect it with an ethernet cable to a router  find an ip and log into the extender by ip  most higher end extenders allow you to connect ethernet to your computer and connect by default http  after that the setup was easy wanted to use it as a bridge  it works well for watching youtube videos on   computers but is not good for upstreaming  it can t steadily support one hd surveillance camera  the signal strength is good but lots of missing frames and it drops connection every      mins connection  in my case its over    second timeouts seems it does some kind of mac masking so if you have managed network with static manual ips expect collisions and inconsistencies and lastly  it gets really hot so if you are looking to extend your  karen home wifi  then you have a winner  otherwise get a better one     
569,4.0 ,                       took a minute to set up  and is bulky hanging off the wall  but works really well      
570,1.0 ,                          beware    that this item contain a slip that states that if you leave a   star review  take a picture and email it to them  you get entered in to receive a free gift  so  is that the reason for a lot of   star reviews  hmmmmmm   the only thing i wish this did was extend my patience  this was just a heap of junk  didn t extend anything  only angered me  and i have worked with computers for    years  you re better off getting two empty soup cans and a string   you might have better luck  i didn t even bother returning it  just threw it away      
571,5.0 ,                       overview i ve never used a wifi extender before and wanted to first see how they worked without breaking the bank on some     gizmo      seemed like a fair amount to do a trial run on the problem my wifi covers my house fairly  but the house was built in the    s and has plaster walls  so sometimes the signal sucks in the furthest parts of the house  backyard  forget it  barely any service  and super choppy hypothesis i wanted an extender that was discreet  that i could put at the edge of the house that would extend the wifi coverage completely throughout the backyard results     well spent  super easy to setup   i downloaded the app and just went through setup   mins in and out   i installed it at the furthest edge of the house and boom  now not only do i have full coverage throughout  the backyard but i also have a strong signal anytime my main wifi drops out inside the house cons the only con is that it doesnt have  ghz coverage  it s using your  ghz signal  but  i dont think most people utilize  ghz anyway to be honest  most every device you use  uses  ghz so unless your a super techy person it shouldn t bother you final thoughts tots recommend it  granted it s the  first day  so i ll have to see how long the product lasts  but sooo farrr sooooo goooood      
572,5.0 ,                       i researched a whole bunch for a wifi extender  i needed one because i live in a small college town and the only wifi providers i could get were terrible but had to make it work  i got this wifi extender because the only time anyone could get wifi is if you were home alone or no one else was using  the wifi only reached the living room  i bought this and put it in one of the hallways where wifi does not reach and let me tell you it s amazing  it was an easy install literally took probably less than   minutes  one thing that i felt like i didn t read or i just missed it that i would recommend us getting the app in your phone that comes with this device  you can shut it off to minimize electricity use and control how wide the range it  also be able to tell how strong the signal is  i am however ordering another one to go in the other end of the house and i suggest if you want something affordable but works this is for you      
573,3.0 ,                       i got this for my parents place because they have their wifi router on one side of their house and garage is on the other side and my dad wants to put up some outdoor cameras   the router signal is very fringe outside by the garage  about mid    s decibels   i tried to put the extender in the middle of the house and the router signal was stronger than the extender signal on the close side of the garage   so i moved the extender to the wall that is on the opposite is side of the house of the router and    feet away from the near side of the garage   the near side of the garage then got about    decibels better with the extender than the router   then when i went to the far side of the garage and tested that  the router had slightly better signal than the extender   so bottom line is it can boost the signal  but not far  it s range is very weak   it d probably be good for an outdoor patio area that has weak signal and you can plug the extender into the wall that s right inside the area you are trying to boost      
574,5.0 ,                       attached is a before after results of the speedtest that i ran in the wifi dead zone  enough said  cheers      
575,5.0 ,                       was hard to connect so we returned it  could be the internet service but felt this should have been easy  we followed the instructions but still didn t work for us      
576,5.0 ,                              
577,5.0 ,                       works good  we definitely noticed a difference once we plugged this in     
578,4.0 ,                       we recently switched over to at t internet and i am very unhappy with them and their service  my husband is pretty mad too as he can t use his xbox on the other side of the house  they were supposed to give us an air tie which is just their brand extender  after being promised one they tried to tell me i had to pay     for it and wait a week to have an installer bring it to us  after a few curse words and hanging up i bought this instead  much cheaper and came in   days with my prime  it was super easy to connect  works really good in our living room with nearly all of our devices  my husband still has a few issues on ocassion with his xbox but he s also comparing it to when it was hard wired with our last internet provider so i can t be sure  overall i m super happy with this and glad it worked so i can still tell at t to screw themselves lol      
579,1.0 ,                       after about   hours of debugging  my conclusion was that it s dhcp was broken  i could connect to the internet if i self assigned an ip on my computer but not with auto assigned ips  about     of the time it would assign a         x x address  which according to support means that it failed  the rest of the time it would assign           x where x was always      for some reason  but internet wouldn t work  i spent   hours with tech support on chat and the only suggestion i got was to try rebooting it and my router  which i d already done  they said the escalated the issue and contacted me by email to say i d get further support within   business day  but   business days went by  i don t want to spend any more time with this product or brand  so i returned it and bought a netgear     
580,4.0 ,                       i ordered two of these  i was  hoping  the second unit would go through the first unit to create a longer distance  this did not work for me  from what i can see  each extension unit has to have its own path back to the original wireless modem and not through another extender in order to work  you make make a wifi triangle or wifi modem in the middle then go left and right from there but it won t go dot to dot into the distance   second unit past the first unit    also the simple button push for enrollment did not work for me  i had to use the computer browser enrollment instructions to get it to work   also note that if i m downstairs i have to tell my devices to look at the extender and not the upstairs wifi signal  so if you re existing wifi name might be   abcdefg    you will see the extender as   abcdefg ext   on your available wifi connections list  also the tech support person i spoke to must be in  mumbai  india  i could not understand her at all  so be prepared to fight with this on your own if you get stuck  but now it works fine once i got it figured out      
581,5.0 ,                       i bought this to extend wifi into my backyard from an upstairs window    i had zero or   bar of wifi before in yard  i have to say it works admirably  i can now sit out on my back deck and enjoy   bars of connection at   mbs speed   not only that but it seems to have strengthened my my regular ubiquity wifi network inside my house  an unexpected bonus setup   it took me   tries to get it past the red setup led   first  do not use your smartphone for setup  as clever as it seems   that just didn t work   second attempt was from my windows laptop  which turned had its own wifi issues  so no go that time   after resetting the tp link  the third attempt was on an imac desktop  and it went very smoothly  just following on screen directions took under   minutes   unplugged the device and moved it to the back of the house  plugged into the end of an extension cord  placed in window sill  and bam  dream of backyard wifi realized   for     bucks   just get it      
582,5.0 ,                       this is probably the simplest install i ve had in a long while  device arrived on time  simply pressed wps button on router  then button on device and moved it to the edge of solid signal and it has easily doubled the range of strong wifi signal this was for my garage to have good signal for a smart switch ac and a nest protect smoke detector as i wouldn t be able to hear a beeping but that app alerts my phone  i used to have one bar of wifi and even then i would get better speeds if i turned it off instead  and now i have full bars on my wifi signal while out in my shop  great product for the price      
583,1.0 ,                       super slow  slower than what i am trying to fix  perhaps i had a defective one  i don t know  i am not trying again though      
584,1.0 ,                         of the worst purchases i ve ever made  tried on multiple occasions to get going straight  connecting isn t a problem  but messing up the signal is  not only am i not getting a better signal  it s also messing up the original router signal      
585,3.0 ,                       did not seem to increase signal that much  but may have been just our setup  increased download upload bandwidth rates by about      easy to set up  ended up giving to a friend to hopefully work better for them      
586,1.0 ,                       the product arrived in great condition  it was so easy to install and i was so excited to start getting better wifi connections to the back of my house and bedrooms  mind you  my house is quite small  just approx       sq  ft  with this wifi extender  it made connection even more frustrating  it slows things down that it streaming keeps buffering then eventually freezes or just shuts down  ok to use for simple goggling  but not great for streaming  i don t recommend this at all  purchase a better one and save your money and time      
587,5.0 ,                       this was needed to extend to a far bedroom  downloaded an app to my phone  plugged it in and the app found it immediately just paired it to my router and entered the password  it was that simple to setup  just moved it to the room that needed the boosted signal and my daughter hasn t had any more connection issues or network drops  can t say anything negative about this device  if i ever need another one  this is the one i will buy      
588,3.0 ,                       so i was hoping this would solve my wifi issues downstairs in the basement   the router sits on the upstairs opposite side of the house   using the app and connecting it was easy   it mimics your router ssid and adds   ext  to it i think the limitations of the single band showed   it struggled with pulling   mbps down and   up   i do skype calls for work and it was really choppy on the flip side i bought a power line adapter and then hooked that up to the extender and changed it to an access point and now it gets      really solidly   i think the communication to and from the router and back out on the same band causes a lot of lag so losing that first leg of travel helps a ton if i had to do it over i would have opted for the     more dual band model   as it is now it s fine for my son to use for his remote learning      
589,5.0 ,                       i was in the beginning a bit skeptical about this product  in all honest truth  i purchased it because it was being sold in an amazon deal  i ve been having issues of slow connectivity in my basement  my router is in the main floor and although i am able to connect from the basement  the connection isn t what you can call reliable  i used the wps method of connecting to the router  mainly because i didn t want to create  another  username password account with tp  and it worked like magic  i was having some issues at first but it was because my router wasn t setup to accept wps connections  i was unaware of that until i logged into the router  my suggestion is to ensure that the wps tool is enabled in your router before you try setting up the extender  once i had the extender connected and after was moved to basement i was amazed at the speed and quality of the connection  it prompted me to write a review          
590,1.0 ,                       it does not even come with up to date firmware  you have to go to the website  download the updates yourself  and load them into the website  that s if it can even find your home network      
591,1.0 ,                       wifi signal is terrible  it did not help extend my wifi signal at all  yes i am a techy person and have it installed correctly     
592,1.0 ,                       i tried to set this up using  method    and it would not do anything it would just give me the dreaded red light   so the direction said to try  method    same red light and nothing worked   so then i reset my modem  same red light   i tried the tp link tether app   same red light no matter what i did  i factory reset the item and tried again  both methods   same red light   this thing is junk   don t waste your time with it   overall a waste of over a half an hour plus the trouble of boxing it up to send it back      
593,5.0 ,                       this strengthens and stabilizes my wifi signal  i am very happy with it  the next one i buy will be  g i recommend this product      
594,1.0 ,                       this is a rather popular and highly rated device on amazon  that s why i chose it  i have noticed no improvement other than constantly needing to reconnect the darn thing to my router  one would think it would always sync back up to my home s wifi after an initial sync  but every time you look at the lights  there s a red one on  also  a suggestion for the manufacturer  use green red for the connection and another light  blue  for the power  currently  it s red blue and power is blue too  so  from a distance  a quick glance at the device is not useful  i have to go right up to the unit an see what s happening  regardless  when it s hooked  blue blue  it doesn t seem to be effective for us      
595,4.0 ,                       i had two very specific objectives when shopping for a range extender   i wanted to get the necessary  three bars  for wifi on my blink xt  camera  and i wanted to spend as little money as possible   this little device has accomplished both objectives we have dual band gigabyte wifi service in our home  but getting an adequate     ghz signal from our second floor router to just outside our front door had been a bit of a challenge   after using this product for a few weeks  i am quite happy with it   it does what it is supposed to   extending the range of our system for the camera   it isn t particularly fast  compared to closer  more direct  ghz and    ghz connections with our router  but i am satisfied and happy   if your needs are greater or different than mine  there are more powerful  higher end alternatives out there from tp link and others my blink camera is working fine again   there have been no stability problems with the extender so far  and it was a snap to install with the wps button      
596,1.0 ,                       goal was to extend wifi to garage to listen to internet radio music  thought that should be easy  extender would not connect to home network using netgear router  followed directions to push wps and extender button to connect  led light on extender indicates no connection however it completely removed and replaced our home network with its own  this left us with no internet connection  once internet connection was reestablished   attempted again to use alternate directions but gave up out of frustration      
597,5.0 ,                       my wireless modem is on the opposite end of the house  log home   there is a set of closed doors i have to keep closed during the day  and a huge refrigerator that does not help with the signal  i plugged in the device and then set up all of my devices  including the tv to the wifi connection ending in  ext  entered my regular password and all is great      
598,4.0 ,                       it really increases speed from   mbps to     mbps on my desk top computer        
599,1.0 ,                       worst purchase   do not waste your money   wouldn t install   such cheap quality   not compatible   useless tech support   amazon support was no help either      
600,2.0 ,                       did not work well     
601,5.0 ,                       it is only a    ghz band which if you don t know the     is range and a  ghz is for speed  my samsung tv usually disconnects from the internet the next day and its a pain to enter the pass  so i use this extender downstairs with a ethernet cable connecting the tv with this extender to keep it connect to the tv  while the modern is upstairs usually downstairs has slowing connection speeds  so  i can also connect to the extender that is downstairs with my devices to get the best internet   pretty good device to extend the internet range  if you want to extend for gaming get a dual  ghz and connect it with an ethernet cable with your pc and it should work if the internet connection isn t reaching that far      
602,5.0 ,                       it took a while for me to finally get all the devices connected and to stay connected but after some trial and error i finally got it figured out and now it works perfect  my grandmother has a mini apartment attached to my house and would always have to bring her laptop over to my side of the house to check her banking and what not and she wasn t able to play many games on her phone without wifi and now she s happy as a camper because of this  i m extremely satisfied with this purchase      
603,1.0 ,                       easy to install  yes  but it doesn t improve my wifi speed  it actually lowers it  after removing a conflicting gateway from my router and plugging it directly into the at t gateway  i have gotten speeds between    to over     mbps throughout the house without this device  with it i get a stronger signal  around    dbm  but download speed drops to less than   mbps  i have played around with it for   or   days attempting various configurations  in my opinion the device doesn t work for me  what worked was removing and reconfiguring conflicting devices      
604,5.0 ,                       we had issues with our smart tv ps  in our bedroom on wifi  we plugged this thing in our bathroom  and havent had issues with our tv since we added it   however the ps  in our room  it helped but didn t fully fix the problem with gaming   but i still give this   stars for making my tv way better then before  and another reason why our internet and bedroom are on opposite sides of my      sqft house  so if your house is smaller the gaming end probably would work if the router and system are closer together      
605,4.0 ,                       i read a good many previous reviews and there were enough of them describing difficulties in setting the device up  i knew my own experience  might be problematic due to my modem and router being in a very difficult location downstairs  i followed the direction exactly for the  a  way to set it up and it did so very fast with both lights becoming a steady blue then i began to test what it could do by plugging it into various locations and testing it out with an app called meteor that provided measures of the strength of the signal and other metrics  i have seen a marked improvement but i still need to try a few more location that due to christmas tree and toy mooses are not yet accessible      
606,1.0 ,                       signal not strong at all     
607,2.0 ,                       we kept getting a signal out of it but no actual internet connection  tried multiple times to reset  setup  and work with it and finally decided to return it  honestly could be user error in that we don t know enough to get it to work  but in following the provided instructions we couldn t get it to work      
608,2.0 ,                       this product doesn t boost your wifi  it creates a much slower network which you can connect to  i googled and people have mentioned it s normal that you get half of your actual speed from these devices  however this particular one cuts the speed by one tenth  my internet speed is    mbps and with this bad boy it goes down to    or even less  tech support has been extremely unhelpful  they kept asking me for proof of the low speed  like why in the world i would call and lie about a low wifi speed they asked me to send screen shots of the speedtest and wouldn t believe what i m telling them      i wish i would ve used it sooner  it s past the return time but don t fall for this product  i mean if you don t care much about the internet speed  it s a good product  it was fairly easy to install too  but you can t have fast internet on this      
609,5.0 ,                       easy to setup  signal strength is good  i might have to get another one if these     
610,1.0 ,                       the issue with this is it extends wifi but then starts  losing connectivity randomly every    mins  especially if other smart devices used simultaneously      
611,5.0 ,                       i was trying to frankenstein my own repeater with dd wrt  not working hooking up a cat  to the port and wiring my building s wired network  i can easy pull    mbps over the unit s  g link  crazy the    g link is great too in repeater mode  the  g and    g work fine  all   mbps  at quite a distance and  good  signal quality no incompatibilities with anything  random dongles  ipads  iphones  macbooks   ds  vita  it all just connects rock solid     of the time  the other    of the time  i think its the main router  tp link archer c  v   s fault i was worried i d need a beefier unit  such as the ac    s  etc   nope  this unit is more than adequate for  g at    feet through walls you will lose considerable bw in repeater mode  however if you want use the cat  port on the bottom for your own wired solution  you ll get full  g speeds     mpbs   which is pretty sweet      
612,5.0 ,                       i had hesitated to buy this for a long time  in part based on some unhappy reviewers  i purchased it  just in case  and it happens that one night we had a storm  and most macintosh in the house then refused to connect to our dual band linksys         i spent   hours on my work mac trying all possible  fixes  found online as wifi can be finicky on some macos versions  so i decided to install the tp link n    wifi extender  the macs connected immediately and all worked fine  even from the basement we could get the signal on the deck on the other side of the house  unexpected bonus    the tp link n    wifi extender was only extended the linksys signal  but since the linksys router did not see the mac  directly  then every one was happy    so literally the tp link n    wifi extender saved the work day working from home   the next day i ordered a netgear orbi triband mesh router    and that works even better  i have kept the tp link n    wifi extender and added to the orbi network and it helps extend signal on the deck and into the garden        
613,3.0 ,                       i already owned one of these and my son had a horrible time getting it connected  but once he did  it has worked well  i could not get this one to connect either  i spent hours trying everything in the quick set up   i used the online chat and learned the unit sent did not have current firmware loaded   i got new firmware emailed to me which i had to download and load   i spoke with the phone support person for over       hours   he finally said my product was defective and needed to be returned   he sent me to a website to make a warranty account  which would tell me where to send it to  but first it required i contact technical support again   th time    customer service is not their strong point they called and emailed me the following day after writing this review   they escalated this issue and this tech walked me through the set up without any issues   i didn t have to download anything or go through all the steps the first person did  it is up and running   i m happy to have it working  the second tech  ed  was friendly and knowledgeable      
614,5.0 ,                       a great wifi extender that did exactly as it said it would  expand my network  it s great  i highly recommend it for anyone that has connection problems in certain areas of there home  i m actually going to buy another now that i think about it lol      
615,4.0 ,                       for setup  i don t have the specific button on my belkin router so i had to resort to the second option of using the app  after signing in the app  the process was pretty much automatic by following the steps  i believe i have seen stronger wifi signal and my skype conversation appeared more fluid after installing the extender  i have my wifi router upstairs and it seems to be improving my situation in my dining room temp office  i am cautiously optimistic      
616,5.0 ,                       i live in a      sq  ft  condo with two bedrooms separated by the kitchen and living room  with my router in one of the bedrooms  the second bedroom s reception was very poor  connections were slow and sometimes they would drop off  the tp link connector was offered by amazon at a good price with mostly good recommendations  so i got it  my master bedroom s reception went from very poor to good   excellent  my connections are quicker and no more dropped internet connection i found the easiest way to install it was with their app loaded to my iphone  the process is almost identical to installing an echo device   we live in a well constructed building with solid wood doors and insulation between interior walls  if it works for me  it should for you      
617,5.0 ,                       after many failed attempts at a diy range extender with dd wrt  i decided to pick one of these up  i figured for the price  it would be worth having a  wife approved  solution  this was by far the easiest extender setup i ve ever experienced  i ve become quite a fan of tp link  there s really not too much to this thing once you get it setup the first time  after that  it just works  i ve had months of up time  and by the time you would have a problem  you ve probably power cycled due to your crappy isp anyway i believe there is one model below this one  but i purchased this one because it best matched the specifications of my router  the tp link tl wdr     one of my favorite features is the ethernet port on the bottom of the unit  what a brilliant idea  i didn t think i would use it  but now that i have it  i use it constantly  i have this down by my tv connected to a switch to bring internet to my blu ray  xbox  and mythtv dvr  i highly recommend this product if you re in a situation like mine      
618,2.0 ,                       i bought this item because i live in a   story house and my router is downstairs right in the center of our place  my isp is xfinity and im using a  motorola mg      x  cable modem plus n    single band wi fi gigabit router with power boost      mbps maximum docsis      that i bought off amazon  this past week the wifi has been horrible upstairs  i pay for a     mbps plan and am getting about      mbps upstairs in my room  so  i bought this in hopes that it would strengthen the signal upstairs and at least give me some boost since i m working from home nope  i installed it  which was super easy  and had it working within   mins  however  with my laptop next to the router i was pulling      mbps straight from my regular router  i switch over to this extender  it creates a network with your home wifi s name and adds   plus  to the name    my download speeds across three individual tests on   different laptops were    mbps next to my home router  upstairs it wouldn t go above  mbps    so now im returning it      
619,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is by far the best wifi extender i have ever used  i have a multi level house and wifi is challenging  full signal in some parts of the house and in others   there is none  i have tried many many wifi units similar to this  i m very tech savvy and pride myself in figuring stuff out with out directions  however  that is very different with some wifi extenders  they are complicated to set up and do not work good at all  i had good luck with the tp link light sockets with the echo and setup was a breeze  so i decided to take one more shot at yet another wifi extender  choosing the tp link in hopes it would work just as good  i really don t understand these other reviews that state how hard it is to set up  this wifi extender is truly easy to set up  this is what i did     quick instructions right on the side of the box  plug in the tp link  close to your router  the green light flashes  press the wps button on your router  then press the signal button on the extender  the green light flashes  goes solid green  goes solid red then after      seconds the light stays solid green  the unit is now paired with your router  now  unplug the extender  walk to a midway point in your house close to the dead spot and plug it back in  it will blink green again  then solid green  then solid red       seconds it turns solid green  open any device you want to use for wifi  go to wifi settings and find your wifi name  except the word  ext will be after the device name  so if your normal wifi is goober    for example  it would now show as goober    ext  choose the ext one and enter your normal password for wifi  and boom  full wifi signal  i now have wifi in every room in the house  if you plug the unit in and the light stays on solid yellow  then move it to another socket closer to the router  hope this helps anyone who has or has had a problem

621,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       oh man  i am over the moon about this product  my bedroom is the basement of the house  so the wifi just barely reached  and has a very weak signal  this extender is a life saver it took maybe   minutes to set up  the hardest part was getting it out of the box  it amplifies the signal perfectly  and i find that it actually makes my wifi faster  as less people are using it housewifi is my normal wifi signal in my room and the housewifi ext is the extenders wifi signal in my room  look at the difference i will be convincing my family to buy these for the farther parts of the house  in love       
622,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i needed a wifi extended to provide a better wifi signal to my ring doorbell  unfortunately  the location of my router was too far from the ring and the signal had to travel through too many walls  including the external brick wall  because of the weak signal  i was having trouble answering rings and getting live views on my phone i originally looked into purchasing the ring brand wifi extended  but it was    bucks and it was only for ring products  i thought it would help to have a wifi extender to connect to all my other devices  so i scoured amazon to find a cheaper one i am technologically literate in many areas  but connectivity and networks are not one of those areas  i was concerned that i would have to hire a techy person to come help me  but surprisingly  it was very easy to set up and connect with my current at t uverse router i did run into a bit of a problem  as my ring doorbell was still showing a weak signal  i fiddled around with the ring and realized that this extended had created a new network for me to connect to   it was my network name with   ext  at the end  i reconnected the ring to that network   my password was the same and everything   and now my ring doorbell works perfect this extender is great and does exactly what i need i also noticed on the box that there is a phone number to call for      tech support  which is very handy to have i highly recommend it if you just need a boost in signal to reach certain devices or reach devices that are too far away from your router

624,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       could barely get a signal in my garage  now with this extender i have an excellent connection  set up was easy  literally push two buttons and it s done      
625,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i live in a large apartment  the modem is in my bedroom and the signal in the living room is strong enough to be reliable so use an extender   when the one i have had for a few years died  i ordered this one to take its place   there were many to choose from  but i chose this one because tp link is a brand i trust the extender was easy to install  and was soon up and running   i now have a very strong signal in the living room and throughout the apartment based on my  experience  i recommend this extender      
626,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the extender does not keep me connected to the network   every time i turn on my lg smart tv  there s no connection  or i get an error message stating the password is incorrect   i then have to unplug the extender  restart the router  then plug the extender back in for it to connect again   every day i have to do this   first  i thought it was the tv  called lg customer service and completed the instructions they gave  but the problem continued  i later realized it was the extender and not the tv   now i m purchasing a netgear   i pray works better than this one      
627,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       all i can say is wow  i live in up in the hills of kentucky in a holler so my other houses our not right next door they are a good      of a mile away at least  my father lives under me and he uses my internet connection on wifi and he does not get a good connection maybe     bars  so when he got an amazon fire tv which we use for playstation vue  netflix  and hulu he would be able to watch but it would stop here and there because of the low signal strength  we decided to try this out and see if it would solve the problem and it did not only could i see my modem at full strength but i could see three other modems two of them at full strength and one at        went up and down  to let you know one house close to me is      a mile the one that is farthest is     a mile and at     a mile i still got a        signal from them  if you want to extend your range i would recommend this product it is amazing      
628,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       there is a problem with my tp link n    range extender  it constantly disconnects from my main router and kicks all the devices connected to it off as well  every day i have to unplug the range extender and plug it back into the outlet for it to work again  but this problem occurs every day so it s not a permanent fix  i hope i didn t get a defective unit
