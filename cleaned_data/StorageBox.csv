0,5.0,                       the container arrived nicely and secure  it arrived in perfect condition with all    small containers perfect  in addition  i also received    small labels so i can easily identify what is in the container  the outside container closes with a snap  i d highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to store small items  which in my case are diamond drills for my diamond paintings      
1,5.0,                       this item came very well packaged and nothing was damaged  i love how the little containers are in a cute carrying case with a handle and locking tabs   will make it very easy for me when i wanna take a diamond painting with me somewhere  the lids on each container close very snugly so i dont have to worry about them popping open and my drills spilling out  i m very satisfied with this product     also came with a large sheet of label s     
2,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love product because it has sticker and ever thing was there  i can t wait use it   i      
3,5.0,                       i did one diamond painting without using little containers to keep track of the drills  ugh  the tiny plastic zip lock bags often didn t close completely  resulting in drills all over the floor  since i plan on doing more  ahem  probably many more  diamond paintings  i decided to invest in proper storage  i ordered this    grid bead drill storage container  and i had so much fun putting my drills inside  labeling them with the provided labels  the individual containers hold a good amount of drills  and close with a very satisfying  click   leaving me confident that i won t be tracking loose drills all over the house i m very pleased with my purchase      
4,5.0,                       i use this product for holding diamond painting drills  it is a great storage system  the containers are a good size and overall it is a great storage system for using at home or traveling with  i also love that it came with labels  the lids of the containers snap shut and hold closed well  overall i love it  i would definitely recommend this to someone needing a storage system for diamond painting drills      
5,5.0,                       in my hand  joann s box on the left and this product on the right  you can see it s much more clear everything about this product is amazing  i needed something to replace my cheap joanns tic tac bead boxes for my ever growing mill hill collection  the darice organizer seems to be the go to  but kind of pricey  this was a bargain but so worth the price  the containers are way sturdier and more well built than the joann s brand  none of them are cracked or broken or cloudy  and the lids all actually fit  i m not worried about any accidental spills  i was also worried about the labels after having my dmc bobbin label stickers fall off constantly  but they hold on so well  they re not going anywhere         i almost fit my   joann s boxes into one  but i m going to need a second  i just didn t want to commit until i knew it was a good item  i would recommend this over anything at joann s for beading  if you re using it for mill hills  it fits   or maybe   packs of petites in one container      
6,4.0,                       it s the best thing i have found so far for dp drills  on average  the kits i have gotten use       colors  and most colors will fit into one of the little individual containers   background colors may require   or more if you want to open all your packets while kitting up  also they come with an abundance of self adhesive little labels for marking the color codes from your canvas my only complaint is that the little containers do not fit perfectly together  being slightly bigger at the top than the bottom  so they have a tendency to disorganize themselves and fall over in the case if you remove one or two from the grid other than that  they do the job they are intended for      
7,5.0,                       love love love    i had s o o many of the    break away cases  i found out that the covers of some did notclose well  while i was pouring one color into a tray  i d be pouring a different color  on the flour    this is soeasy and you don t have   other covers to  watch  at the same time   i purchased       storage containers  at thesame time  i do both round and square drill paintings  just easier than having both drills in the same container i give this a  huge thumbs up       i would recommend this system to everyone    god bless you all        
8,1.0,                       this box was a limited time only deal  so i bought it and frankly  it s cheaper and less secure than what i ve been using  the dill containers are really small  see pictures   i kept thinking they were like the size of a tic tac container   i feel like they will stay shut  but the larger box is doomed to not last long   i would certainly not trust this to carry drills anywhere  and the handle is worthless i purchased this to find a better way to store my drills while doing my diamond painting  i was using a plastic set that is like a weekly pill container   boxes with   rows kept inside a larger plastic box to keep them together   while i like that product and found them to  almost  meet my needs  the more i used them the more the plastic closing elements both on the small internal containers and the larger  external box is starting to fail staying shut   since i don t store back up drills  i can t afford to spill any in a kit  i felt like i was flirting with disaster and have resorted to a rubber band to at least keep spilled ones in the larger box   this turned out to be worse in my opinion      
9,3.0,                       after completely filling every little tic tac dispenser from just a single diamond painting kit  minus   bag as there wasn t enough  i don t see the tops lasting too long since to get the tops off you need to pull on the tabs  also    full bag fills     little dispensers  these things are tiny  i also had three containers with large cracks in the side although the crack doesn t go all the way through  i also received several that had smaller but very noticeable scratches  in just one afternoon session i was able to empty   full containers  the only real plus to these is the larger box to store everything in and the labeling stickers work very well   if you do diamond paintings often i would say either buy multiple sets or just save up your tic tac dispensers as they would hold much more  if i liked tic tacs that would have seriously been the better option and the most cost efficient but i don t like them and i can t see me just tossing them either  so overall     ehhh         
10,4.0,                       this is exactly what i was looking for for my excess diamonds   the little tic tac like containers hold a decent amount   it s easy to pour them in  it s easy to pour them out   it comes with little label stickers that give you enough room to write a dmc number and shape on them  you can order them as you get new dmc numbers to add my only issue is that the larger container seems to have been chosen because you can technically get all the mini containers in it   but not always easily  so getting all the mini containers in the larger container can be mildly annoying      
11,5.0,                       since the covid    shutdowns and restrictions  i have completed fifteen   d diamond projects  all of these were done prior to purchasing this portable bead storage container  i don t know why it took so long for it to dawn on me that opening little plastic bags and resealing was a real pain  besides  i couldn t see all the symbols at once when i had the vinyl bags lined up back to back  with this storage container i can see all the symbols at once  and there is no trouble getting the containers open  it comes with an initial set of labels easily removed so i can reuse the containers for the next project  this container has saved me frustration and time  i already had a small funnel for transferring the beads back into the container  definitely recommend      
12,4.0,                       i m happy with this case to store my diamond dots  the small containers inside work great for my purpose  i can take the top completely off to fill or i can flip the small top open to pour out a small amount of dots to use  they are basically small tic tac containers  it s nice to have an organized way to store my supplies  the larger case that holds everything does the job  the closure snaps seem a little flimsy and i have a feeling they will break off over time  that will cause me to not be able to carry the case around  like a mini suitcase  without all the little inside containers falling out  it s working fine for now though      
13,2.0,                       i thought this would be good for the  diamond  paintings to hold the plastic beads it came from china  shipped in a light weight bag  and the latches were broken  the handle is almost stationary the little containers were solid enough but i could see the lids breaking very soon after repeated use it didn t pay to send back  i gave the containers to someone else and tossed the tub      
14,4.0,                       this little sucker is a life saver  before this i was constantly picking up little diamond painting beads all over the house  the only thing i would improve is to make the caps fit a tiny bit tighter  on the one hand  they come out easy enough to easily pour in the leftover beads when you re done with them  on the other hand  i ve had a cap or two come out when i wasn t trying  no bueno  they are cute though  they look like little tic tac containers      
15,3.0,                       first time doing diamond painting  i wanted to organize stones   little containers are ok but case they are in i was not impressed with  there is nothing keeping them in a row  not sure which way they are supposed to be facing they don t fit in there very organized  take one out and they all move  the labels don t stick      
16,3.0,                       likes     these are flip top lid containers     they come in a case to hold them all     the    count is better than the    count  because when you do several different diamond art paintings you wind up with extra gems      carrying case is pretty sturdy  dislikes  the lid flaps are flimsy and break off  i just opened this package yesterday for the first time and two of the flap lids broke off     the sturdy carrying case one side of the close lock is not manufactured correctly and the lid does not stay on the latch  i have ordered this very container before but this one seems to have issues      
17,5.0,                       by far the best box for diamond art  i have previously purchased a box that had only    bottles that screwed on  this box has    snap on lids  can be opened and closed with one hand and since all of the kids are attached  they can t be misplaced  boxes open close very easily and far superior to those little little jars that can be over tightened and get stuck  comes with small white stickers so that each box can be marked with the corresponding symbols  the worst thing that i can say is that sometimes you have to hold it by the handle in order to get both sides to snap shut      
18,5.0,                       wish i had ordered a couple more  not very diamond painting company uses the same color labeling system so it makes sense to have other storage kits to accommodate those as well  also  i think i will have to look into log books for the same reason   i just received this box and have not used it but my only concern would be for sturdiness of the hinges on the individual boxes  with constant use they may become infirm and break off  however i think they will still snap on  just easier to lose track of them if they are no longer attached   contrary to the appearances of my apartment i am ocd about matching storage and storage anything  this fills that compulsion  i would recommend  ocd or not      
19,2.0,                       this item came cracked in   places   one crack on the front of the box top which doesn t affect the function of the product  and the other crack on the back of the top near one of the hinges  this crack makes the top of the box hang funny when open  and since the weight of the top of the box pulls at the crack  it keeps getting bigger  the plastic is not very sturdy  i have duct taped it to hold it together the small containers for the drills are mostly fine   a few have flaps on top that almost snapped off when i flipped them open for the first time  and they will probably break off eventually  i m using those for lesser used colors had i not been in the middle of a project that i really wanted to use this for  i d have returned the item for the poor quality that said  having your drills sorted in containers like these makes doing a diamond painting flow nicely  you can easily pour out just the amount you need for the area you re working on  just wish the case itself was sturdier      
20,5.0,                       i wish i d had the good experience other did  the outer box arrived shattered on one end  with a long crack that went all the way to the bottom of the container  several of the closure tabs on the small containers are completely snapped off and loose in the box i am processing a return and hopefully the replacement arrives with no issues like this  how disappointing    edit  two days later  my replacement arrived and it is exactly how i hoped it would be  updating to    since this seems to be a shipping issue  not a product issue  at least now i know what ll happen to my case if i drop it        
21,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the concept of this case is great but it s made very cheaply  most organizer cases have actual hinges and hooks made from other parts  this is basically  d printed from one single sheet of plastic    the hooks on the front do not stay closed and its very hard to get them to snap like they should  the little inside tic tac like containers are made better than the actual case  such a shame because i like the design of this case a lot more than some of the others i ve seen       
22,2.0,                       i received the product and one of the clasps to keep it closed was already broken off  the containers to hold the little diamonds are similar to tic tac containers  they are easy to use  i was very displeased with the case itself  it is very thin and easily breakable  the handle to be used to carry it is flimsy  and seems like it will snap of you try to carry the case      
23,4.0,                       first of all  i used this product for a little over a month  and it certainly serves its purpose  especially for the low cost and number of individual containers  however  i decided to upgrade to a more expensive set of containers  used for diamond painting drills  because these containers are flimsy and the thin plastic cracks  if you never remove the lid  maybe they ll resist cracking  but that tiny lid makes it harder to put drills into the container vs removing the lid  almost all mine have splits in them now  and while the containers are still usable in this condition  i wanted something better with a larger opening for putting in new packs of drills      
24,5.0,                       i love it    i have started a great new hobby  it s called diamond art  and i ve become obsessed with it  and all the accessories that go along w it lol  this container and the little bottles that comes with it are perfect size  and exactly what you need to hold all the colored diamonds  drills  that you need for every new wip  the containers are very sturdy  and the box as well  i will definitely be ordering more like this for every new d a project  it came as specified and pictured  and with enough labels for every container ty very much      
25,3.0,                       i wanted to be able to put my diamond painting beads in the containers while i m working on a project  but three colors did not fit in these tiny little boxes  they are only good for storing leftovers  if you haven t got too many of them per color  would ve preferred that they were tictac size boxes for the price  which is what they look like visually  perhaps an image showing one in a persons hand would help people know what size these really are  don t pay more than    for this box  keep an eye out for a sale     
26,4.0,                       first  what i liked was the snap container    the container and box was sturdy and i liked the adhesive labels for color identification what i was disappointed in was the flimsy handle and the small containers fell down when   or   containers were removed and i found the containers annoying to pick up to put in place  i am also missing one container   that was not in the box   so  i always have fallen lids that need to be uprighted to give me a tight fit   it s a good idea  maybe this is as good as it gets for the small pixels   i use this item for diamond painting      
27,5.0,                       i used this to organize my seeds and used the label that came with it to indicate planting season  then i just used a label maker to put across the front what each seed was  it s more compact than some of the other seed storage i was looking at which is also nice  would be great for beads too      
28,1.0,                       the first thing i noticed about these incredibly small cases is that most of them arrived scratched  they look as if they have already been used  if a product were to be on the shelf in this condition  i would never purchase it  like other reviews mention  the plastic is so thin it feels as if it is going to break just by opening it  i m incredibly disappointed with how cheaply made this item is  definitely returning it      
29,5.0,                       i m really pleased with the container   everything is easily identified by labeling each individual container   a small funnel helps to fill the container with diamonds  it is a tad smaller than tic tac containers   you can easily take the number letter you need and dispense the diamonds you want to work on without having them all over your working area   as i get a new kit i put the diamonds in the containers before starting on the canvas   i complete one kit before starting a new one   i love painting with diamonds      
30,2.0,                       bird songs  liked it originally  but does not stand up or flops over when filling  and i bought    the little tic tac containers are cheaply made and the lids do not fit tightly  beads came tumbling out more then once  i got so aggravated i finally tried taping them closed  but that is inconvenient cause i have to reseal each time i use      
31,5.0,                       i was pleasantly surprised on this when i purchased for my diamond art beads  they are easy to fill  easy to get a few or many beads out of and fit nicely in the box with just enough room to be able to get just one container out at a time  i will say the locking hinges are a bit flimsy but do the job   how long they will last we will see  i purchased another like it and the boxes fit so tight you have to take out multiple just to get to the one you need  buy this one instead      
32,5.0,                       my case came quickly  using it to hold herbs for a travel altar  will work great  the lids are snug while not being difficult to remove if you want to  comes with little stickers to label them  the containers are very small though  smaller than a tick tack case by probably half  ordered another one because apparently i have more supplies than i realized  will probably order a third one in the future for my diamonds for my painting with diamonds kits too  i think this will be a lot more space sensitive than the system i am currently using      
33,5.0,                       i wasn t sure about getting the diamonds into the cases but the white tray that comes with each picture has the pour tip that fits right in the top of the  boxes    the top removes completely but that isn t necessary to fill  depending on the volume of each packet the individual box will hold at least   packets  it makes the work area much cleaner neater  they also send a sheet of mini stickers to mark the  boxes with the correct id number      
34,5.0,                       this is perfect for those who bead or make jewelry to store and organize small pieces and bead colors  the box is a good size  easy to store and also easy to take along with you on the go  and the clasps hold and snap together tightly  and i feel confident it will stay closed  i got all my seed needs sorted and in the little containers  and then realized the corner of the top of the box was cracked   after all that work  i ll have to undo it so that i can return it for an undamaged one  it came to me in a sealed plastic mailing  envelope that didn t have any padding  i m bummed i have to wait again for it as i was hoping to get all organized for winter  otherwise this is a great buy and a good price      
35,4.0,                       i used this product to store   d drills   they weren t as large as somebody described almost   inches  only   inches x   inch  actually  found a few with bad  cracks and several with stressed and scratched corners but overall worked well for organizing and consolidating drills into a compact and easily carried unit shipped very timely and wrapped well      
36,4.0,                       this little organizer was a game changer for the diamond art game  i did my first diamond painting without any kind of organizer aside from little ziplock bags  and that was a little bit of a nightmare  so i upgraded when i bought my next project  it s great for not only keeping me organized while i work  but keeping my mischievous kitten out of trouble  i just have one complaint  while one of the boxes works perfectly  i have issues with the little inserts in the second one  a couple of the containers have lids that are too flimsy to stay closed  so i leave them empty  not surprised considering this organizer is on the cheaper side  otherwise  i love how contained and organized everything is      
37,3.0,                       i love the little containers they are perfect for my drill storage  they snap well and are sturdy however i have a problem that the large plastic storage case came broken  very disappointed  could you send me a replacement outer box   i d spend more on fooling around with packing and returning it then it s worth   if the company makes this right i ll up it to five stars and write here that they  made it right      
38,3.0,                       opened the mailing envelope and the contents box was cracked  the tic tac box openings and container are very small  much smaller than an actual tic tac container  do have to say the lids on the tic tac box seems sturdy  however  overtime i feel they wouldn t last to long  i m going to keep the product but i am going to invest a bit more   into another product      
39,1.0,                       this box broke the moment i opened the lid  the plastic is really flimsy  i had to duct tap the lid where it cracked because i desperately needed a container for my beads the good thing is that its a small case and the containers are ok  they are just like tictoc conatiners easy to open  but hard to pour and fill      
40,5.0,                       i never should have waited this long to buy this item  i enjoy diamond art kits and have completed nine  seven without my bead box  that was dumb on my part  these small containers are well made  even my husband complimented on its structure and he is hard to please  it helps keep my beads and me organized so i can relax while making art  it came on time and neatly packaged  thank you      
41,1.0,                       i m disappointed in the quality of these   i ordered them and they seemed fine but after doing   diamond paintings one of the lids no longer stays on and   of them cracked   i can tell they aren t going to hold up for the longterm now i m looking at something else to get instead   very disappointed as i ve only had them for   months and it said they are for diamond painting      
42,5.0,                       this diamond painting holder is great   it has many containers to hold beads in   it is easy to use and definitely helps you by giving small labels that  you can place on top to identify each color coordinate   i  in fact plan to order another   the carry case is great as well since it closes snuggly on all inside   so there is no possibility of any beads escaping      
43,5.0,                       these are the perfect containers for my acrylic  diamonds  for crafting  easy to fill  hold     grams  and so far have not popped open if i drop one  very sturdy  by far the best little containers for this purpose  comes with plenty of label stickers  the cases keep everything sorted and safe  i will definitely buy again if i need more      
44,5.0,                       i like creating things with lego but i don t like searching for some of the tiny pieces and trying to figure out what is where  this little box is perfect for sorting and holding the smaller pieces i love how sturdy it feels and how easy it is to take the tops off the individual containers  while staying securely on when i want them to  great value  very pleased      
45,4.0,                       easy to use and store my diamonds for diamond painting in  but  i have already cracked   container trying to get the little tab in the lid open  it stuck down and when i pulled the container cracked  not enough to render it unusable  but it s a pretty good sized crack    stars  because the plastic seems easy to break      
46,4.0,                       it is perfect for diamond painting and keeping things organized  i did take a star off however because my lid came cracked in   different places  not making it unusable  just hard to close at times   i decided not to return as it was more of a hassle  however the product is good  just the container is not as sturdy     
47,5.0,                       i love that it has so many more containers than the other storage container i had  they are easy to fill and easy to dispense just the number of drills you need  sturdy box and tight closure as well  it makes diamond painting so much easier  i would recommend it and or buy it again  if you do   d diamond paintings  you need this      
48,3.0,                       love the ease of switching out colors  saves a lot of time  not having to hunt for the right bag for a color you need   labeling is nice  easy to grab  etc   only problem is that the right latch on the box is broken  and actually missing a chunk  so it doesn t close on that side   otherwise  it s a great item to have for diamond painting fans      
49,4.0,                       i have done over a dozen painting and these little containers are a nice addition to my projects   i like having a large number   i deducted one star because several containers were broken but there were still enough left   the containers i ve been using are connected so having these being individual is a handy change      
50,1.0,                       i know accidents happen  but the hinges being such a thin plastic made this item very fragile  i just took it out of the package and inspected it cos the lid refused to close and found that the right hinge had been torn broken  not sure if it was the retailers fault or the way it was delivered but now i can t give this as a gift for my mom for christmas  i was hoping to not have to deal with the stress of a return refund but this isn t usable at all like this         
51,4.0,                       i guess i was thinking that the little flip top containers inside the box were more like tic tac size  but they re smaller than that  i could still fit most of the colors in one container per color  however  and there are a lot of containers  so i could make more than one color if i wanted to  i put my extras in baggies and worked them onto my diamond painting canvas first so i could keep it to one container per color   the included sticky tabs for the numbers is great  i bought a second box so i could have my round gems in one and my squares in another  but because of the size  i ll likely end up buying more  still  i like this better than others i ve seen around the web  i m not sorry i bought them         
52,4.0,                       it is as advertised  i think the box and the container are made a little flimsy for hands that don t have good grip  good product just not to my liking      
53,5.0,                       i needed some way to organize the diamond dots rather than the bags the kits provide  these are perfect  keeps the beads secure  easy to open and pour out when needed  and easy to put excess dots back when done  i use a small funnel but the tray provided works well also  and there is enough space for a small label on the top  the carrying case keeps everything together and in one spot  highly recommend      
54,5.0,                       i received my order in   days  the box was in perfect condition  i have used this type of container for years but was unable to find them locally  i use them for holding beads  over  grams will fit in each container  i especially like the carrying case  it locks closed so i don t worry about spilling them when i carry it  if you have trouble keeping the little labels on  just write on the box with a sharpe      
55,4.0,                       he product itself is good  it has a lot of containers and fits the beads  my only complaint is i received it broken  a latch is broken off  and the box is cracked  i d get a refund  but i have to send this one back  and honestly i m too lazy to do that photo of how it s broken is attached sturdier box would be nice  i m going to try and put these containers in something else      
56,4.0,                       these containers work very well with organizing my diamond dots and make it easier to use them  i didn t care for the labels that came with them  so i am using my own small return labels i get in sheets for my home office instead  otherwise  i am very satisfied with them      
57,5.0,                       this is by far my favorite organization container for diamond art dots  they are all separate  tik tak  containers so they can be filled in whatever number order  labeled with the little label stickers provided and then the containers can be rearranged in whatever order you want inside the box they are all stored in      
58,5.0,                       this helps keep my dots gems whatever you d like to call them organized  much easier than hassling with the baggies  pouring the excess back into the containers isn t perfect but doable  i m satisfied with the purchase and recommended them to my sister who has started  diamond painting       
59,1.0,                       original order arrived and the case was cracked  arranged for a replacement and return  replacement arrived damaged more significantly than the first item the product itself otherwise was exactly as i expected and i would have been very happy with the item the shipper should rethink the packaging used for shipping as it seems the bubble wrap envelope does not provide adequate protection      
60,5.0,                       it came exactly as described  the only thing  in my opinion  that would have made it better is if the containers stayed upright in the container after removing one or two from it  they tipped over for me  nothing spilled out  but made it challenging to stand upright for me not so nimble fingers      
61,5.0,                       i bought two of these and they are very nice and compact and holds lots of diamonds  the containers look smaller than they seem  one of my container came with a broken clasp and a crack on the side on it   but it s not really a big deal  i probably could have returned it but it still works perfectly fine      
62,5.0,                       arrived on time  i know the description says bead storage     but i used this storage container to store all my planting seeds  grabbed a permanent marker and cleared some space and got my seeds organized and easy to access  i love it  i need a couple more of these  one for me and another for my sister that i ve convinced to grow food      
63,4.0,                       do to the current situation with covid    this came later then was intended because our mail is very slow and behind other then that it s a great product very sturdy  has plenty of space for my hand to get each container out  for what i m using it for it holds   diamond paint projects and maybe a little more  it also has area i can put the pen and trays and still able to close the box      
64,5.0,                       i m really glad i bought this for my diamond painting and how easy it is to use and the the gems in and out of it  the stickers for labels are okay  i get that they don t need to be too sticky so you can change them whenever you need too but it can get annoying when they don t stay stuck at times  the individual containers are perfect and so nice to use  but the case is very thin and not even a full week after i received it the bottom cracked      
65,4.0,                       great for diamond painting drills   holds quite a bit   if your into diamond painting this is a must have to hold the overflow of drills   only thing that concerns me is how long will the snaps last on the box  they seem a little flimsy when you close the box      
66,1.0,                       thought this would be great for my diamond art drill pieces   but most dont stay shut or close tight enough   pieces end up in another coloer     
67,4.0,                       wanted to use for my garden seeds   each container is very small so can only use for tiny seeds   not what i expected  will use cause it s such a bother to return items   note   if your using for seeds  use the smaller seeds   beans  squash  zucchini  sunflower  and other larger seeds will require a larger container      
68,5.0,                       i am using this storage box to keep vegetable plant seeds for next year s plantings  it is working out very well  the boxes are easy to open and close  it is also easy to label them to identify what is in each box  i am very pleased with this purchase      
69,3.0,                       flimsy container   first one shipped was cracked so i returned it   the second one arrived and the lid doesn t close securely   my other container is much better and wish i would have bought another one of those   i don t recommend this product      
70,2.0,                       really disappointed in this box  the little containers aren t bad  but the big container is extremely flimsy  it would break with daily use  the latches are super thin and don t even latch correctly because the box itself is also very thin  sending back for refund      
71,5.0,                       we have purchased these three times from this seller and they have been great   on one occasion  one of the items was broken   we let the seller know and they replaced it within a couple of days   i was very impressed   we will continue to buy from them      
72,1.0,                       ordered twice and both came very broken  almost cut my hand open on the first one  one little box was completely shattered and the outer box was cracked in multiple places  the second one both clips were also broken  missing  loved the idea  but product was very poor     
73,5.0,                       these storage boxes are just what was needed  i purchased to store diamond dots  perfectly sized   they are easy to open  seeing your stored pieces is clear  very easy to store and stack  will definitely purchase again when i have filled these      
74,1.0,                       cracked within a week container won t stay closed they won t replace it and threatening people when contacted  also soliciting buying good reviews     
75,5.0,                       this storage kit has    containers and a plastic box to keep the    plastic storage containers  the tiny storage containers can store many different small items  i do plan to use this to store my resin diamonds from my diamond kits      
76,4.0,                       they were a little smaller than i expected but they still fit a lot of the gems in them  i bought a total of    so i will be able to organize them properly  they open and close easily by hand  and do not open on their own  the case is a easy to open and close also  they have a handle so you can carry them  however  i would not trust that  it seems a little thin  otherwise  great product and will purchase more when the need arises      
77,5.0,                       amazing box  if you are doing diamond painting   then don t start your picture until you have this storage box  it will save you time  nerves and drills  i ve heard so many stories with lost packages and spilled drill packages that i decided to have th is box first      
78,5.0,                       a lot of  tic tac  style containers are cloudy and don t show your product properly   these are perfect   nice and clear   very happy with my choice and the number of containers i received      
79,4.0,                       the case and individual containers are pretty decent   the only complaint is that the containers don t readily organize in the case   nothing to keep them aligned   however  they do the job and i like them      
80,5.0,                       use to hold the beads for my diamond pictures  lots of containers that lock and easy to use  comes with adhesive tabs to number the containers  i have bought   so far  great for holding small items      
81,5.0,                       this product makes my seed obsession extremely organized  i not have the ability to have them sorted out labeled and stored neatly  i showed this to the pepper freaks community on facebook and they love it  thank you      
82,1.0,                       very disappointed  my item arrived today and it was broken  will request for a replacement update  my replacement came  one of the box is once again broken  very upset  cheap product      
83,4.0,                       this case makes life much easier when your working on your project  the boxes are the size of tic tac boxes and are nicely held in a carrying case  it comes with the labels to number the tops  i really like using this product the reason for   rather than   stars is i find the labels want to peel off  nothing scotch tape can t fix though      
84,4.0,                       boxes work fine   one lid broke off but have enough to replace one   others may break with constant use but still worth the money   just buy a kit with more bottles than you need   carry case great to keep neat and consolidated      
85,5.0,                       boxes smaller then i expected but will be perfect for my diamond painting drills  came securely wrapped and well protected   nice and clear even has small blank number sheet to label boxes        
86,5.0,                       i am very satisfied with this product  customer service by this company is outstanding  i surely recommend this companies products  i will definitely purchase from them again      
87,4.0,                       i really like the idea of these containers  i ve been using them for drills for diamond art  and let me just start off by saying it would be great for a small project and not for a super huge project  some of the dots like to clean to the sides and it makes it a little difficult when you re almost done with the color  as for sturdiness    i had one that was already broken when i received it  which doesn t matter to me  it s just a small container      
88,3.0,                       i was disappointed in this because the latches didn t work very well and the little cases are crammed in there and more challenging to get in and out  the containers are a lot smaller than i had anticipated      
89,1.0,                       the lids don t stay closed and it s total junk      
90,5.0,                       i got sucked into diamond painting and needed a sturdier way to store all the dots   this keeps them all in one spot and organized   the cats can try to knock them off the table either individually or as the entire kit but they can t get in to ruin them   win      
91,3.0,                       received the item with the lid broken in two  sturdiness stinks and the price of the item is not worth that kind of money  however  the little  tic tac  holders for the  diamonds  are great and there s plenty of them  shipping was  quick and painless  too      
92,5.0,                       i finally found a drill holder that has enough containers for a large diamond painting project   definitely get small funnels for putting the drills in the containers   overall very pleased      
93,5.0,                       makes this so much easier to use and store my drills for diamond painting  very easy to load the drills into the containers and includes labels to put the numbers and symbols on      
94,2.0,                       box is warped  unfortunately this makes it unusable for what i need      
95,5.0,                       love this storage container to hold all my painting beads  they work great and easy to keep it all organized  i received my order quickly too  glad i made this purchase      
96,4.0,                       i was looking for a container that would work for my painting dots and this fit the bill   the only thing i would have liked is that the closure  snap  was stronger      
97,4.0,                       i would love to give   stars but the large compact box that holds the smaller containers are very hard to close  but i have had no flaws with the smaller containers  i love them  i bought this set after using a different type of container for my dp drills      
98,5.0,                       great organizer for my drills  sturdy  convenient and easy to transport  why didn t i get one of these sooner       
99,5.0,                       my package arrived a day earlier than anticipated  yay    it took me less than    minutes from opening the package and beginning to work on the picture  the storage container is wonderful   similar to a small one i have  but much larger  the only negative comment about it is that the little labels one can use came loose form their backing and i had labels all over the place frequently      
100,4.0,                       this case is perfect for sorting and storing diamond painting drills   i am so happy with my purchase   the only thing is one of the little inside boxes is missing      it must have been a manufacturer error      
101,3.0,                       i purchased this box to hold my diamonds for my diamond embroidery   for that purpose it works perfectly   however   i have only had the case for a few weeks and one of the closers has broken off on one side  i ve got a big rubber band keeping it closed for now until i can find a similar storage option from a different seller      
102,5.0,                       the containers are easy to open and fill   there are lots of stickers included so the beads can be labeled   the case is sturdy and it is easy to open the lid      
103,4.0,                       they are convenient but feel flimsy and don t hold enough dots  you can t also put them in the box all the same way as they won t stand upright good so you have to put them every other way  i m not too impressed with it and wish they held more dots and were sturdier  the lid feels like it might break overtime too      
104,5.0,                       these are perfect  fits into box nicely  labels for the top of each container  i buy the mega size diamond paintings and there s a lot of drills with those  i should have got this sooner  will be ordering more      
105,5.0,                       love these  they work so well   i only wish they were bigger  so i don t have to use   for the same one    but i also didn t read description very well   i would buy them again  i do love them     
106,5.0,                       this is the  rd storage container that i have purchased from this company and i highly recommend them   the individual containers work perfectly with my diamond painting drills   i will be purchasing again      
107,4.0,                       i love this box and it s super useful  the reason why i gave it   stars is because one of the little holders came very scratched up and the lid was missing  it s not enough for me to go through the whole return process and get a new one though  which is why i ve decided to review instead      
108,5.0,                       this is a really big container it holds so many beads so if you get a big diamond painting this works great plus it comes with a lot of stickers     
109,4.0,                       convenient storage for dp drills  but i thought the tic tac type dispensers would be a little bit bigger than they actually are   but still  good value for the    and serves the purpose that i bought it for      
110,5.0,                       exactly as described  works great for storing my beads  before this i was using zip lock bags and it was a mess      
111,5.0,                       i use this for my diamond drills and it s perfect  i don t have to worry about accidentally knocking them over and having diamonds everywhere  it s very convenient and portable too     
112,2.0,                       was excited to get this to organize the diamonds for paint with diamonds craft  many of the tic tac looking holders came broken  they are really small and it takes two to three to hold a large bag of diamonds  they are meant to only store the small bags      
113,3.0,                       the box that holds all the tic tac containers is cheap and worthless  love the containers though holding enough for   small diamond paintings if i could buy just the containers and not the box i would purchase more      
114,5.0,                       this is such a great product for my fellow diamond picture lovers    these are similar to tic tac boxes  easy to use and easy pour  i actually purchased another one after using the first one for a couple of days      
115,5.0,                       i just can t wait to start my next project of diamond painting because this will hold all of the drills needed for the project  no more misplacing the extra packets because they will all fit into these  tic tac  containers      
116,5.0,                       about time i got something  like this for my diamond dotting craft   this makes things so much easier to find   comes with labels to put on top of the container   i used pencil so i can erase it and use multiple time   perfect size containers and there are so many of them that you have more than enough     
117,5.0,                       i really liked the storage boxes  the boxes were a little smaller than expected but it did work surprisingly well  for some bigger paintings i would recommend getting a bigger one but other than that i really loved the product and it has helped me a lot on my beginner career  one thing i want to add is that all the lids closed very well so i do recommend this product for beginners      
118,1.0,                       bought this for my daughter  the product arrived from amazon broken  the clasps to lock down the lid were both broken off and the lid was cracked  it could have been damaged during shipping  the individual containers inside are nice  but would recommend storing them in another container  even though the damage might have occurred during shipping  i think the clasps would have eventually broke off anyway  not very good plastic  she will still use it  she just has to use a rubber band to keep it closed      
119,5.0,                       the product is great for little stuff specially when you are do the diamond painting like me it s easy to have all the little rhine stones in that little container because they look so organize      
120,5.0,                       my granddaughter has a craft project that uses a bazillion  jewels   this was just the ticket to keep everything corralled      
121,5.0,                       this is my third purchase of this organizer  it s a great thing to have to sort the drills for your diamond dots  stickers make it easy to label and organize      
122,5.0,                       i love the storage containers for the beads   easy to fill  easy to dump out whether one or lot  very sturdy and convenient      
123,5.0,                       arrived earlier than expected  not sure how i would ve done my project without the organization and ease of this product  definitely worth the purchase      
124,3.0,                       mine was broken when i received it  i was hoping the container would have been a bit bigger  even after checking the measurements but it was too small as well  rated low because it was damaged  overall i d say it would work if you re not storing items in bulk      
125,5.0,                       i mix these with harbor freight containers for diamond art projects  they are perfect for smaller amounts of drills     
126,5.0,                       diamond art painting is new to me and i love it   it is very relaxing and so fun to see end project   i always go all out when doing a new project and had to buy the diamond storage container   it is so functional in every way and a great way to keep bed colors separate and easy to use when a color is called for    very happy with this product and recommend to anyone who enjoys this beautiful art work as much as i do          
127,5.0,                       my daughter recently started doing diamond painting  and this storage container was perfect for her  she loved it  as it stored so many diamonds  yet small and compact for easy storage carrying   a must have for any diamond painters      
128,5.0,                       what i love about this box is there is    tictac size containers and two sheets of plain labels  each bag of beads are clearly marked with numbers  the box is very sturdy and it locks  which is wonderful i will definitely be getting another one just like this because i love the design in the sturdiness of it      
129,5.0,                       has a first time diamond art buyer i purchased this to store my diamonds  needless to say it made the work so much easier     
130,3.0,                       i am disappointed in the product  when it arrived the containers were turned in all different directions  i turned them all the same way and the lid will barely close  if you turn the containers back to all jumbled directions the lid fits  who wants to have to look at their numbers upside down      
131,5.0,                       i use these for delica seed beads   they hold    grams of size        you should test the tightness of the lids  i have had several become loose and spill in a plastic bag   the labels they provide are small but useful  these stack well  and have great visibility      
132,5.0,                       this box with    little boxes is the best way to store all my diamond painting drills   easy to use and a great price from this seller      
133,1.0,                       very disappointed carrier came broke   the box that it was delivered in was not dented or anything     
134,4.0,                       i love the concept of the  tic tac  spouts  my only issue with the product is that there were a few containers that were cracked down the side  not to the point where it s not usable  but they are cracked  as long as you do not squeeze  it should work out fine      
135,5.0,                       i use it to store my extra drills  that s great so that when you re working on a diamond painting if you have the color you want to switch out you ll always have extra but you can store in these cases     
136,5.0,                       i like these for their easy open and size  i use a funnel to put the diamonds back in which makes it super easy     
137,5.0,                       love this and i really wish i would have bought it years ago  i will be buying more for my collection      
138,3.0,                       i bought for my small beads but these are really tiny  not what i was looking for  good quality  just super small       
139,5.0,                       i am using this for diamond art gems   think of an old tic tac box   the work great   small size but hold a lot of beads or gems   great way to keep them organized while you are working and have them all at hand and nearby      
140,5.0,                       this container is perfect for the diamonds in the diamond painting projects   this is very sturdy  the tic tac holders inside had lids that seal nice and tight  so you won t spill anything   plus  the outside container has a tight sealing system too  it s perfect   the package arrived very well protected  and was shipped fast  thank you      
141,5.0,                       i like this system for organization   i am not sure how long it will last with these kind of flip top containers   but for now it is working great     
142,5.0,                       i used this for  d paint by numbers pieces  they work perfectly  the size of the individual containers is a little smaller than expected  but i don t mind that some of the colors with more pieces are split into    containers      
143,5.0,                       love that the labels are small enough to fit on     of lids for each container  have another one where the labels go across the complete top and rip as you open them up     
144,4.0,                       you can hold a lot of diamonds in it and i make jewelry so it holds a lot of the little  pieces that i use  i will be buying another one soon      
145,1.0,                       very cheaply made  not thrilled with this product  definitely not worth the money  it comes with stickers that do not stay on      
146,4.0,                       i really like them   great for storing diamond painting beads   a little bit on the smaller side but easy enough to use   for the same color if you have to      
147,4.0,                       i have just taken up the diamond art craft  i am normally a very detailed and organized person so this falls right into place for me      
148,5.0,                       was looking for something small for vegetable flower seeds to store in  each container is study and seals well  i recommend making sure your seeds are well dry or add some silicon beads decadents   small enough to fit in a drawer in the fridge if you prefer to keep your seeds cool  i posted this on a facebook gardening forum   so  if you get an influx of buys  your welcome      
149,3.0,                       the lid of the large container does not fit snug  several of the small containers came cracked  had to order a replacement to mix and match a full non broken set as the  nd set had cracked containers as well but once i got a full working set  work exactly as we wanted them to      
150,5.0,                       i use this for sorting and organizing my diamonds for diamond paintings  the sticker labels are super helpful and each little container is like a tic tac container  the covers easily pop off to pour all the diamonds into  i do wish they fit better into the case  it s a little sloppy  but works great and serves its purpose      
151,5.0,                       great product for the price  one downside is the plastic increases the static electricity making the transfer a bit difficult      
152,5.0,                       i have just started filling these up from containers i had bought before that wouldn t stay closed  these are so much better and i like the  tic tac  style opening because it makes it easy to just shake out a couple at a time  very happy with this purchase     
153,5.0,                       these are great for storing small diamonds until you are ready for them and storing for future use if necessary after a picture is completed  sometimes you run out and can go back and use extras all saved from another picture but they are all coded the same      
154,5.0,                       use this box for drills in my diamond painting  the opening in the individual boxes are a little small to pour the diamonds in without spilling  having the labels included is great      
155,5.0,                       great view of your stored items   going to order another one  over organized person     
156,5.0,                       my granddaughter is working on a diamond project and she loves this storage container   she said it was pretty sturdy      
157,5.0,                       i love this organizer   it has made my diamond painting a pleasure instead of a chore sorting diamonds   highly recommend this product   great seller and prompt delivery   thank you     
158,5.0,                       the tabs to close it are a little flimsy  but other then that great to use arrived  on time easy  to use great price  if your doing alot of diamond paintings this is really  convenient and helpful      
159,4.0,                       these are perfect for storing diamond dotz and beads  couldn t be happier  in fact  i intend to order more      
160,5.0,                       makes diamond painting so much easier   very easy to put the dots in and when done with the color can easily return to the individual container   so compact and small but very convenient   labels enclosed with storage box makes it easy to mark the containers   would recommend this product      
161,5.0,                       i love that the bead containers are separate from main suitcase   i only have to pull the number i want to use  not a whole row      
162,5.0,                       i haven t used it yet but my sister has ordered   now  so i m going to say it s great also     
163,4.0,                       an average product but fairly useful for intended application   opening on each box is small  easy to spill when filling      
164,5.0,                       very helpful  i use this for my diamond art and it really helps keep all the beads organized with stickers you can write the symbols on for each color bead and put onto the top of each individual container  the small opening is perfect for the tray to pour the diamonds back in      
165,5.0,                       i cannot wait to start using this  it is going to be so easy to keep all my diamonds neat and tidy in this kit  the cartridges feel very sturdy and have a good snap to them for closure  definitely better than the tiny bags most diamond kits usually come with      
166,2.0,                       the concept is great  would work great if it wasn t so cheaply made  the outside container is what is so cheaply designed   the locks broke after only use a couple of times   i was going to send back but window was closed  i wouldn t waste my money   try and find something sturdier      
167,5.0,                       this is very   very nice  the labels are great  they can be peeled off when needed without making a mess  the outer container closure just a little flimsy but overall good value and i would buy again  but i would make sure the cover is locked before carrying it  the little containers inside are very good and sturdy      
168,4.0,                       this is an easy way to store all the leftover diamond dotz from a project   i don t think the stickers will stay on the containers too long  so i used a sharpie to write the numbers directly on the containers   i do wish there had been a compartment to keep the tool  funnel  and wax so i could have everything in one location      
169,4.0,                       love this and works great for craft organizing   i wish the boxes would have columns to hold them in place but its great     
170,5.0,                       i m using these for my drills with  my diamond  paintings     perfect for what i need  fast shipping wonderful product     
171,4.0,                       i like it  the box that holds them is a little unsteady and the handle you need to be gentle with  but the containers our nice and for the money not bad at all      
172,5.0,                       the size of each container for the dotz is a good size  and the fact that they are not connected is a benefit for me      
173,4.0,                       these are nice containers  i like them except for the fact that they fall down in the box if you take   of the containers out  other than that they are worth it      
174,4.0,                       not all of the little containers snap closed as well as they should  most do and otherwise it s great      
175,5.0,                       i am so glad i chose this item it is so amazing and easy to use for gems  i am going to order a  nd one in a week or so just because it is so well put together and useful   the little containers are so versatile  if i go out or something i could put salt and pepper in them instead of carrying full salt and pepper or any other spices or a to go pill case      
176,5.0,                       great storage  container seems just a tad to small to close it  i think the labels could be bigger      
177,5.0,                       perfect exactly what i needed  the little containers remind me of tic tac containers   but i love it  will buy another if needed     
178,5.0,                       this thing is perfect for even large projects  i ordered a second one for my daughter to do her projects  the only negative i have is that the latches are a bit flimsy  it s just generally great though     
179,5.0,                       very helpful for these very tiny parts   only downside seems to be the stick on labels for the containers   they don t want to stay stuck on  might want a back up plan for that      
180,5.0,                       i have all of the mill hill beads and these are a perfect way to store them   the labels that are included fit perfectly and are easy to see   i bought   of them to hold my beads and i m very happy with them        
181,5.0,                       these are so nice  i use them to store small beads  i bought another brand   not good  the case latches solidly and all the cases are clear and nice      
182,2.0,                       do not buy this product  mine came busted up  the plastic is very brittle and mine was busted along both sides of the case  being shipped from china and obviously thrown around  i could not see the damage until i had totally unwrapped it so sending it back was not an option  the individual plastic holders were undamaged so i have to find something else to put them in      
183,2.0,                       love the concept   perfect for my diamond stones  one of the clasp  closure  tabs broke the first time i used it      
184,4.0,                       a few of the containers cracked as they are very thin plastic  i wish they were larger to hold more drills  overall very good design and easy to use store drills for diamond paintings      
185,3.0,                       way smaller than expected needs to be bigger can t get a full package of beads     
186,5.0,                       amazing  i use these to kit up my diamond painting i will be doing  very easy to use and the kids stay closed  easy to fill      
187,5.0,                       this organizer is perfect for diamond painting  i was worried the hinges wouldn t last but so far they ve been great  my only complaint is the stickers fall off      
188,5.0,                       smaller than i though  but they are great storage for small beads      
189,5.0,                       plenty of drills good quality granddaughter loves it   i even bought a second one as a gift for someone who is handicapped and needed a small project they could do     
190,1.0,                       cheap and junky  came with several holder s cracked  it s more cost and trouble to return then it s worth  do yourself a favor spend a few bucks more and get a better one      
191,5.0,                       the labels with this product are the perfect size   others are too large to use therefore useless for easy access      
192,5.0,                       this is a great way to keep your beads from spilling out everywhere      
193,5.0,                       i love these for storing my beads and using them for projects  very easy to use   the only negative is the clasps on the front of the big storage box could be a little sturdier  sometimes a little tricky to get closed all the way  but for the price of the item  i am very satisfied      
194,5.0,                       i use this for my diamond art paintings  it works well  keeps me very organized and make it much more enjoyable     
195,5.0,                       i have had several different types of containers for my paint with diamond beads over the last two years  i found that these are easier to use because you are only lifting one at a time out  the individual tops snap securely  i like this product so much i bought a second one      
196,5.0,                       i have now bought about eight of these  i mostly use them for seed beads or other beads  i like these much better than grid containers because you can take one bead style out at a time  the lids do you stay securely on and prevent spills      
197,5.0,                       i bought this specifically for diamond painting and am so glad that i did  makes finding the right color so much easier  i would recommend this to anyone who wants to do diamond painting as their hobby  would also be good for bead work

263,5.0,                       i use this for storing my diamond painting drills  i like that it came with labels too  it seems a little hard to snap shut but i believe once it gets used a few times it will make it easier  but granted if you drop the unopened container  you can guarantee nothing will fall out      
264,5.0,                       to organize beads for diamond painting      
265,3.0,                       the containers are kind of smsll and a little  flimsy   the handle on the box probably won t last long      
266,5.0,                       im so glad this productnis available  easy to use and the little containers dont spill     
267,3.0,                       these are so small and therefore very difficult to use with my diamond painting plastic diamonds     
268,5.0,                       love this as it is very easy to put my diamond dots inside and has lots of room  i bought   of these as i loved them that much      
269,5.0,                       love that it holds lots of beads   can be a bit hard to add beads to containers   i liked enough to order   more

271,5.0,                       like these better than a different type  takes up less space and very easy to use one handed  have   so far      
272,5.0,                       useful for extra dotts     
273,4.0,                       each individual box was easy to use  but there was nothing in the larger container to hold them in place  so if you removed one or two of the small boxes  the others have a tendency to fall over      
274,5.0,                       works great with diamond drills i need to order more     
275,1.0,                       broken right out of the box and it wasn t shipped witn anything hard      
276,4.0,                       does the job i need holding the beads   outside area could be a sturdier      
277,4.0,                       i loved the little containers  reminded of little tic tac boxes    easy to use disliked that there was not a divider between rows   when a container was removed everything would fall over   and the labels did not stick well   so i had to make some with my labeler otherwise i really loved the product and will order again when the first one gets full      
278,5.0,                       very easy to switch between colors

283,5.0,                       this was a great addition for my daughter to organize all the extra little diamonds for her diamond art  it is compact  stored away easily  loved that the individual compartments come out

286,3.0,                       cheep plastic  the lids break off the small containers located inside the case  labels do not stick well to the lid plastic as well and fall off mixing up your labels

288,5.0,                       i diamond paint  so the containers are used to hold my diamonds   i use them all of the time      
289,4.0,                       nice but doesn t hold much      
290,5.0,                       little tabs on the lids break very easily   have to be vary careful with them     
291,5.0,                       i m new to diamond painting and have found the storage box very convenient  especially when i needed to fill a few remaining diamonds that i missed   easy to find what you need with the labels and opening is large enough to grab just one diamond if needed      
292,5.0,                       it s compact  yet holds a lot of colors

502,5.0,                       the individual containers are smaller than i expected  but that is deceiving as they hold alot of drills  the locks on the cases are strong which should help me from dropping it and spreading drills everywhere

509,5.0,                       this is exactly what i needed  i use it for diamond art and it keeps all my beads organized and even my grandkids used them without a spill  i use the extra labels to put the symbols for my current project on the side of each container      
510,5.0,                       love all the individual containers to house your diamonds      
511,5.0,                       am so excited to be able to save space with your storage containers      
512,1.0,                       the tic tac containers are fine and easy to fill and open  but the case that holds them is completely useless considering it dont lock shut and needs tape to hold it closed  useless

517,5.0,                       i used one for diamond painting gems and my husband used one for seeds      
518,4.0,                       it s a good container to keep your extra diamonds but its little pricey for one container      
519,1.0,                       do not like the skinny containers  you remove one and they move around and fall over  they take time to straighten all the time

528,5.0,                       ordered this item to replace the kit i previously bought   this is a better item and at least it has labels to mark each item and they do not fall out of the case      
529,5.0,                       great set of products  especially for the price

536,5.0,                       i used it for storing my diamond dots  i haven t had it for long so not sure how long the plastic lid will hold up but hopefully for a long time  so far all is doing well      
537,5.0,                       for my diamond art     
538,5.0,                       the ease of working with the containers is perfect for diamond painting      
539,5.0,                       i haven t used the containers as of yet  but i do like how tall they are   which mean i can get more in each container      
540,5.0,                       perfect for sorting my little diamonds  i like this way more than the plastic bags that usually come with the kits      
541,4.0,                       i liked the convince of the containers and the size  easy to store away  container could be a little sturdier  i used it for diamond bits      
542,4.0,                       i hope it holds up   seems a little flimsy   the handle and latches are  very thin and i hope the tops for the diamonds cases don t disconnect   time will tell      
543,5.0,                       exactly what i was looking for at a reasonable price      
544,1.0,                       this product is very poor quality  not what i expected at all  the box will not even clasp closed  it is also much smaller than expected  it will not even hold as many beads as the one i use now  very disappointed         
545,5.0,                       i liked this storage container very much   the tops come off for easy filling  and snap back into place firmly for storage   i really think i will get a lot of use out of this product   thank you

552,5.0,                       i love it  especially the little labels that s it comes with to keep your numbers straight  especially if you have multiple diamond paintings to do

554,5.0,                       exactly what was advertised
