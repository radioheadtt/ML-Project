0,4.0,                       i m very happy with this hub   it s nice and small and works just great   i own a sabrent usb     hub as well  and my experience with it caused me to select sabrent for this purchase  too i would have given it   stars  but for one thing   the cable is very short  maybe a foot or so  which is great for laptops  but i m using it on a workstation tower that is located under my desk  so i had to get an extension cable for it   no biggie  and i wouldn t let that stop you from getting this unit note   i was having trouble with my logitech unifying receiver when it was plugged into the back of my tower  poor reception from mouse    i now have the receiver plugged into my sabrent hub  which is located on my desk s work surface  and it works great      
1,4.0,                       i have been looking for a usb hub for a while and none were the  bang for the buck  i thought they should be  i read the reviews and thought i would try this one it is nice  it works well and i have quickly filled up each port the disadvantage of this unit is the length of the cord that runs from the hub to the computer  it is very short  i use a laptop and this would be really great if the cord was longer and i could then velcro it onto the lid and when using  the hub is out of the way  i can t do that with this unit  that is a big drawback for me and i do mean big however  the price was more than fair for four ports if it had a longer cord  it would be perfect     
2,4.0,                       looks great and is exactly what i needed  only reason i gave   and not   stars is because sometimes the pc won t pick up the device plugged into the hub if you plug it in while the computer is running   plug everything you need into the hub and then start your computer to avoid any glitches   otherwise it s a great product      
3,2.0,                       one by one each leg went bad  only needed two outlets so it took a little while before completely worthless  but wouldn t buy again and certainly wouldn t recommend      
4,5.0,                       in regards to the sabrent   port hub with individual power switches and led lights is a great bargain  i have been using it with my lenovo ideapad  if anybody has one you know that there is a lack of usb ports like any other laptop i ve had no problems whatsoever  i attached a magnet from a old hdd so it can attached on the side of my metal cart desk and not be in the way  as far as transfer speed it does what says it does  solid device at a low price  very satisfied with this purchase      
5,5.0,                       i really like this product  i use the usb     hub as an on off switch for usb led lights mounted on my pull out keyboard and for switching between monitoring my two ups sources  the lighted switches are a nice touch  i use the usb   hub to disconnect my two usb     backup drives  flash drives  and card reader from my computer  that allows me to physically isolate my backup drives and thus better protect them from malware  i receive a notice from my calendar to reconnect the drive prior to my acronis backup  acronis      sends an email when the backup is complete  as a reminder to disconnect the backup drives  knowing that your backups are safe is truly priceless  and this is done with  remove hardware  followed by pressing a button      
6,5.0,                       very easy to use  just plug and go  cord could be a few inches longer  but still easy to use  lights let you know which port is active      
7,5.0,                       i use this product to hook up multiple usb devices to my laptop   mouse  keyboard  headphone i like the idea that i can push on and off the device when not in use without having to unplug the entire hub      
8,1.0,                       junk  it didn t even last   years  it was okay for the first   months or so  but then the usb cables that were plugged in would lose contact and weren t working properly  i would have to jiggle the wires for it to work  i would not recommend purchasing it  spend the extra     for a quality piece of equipment instead of this garbage      
9,5.0,                       not much to say other than it works quite well  it s been holding up for the past couple years i ve been using it  definitely recommended as a cheap  compact usb     hub  as other reviewers mentioned  it s a bit tight and you may need to pull a little harder to get the usb cable out  but i don t mind it too much      
10,5.0,                       i bought this product because usb     creates signal interference in the    ghz      ghz range  which happens to be the frequency that bluetooth and most wireless mouse and keyboard dongles use  so  if you plug those devices into a usb     plug  you are likely to get intermittent problems with those devices stuttering or not working  with this usb hub  and a usb extension  i am able to plug my wireless mouse  keyboard and bluetooth dongles in at a safe distance from the usb     ports  and alleviate that problem      
11,1.0,                       this was about as useful as a a block of wood in a steel factory  this would not charge anything that wasn t a simple device  iphone   no  ipad  no  basic headset  yes  but it charged slow  there is a place for a power supply that probably should have been included  this just was a vapid waste of money  thankfully i was able to return them for a full refund      
12,5.0,                       i ve been doing a lot of hybrid bible studies and i needed additional ports for my added microphones  cameras  etc  for my macbook air   this worked just as i needed it to  one thing to note  i couldn t use any of the usb ports on my macbook when i had this inserted  this was the only device i could use for ports      
13,5.0,                       it is just what i needed  and at a great price   my macbook only has two usb outlets and these days  with all the zoom for work  classes  etc   it became necessary to have more than two items plugged in at a time   external microphone  cooling pad for my older computer  the printer  ring light         now i don t have to unplug things  and that is a welcome help   i like that i can turn each slot on of off      
14,5.0,                       i have had a lot of issues with my work laptop not allowing or recognizing my devices with this working from home quarantine  this worked    it gives you extra usb ports which is amazing  this is a must buy        
15,4.0,                       very convenient usb hub  definitely needed it to use my usbs on the desktop computer which doesn t have enough built in ports for me  it s small enough to stay out of my way  the only thing about this hub is that with the type of usbs that i have  i can only use   at a time because my usbs are a little to wide to use all   ports  that s the only complaint i have   for me  the chord is just the right length  happy with my purchase  the price was excellent      i bought        
16,5.0,                       this is the  nd one i bought in a few years  reliable product  the first one still works fine  i needed a  nd one for work   the cord s length is perfect  not too long and short enough to my likings      
17,5.0,                       the   port charging station works well with the led light   charges fast   the only negative is the  ft cord   it cannot be moved or reached other than where it is located      
18,5.0,                       this product is super easy to use  plug it in and plug things into it and go  the cord is fairly short  which could be a problem if you need to connect it to the back  but its perfect for me   since i just ran out of usb ports  put a piece of tape on the bottom of it to stick it to the computer  and i m a happy guy  i especially like the individual power buttons for each slot     
19,5.0,                       because of my home office   studio setup  i needed usb ports in two locations  i purchased sabrent s     usb hub for my recording gear  webcam and game pads  and their     usb hub for my bluetooth mouse   keyboard dongle and printer the     and     hubs transfer data exceptionally well   no connectivity issues  lag  or playback issues whatsoever  having an on off switch per usb port is incredibly convenient due to the number of instruments and mics i use for recording  both hubs are the same size   they re slim   compact and easy to keep out of sight the sabrent     and     hubs together cost me     and transfer data for   devices simultaneously without a hitch  having two separate usb hubs allows me to keep all devices connected to my pc and in their proper place i couldn t be happier with these hubs  and highly recommend them      
20,5.0,                       the laptop i was issued from work only has one usb port   not handy   so a few months back i ordered a belkin usb       port ultra mini hub by belkin from amazon which didn t work very well for me   the things i had plugged in kept losing connectivity  i thought maybe that s just how good it was going to get since i d never used a hub before   however i got so frustrated that several weeks back i came back to amazon and ordered this sabrent   port usb     hub with individual power switches and leds and i can t believe the difference   i have not once lost connectivity with anything i plug into it    of the   hubs are currently being used and i m loving the fact that i don t have to work in frustration any more   i wish i d gotten this one first      
21,4.0,                       i was seeking to find a compact  self powered hub for travel  as the macboo k air is very limited on usb ports  and i ve been pleasantly surprised with this gem  it fits neatly into a pocket in my carry on bag  fits snugly in the port  and thus far has been completely foolproof with everything i ve plugged into it turning off and on of individual devices is nice  as well  however  if i were to have one suggestion  it would be for a longer cord on the unit itself  the short cable tends to place the hub in some very awkward positions  especially when using the laptop in clam shell mode  on a vertical stand   fantastic little budget port for travel  though    glad i purchased it      
22,5.0,                       i am a virtual teacher this year  i have my wireless mouse and document camera plugged into my computer daily  i recently purchased a wireless keyboard  i only have two usb ports on my computer  i use to have to unplug one device in order to make room for the other  this port has solved my problem and another tool to make virtual learning easier      
23,4.0,                       this is a dandy little   port hub  it takes up very little space on your desk and works just fine  i wish the cord was a little longer but still it is a very good value      
24,4.0,                       worked great for daily use connecting my flash drive  projection system  and pen tablet   after a year  it has failed   three of the four ports do not work   not sure why the middle port is still working  but useless now   i would buy another  but it could fail in   months        
25,5.0,                       this device works well  i have a couple midi keyboards  an audio interface  and external hardrive plugged into this that is plugged into my macbook via macbook usb adaptor      
26,5.0,                       it works  just be careful about using multiple devices with high power consumption do not attempt to put  like    hard drives on this thing  in fact  for something like a usb hdd  i wouldn t exceed one  they use considerably more power than something like a usb flash drive  which i think you could stack on without an issue i actually bought this for my raspberry pi  which is a device where you especially need to be conscious about the power consumption of the devices you plug in  but overall  it s a great item for cheap  the switches are a nice touch  with a nice blue glow  it s easy to control what devices are on  without having to unplug them  but do be sure to safely remove them before switching the power off      
27,5.0,                       i love this   port hub and it fits my needs to a t   i hate plugging chargers into the    volt plug in the ashtray  my car has an additional    volt plug in the boot so i plug this hub in that port and am able to plug my phone and my music usb drive into the port for playback in the car  i haven t found use for the other   ports yet but i like the convenience of the flexable cable that s long enough to rest comfortably on the floor of the boot without a bulky cable intruding into storage space   i only turn on the two needed ports and keep the other two turned off   it does everything i need it to do and because it is so light weight  i plan to purchase another one for my tablet dock  most multi port hubs i ve purchased would only allow me to use   ports at a time but not so with this one  when my friend s phone went dead on one of our out of state shopping trips  we were both able to charge our galaxy phones without any problems or decreased charging capacity      
28,5.0,                       i like that by adding   port usb to the new laptop     usb ports   one taken up with a wireless mouse  i can charge my earbuds  iphone  and still have   more ports if needed      
29,4.0,                       great accessory for laptops and portable systems  i use multiple of these to control speakers  headsets  and ham radio accessories on my laptops    i use a single usb port on the laptop and can freely activate  de activate  and swap the various adapter cables i need  also useful for powering on off usb accessories that don t have a switch of their own  speakers  etc    great for low speed  low power accessories and for providing just that little extra bit of standoff for flash drives if they came with some hook loop tape or some other adhesive  they d be a perfect        
30,4.0,                       i like that i can turn on any or all of the ports whiles leaving the others off  it is small  light  and well built  i would give   stars if the usb ports were slightly further apart  some flash drives are too wide to fit side by side on this      
31,5.0,                       this device has worked out better than expected having a laptop with limited usb ports i was looking for something like this and it has filled the bill  i have a wireless mouse which needed a port and a new cooling fan which also needed a usb port  and a portable drive my passport   so with all the demand this sabrent product has been a savior and works with all these units  i highly recommend this product and i was contacted by the company to see if i was having problems with their product not many companies go that to insure that their device is working to your satisfaction       
32,1.0,                       i have an extension cord from the outlet to my desk  i usually use a block and then charge my phone  thought this would be a great addition so i could charge multiple things  and it looks cool   but it didn t work      
33,5.0,                       i purchased this as my work lenovo laptop doesn t have enough ports   i needed the extra for a desk lamp and fan   need to be comfy while working from home   leaves   extra ports if i need to charge my phone  etc       
34,2.0,                       i needed a hub for my work computer and this had looked promising  i ve used it daily for the past few weeks and it started out great  however  the past few days i am  not having issues where it keeps randomly disconnecting and my computer gives me malfunction errors  this is a real bummer given that my bluetooth mouse and headset are run through it  i tried to save a few dollars and now i have to find another hub that works more consistently      
35,5.0,                       so far it works just as a usb hub should  the power buttons are a bonus  so the camera we use it for can easily be turned off when not in use without having to plug and unplug every time      
36,5.0,                       surprised by the compact size  this works well if you have limited space  like the on off feature  it allows you to plug in multiple flash drives  and select which you want to use  this hub has a good price  so far i am pleased with the performance      
37,4.0,                       i bought this to use on my xbox one  i needed it because the xbox only has one usb port  i have four different things plugged into it and they all had no problems being powered or connecting to the xbox  the different things i have connected to it is a keyboard i use to write messages  some games now allow the use of mouse and keyboard   a mouse  a charging cable for my controller  and an external hard drive for game storage      
38,5.0,                       i use wireless keyboard  mouse and a graphic pen tablet and some times an extra mouse  i have used another one and it was okay but this one is great  i like this one does not dangle off the tv tray that my laptop is on  the other one would dangle off and catch the attention of my kitten and did not need the aggravation of that  i like that this sits next to the computer and that you can turn off what you do not need at the time  i have never had one that you could turn on and off what you need  if you are looking for a very good usb hub then i would say get this one and you will not be sorry you have done  it works very well as the other one had issues after a month or so and of course was a good   inches long  this one is nice and short cord and is perfect      
39,5.0,                       i wish i would have had found this years ago  for years i have been constantly switching all my printers and devices throughout the day since i can only plug in two at a time on my computer  it was a frustrating  this thing is a lifesaver  i have all my devices plugged into it which uses one usb on my computer  and can use my phone charger in the other  perfect   if i ever need another one i will be back  thank you so much        
40,2.0,                       bought this specifically to add my apple iphone  says it works with apple  but after receiving and trying it does not  if you then look into the questions  it s clear it can be used with some apple products but does not charge apple products  that should be a heck of a lot clearer in the description  seems to work with other items  so it was inexpensive and i can use it elsewhere  but beware if you are wanting to use this with your iphone ipad      
41,5.0,                       not enough usb ports on laptop required an additional solution to connect variety of hard drives   devices works perfectly   the ability to turn the sockets on and off is a plus   arrived quickly and exactly as advertised      
42,5.0,                       very happy with the flexibility this device provides me for my applications  with all the devices requiring usb connectivity  our imac is out of usb ports  also  i use this hub to bring the usb access out in front of the computer where i can actually use the port without having to get in behind the mac to plug things in  very convenient  and welcome expanded usb capacity as well  everything i ve used with this device has worked so far   ie  iphone access  charge fitbit  charge tao bluetooth transmitter  and connect an external hard drive  i love this thing      
43,1.0,                       small package and individual switches are attractive  but was unreliable cutting out occasionally and both the pcs  win    i connected it to said there was an issue installing the driver i returned for which i had to pay the postage  for the    i got back i might as well have thrown it in the trash bought something much better instead  aukey  which arrived next day and works  this product was a waste of my time      
44,5.0,                       this product takes the usb power output from a single source and splits it into four outlets  servicing up to four devices  it has illuminated switches for each port   it is a simple device that costs little and works well      
45,5.0,                       i can t believe i never thought of buying one of these before  between the iphone charger  fitbit dongle  fitbit charger  external hard drive  and i m still using wired keyboard and mouse   i was always shuffling things in and out of the two available usb ports on the front of my computer   not anymore i haven t had any power issues  though i seldom use all of these things at once so maybe if i was syncing and charging my fit bit and iphone while also working on documents on the external hard drive it would be too much  but after three weeks of having this  i m just amazed i didn t think of it sooner      
46,1.0,                       the connection of the port to my surface   is very finicky   i have to have the unit positioned perfectly in order for the ports to work   strange thing is that once i plug it in i can tell that the ports are receiving power because it lights up  but the ports do not work until i find the perfect position   at the moment i have it plugged in and sitting on a scotch glass with happens to be the perfect height to give me a good connection   but if i bump the desk and the glass moves even slightly it will lose the connection and i will need to wiggle it around until i find a good spot again      
47,5.0,                       my pc needed additional usb  outlets so purchased this product and allows for the use of   addition outlets   each outlet has an on off switch  which makes it easy turn on and off as needed when using      
48,5.0,                       i chose the sabrent   port hub for a couple reasons  foremost is the size factor  i have a dell all in one     screen and fits well on my portable computer stand  very little space for extras  which is good as i am a stacker  the sabrent hub fits perfectly under the monitor making for easy access  the hub is light weight yet with enough heft to let you know this is not something slapped together to make a buck or two the second reason is price  with usb     becoming more prominent the     hubs are getting cheaper in order to clear out inventories  this hub was at my price point and i feel that i made a good and wise purchase      
49,5.0,                       i ordered this for the home computer which is my old laptop  then  liked it so much  we ordered another one for my laptop i use at school  i love that you can keep things plugged in and just turn off the port  and that there are blue indicator lights to let you know when a port is on  i have not noticed any power loss  and all our usb powered devices work well with this hub      
50,2.0,                       all looks as expected n now i need use it in order to give an informed review    thank you     smile        peace     v perez                 after use i find it to be very weak   does not work when more than   are plugged in  unable to fix it  conclusion  not working as sold to work or this one is broken     if not to late  replace or refund if applicable please v perez            
51,5.0,                       i ve been working remote for about   months and recently got equipment from my employer  the laptop only had two usb ports and with my dual monitor setup and various accessories  i needed more ports to accommodate them all  this was an affordable and easy fix and has met my needs tremendously  i now have enough usb ports available to accommodate everything at the same time      
52,5.0,                       i bought this for the new toshiba laptop i recently purchased  one thing i like about this usb extender  one aspect of this usb extender i like is the fact the usb connection thing is attached to a cord  other extenders i have had in the past simply have one that folds out  my laptop sits on a mounted fan to keep it cool and to help me work  so  this made it really head to plug it in and allow it to sit on my desk while i work i didn t know this before  but on top  you can see it in the picture  this usb extender has buttons over each of the ports  you press one of those buttons when you have a usb plugged into it so it activates  a blue light comes on to let you know that port is active  i love that  it s kind of cool since i do have quite a few computer items that tend to light up  so  that added to the little light show i have going on with my laptop it s pretty fast and transfers data just fine  perfect for being able to plug a bunch of things in at once      
53,3.0,                       pretty lights  a little bright   good design  but windows   kept telling me it wasn t      who am i to argue  went back to my amazon basics       amazonbasics usb       port ultra mini hub                        which windows seems to have embraced enthusiastically from day one update           was contacted by manufacturer s representative and we shared some email   i was impressed by sabrent s commitment to their product and to their customers and decided to try their product again as it stands  i was wrong about the hub  the issue windows was reporting was due to a problem i had with the usb port on my asus x   a notebook    the physical port itself was slightly malformed  causing problems with grounding  since rectifying this problem  the sabrent hub has performed flawlessly      
54,3.0,                       i needed this to be able to operate items like a logitech  d  pro joystick hp      webcam or the razer mouse that i ordered from amazon even if were the lone item selected no they would work through this item but if you want to charge four cell phones at once i have put my wireless logitech mouse on this bar makes for a nice tidy extension the company will probably think twice about thinking oh you have an inferior system     hp phoenix envy        qe is not inferior by any means i was hoping for a switchable outlet to be able to select not happening      
55,5.0,                       does exactly what it says  it is a usb hub  i haven t really taxed it too hard  but it s flawlessly performed with any number of devices i ve connected to it  i ve used it with several windows laptops  a macbook pro  and an imac and never had a problem  it was even supplying wired ethernet for the macbook through a usb ethernet adapter at the same time i was running a portable hard drive off it i had a few people go  where did you get that    since it is immediately apparent what its function is  they re even more shocked when they find it costs less than     the indicator leds are very bright  so you might not want it active while you re sleeping  bright blue led light everywhere   but i mostly use it at work anyway and it doesn t cause any problems      
56,5.0,                       i have ordered many of these usb  splitters  in the past  and been disappointed in all of them  usually they work at first them quit on me or stop doing what they should after a few hours  this is the first one i have ever gotten that actually keeps working and can handle   printers through   usb port  i run a zebra shipping label printer  commercial hp office printer scanner  canon food grade edible ink printer  and a primera lx     color label printer all through this usb splitter  it allows my computer to actually identify each one  almost better than my pc could when i was having to switch cables to use each one  i highly recommend  i cannot comment on the charging power for devices  but i imagine that wouldn t disappoint either      
57,5.0,                       this sabrent   port usb     hub with individual led lit power switches is perfect for me to use now that i must work from home   the cord is very short  too short  but that is my only compliant   the four power switches are nice   the product works excellently   my only negative comment is the cord is way too short overall  i would purchase this product again   good product for the price      
58,5.0,                       this little hub works great   i have plugged my miracast dongle into it and it powers it up just perfectly   i can also plug my phone into it and use it as a charging port   i plan to plug a bluetooth adapter receiver into it as well and hopefully turn my tv into a bluetooth capable tv   we ll see   either way this hub works as described and i love it s small  lightweight design      
59,5.0,                       works perfectly fine and no i m not a paid actor or bot  the usb works fine   got in perfect condition and in a box  opened it up plugged it in into my computer and it works perfectly with my keyboard and mouse  now i have more usb extra plugs for the future   i m very happy about this product   will probably buy another one in future once i run out of usb ports again        
60,3.0,                       for the price  this hub is pretty good  read and write speeds are really great  but if you move around a lot of data  you wanna look at the usb     version  the leds look very cool and the hub isn t as big as it looks in the pictures  it s   cm long and   cm wide  don t buy this if you want to charge things as well  it s a very slow charger update  it s been over two years since i had this product  the product definitely passed the electronics shelf life test  and for that  i m tempted to give this product   out of   stars  but i m hesitant because of the charging issue  i ve tried to test this product with various electronics to see if perhaps it could charge them well  with the iphone  s plus  the samsung galaxy tab s   and even bose qc  s  the devices just simply refused to be charged by this hub  read write speeds are also pretty mediocre  for now  this product serves as a connection hub for my laptop  by this  i mean i ve connected a usb fan  works   a wireless mouse  a wireless keyboard and my printer  i tried to use this hub to transfer files from my laptop to a usb flashdrive  and found it ineffective and slow and rely on my laptop s usb ports instead all in all  final recommendation  buy this product if you re looking for extra ports to connect wireless keyboards mice  usb fans  printers or other peripherals  would      not recommend this device for device charging or file tranfers      
61,5.0,                       there isnt anything to dislike so far   its doing what it s suppose to be doing and helped me out a bunch as far as keeping thinigs plugged up   i love that i can turn the ports off that are not in use   i would buy again if i needed one for another comp       
62,2.0,                       update it has been just a few months and i have now begun to experience disconnection problems with this usb hub  it started   days ago while trying to import pictures off of an sd card  i used it again a moment ago and had th re some problem while transferring a larger file  by larger i mean about   gb  i ended up having to use a different hub to transfer the file  the hub hasn t left our desk  it hasn t been pulled on excessively   in fact  we have barely used it at all  we got about   months of light use out of this usb hub  i don t know if that would have been less had i been using this particular hub with my portable office   at this point i can not recommend this hub to anyone  look elsewhere  i am now going to replace this hub changed from   star to   stars    stars for the pretty blue lights i haven t had any trouble with this hub  works as it should and the lights are helpful when i pay attention to them      
63,5.0,                       my computer doesn t have enough usb ports for everything that i want to plug into it  i got this little gem  and i am really happy with it  the best part of it is this  it has about a     cord from the usb plug to the   port hub  this means that there isn t any weight on the plug itself  the cord stays plugged in perfectly      
64,4.0,                       i have a laptop with only   usb ports  but when i have my fan  my portable mouse  my external hard drive  that s three spots right there  sometimes in need to plug my ipod in to charge it  or attach my phone to transfer files  i ve noticed with the ipod it tends to not upload the album covers  and my external hard drive doesn t quite fit the plug in s so i still manage to plug those two things into the laptop  but the portable mouse  the fan  and my phone all plug in nicely through this little   port usb port this is my second purchase of this item because after owning the first one for a little over a year  the little white parts that the cords plug into fall out an the port it belonged to becomes unusable      
65,5.0,                       this has survived over five spills and is incredibly convenient for my poorly designed hp pavilions usb port only located under the monitor  completely out of view  and impossible to use with any usb attachment longer than   cm  basically any usb  this little guy doesnt save superior bus ports  no midi or usbmidi  but it does a great job with devices requiring drivers  data sticks to transfer files  phone connections  android bridge debugging software etc  a      
66,4.0,                       i m an imac user  i love the design of the imac  but hate that the usb ports are all rearward facing  i figured i could remedy this with a cheap accessory like this sabrent usb hub  which i purchased and taped with  m double sided tape to the underside of the imac with the ports facing forwards it works great  i love how you can turn on only the ports you re currently using with the touch of a button  the blue leds clearly indicate which slots are active  a minor complaint is that there s no way to turn the leds off except by disabling the port  which sucks a little bit and costs the hub   star  but wouldn t stop me from purchasing this item again   the transfer speeds are fast via      and my devices are always recognized in osx  perfect compatibility   just the way a usb hub should work  it even provides enough power to charge my iphone   ipad   would recommend  perfect purchase if a  you re looking to relocate usb ports to the front of your computer or b  you just want to expand your connectivity options  looks great  too  with excellent build construction      
67,5.0,                       works great as a   port usb extender  the lighted on off button per port is an added bonus   i have connected web cam  presentation pointer dongle   and flashdrive  i purchased a second one to use with my work laptop      
68,4.0,                       i bought this so i can switch my music thumb drives in the car  my wife s verbatim drive comes apart when ever its removed  so i didn t think it would last very long if i kept on removing it to listen to the music that i like   it makes things convenient when you don t have to look for your drive   i looked for a two port model  but couldn t find one  this works very well for my purpose      
69,5.0,                       this is an amazing product  just what i needed  and works just how i thought the buttons and lights work perfectly  button is pressed and light is on  showing usb is attached the cord length is on the shorter side  i dont fully mind  but longer would have been a little bit nicer this does not charge required items  aka keyboard  controller  etc  this product only works with usbs  and does not work for anything that needs power from the pc to function      
70,5.0,                       i m sure many of you have multiple laptops that get used in your house  just like we do i have a macbook  my husband has a work laptop  and his personal laptop  we have one desk with a monitor  printer  keyboard  and mouse in our house i bought this so that we can each walk up to the desk  plug in one usb hub and connect to our mouse  keyboard  and printer it doesn t matter if we re using a mac or a pc  the unit works perfectly  just as described it s a great plug n play product that helps us in a very practical way with each of our laptops  katie     
71,5.0,                       the usb port lights up when you are using the port and then it s off when you don t use it  the buttons make it really easy to use  i don t use it for charging but for plugging in other computer items and it s been working great so far  and then i can just click off the port i don t need when i shut down  like speakers or my mouse      
72,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          so far so good   works well  does not get hot at all  i read posts about them getting hot    all of the plug ins ports work  i have my interface  two hard drives  and my iphone plugged in   i use them all day long have for the past couple of weeks since i got it and doing great   the buttons are smooth and easy to press   oooooooonly thing is         the port is a little tight so you have to push your usb  in and pull out  a little harder than normal       but not that much    it s just noticable tighter if what i wrote was at all helpful please click so below so i know this helps others   thanx     
73,4.0,                       very good for the price   you can put it on either side of the laptop without it getting in your way   you can turn off the ports you are not using   i like it a lot      
74,5.0,                       the buttons allow me to have different usb headphones speakers plugged in at the same time and just turn one or the other off without having to plug or unplug the device   that turned out to be much more useful than i expected also i was using a mouse jiggler  which caused some boot issues with my surface pro  not recognizing the keyboard upon boot    simple solution  turn it off  boot  and turn it back on      
75,5.0,                       i had purchased a new laptop without realizing it only had two usb ports when i was use to having four   i needed those extra ports for my mouse and keyboard   this option has proven quite effective   yes  the cord could stand to be a little longer  but i m making it work   i haven t used it to charge anything yet  so i can t say anything about that  but for what i ve used it for it s perfect   i do like the fact that you can turn off the ports not in use      
76,4.0,                       this product works well for the most part   i connected it to a usb extension cord and use it with my new usb keyboard  which works well with rapid response   what surprises me  however  is that my usb thumb drive does not get recognized at all when connected to this hub  but works well when connected to the usb extension directly   i don t know what the problem is but it still is working for what it was originally purchased   easy connections and secure unlike many usb s that easily disconnect with movement   good product      
77,4.0,                       so far  so good  it looks a bit flimsy  but then all of those little things tend to feel that way because it s plastic  so far  it works great  and looks really pretty with the lights on i deduced one star because the buttons get stuck sometimes when you press them down  but it doesn t detracts from the device functioning  and you can easily unstuck them with your nail  it s nice that you have the option to switch it off or on with the buttons i ll try to remember to update the review if it stops working at some point down the line  but for now i ve had it for   or   weeks and it s working great  fast and reliable      
78,4.0,                       i have researched many usb ports to use for my macbook pro  and i believe all that research has paid off  this device is so useful for a laptop with only   ports and definitely brings a lot for how much i paid for the small port  the sleek device is pretty easy to use and it works perfectly  none of the connections have been questionable after   months from buying it and it still works as smoothly as day    the only complaints i do have about the product is about the cable and the led buttons the cable seems very flimsy and could break if it s suddenly pulled  which makes me nervous sometimes when my cat gets near it  the buttons work great and give a satisfying  but small  click and is accompanied by a blue led to let you know that the port is active  the problem is that the leds sort of  bleed  through to the next port and makes it confusing to see which one is actually active  clicking one of the middle buttons would confuse me on if the adjacent buttons were lit or not and was a hassle sometimes overall  the device looks great on your desk and is perfect for travel due to it s small size  just be careful with the small cable and don t give it too much stress  i would definitely buy this again  or even the     model  for the price  performance  and sleek design      
79,5.0,                       purchased this to add functionality to an older laptop with one usb slot  this works great and allows me much more functionality on my old repurposed laptop      
80,1.0,                       i was so excited when i purchased this product thinking it would solve my usb shortage issue  it worked fine for the first hour  then it started disconnecting from my computer automatically  then reconnecting  and disconnecting  this can go on for over a minute if i don t put a stop to it by yanking the usb out of the port of my laptop  my fear is that with it disconnecting automatically without permission  it will probably mess up the files on my flash drive  i give this   star      
81,5.0,                       for some reason  most of my laptops  i have    only come with     usb ports  which is really frustrating considering i need to use a wireless mouse mic camera sd reader etc  there are never enough ports  so i decided to buy this affordable hub as a way to simplify my work and i am so glad i did  i even bought more hubs for my desktops because i love the feature of being able to shut off certain devices with the push of a button  i think the cord could be a little bit longer  but i really can t complain  the device works great      
82,5.0,                       not sure what the caption camera quality referred to  but overall it powers my hardware from my computer very well and i am very satisfied with the small design and effectiveness of the device  i ll hook more up to it later  it s great for those people who use macs for they are notorious for not having many usb ports      
83,5.0,                       this is the first usb hub i have purchased that does not have a separate power supply   it works just fine on an old dell m     laptop running vista and it is much more convenient  useful   the wireless mouse and keyboard connect and work just fine running through the hub   i don t really care about the power switches on each port but since they are there i have turned off the two unused ports   i don t understand the infatuation the designers  of all electronics  have with the blue lighting   in a darkened room it is totally annoying   i put the hub in a small cloth bag with a drawstring to resolve the issue of the blue lights   still gets   stars and a strong recommendation      
84,5.0,                       love how i m able to connect this easily to my computer  worth the price  love how i can utilize various usb at the same time  this has made my life easier      
85,2.0,                       i got this to watch my movies and such from flash drives on my tv cause i got tired of going in back of tv to switch out drives  but i can only put   in at a time instead of   cause ports are to close  i have all sandisk and pny flash drives and cant fit them in ports next to each other  other then that it works great     
86,5.0,                       i received this as a x mas gift   it offers additional usb ports to my laptop   the led lighting adds a cool effect to the hub as an on   off option   i like this hub      
87,3.0,                       with my husband and i both needing to charge our cell phones  kindles  ipad  etc  at the same time when traveling  we run short of easy to reach outlets  so this will help solve the problem   we are also preparing to travel out of the country  and i have one outlet converter plug for the country we are going to   hopefully no problem  we can charge   devices with this handy  helpful usb hub update i recently used it in new zealand with an adapter i had purchased and was disappointed  it was so slow charging devices that i ended up getting more adapters to charge devices individually  i have not used it since      
88,5.0,                         use to switch on and off small low speed  low power devices  led lights in the buttons shows which devices are active  adequate build quality and a great value even compared to small hubs without switches and lights     
89,5.0,                       i dont like having things plugged into the front of my pc  picked this up  since i only needed   additional usb port and it did the trick  low cost but good quality      
90,4.0,                       i was thinking the switches were rocker type not push on   off  but with that said it seems to be working good so far  so i ll repost another review after i ve used it a bit more      
91,4.0,                       this usb hub is great  the only problem is the cord needs to be longer   this usb hub is not made to charge batteries  it s only use is for data transfer  such as back up hard drives  printers  etc      
92,3.0,                       this is slow charger and doesn t work on certain items  wish that would have been more clear in description  in addition  the buttons are easy to hit so you accidentally turn it off  now i have to buy new product that actually charges so this was a waste     
93,5.0,                       whoever designed my new hp computer put all the usb ports on the back  making them impossible to reach without pulling the monitor out   this little gadget fixed that problem quickly and with style   now i have four usbs right near my keyboard where they belong   good quality  excellent value for money      
94,5.0,                       works great  my friend even bought one and his works great too  it does what it says  gives you   ports in the space of one  i love the fact that you can use the switches to individual turn on off as many ports as you want  it does not come with a power supply so it is drawing power from your computer usb port  with that in mind be careful of what you attached it  if you plug in several power hungry devices  eg a phone  external   tablet  etc  and turn on all of them one time it will overwhelm the system and cause it to shutdown the ports for regular use with flash drives and lightweight stuff like that it functions very well      
95,5.0,                       i have a few of these and they have worked really well  i like that i can turn off power individually  i have a string of lights in my window that is usb powered  so i use this hub and just turn off the power to the lights via the hub when i am not using them      
96,5.0,                       this sabrent   port usb     hub with individual power switches and leds  hb umls  is just exactly what i needed   i got a new computer for christmas and it is made for travel and on the go  but it does not have enough usb ports for everyday use  such as for a printer or whatever i need to hook up to it   i am using this computer on the go system for everyday use as a desktop computer  so i needed more usb ports   love it  just what i was looking for at a very good price   thank you sabrent      
97,5.0,                       i bought this because my laptop s usb ports are too close together and the things i need to plug in are not slim  with this  the wide plugs fit comfortably next to the slim plus  though i doubt two wides would play nicely together  i have not noticed any decrease in the performance of my headset or mouse from being plugged into this intermediary compared to directly into the computer      
98,5.0,                       overall  this product is great   it does what it has to do pros build  it is built well and sturdy   it feels like it can handle a beating   it s strong yet lightweight   the cord feels thick and i doubt it tears easily with constant maneuvering function  works perfectly   plug it into your computer and then plug whatever usb devices you need to   there is an led blue glow around the buttons switches which turn on when the corresponding usb port is activated   the glow disappears when it is switched off compatibility  so far  every usb device has connected without any difficulty   connection remains strong without disconnecting randomly cons buttons can easily be pressed   there is basically no security measure to prevent it from being pressed accidentally   it s not a big thing but it s definitely something you wouldn t want to happen  especially if you re doing something like playing games      
99,5.0,                       i bought this hub to provide low profile usb connections between my auxiliary devices and my laptop  it works well  i like the ability to turn devices on and off at the hub  the cord is short  so the hub is right next to my laptop  it provides a better connection to my printer and cricut than the usb slot on the pc does      
100,5.0,                       so i used mine to plug into my tv so i could plug in my led strip and neon sign  works great  doesn t get hot  and all the lights shine bright  purchasing another for my computer      
101,1.0,                       i barely used this usb hub  bought it for my car originally and turned out that i didn t drive much living in brooklyn ny  i think it was about    months after the purchase  the hub stopped working  the led lights were and are still on  but it wouldn t charge my phone or any type of device  not sure about other   start reviews  maybe this is one in a million bad product occurrence      
102,5.0,                       so far this is working great   if you have multiple items to plug in to your computer  and you don t have enough usb ports  this is perfect   i get tired of unplugging things then having to plug in again  what i like most about it  is the fact that it has buttons to turn an item off   like my camera for my desktop   i can leave it plugged in  but i can turn it off when i am not using it   so far great item for me     
103,4.0,                       convenient and easy to use i have a surface pro with only one usb port   i am so glad i bought this   port usb hub   i can attach my printer  my    key pad  and an external hard drive and leave it plugged in instead of having to keep switching them out   the buttons are also convenient   when i want to eject my external hard drive from my computer  i can simply click the button to turn off that port after ejecting it   my external hard drive can still be attached physically  but its port is turned off small improvement suggestion the only thing i would like to see different about this product is a longer cord   i was aware of the length at the time of purchase    but it would help if it was just a bit longer by a few more inches overall i would buy this product again      
104,3.0,                       wanted to love this usb hub from all the positive reviews but once i received mine i quickly connected it to a wall outlet cause nothing gives better power consumption than when using a wall connection  anyway i love how it allows me to power each one on or off and shows a cool blue light when it s charging but it doesn t charge any faster than if i was charging it off my computer and it s connected right to a wall plug so don t know if i have a defective unit or what  i will give it a few more days to see if charging improves with my devices otherwise i am returning for a refund      
105,5.0,                       i love this switch for the simple fact that it has a power switch for each usb port  each switch is lit up when powered on which is very good for determing what is drawing power i use this hub for my  d printer  i have the printer plugged in as well as two web cams  whenever i want to begin printing  i just go turn the three ports on that i need and get to work  this allows me to leave everything connected to my computer without being powered on  i run both webcam feeds through this usb hub and have absolutely no issues  the hub doesn t need an external power source which is even better the cord is a little bit short  but i had plenty of usb extension cords that i could use since my  d printer is about ten feet from my computer the price of this usb hub is fantastic and it works very well  i will certainly be buying more      
106,3.0,                       when i first using this product  i thought my phone has a problem  not this product  but it turned out that this product takes way longer time to charge my devices like two or three more times is needed  i did not return it becaus it works although it takes forever to charge my phone   i actually don t use it now  but i am still keeping it because for trip  its better than nothing i guess and it is really cheap so          
107,1.0,                       maybe i just got a faulty one  but it quit working not long after i received it  but the return window was closed   it seems to have a short in it   i plug it in and hear it connect on  then off  then on  then off     very annoying   if it worked  i would love it   my new computer is small with only   usb ports  and i need a switch   i thought i d write a review of my experience  and look for a replacement device   the idea is great  but it could cause damage to external hard drives or flash drives   occasionally i have to restart my computer  because this devices  on  off  on  off  causes this error    driver power state failure    hopefully they will improve their manufacturing of these devices   until then  i cannot recommend this      
108,3.0,                       this thing doesn t do a fantastic job on its own  usb     standards dictate that a unit can deliver    ma of current on average  and up to    ma of current if the unit sends a request  and the host allows it  now downstream if you have no power for your usb hub  you can only deliver    ma per usb slot  so if your devices are not playing nice you may have dropouts in the usb hub  adding a power supply would fix this  but the power jack on the side appears to be non standard  if you want a usb hub  i suggest spending a bit more and finding one that is powered  you will have fewer problems      
109,5.0,                       i have a problem with usb ports on my laptop that has space in between ports too tight that i can hardly use both ports at same time  not with this unit  besides giving more ports to use  spaces between ports are not so close  not so far  and allowing me to use all ports at one time with ease  the on off button is also convenient  if i want to connect or disconnect a drive  i just select the associated button and press it  i do not have to keep removing and reinserting the drives unless i need to carry them on a trip  the buttons are distanced enough for who with fat fingers i might have one concern that the on off switch is a little too soft to toggle  i have a cat which uses to hang around my laptop  i am afraid some day she is curious enough to tap on the blue light  button  while the device is in use  that might cause damage to files being written  i find a small hard plastic cover to place over the buttons to protect them from possible accident  if the company could modify the switch to avoid accidentally turning off the device  i would give the product    stars      
110,5.0,                       works well   lights up cool blue and can turn off each channel separately so you don t need to keep plugging and unplugging cords   definitely worth the money and i would recommend      
111,5.0,                       the product arrived quickly and i put it to use straight away  although no instructions came with them  i was pretty confused about how it worked  specifically the buttons on the top  but after plugging it in and testing it out  i realized that they were used to eject turn off the usb connection to the cable  i have plugged my keyboard and mouse into it and i have to say that it works perfectly  the connection is stable and there are no issues with a lag behind mouse movements or keyboard presses      
112,5.0,                       love it    i run the usb from the back of the computer and taped it on the desk in front  so i can change plugs very easy and the power seams great nothing says low charge when there plugged in  plus it lights up blue my favorite color  ksw     
113,5.0,                       i was amazed at the quality of this unit   and i m a gadget freak   it has solid usb connections  nothing loose and cheesy about it  i attached it to the face of my tower pc with mounting tape  looks and functions very solid  i m an amateur photographer and am constantly disconnecting one to use it for something else  having this has saved me a great deal of frustration  i can even leave the cables plugged into the hub and just power off the l e d  power switches  so now i don t need to hunt for cables  i m using it full time now for a month and have had no problems whatsoever  i m very glad i got over some of the  if y  reviews and bought this      
114,5.0,                       we needed this item for another hub to plug our webcam into   it is reasonably priced and works well  i ve never used it to charge anything yet and that is why i gave charging power a  rating      
115,3.0,                       i actually like this hub  it s nice to be able to turn the power on or off to each individual device that i m charging  that comes in handy as the usb from my computer seems to not be able to support more than   maybe   of them being turned on without locking up the laptop  when i say  locking up  i mean that the mouse  also usb device plugged into another port  quits working until you shut off one of the charging ports on the hub is this the device s fault  i can t be sure if it s my computer or if it s because of the device  however  on the information provided from the seller there is no mention of this as a possibility to be aware of the cord is very short and just barely long enough to put the port behind the laptop instead of having it sit on the keyboard perhaps a better solution would be to charge a battery pack and attach the hub to that pack to charge multiple devices  maybe i ll give that a try      
116,3.0,                       the product is sleek and probably works fine for most things  but i purchased this product to plug into my tv to power a light strip and my roku stick  when i have both on  the hub does not have the ability to power both and the roku turns off  will be returning in hopes i can find one with a higher voltage capacity  but otherwise  the product works fine with only one thing plugged into it      
117,5.0,                       i love to be able to turn the ports on and off  four flash drives is a pretty tight fit  but it does work  lap tops and computers keep reducing the number of usb ports  this is a must for people who need to store information in various places  i like it because if i get lost on which usb holds what information  i just shut a port down and watch the drive disappear  you may not understand what i mean  but if you buy this  you will      
118,5.0,                       sometimes i think up ideas for products and am delighted to discover that they already exist  this was the case for the sabrent   port usb hub  this little friend does an exceptional job at powering my multiple laptop accessories  mouse  speaker  external keyboard  and more  i love the ability to switch ports on and off as needed high quality at a low price makes this useful accessory a must have      
119,1.0,                       i was having problems with my wifi dropping out randomly  sometimes for a fraction of a second  sometimes completely  see photo   i thought it was my wifi adapter  so i bought a new one  initially that seemed to do the trick  but then later i saw suggested items including versions of this very usb hub  except by maybe   or   different companies  then my wheels started turning  i looked at the reviews for them and saw an issue come up again and again in the reviews  people using those hubs had trouble transferring large files to from external storage  thumb drives  external hard drives  etc   so i did an experiment  i plugged the new wifi into this hub  plugged the old wifi directly into the computer  and ran a continuous ping with each  one at a time  not both at once   sure enough  the new one gave results that look like the photo  and the old one was smooth sailing  not a single return slower than   ms  so clearly this hub was the culprit  i didn t seem to have this problem when i got it in march  and it started acting up in mid july  i d give this   stars but people aren t going to buy a hub unless they re going to be transferring data  wifi  hd  flash keychain  etc  and even at this price range that s not something you want to have working when it feels like it      
120,5.0,                       my first usb hub and it is working out great  a very useful product and really comes in handy with all the electronics around these days  and saves wear on those usb ports  i should not have waited so long to get one but i am a procrastinator  i only have two ports on the front of my  desktop computer and one of those is worn out and plugging into the  back is too out of the way for me to deal with since purchasing this hub and plugging in to my computer it has really been a lot easier for me to keep things charged and ready when i want them it  i am a slow adapter to technology but in the past year i have  started to gain some ground  getting several portable items that need  charging quite often  my computer is a window     and this hub works  with it i love that there are light indicators to turn on and off the individual ports  i hope that i have helped you decide if you would like this product  it is working great for me  i used it to upload the pictures from my camera  purchased this item from store pc      
121,4.0,                       i like this hub for what it s suppose to do    connect other peripherals  i liked the buttons to turn on off the individual ports  but i don t think it was necessary after using it a few times  for one  i kept forgetting to push it on  which made me wonder why i couldn t see my external hd  doh   so most of the time i just leave it in the on position  so far it has been doing well for the last month  just had issues with just using it as a multiple charging port when plugged into a wall socket for phone and ipad  it charged only one at a time at a slow rate  also the cord is very short  another foot would have been useful      
122,1.0,                       my first sabrent hub worked fine for a year or more but then started sporadically cutting out whenever it got jostled  i bought another and that one cuts out  sometimes several times a minute  even when i m nowhere near it   i thought is was my computer until i tried each of the attached devices separately   it s the hub and it s no good      
123,2.0,                       this product seemed like the best way to extend my   built in usb ports  however upon arrival i discovered it one of the buttons was already depressed  so no i have to push it down below the case to turn it off  fortunately  it still turns on and off  and in general due to the poor quality i am constantly nervous the buttons will break as they feel like they are always there right out of the case  all that aside  leaving them on  and just letting it sit and due its job  that it does just fine  if you plan to use the on off feature  not the item to buy  if you want something cheep you can turn on and leave  but not planning on moving or taking are abuse then this might be okay   i should note  that i have tried   other brands with a range of results  in the case of these style items  you get what you pay for and you will need to spend some money if you want something reasonably sized   this is a very small item  which will take any wear and tear as it where      
124,5.0,                       i purchased this port to hook up my external keyboard  wireless mouse  and fan for my laptop  works perfectly  i love how the ports not in use can be turned off  i love this one so well that i purchased a second port for my xbox external hard drive and battery charger my only complaint  the cord could be a little longer     
125,5.0,                       this product was recommended to me by my niece who is working from home   i needed to open and download a data stick and still use my wireless mouse  voila  this was a great solve      
126,5.0,                       my desktop computers hard drive recently took permanent leave so when i got it rebuilt i noticed my pci card that was a hub for   usb slots no longer worked either  i done the natural thing and turned to amazon  read the reviews and settled on the sabrent   port     model and as usual it arrived in two days and saved the day  all of my morher boards usb slots were busy so now i can plug in my backup hard drive  flash drives and thanks to sabrent i can switch power on and off at will  i doesn t get any better  thanks sabrent and amazon      
127,5.0,                       this is a really convenient little hub  it takes very little room  the cord is not so short that it s frustrating to actually use  and the small led s are a pleasant shade of blue  the off on feature of each port light is a nice touch  it seems sturdy and well made it s always good to have a hub or two handy  almost everything is a plug and play these days  it just makes sense to be prepared for multiple devices used simultaneously  as hubs go  this one isn t disappointing  its almost elegant in its simplicity  actually      
128,5.0,                       although this was ordered by mistake  i actually needed an hdmi hub   at this low price  i decided to keep it   with both back usb ports in use on my small no physical drive pc  i was able to use this hub in one of the front ones   with this hub  i was able to plug in a portable cd rom drive  two flash drives and a portable hard drive   and the real beauty is each port has its own on off switch  so i can access each one as i need it   the blue led lights around each power button easily tells one which ports are active i have seen higher prices for hubs that have none of these handy features   and it doesn t require external power like some hubs do      
129,5.0,                       has the four usb ports  there s power switches so you can turn off or on the usb connections individually  it s a bit short but that s fine since i m working at a small distance not a long distance from my computer anyways      
130,5.0,                       we have too many gadgets and they all need to be charged with usb   we had single plug chargers all over the house    it made me crazy  or crazier  because the plugs were never where i wanted them when i needed them     so i had a brilliant idea  set up a charging station in a central location for all        i bought this hub  which was delivered fast  and extra charging cables   woohoo i had a place to charge everything well almost everything at once   i am going to be buying one more  maybe two more  so we can charge everything at once   i have already set it up so that when we travel  even over night  it is easy to unplug one pack it and have everything we need to charge everything we want   i love it  i had an idea that was actually helpful           
131,5.0,                       i liked the first one i bought so much  got this one to have a spare  i like keeping some of my peripherals hooked up all the time even though i rarely use more than one at a time  that s really what it s for since it provides no power on its  own      
132,1.0,                       i ve had two of these   at first they worked great   but  they only operate for a few months   the first one worked for about   months   i assumed this was not a typical issue   however  the second one worked for   months   i will not use again   poor product      
133,5.0,                       i somehow broke the switch that turns my wifi on and off for my sony laptop   of course it was somehow in the off position and the local repair shop could not get it turned  on    they offered me a usb wireless device to connect to my wifi at home for a lowered price of something close to       the reduced price was because they had tried to fix the switch   i immediately thought of amazon and ordered this to go with the wireless usb adapter since i only have   built in usb ports and use one for a wireless mouse   received this quickly and plugged it in and was up and running   i wish the attached cord was either longer  or the device was someway attachable to the laptop to make it more streamline   even so  overall i am pleased with the purchase      
134,5.0,                       for some reason  amazon s automated system seems to expect me to review this as a camera  i can safely say that  while this is a highly effective   port usb charger  it fails in every respect as a camera looking at amazon s feature list  the first thing it wants me rating is camera quality  i m afraid i have to give this only a single star  if i could  i would give it even less  forget megapixels  i was unable to use this alleged camera to get even a single pixel onscreen  i really have to question the decision making of the manufacturer  seeing as they decided to forgo camera quality in favor of accessory features  like four led usb ports which light up when charging  and thus allow me to easily manage power output to multiple devices i must give it a   in charge power as well  while it has proven itself exceedingly useful when it comes to charging other devices  such as my tablet pc  phone  xbox one controller  and wireless mouse  it does not keep a charge for even a single second  had i been expected to rate its capabilities at charging other objects  i would of course have given it a five star  the blue led lights take minimal power and allow me to choose between putting almost all of the charge power into my charging device when i go out for a walk  or having several devices plugged in at a time my laptop s usb ports are largely broken  and there s only one of them  this usb hub allows me to plug in an extra keyboard and mouse  because the shoddy quality of the alienware keyboard the laptop came with meant that its keys have largely fallen off  i have had no choice but to find a usb hub  such as this one  when it comes to charging  i ve used several brands of usb hub  and this is absolutely the best one i can find i have  thus  given it two stars for cable length  its cable is actually slightly larger than normal for usb hubs  meaning i don t need to worry as much about bumping it when i move my hands around the desk  it s really quite generous in that respect  however  even long for a usb hub is very short for a camera  which somehow the algorithm believes this is  as a camera  the charge cable is far too small  once again  however  you need not worry  because it won t actually keep its charge anyway i m sorry to say that i am cannot in good conscience approve of the camera i was provided  however  since the page i bought it was labeled a usb extender port  and it is      the best one of those i have ever seen  sturdier than most  sticking effectively in the port on my laptop that most other things jiggle out of  that s not really that much of a disappointment if you are looking for a digital camera  look elsewhere  this is not a digital camera  however  if you want a usb port  i cannot possibly recommend it highly enough  this is a miracle  and if it ever breaks just from overuse from how much i am carrying it around and such  i fully intend to replace it with another of the same brand  you can t get a better   port usb port  a fact which  i hope  will somewhat soften the blow to anyone who expected a camera five stars to the product  and one star to whatever idiot made amazon s product recognition algorithms      
135,5.0,                       this is a great gadget if you need multiple ports for headsets  microphones  light up pads and everything else gaming  wish the cord was a little longer  but does the trick      
136,5.0,                       a handy dandy little accessory  especially in an era where manufacturers limiting the number of usb ports   it came in real handy because i hate the touchpad pointer on my laptop and connecting my wired all in one printer  wireless mouse and keyboard was a snap   made it easy to transfer the devices to my work laptop when needed   i liked it so much i purchased a second one for a friend and she loves it too      
137,5.0,                       love this  my keyboard  laptop  webcam  and iphone all plug into one device and then into my work from home laptop   being able to turn off each item via the illuminated buttons is a nice feature instead of unplug re plugging every time      and yes  it charges my iphone when plugged into a power source     
138,5.0,                       i have used this unit before  unfortunately i did not get that far this time   i had a bad time with the packaging i cut the top inch off and tried to tear it open   it did not go well  and the package was covered in blood   i moved lower to cut it open and the connector had or was packed in the top portion and i cut if off   needless to say it went into the trash the packaging is cheap and dangerous and is overkill  especially if you cut yourself up   i guess anti theft is more important than safe packaging i will reorder and use a chain saw to open the next time while the unit is okm  the packaging is ceap     
139,5.0,                       my new computer didn t have enough conveniently placed usb ports  so i use this to supplement it   it s great for that   i especially appreciate the ability to toggle the things plugged in on and off   it makes it very easy to switch between a couple of different modes in my computer without having to fiddle with what s plugged in i do wish the cord was maybe    longer so it could sit comfortably on top of my computer without the cord being stretched taught and prone to sliding      
140,5.0,                       boss who has never touched a computer and guy at walmart picked out new laptop for me to use   no  this laptop only has   usb ports  one of which i have to use to access internet   yeah  i know  this has given me ports i needed for everything else and my cursor is now under control   so grateful for sabrent   port usb     hub for putting me back in control      
141,5.0,                       this device totally fills needs i never knew i had  what a concept  switches for the different devices you have mounted on extensions    perfect for my backup external which does not have its own power switch  peerfect for activating the line of a plugged in device which seems to be a boost for the system to recognize the usb  which is sometimes flakey on windows machines  saves me a lot of trouble  just wish the cable was somewhat longer    i had to buy an extension to get this too my desktop delivery and quality folow thru with shipping from this vendor  very happy     
142,5.0,                       i had to do some research about whether to get a device that supports usb     or       also learned that this not a charger for phones  i wanted a hub for my laptop  to plug in keyboard  mouse  backup thumbstick  etc   love the short cord and lighted buttons to turn ports on off  this device is exactly what i needed  it is performing well  my laptop only had   usb ports  because it also had hdmi and micro ones   this  extension cord  saved me from having to buy a new laptop  well worth the price      
143,5.0,                       this purchase i have never once regretted   it s super portable and is a live saver for me  i use a ton of things attached to my mac when i work   so it s awesome  hope the quality is similar from years ago cause i would hate to disappoint new customers lol   best purchase i had made tho    it still works perfectly       
144,5.0,                       great product switch that can be turned on and off and lites up blue on each switch when you push one of the   buttonsgreat item if you need more usb ports for keyboard wireless usb mouses usb speakers lamps you name i even charge my electronic cigarette and cell phone every penny worth the low price i paid it s mini as well and doesn t take up any space whatsoever  the size of a mini harmonica get one    all ports work well and i am drawing a lot of voltage otta this little acer one netbook without consequences so far      
145,5.0,                       anyone who uses a mac knows the frustrations of the limited usb ports that most of them have to offer  i edit a lot of my photography work on the mac and it became frustrating when i had to transfer data between multiple devices or merely organize my external hard disks  the usb hub is a pretty basic  cheap  not so nice looking but works pretty well kind of a product  even with all the positive reviews  i wasn t sure if it would be as good and was expecting a port or two to fail on me by now  but  much to my relief  it hasn t  it s been plugged to my system since it was shipped to me and became an essential part of my work gear  it has   slots with buttons that lit up with a blue light when on and fully pressed  i usually have my mouse and usb drives connected to it and also my  tb external hard drive and it has been able to take all the load  one of the buttons is faulty and seems like its not on and presses when it actually is  so far  i haven t come across any cons of the product and glad that i bought it      
146,5.0,                       one usb port didn t work   didn t anyone test it in the manufacturing process   not worth the time trouble to return edit     the package looked like it might have been opened   perhaps a prior customer damaged it   then returned it   if so  who should have retested it edit     seller shipped new  fully working replacement      
147,5.0,                       even though new vehicles have lots of ports  this device offers an opportunity to charge phones  gpss  lap tops  etc  all close by whether it s in your car or home  and you don t have to worry about not having enough wall sockets  especially in hotel rooms  works well      
148,5.0,                       i use my asus laptop as my primary  desktop  computer as well as a laptop  and unfortunately  the   included usb ports were not enough  or in good locations for stationary work  after a few months of use  i can safely say this product was a bargain for what it does  it is not powered  so you cannot use this to charge usb devices  but the four usb     ports are very well suited for most accessories  i saw no need to spend more money for a usb     hub when all i needed to hook up were a keyboard  mouse  and occasionally a flash drive for small file transfers  i could use the     ports on my laptop itself if i needed the extra speed  though     is fine for most   the build quality on this hub is second to none  and i like that i can deactivate the ports when they are unused  the cable is thin and flexible so i can position this hub as i need it  i would highly recommend this hub and other sabrent products  i also purchased a sata iii hard drive usb enclosure for my laptop s old hard drive when i swapped it out for an ssd  again  a fantastic product of very high quality that will last for years      
149,5.0,                       i have been looking for a compact usb hub for my laptop  one that offers versatility and space saving attributes  this sabrent   port usb     hub does just that for me  i really like the short cord that really helps keep the desktop less cluttered  works great i have not tried the  charging  capability however i am certain it works just fine      
150,5.0,                       i bought one for home and it works wonderfully  i thought i d purchase one for the office  that one works not so wonderfully and has promptly been sent back  i m not sure if it s a product quality issue or just the fact that at home the product is working with an imac and at the office a lenovo laptop  but at work it constantly disconnected and reconnected and wasn t reliable  i also noticed the one i purchased for work had a very snug fit with all of my ubs devices and at times i felt like i was jamming them into the ports  quality control needs to improve on this product for sure   update   sabrent reached out to me and replaced the product free of charge  excellent customer service and the new products work wonderfully  thank you sabrent and i will change from   stars to        
151,2.0,                       worked good for a few months then just at random this past saturday would not work for my iphone   or any other iphones that i have for that matter  neither through my laptops or plugged into another usb port outlet definitely only has a limited time use for apple products apparently  works for everything else though  being that i usually have my phone connected to my laptop through there  now that it doesn t want to read my iphone i won t be using it as much and will be going with another product      
152,5.0,                       i don t know what to say about this other than knowing i can now charge four five phones with this  or connect a bunch of console controllers via usb through this the product is simple  works  and has  admittedly mildly disappointing  led switches to quickly power on or off ports whenever needed also  while i am unsure which ac adapter this product takes  you can plug in a compatible ac adapter to use power intensive usb devices with it      
153,5.0,                       love itthis is my second one  they do break if dropped but work for quite some time and very helpfuli use this with my toshiba laptop running windows     that doesn t work with a lot of usb wires  this little hub acts as a middle man so i dont have to bother putting things on sds or getting to my windows    or   computers if you have multiple of the same device type plugged in but don t want to take them out and risk losing the dongles you can just leae them in and turn off that specific port and this lil guy is much easier to find but its also small enough to carry with you when you go      
154,5.0,                                 purchased this because my antique laptop has only two usb and in today s wired world  you need more   it works well for connecting my phone to the laptop  i keep my mouse plugged in full time and rarely have an issues with it  and the on and off option allows me to not worry if i keep a cord in that the cord or the laptop will be damaged   i do wish the cord was a bit longer  but honestly i haven t found many of the usb hubs with long cords  and this is the longest one of the lot   my kindle does keep tell me low charge  but not sure if that s the hub or my computer   my phone has said it twice since obtaining it   otherwise it s quite happy with it   i m happy too         
155,4.0,                       i have had this for about a year now and have only occasionally had problems with it  but they are worth mentioning pros buttons to turn ports on and off is nice  in retrospect  this isn t as useful as i thought it would be  but it is still i fairly nice feature  it is just really not that often that i have something plugged in and i don t want to use it small and compactcons the cable for this is insanely small  to make this product worthwhile i also bought an amazonbasics usb extension cable  i have the entire hub set up on the top corner of my desk but wired down to the back of my computer  i can see how many people would not need an extension cable  however  if they are just setting this up on a laptop or have a spare port on a keyboard anything related to audio doesn t really work with this hub  my headset   usb speakers or small things like that always end up receiving an annoying hum as feedback when plugged in here but work totally fine if plugged in anywhere else on my computer  work around this hasn t been a problem for me  but if you need this hub to have more space for headset or other audio equipment  i would look for a different product      
156,5.0,                       bought the one in the photo december       it s now july      and i need to purchase a new one  i believe there may have been a power surge that caused two of my computer items to die  one was my laptop charging battery and the other was this usb port extender  i was surprised with how long and how well this usb port extender worked  i ve used others that did not connect to my computer or gadgets  this works  buy it  i m upgrading to the    port extender because i like it so much and because my computer is about   years old and only   of   of the usb ports on it are working i can t speak for the    port yet  but if you are considering the   port usb extender  buy it    i ve used this for my mouse keyboard  printer  scanner  to charge my phone and watch  and to open flash drives      
157,1.0,                       couldn t get this usb     hub to even work  my pl recognized it just fine  but the moment you plug a device in and then hit the switch to send power to that port  and the hub resets itself over and over never allowing the pc to recognize the device or load the device drivers  instead all you hear is the pc sound saying a device was plugged in  then start loading drivers but at that second chiming that the device was unplugged and it cycles bock and forth plugging in and unplugging  i d return it but only paid    or    and the return postage would cost more than the refund  avoid      
158,4.0,                       it s a beautifully made device  the switches are sublime  and the packaging was a work of art   i plugged in my keyboard and mouse right away  but moved them back to the computer s ports about five minutes later   both devices became erratic   maybe one data driven device at a time would work  but definitely not two   however  my non data devices are working great and i really like it      
159,1.0,                       purchased the sabrent   port usb     hub with individual power switches and leds  hb umls   the device only worked with my flashdrive  it did not work with my keyboard and my mouse  i work on a laptop but have a mouse and keyboard that i need to connect  anyways  the device was useless to me because it couldn t connect those devices  the product description states that accessories such as a mouse or keyboard can be connected with this hub but that is not accurate information      
160,2.0,                       i was given this hub by a friend who bought it from amazon for me  it s maybe nine months old  in my possession   and today it has simply stopped working  it s plugged in  as always  but i leave the ports off unless i am using the devices plugged into it  now not one of the blue lights comes on when any of the four buttons is depressed i just don t know enough about the technology to guess at why it has stopped working  usually things with moving parts are most susceptible to breakdowns  but except for the buttons that activate and deactivate the ports  nothing else moves or has changed since i hooked this up  i have had a couple of power outages recently  but they have occurred when my mac has been asleep  perhaps there have been surges  but none of my other equipment has had problems i ll be buying a new hub  but i won t be buying another one of these  even though it s amazon s favorite      
161,2.0,                       the cord was too short for what i needed  but that issue is on me should ve double checked  this product worked fine without any issues for about a month or so but recently i came across the problem that it is not recognizable on my computer  it was really convenient that i can turn off individually for each slot  i just wished it didn t stop working all of a sudden      
162,1.0,                       i was so excited to get this usb expander splitter   my plan was to use this to charge multiple devices from one usb   i plugged in my phone and my tablet  and was very disappointed  the tablet shows that the charger is plugged in  but there is a red  x  over the battery icon  indicating that it is not actually charging   i tested that cord plugged directly into the original usb  the one that this new   port charger was plugged into   and it works fine   my phone gave me the message that it was  slow charging  and that i should check to see if it was plugged in properly   i checked to make sure all of the connections were good  and went off to take a shower   when i came back  my battery had decreased by       i then checked that cord the same as i did the other cord  and sure enough  it works just fine thankfully  it was only     because i d already thrown away the packaging  and i m not sure it will be worth the time and effort of a return unfortunately  this device will not work for me for the purpose i intended         
163,5.0,                       this is a nice usb hub and i ve been using it a great deal with zoom meetings  i can plug my webcam  usb mic  led light  and powerpoint remote and use them with ease  nice product  and i especially like being able to turn off each individual usb port when i want      
164,5.0,                       does a great job   plug into the laptop  add your extra stuff  mouse  keyboard  headset  etc  and turn on the outlet   downside   if it  rolls over  it might press the button and shut it off      
165,5.0,                       original product got lost in shipping  currently says it s in memphis tn      i blame that on usps though    amazon cancelled that order for me  refunded me the money  and after i re placed the order  they upgraded my shipping to overnight at no charge    so the package did get here with no major issues at all  it s super easy to unpackage  plug it in  switch on the buttons for the ports you are using  and it works  really nothing to it  just a great little compact item if you have a lack of usb ports on your computer for your peripherals  for the price  it s hard to beat  i have not noticed any speed or download issues with this product  i am using two ports  one for a printer and one for an external hard drive   i even like the blue lights      
166,5.0,                       item arrived on time and as advertised   thanks to this handy little item  i m able to hook up   older printers to my laptop along with the stick for the wireless mouse and i still have one more open slot as a spare   everything seems to be working well so far and as amazon had the item for a great price  especially when compared to an in town electronics store   i couldn t be happier with the item   item is small and compact with just the right amount of cord and i will gladly buy another one for our other laptop if the need arises      
167,5.0,                       this is really good one  don t have to buy the expensive one  they work the same  well unless you are a mad scientist or computer super programmer that knows a lot better than me about cables   oh  so you are    ehemm    sorry  advice  always push the button on top of socket that you plugged in  that my friends  is the power supply buttons to supply power and retrieve information from your usb storage device that you plug in to  not the one that you don t plug in  anyway    just push that damn button will ya   then you can write a good review if someone said the other products are far better than this   buy it           well at least that guy has already try this one and also try another one and still decide that the other product still better  i don t  i m not that mad scientist      
168,5.0,                       great usb hub  a great price and it works great  although i ve only been using it with my raspberry pi zero for retropie gaming  i ve noticed that this hub is one of the few that is able to power all of the ports when used with the zero board  other hubs don t distribute enough power evenly through all the ports at the same time  this one is great  and i especially love the option to turn off individual ports with a simple button  and  the led light around the button makes it easy to know which ports are powered and which ones are off  i can t recommend this enough  especially for those in the rasp pi community      
169,1.0,                       i probably would not be writing this bad review on one of the ports being bad but i bought   of these sabrent   port usb     hub with individual led lit power switches  hb umls   but there is   port on each one that does not work so don t waste your money on these external usb ports      
170,5.0,                       i can plug in keyboard  trackball  camera plus one other thing   this means when i switch from work laptop to personal laptop i have only one thing to swap out   this saves endless untangling of cords   it seems to handle all my devices quite happily  nothing has failed  charged devices seem to be just fine   overall entirely happy     
171,5.0,                       life saver   this totally helped me out when i had to transition to work from home since i was using my laptop that only had   usb slot   this helped out a bunch and allowed me to connect a wireless mouse  bigger keyboard and even left me with a slot to use for my phone   good price and quick shipping   product definitely works well for the price      
172,5.0,                       this was recommended by a friend and is perfect for my needs  with clear blue on off switches for each plug used   compact  well made  great packaging      
173,5.0,                       i ordered this three days ago  thought it would come in a week  imagine how surprised i was when i saw it on my front porch  btw  not safe  could have been stolen or something  we have mailboxes for a reason   it seems to work fine  has all the features the description said it has  i especially like it because my current pc only has one     usb port and a lot of things i need to connect to it  at the same time  have a usb cord  it s also nice that i can decide which port i want off when i want  not a bad purchase  let s see what happens in a few months         
174,5.0,                       i had before given this a bad review by saying it was lose and would fall out  little did i know that it was my usb port on my laptop board  so after opening the case to the laptop and tightening a few screws it works perfectly  sorry it took me so long to correct this as i could not figure out how to edit the review  once again great product and the seller contacted me and even offered to send me a replacement even tho nothing was there fault  great company great item       positive review   to bad the don t make cars   lol     
175,5.0,                       needed something to add usb ports as the company sent a laptop with   ports and equipment that required more  this works great for that purpose  haven t had any issues  would recommend for expanding usb ports if that s what you need      
176,5.0,                       smaller than i thought it would be but  that was a pleasant surprise  i love the options to turn device on and off directly from hub      
177,5.0,                       really great port  was able to free up so much space in my work area now that i have the usb cords behind my lab top  love the fact that i can turn off the usb for each individual connection great product     
178,5.0,                       we are using this product as we teach from home  the bluetooth for the mouse and   flash drives are plugged into this extension  everything works well      
179,5.0,                       it gets a   of    only because the cord is short  it works to switch off the camera   headset  external drive   i have a spare still for a jump drive to share info  the light is bright  up   off   down  blue light on   on  it arrived fairly quickly  package was simple   easy to open  recycle too      
180,4.0,                       sabrent   port usb     hub with individual    sold by  sabrentthis is a handy usb controller and the lit pb switchs are also helpful in isolation of the sockets   small in size can be carried most anywhere a word of caution      when you have drives running from this device  don t touch it     i don t know if the switch contacts are not pressing hard enough or if contact somewhere else fails but you will shut down your drive by simply moving it it works fine as long as you do not touch or move it until the drive has completed its task works where you need to expand your usb drive  like with a laptop that only has one usb port   and the buttons light up when pushed to use the associated usb port   honestly  i have had no failure using it as long as i don t touch or move it while data transfer is initiated i took one star off because of the sensitivity of the hub but otherwise  i like it      i did receive an email from the seller  right after my order was in for this device   they wanted to know if there were any problems after i received it so they could take care of any concerns        and i told them of the problem that was the last i heard from them      for what its worth      i am not associated nor did i receive any merchandise or monies for my unsolicited review                 
181,4.0,                       i needed an extra hub ports to charge my tablet  ipad and the phone  this   port usb     hub does the job i like that there are buttons over each port which you press to activate the port you are using now  the blue light which comes on when the port is activated is very helpful  it shows you which ports are in use the unit is very compact  i plan to take this usb hub with me when i m travelling because it doesn t take a lot of space at all  i can easily plug all my electronics at the same time what i don t like about this unit is that the four ports are really close to each other  so when i tried to plug in a simple flash drive i couldn t plug in another device next to it  also the cable could be longer  it easily disconnects if the hub is moved otherwise i think it s a good gadget for a price  i would recommend it      
182,5.0,                       exactly as described    i was desperate for something like this   my laptop only has   usb ports  and   are permanently spoken for  there are times when i needed to have more usb ports because of my devices that need to be connected via usb to my laptop  this works great  just plug into laptop usb and plug into it whatever you need  and you don t have to keep connecting and disconnecting   you can turn the usb off with the switch  led light indicates on off   and if you need more than a   port  you can get another   port and connect it to this one  according to the package   when you have everything turned off  you don t need to eject usb on the laptop because it only reads what is turned on i highly recommend this product   update            i ordered another one because with all the products i m getting that require a usb port  wired keyboard  usb led light  etc   i just needed another  took it right out of the packaging  plugged it in    and it works  it works connected to the laptop directly  and it also works connected to another   port hub that s connected to the laptop i know some people will wonder why i bothered getting a wired keyboard that would require a usb port  because my laptop key pads are acting up  and i don t want to worry about battery life with a wireless   but all in all  i m happy with my first and second sabrent   port usb hub fast delivery  and i ve had no problems with it  both times  now that says something      
183,5.0,                       so  glad that someone had the smarts to invent something like this especially now days when notebooks and laptops don t have enough usb ports  and everything is headed towards the flash drive   being able to turn each port on and off for what is needed is such an awesome feature   each port will display a light letting you know if it s on or not   my surface pro   laptop only has one port  because of this ingenious device  i am able to plug in a mouse  an external hard drive to back up my work  a portable flash drive  thumb drive   with another port open to charge various devices  if my notebook is plugged into an outlet  such as my phone  ipad or bluetooth earphones      
184,4.0,                       i found that the ports themselves are a little hard to use   with all of my devices i had to jiggle the cord a bit to get them to fit which worried me at first  but once you get them in it works it came quickly and is a really convenient addition to my workstation      
185,1.0,                       since the sabrent hub was inexpensive  i decided to replace my old working hub with the sabrent to take advantage of individual usb port switches   my old hub has no switches   the computer responded to the sabrent usb hub being plugged in  but no devices would work with it   i also had difficulty inserting my wireless mouse usb receiver into any of the slots  although my wireless keyboard receiver inserted ok   i  then  connected the sabrent hub to a different usb port  but the sabrent hub still did not work   neither my wireless mouse nor my wireless keyboard would work   the buttons on the sabrent did  illuminate when plugged in   i tried turning buttons on and off and still nothing worked   i plugged the devices back into my old hub and everything worked again   could just be bad quality control and the mfg never tests the device before selling it   i must rate it   star since it did not function      
186,5.0,                       i started out using a   gb thumb drive  usb  and partitioned it to separate mp s and for tesla dashcam  it worked fine but i noticed some quality issues and a few bugs while screening through dashcam videos  i read that a usb hub will work and found several tesla owners giving this a high rating  it works as intended and i am able to charge my phone  connect two thumb drives    gb     gb  for music and dashcam  and best of all i can use the logitech gamepad f     i do like the feature of disabling the usb ports and the only time i do that is when removing the video drive      
187,5.0,                       has   ports and each has its own switch  you don t have to mess with the computer to disconnect  you just turn off the switch  it works better than the usb ports in my computer  they are getting old and there doesn t seem to be any good way to clean them      
188,5.0,                       this is my  rd   from store pc and they are great  putting in a usb pci card in the back is so much trouble this plugs in and you re ready to go     
189,5.0,                       i liked the reasonable price  and the   blue off on lights  and most important it extended the   ports on the front of my computer tower to    and it did not lose a sound or connection strength  it does exactly what it was said to do i am delighted with this product and give it a full   stars  thank you brent and amazon      
190,5.0,                       i purchased this device for my son who needed extra usb ports for his mic camera needed for school  its been works great  he loves the fact that you can turn each usb port on off individually without turning everything off or unplugging it  also  the light up led is a nice touch  especially  since his keyboard  mouse  headset  pc all light up      
191,4.0,                       if you re charging multiple devices with this off of one power supply than the devices will charge slowly  if you re just trying to increase the number of usable ports on your xbox  playstation  or pc mac then this product is great      
192,5.0,                       most things being usb driven these days  my laptop and two older towers are always in need of  just one more  usb port this gizmo is ideal  not only can you attach additional devices  but you can turn any on or off in any combination  and the blue led helps keep it all straight  if you  like me  have a bunch of usb memory sticks  chips and adapters each with a copy of  something  and want to get it all consolidated on one machine  this helps  i have a dozen or more microsd chips for smart phones  mp  players  even bluetooth speakers that accept a chip with mp  tunes  digital camers    you get the idea it s also a bargain accessory  works very well  recommended      
193,1.0,                       junk  i tried using it for two months but found it to be very unreliable  sometimes the ports worked  sometimes not  for instance  if i ever disconnected my laptop and took it in the other room  then returned and hooked the external keyboard back up to the laptop through this port  it wouldn t work until i restarted the laptop  countless other similar situations and it got to the point where i just unhooked it because it would make me so frustrated at times  i basically burned       for nothing bottomline  if you like a device that works half the time  this is for you     
194,3.0,                       this little charger works great for charging general usb devices  like hand warmers  lanterns  toys  etc  however it does not charge my iphone  it must not be mac compatible   so many things have replaced batteries with usb charging cords that i needed something to charge multiple things at once and this seemed to be the answer  it does take a bit longer than i would have liked but overall it serves its purpose for now  i can t decide if the on off button for each port is useful since sometimes i plug in the device and do not turn on so i go get my device later expecting it to be already charged and nothing  because i forgot to push the little on button      
195,5.0,                       this review is for the sabrent   port usb     hub with individual led lit power switches  hb umls  so look carefully  it is usb     not      so if you need speed  forget it  but it s perfect for my use case  where i have multiple wireless dongles for keyboards and mice that i attach to the hub  it s nice to be able to switch them on off individually and the hub lets me quickly switch from using one computer to another  and at least when i bought it  it was cheaper than other options      
196,5.0,                       with newer laptops coming with less and less usb ports  this hub is essential  i have a laptop where the usb ports are so close together you can t stick two usb sticks in next to each other  there are four ports on this hub which can be  turned on  by clicking each of the little buttons above it  i use it to keep the receivers for my wireless keyboard and mouse that i only use at work and at the end of the day i just remove the hub and keep it in my desk  no more searching for your receivers that you accidentally took out at home  the cord length is about   inches  so more than enough to clear whatever else you may have plugged into your computer  the hub itself is very light so you can leave it hanging off your computer      
197,5.0,                       so i m editing this because i ve had it for a bit now and i can be more accurate  it works great  i love that i can turn the ports on and off  but it sucks i can t plug up a drawing wacom tablet  pressure won t work   actually at first a hard drive wouldn t work in it but  now it does for some reason  a problem that i forgot about is  moving ut around while you have things plugged into it will on amd off say it s disconnected etc  its annoying  this doesnt happen when you first first get it  otherwise i experience no other issues  at the same time it is great if you just need the extra ones to charge a phone or plug in a usb for a wireless mouse or something  so far so good  etc      
198,5.0,                       i was trying to look for a usb hub to connect to my nexus        via otg cable  and this is exactly what i wanted  most of the usb s couldn t attach directly through the otg cable  but when i plugged this usb hub into the otg cable  it allowed any and all of my accessories  flash drive  mouse  sd card reader  to be connected the thing i liked best about this usb hub was the ability to turn on or off the ports on the hub  which meant  i could turn off the devices without completely unplugging the device  the fact that the power switches had a blue led was an added bonus to all my other blue led lit up devices for the price and convenience  i would buy this usb hub again      
199,5.0,                       great value for the price  does the job for which it is intended picky gripes the lights  bleed  through to their neighbors  indicator windows  so depending on your lighting conditions it isn t always easy to tell which ones are on the cord could be longer   i would certainly like it to be more easily accessible  but obviously that depends on your setup      
200,5.0,                       this usb extender is perfect for my laptop i only have   usbs and since everything uses usb ports   just doesn t cut it  now i can plug in speakers  a cd rom   since my laptop didn t come with one   my cell phone  and my portable hdd      
201,4.0,                       i like it but it just isn t long which is my only problem since it s just dangling off of my pc and gets in the way at times  overall though it works great and works with anything that supports the usb drive      
202,5.0,                       i love this thing  it was super easy to set up  just plug it in  and you get extra usb ports  it also has on off buttons for each item you plug into it  which is a really nifty feature  super helpful  i would recommend this item      
203,5.0,                       i own two of these hubs  one for my laptop  constantly plugged in  and one for my netbook  they both work great  driver installation took a very short time  any usb device that i have plugged in to this hub are recognized and work seamlessly on windows  devices like keyboard  mouse  bluetooth keyboard mouse combo  flash drives and also a tv tuner  what iike most about this is the buttons  so  i don t need to physically unplug my tv tuner  for instance   i just turn the switch off when i don t need that devices and turn it back on when i need the device      
204,5.0,                       small enough to stash in a laptop bag or conceal in a pc build   the latter is actually why i bought this hub  to use with a few wireless dongles to add concealed bluetooth and logitech unifying to my gaming pc   combined with the nzxt iu   internal usb hub  this sabrent hub works well with the aforesaid dongles and works with any os   i took a couple of command strips and stuck it to the front of my case  nzxt h     behind the vanity shroud and ran the wire inside through a conveniently placed hole to plug it into the iu   board   that s it  that s all it takes   now i get built in bluetooth and unifying with essentially no signal loss   i like the individual power buttons    i can disable the ports i don t need  hopefully reducing overall power draw probably far enough off the spec sheets to confuse the guys  and gals  at sabrent  but i like it          
205,5.0,                       very nice product  i love the led indicators and the push buttons to turn a port on or off  the cord is very short but i just got an extension cord and have no problems with it  this is an excellent purchase for the price i was planning on upgrading to a larger hub later on  but i ve had this one for   months now and i m so happy with it i am thinking about just buying another and pocketing the     i ll save for not buying a   or    port hub      for two of these and         for a decent quality   or    port hub  i currently have a keyboard  mouse  webcam  and flash drive plugged in to this and they all function perfectly pros leds turn on when a port is on and are off when a port is off  they work perfectly the ports are spaced far enough that devices shouldn t have problems when plugged in adjacently very small and unobtrusive cons cord is short  you can see this in the picture though    you get what you see  overall this is a great product and i wouldn t hesitate to buy it again note  my wd mybook external  tb hard drive won t work using these ports  however  it s a finnicky drive at best and i never know whether a port will read it or not  i haven t tried these with any other external drives      
206,5.0,                       my computer only has two usb outlets and i needed to charge my phone  my headphones and my watch  on top of having a mouse  i chose the four outlets port since it was good enough for me and i love it  i like that is small and nice looking  also like the on and off feature that allows you to consume only the right amount of electricity  so far it has been working beyond expected  i do have to mention i have only charge two things at a time      
207,5.0,                       i bought one for a laptop i use in the basement for my cricut  i also have some speakers for my computer hooked up to it and it works great  i love that the cord isn t too long  you can turn each individual port on and off and the blue glow is so pretty  just ordered   more  one for my daughter and one for my upstairs pc  great item for the price      
208,4.0,                       very useful for adding more usb s to a laptop  i use one for a mouse and two for an external hard drive  what s really nice about this product is that you can disconnect a device without unplugging it  thus decreasing the stress on your device  plugging in and unplugging in a device is bound to put some wear on it and this product allows you to avoid this problem  however  i don t like the aesthetics  the product is advertised as having a  sleek black finish  but it s nothing impressive  it looks like regular plastic that kid s toys are made of  also  the    cable is inflexible  so you can t bend it to whatever you want      
209,5.0,                       you have to make sure the buttons are pressed for the occupied usb  does what i need it to      
210,5.0,                       this is a wonderful item to add extra usb ports   the laptop we needed it for only had one and a wireless mouse keyboard was in there   we used this to be able to read thumb drives  being able to leave them in but turn them on or off is a great feature     
211,5.0,                       i ve been using this product for a bit now  and i am nothing short of happy with my purchase  i use it for my wireless mouse  my printer  my wireless number pad  accounting homework while left handed is a bit uncomfortable without it  and i also sometimes use the fourth port as a charger  this thing can handle all of it  and i m so impressed  i think everyone should get one and watch their productivity go up        
212,5.0,                       after getting a monitor laptop stand for my sit stand desk  i found that two of my laptop usb ports were covered by the clips that held the laptop in place  i ordered this usb hub to remedy that problem  it was perfect for that   i have my camera  wireless mouse keyboard and headset plugged into it  and all work perfectly  what i didn t realize is how helpful the  on off  buttons would be  i used to need to plug in or unplug whenever i wanted to switch between using my headset or using my laptop mic speakers  now  all i have to do is push a button to turn the headset on or off  so much better  i used strong  m adhesive to attach the hub to the bottom of the laptop platform on the monitor laptop stand  i couldn t be happier with this little gadget      
213,1.0,                       defective when received   enabling power to one of the ports would shut down the whole unit   there was a short which should have been detected   amazon s return policy is great and this unit was replaced with one from a different vendor   quality control is important to me   nice looking unit had it worked      
214,5.0,                       i have a couple failing ports on my motherboard  and only two of them were still working  simply needed to expand one of them to multiple ports for my kb and mouse this works perfect  i mounted it on the back of my pc case with velcro  plan to buy more for other applications keep in mind  this unit is not powered so if you need to run devices like hard drives or other high power required items  this may not work  you will need a powered hub      
215,5.0,                       with working from home and doing virtual school for my kiddos  my prior conference call set up wasn t working  i only had one free usb outlet on my laptop and forever switching lines back and forth between a speaker device and or headset  this device sits right on my docking station and easily allows me to seamlessly flip back and forth between audio options  seriously a huge improvement  definitely a huge value for the money  the power switches illuminate to easily let you know which line has power  great product      
216,5.0,                       omg  i needed one of these so bad  i m super glad i purchased it  my computer didn t come with enough usb ports so this comes in extra handy  i love the  lighted buttons that turn each port on   off   fast connection too  whomever thought of this is genius   i waited a bit before posting my reviews because i like to ensure my honest opinion  i hope others do the sane for me  i would buy another one in a heartbeat   sabrent is an excellent manufacture   in my opinion   ty     
217,5.0,                       my desktop has a limited amount of usb ports   i kept having a problem with my keyboard  no matter which usb port i was using on my desktop   i ordered this and i am very happy   my keyboard is working properly again  and i have three other ports that i can use when needed   i love that the individual usb ports are lit up while you are using them   great product      
218,5.0,                       i have had two hubs in the past   both caused issues with the functionality of the laptop   thank you for making a product that works      
219,4.0,                       works for playstation classic with bleemsync to allow you to play two player by plugging both controllers to this hub into port number       
220,5.0,                       this little thing is quite handy for my situation  i use it on a laptop that suffered a humpty dumpty esque fall  the entire right side  where most of the usb slots are  was damaged beyond repair  one usb is more than enough though  because of this   port hub  i love the lights as an indicator  they re obvious in both bright light and darkness  but not overwhelming   easier than shown in picture to tell what is on  easy on and off  for some  i think the cord length could be an issue  it is quite short  for me  it s great because of placement  but  if i ever needed longer  i d be in trouble      
221,5.0,                       i ve only had this device for a few weeks but so far it s great  i use two of the ports daily  and i mean all day  daily   and a third hub on occasion without any loss of connectivity or performance  i use one hub for a keyboard and the other for a wireless usb mouse   both of which work perfectly using the hub also  my all in one wifi printer suddenly stopped connecting wirelessly for no apparent reason one day when  after spending too many hours trying to troubleshoot it   i remembered it had a super long usb cable that i ve also connected to the hub on occasion and all three of my connected devices worked flawlessly lastly  the hub order confirmation had me expecting it would not arrive for a few days after placing the order but it showed up in my mailbox the very next day    woohoo  i was stoked because i really needed it i ll update my post if the device stops working or causes trouble    but for now i m very pleased      
222,3.0,                       i bought a couple of these a few weeks ago  the one for my keyboard and mouse i haven t had any issues with  the one i hooked up to two c    webcams  though  has periodically      times an hour  has been dropping and causing a rescan of the usb bus  lots of warnings in dmesg about this   i only use them for snapshots at  m intervals  and the power consumption shouldn t be enough to warrant a powered hub  furthermore  when i replaced it with an  amazon basics    part unpowered hub a few days ago  i stopped having any issues  that leaves me uncertain if one of the two is bad  or if the application to which i put it is not ideal  so take what you will of the above  i bought it because it was cheap  not because of the switches  which i don t need      
223,5.0,                       i use these for my surface which only has   usb port  very useful for remote teaching  love the lit up power switches and the   ports  good buy      
224,5.0,                       when i bought this one amazon told me that i purchased this item before   since i can t find it since my move  i bought it again   to me that is the best proof that it is a useful item   my computer is several years old and only has one usb port on the front so i recommend using this usb  extension cord       
225,2.0,                       i bought this because my     laptop has only one usb port  i plugged it in and was using   of the   ports  one for my mouse and the other for a external hard drive   after about an hour my mouse stopped working  i tried different ports but it still didn t work  plugged it into my laptop directly and it worked fine   not sure what the problem is  but disappointed in this product      
226,5.0,                       product shipped on time  and works perfectly    as a simply technique     to conncet four  yes   x    tera byte  western digital   tb  my book desktop external hard drives   to a  dish network  receiver descrambler demodulator   result     tera bytes of external  movie storage  that s space for about       to       hdtv events   of importance  the dish network receiver  box  allows a user to connect only  x usb drive at a time   the trick to use this idea   power  off  the receiver box  before selecting any given usb drive  remember  only one at a time   then power  on  the box again   it s safe  sure   and it works   note   the external dvr drives used with dish network  must  have their own power supply   so  i also bought a power strip for transformers  the transformers are turned    degrees  and there s a surge suppressor   which allows all four     external drives to remain powered up   this usb hub allows the user to  select   connect   just one external drive at a time   doing so  doesn t damage anything  and the connection methods respects the dish network warranty of your receiver box        enjoy      
227,5.0,                       i ordered this product a long time ago  and it served me well the entire time i had it   i can say because of my really dated laptop  i was having a few issues with the usb hub when it was already getting much older   i recently got a different usb hub that served me equally well   my main issue with my work space is i am using a really dated laptop so i am trying really hard not to fault usb devices like this   i know the product did it s job well for as long as it worked  and it lasted me a very long time   i recommend this product for people who have a much larger work space available to them than what i do   having to move it around a lot  etc  likely caused it to get damaged on my end so was not your guy s fault right there   either way though  for folks needing extra usb slots these sorts of products work really well just make sure you guys are using more modern laptops and desktops than i am currently am hahah   either way guys  keep up the good work here      
228,5.0,                       my new laptop only has       usb ports and i needed more to work efficiently   the   ports on the hub has worked great to transfer files to thumbdrives and use various devices   the hub works great and date transfer is fast enough for my needs   i would buy this product again   i am not sure if the on off buttons on the hubs are necessary instead of just unplugging the device from the hub  but i have only used the hub for less than a month      
229,4.0,                       that about sums it up   the original product wasn t working well   the company very quickly responded and sent me another hub   it has been working fine ever since   it was super inexpensive  and it is super light weight which is both a blessing and a curse   i use it to allow me to plug in mouse  extra monitor  keyboard  and sometimes a separate keyboard or a scanner or a third monitor  which given my software version  doesn t always work   but the hub works  the led makes it easy to see if the individual ports are on or not   good value for the price      
230,5.0,                       i like  how you can turn on and off of each slot individually  it is small and doesn t take up much space from my desk  the black color the blue led lights for each bottom make this adaptor looks good and high tech  i like it  another good buy on amazon      
231,5.0,                       this hub is a piece of junk   i connected devices to it that didn t require bus powering and these devices would constantly disconnect from my system   i can t sustain a successful connection with any of my devices and my computer using this hub   i wish i had never purchased it   it is super cheap  and you get what you pay for   too cheap for me to bother returning it   bummer  update sept           andrew from sabrent contacted me  on his own initiative  i might add   and solely because he saw this amazon review  and followed up by sending out a replacement unit to me  including an ac adapter  which wasn t even part of my initial purchase    the replacement usb hub works just fine   thanks very much andrew   also  to clarify  attached to the older  failed  unit was in the simplest scenario of just one device   a pny usb flash thumb drive which draws very little current   and even with just that one device the drive would erratically attach and detach constantly  while it was plugged in  which made it basically impossible to access the thumb drive in any reliable way   this doesn t happen with the new hub   it maintains the connection  so far  so i have to say that i m very impressed with sabrent s proactive support   it s unusual  and speaks highly of them   given this experience  i would purchase future products from sabrent      
232,5.0,                       my previous hub  an insignia unit  stopped working after may be two years of using it to hook regular usb keyboard mouse to my laptop found this sabrent unit in amazon  as having a ton of favorable reviews  almost five stars rating  costing less than ten bucks  featuring four ports with individual on off switches  so it was a no brainer to pick this one so far  highly satisfied about it  now  besides hooking my keyboard mouse  i also use it as the charging station for my phone   of course  my laptop is always plugged into the wall the cord length  is just what is needed for it to sit comfortably over my laptop left  cheek   a longest cord would defeat the purpose of being also a tool to help diminish cable cluttering  not the opposite      
233,5.0,                       works great  love that i can toggle the power on off for devices when not in use  cord is only long enough to dangle away from my chromebook  so it doesn t get tangled up at all  haven t used it to charge any devices  i can plug in a bluetooth mouse  full size keyboard  a mini doc cam  and a headphone microphone headset at the same time  and everything works the way it should with no glitchy lags      
234,2.0,                       did they really have to make it so small  i bought it with the only purpose   to be able to connect   thumb drives to my tv  the plan was to save my fitness videos by category to   separate usb flash drives and switch between them as needed  this would enable me to overcome the limitations ob the built in player in my tv  it can see only a small number of files on a drive   guess what  the distance between the   connectors is so short that usb sticks do not fit next to each other  one can only plug in   usb cables  but not   usb drives   a couple extra millimeters between the ports would ve sold this problem  now  i have to buy short extension cables to be able to achieve my goal  why not do it right from the very beginning otherwise  the price is good and it is good that a hub with switches is available      
235,1.0,                       very inconsistently certain hubs won t work  they ll work with one cord  then not work   then will work again  i just had my phone plugged in for an hour and it wasn t charging  then i put my other phone on the same cord attached to the same hub and it charged fine      
236,5.0,                       my daughter needed a hub for her school computer  so i got this one for her  as i liked the idea of being able to toggle the individual ports on off  it was pretty slick  and i experienced a brief sadness resulting from my lack of necessity for a new hub well  my day finally arrived about four months later when my hub suddenly and mysteriously died  now i too can enjoy the power of controlling each hub  this also has the benefit of being more compact than my old hub  so i ve got that going for me   which is nice      
237,1.0,                       i have an alarm clock with one port on the back that i plug my phone charger into  i thought it would be nice to have a splitter so i can charge my phone and kindle at the same time   the power output is so low that it doesn t even charge my phone  my phone prompts to plug it in to the original charger  it is plugged into the original cord plugged into the splitter   the same power cord plugged right into my clock charges my phone in an hour or two   on the splitter the battery was still dead the next morning  and yes i had the power on to that specific outlet on the splitter     
238,5.0,                       my only complaint is i wish the cord were just a few inches longer  i do like that you can turn on and off the individual plugs      
239,5.0,                       i have never been so happy about a product like this hub  absolutely essential and important especially for those people working constantly with multiple active portable devices simultaneously  works like a charm  it only takes the a single usb port on you computer  very good product for a very good price  it arrived on time as well  i recommend it very much      
240,5.0,                       this thing is exactly what i needed to give me additional ports on my laptop  the swiches to turn each port on off is great so you don t have to unplug  just push the switch and power goes off  price was great  delivery fast  only been using about a week so can t comment on longevity  would definitely recommend     
241,5.0,                       exactly what i needed  for a really great price  i m also able to turn on off my extensions when needed  which helps save a ton of hassle since i m in and out of meetings all day and need to constantly plug unplug my headphones       would buy again  and recommenddo note  when you have a port active  it the square button lights up blue  which is fine for me  but it may annoy some people  like my partner  who don t like random things lighting up     
242,5.0,                       yes i know this review is a year or two late  but i can definitely tell you that this is worth the money  i ve had it for quite some time and i have never had any problems with it  works great for charging multiple phones or controllers at once  i bought this to use  so i could charge a couple of my ps  controllers as well as my phone at the same time  worked great for that  now i use it at my computer desk to plug my webcam  headset  and my usb floppy drive into as i m not someone who likes to have a whole lot of wires showing in the front of my computer  i would definitely recommend it  my only thing is if charging multiple phones i may recommend plugging it into a wall charger base  as phones need a little more power than a controller      
243,5.0,                       this works exactly the way i hoped it would   the only thing i can say negatively is that i should have bought one that had even more ports   who knew that within a week of it getting here  i d decide to add a bunch of usb devices to my computer   now i will be buying another one to piggy back on to this one   i like that it has the on off switches too   that works great for my headphones because my son can use them for his rosetta stone program  and then when i want to use the speakers  all i have to do is tap the switch above the headphones and the regular computer speakers engage   much easier than trying to plug and unplug a usb      
244,5.0,                       i purchased this   port usb     hub with individual power switches   leds  black  almost two years ago and it still works great  others have mentioned in their reviews that they ran into some issues with it disconnecting their external hard drives while in use  fortunately  i can say that although i have had this happened to me before with this device  it has only happened once or twice in the whole time i ve had it  the one or two times it has disconnected or improperly ejected my drive was when i either plugged or unplugged something else into the   port hub  i believe it was during a transfer  so it seems that the connection was disrupted from the additional source added or being taken away   or when i turned pressed or depressed one of the buttons to cut power to that usb port because i cited either of these activities as disrupting the connection to my external drive  i just do not mess with the on off port buttons or plug unplug anything during a transfer just as a precaution   note  the drive does not disconnect every single time that things are plugged unplugged or the button for a port is pushed  i can usually use it like normal even when my external is connected  the drive has only disconnected due to this activity those very few times mentioned  i like the ability to  turn off  the connection to specific ports by using the buttons so certain drives though ejected are  unplugged  i have a macbook pro so having additional usb ports was a must with only two available on my computer  i would definitely recommend this product to a friend  the price is extremely good too considering the use i ve gotten out of it thus far      
245,4.0,                       quality and operation is first class   i got what i expected    no surprises i went to the manufacturers web site looking for the power supply for it so that i can plug in devices that draw more current and found nothing the unit has a socket but there is no data on it   i assume it is   volts but it would be nice if there was a part that i could buy to add to it otherwise  it works fine and i m pleased  i would recommend it to others      
246,5.0,                       originally i thought that this was a gimmick hub  however it turned out to be very useful  i purchased this to use in my car in order to power a bluetooth receiver for streamed internet audio  however i also wanted a second port to recharge my samsung s  smartphone  and this hub just turned up at the bargain end of the price spectrum so i tossed it in the center console  thinking  done   as it turned out running the bluetooth receiver made my phone fail to work with the car s integrated bluetooth for incoming calls  so now it s as easy as reaching inside the console to power down the receiver with a button if i expect a call while i m driving  and of course i can power it back up when i want to listen to internet radio  result is less wear and tear on usb connections  and it is also a lot faster to push a button than to unplug cables      
247,5.0,                       i use this for my xbox bc i have   external hard drive and needed a second alot for when the wife wants to play with me  ot gets the job down and looks good when doing it      
248,4.0,                       we use these to charge all our non apple products like cameras  charging batteries and other electronics  does not charge apple products like watches  phones and ipads  the cord is a little short to sit on some of our counters  but otherwise it works great      
249,5.0,                       this is a well designed and practical way to add usb ports to a notebook  the product is packaged nicely and sealed  just understand that it is for docking   not for charging  basically  it s like an extension cord  that s it  there is another  more expensive model that docks and charges  so  don t be hasty when ordering  if you just want to add usb ports to your notebook or laptop  you can t beat this unit for functionality or price      
250,3.0,                       gaming laptops do not have enough usb ports for gaming  i bought this for the extra ports and it works but some minor things were a bit discouraging  the lights that show which port is powered on light up the adjacent lights a bit so it could be difficult to know which ones were on  the headset i used in these would sometimes become static laden and if i plugged in direct to an on board usb would be fine  and checking device manager the headset got to logitech headset     a week or two after first use with no change on my end  i know  really minor issues but i thought these might be good to know before purchase  i am sure there are other ones of these without these issues though i know not which      
251,5.0,                       i am a musician and use many different instruments and devices to record my music  all of my midi controllers  keyboards and interfaces between my mics and guitars that all link into my computer use a standard usb connection   this device saves me time  keeps me organized and saves me a big hassle from having to swap usb cables between all of my instruments      
252,3.0,                       works fine for connecting mobile device for power and sync does not work when i connected either of my   portable hard drives or my desktop external drive  i thought maybe it needed power and plugged in a power adapter i had  it does not come with one  and it still did not work which was a big disappointment  when i connected my drives they weren t recognized by my computer as being connected at all  some reviews misled me to believe it would work if you just want to connect some accessories but not external hard drives  then i suppose this will work for you      
253,1.0,                       be aware that this will not work without the power cable that is not included   i am sending mine back because after plugging it in there was no connection to anything i plugged into to it and then the laptop   there clearly needs to be a power cable that doesn t come with it      
254,3.0,                       this usb hub is ok  i bought it because i liked that i could tell which devices were connected   the main reason i bought this was to connect my fire stick to my tv  i wanted to use the usb part to power my fire stick without having to plug it into the wall   i also wanted to use the other ports to connect my other devices to my tv  unfortunately when i plugged in my fire stick into the hub and then hub into my tv  i got an error message saying my fire stick did not have enough power  i was very disappointed  i guess i m going to have to use my hub for other things around my house      
255,5.0,                       someone commented on a switch being improper disconnect  but proper plug nplay devices wont get improper plug warnings  if you unplug and the drive wasnt ready  youre safer to plug the same item back in  the danger is to plug a different directory into that same port  and then from ram it writes the former directory onto the new different drive  computers have only so much memory for directories  and once they max  they will drop a drive from your hub to load the next drive up of your hub  i learned this with a ten port usb hub  this maxing the directory memory of your computer will crash one directory to load up the next directory  and in my case twice i lost a wd passport tera drive permanantly because of too much directory gigs   yes  i did swap a drive  and it tried to claim the new drive was the former one plugged in   so the push button off is a must for safely having four tera drives connected  the off on buttons is a must for usb hubs  wait until you hear the computer beep of usb connect or usb drop  i wont buy a usb hub anymore without switches  they were formerly expensive and i was being tight and cheap  i wont buy a switchless ten hub anymore  anybody want mine for free      
256,5.0,                       i really like this switch   it has an input for a power adapter  which i supplied   there seems to be some confusion about this is the q a answers    it allows me to power or unpower individual devices  e g   my arduino processors  backup disk drives  as desired  without plugging unplugging usb cables   i can also charge my phone or gps  or whatever with it the paragraph above is actually from my review of the usb    version of this hub   i liked it so well i ordered the     version  with power supply  for my new machine with usb     ports   i now have it plugged into my dynadoc u    docking station so i can leave a couple of hdds and a flash drive plugged in and take them on  or off line using the appropriate switch if  i don t forget to eject them first    i initially had two problems     i didn t plug the power supply into my power strip   the hub will drive flash drives  but won t supply enough power to handle a disk drive   it easily handled two hdds when i plugged in the power supply   duh    at one point  i ejected all     devices on the hub  a flash drive and   hdds   turned off the corresponding switches  then tried to bring one of the devices back on line by turning on it s switch   the computer didn t recognize the presence of the device   i managed to clear this condition by unplugging the huib from the docking station  and reinserting it   after this  each device would come up  and i could eject them all  and power them down   and could bring them online again by pushing the appropriate switch   i haven t seen the problem since      
257,4.0,                       i haven t had any problems with pushing the buttons and having hard drives pop off the computer  of course  i m only pressing the buttons to  connect the drives  i unmount them first before pressing a switch to disconnect them  as a precaution  however  i don t ever touch any buttons if i m doing something that is using a hard drive  just good practice with that said  this    and similar    four port units are the largest i have ever gotten to work consistently at     speeds  i ve tried   ports and    ports and nada  it seems like four is the magical limit  especially for hooking up hard drives  you won t go wrong with this and you probably will with the larger ones  if you need more ports you might get by with two of these and plugging one of them into one of the vacant ports of the other giving you a total of seven ports with one hookup tot the computer  but i haven t tried this  a better plan would be to get eight ports by hooking each box to a separate usb port on your computer the switches have a nice blue glow around them when active and pressing them drops the button height a tiny amount as well when in the  on  position  the glowing light is really needed if it s dark to tell what s on and what s not  i like mine so far      
258,5.0,                       i use this to control my usb fans at work and home  this way  the usb hub wears out first before the fans  which has never happened  i sometimes push some of the buttons multiple times a day  and the older one is still going strong after a few years  no issues here  would purchase again with no hesitation  i can not attest to the speed of the usb  but the power works      
259,5.0,                       very nice hub   i use it with an otg adapter for a cell phone   it allows me to switch on and off power to each individual port which comes in hand in getting andriod os to recognize hot plugged flash drives  it is very lightweight but yet sturdy enough to suit my needs   i really like it s linear layout with all the ports on the same side   i have not used it with an external power brick  so i can not comment on that   based on this unit  i will be buying more and also trying the usb  model as well      
260,5.0,                       works good on my hp laptop with windows installed  had to get this because of a crash on my computer while installing updates  i not only lost all my information but also   usb ports  anyway after installing windows again and putting this device in my remaining usb port i now have a functional laptop as good as before the problem       
261,2.0,                       i bought this item solely to charge more then one phone off the same outlet   i chose this one in particular because it was cheap and had good reviews   unfortunately it works horribly for charging   don t get me wrong  it does charge   but    minutes to get a   charge is unacceptable   when i plugged the same cord directly into the wall box i got    in about   minutes   and that was with only   phone plugged in   i would guess that plugging in more things would slow it down even more but i m not sure   i m going to end up just putting this in one of our travel bags to use in hotels where we have limited outlets because it is far too slow to use on a regular basis      
262,4.0,                       for some reason all the usb ports on the front of my computer have stopped working  so i needed to add more to the back  this adapter plugs into one port and gives your   ports  for a net gain of   usb ports  good to have it works  but it feels kind of flimsy  also  somehow the computer detects that a device has been added when the cable touches the port on the hub  even if the port is turned off  the device doesn t connect to the computer unless the port is turned on  so that is good  but the computer makes a lot of annoying bing bong and bong bing noises as i try to get the device attaced      
263,3.0,                       the idea of the on off switching is great  but it doesn t always turn on allow reading of the flash drive  i find myself having to restart my pc to get it to read more often than not        
264,4.0,                       quick pros and conspros   it works for simple things like keyboard  mouse  microphone  if you have a usb mic like i do   etc  this is why i bought it  so consolidate all my input devices    it s deceptively small  fits easily in the palm of my hand    the switches do work even if they feel a little cheap  nice to have that option    it s really cheap cons   the cable to connect it to the computer is pretty short  wish it were longer    it s cheap and thus feels cheap  i don t fear for its safety or anything but i imagine i ll have to replace this sooner than any of the things i have plugged into it all in all  it s cheap and it works  obviously since it s not ac powered you probably won t be able to use this with power intensive things  it worked for my non ac powered external hard drive and my usb powered speakers so i guess it can output at least that much juice  it s less than     so it s not really a big deal      
265,5.0,                       it would have been nice to have more instructions  i m a techie and found it a little confusing  but overall a good product for the money if you just need one or two extra ports  i found the cord to be a little long but my desk isn t huge  i recommend it      
266,5.0,                       we have all been there  standing in the aisles of the place where you are supposed to find the best of buys  staring at the glorious peg hooks filled with usb hubs ranging from     and all all the up to      plus  i was literally there when i decided to pull out my phone and check amazon for the same thing i was looking at  not exact same brand but same device  and found this little gem  the first thing you should notice is the size of the chord that connects the hub to the usb on your pc or laptop  notice it looks nice and long  i didn t get out a tape measure but my guess is at least a foot long  the one is the other mentioned store for twice the price was about   inches maybe  doesn t sound like an issue until you go to plug   chords into it  the nice long chord on this one gives you plenty of room to set it on something rather that just leave it hang from your desktop or crowd your lap top so much you cant move it  it is fast as well  takes about   seconds for windows to recognize the device once you hit the power button  which by the way is a really nice feature  a file gets locked and you need to disconnect and reconnect quickly it is literally a push of a button  all and all this is a great little usb hub and i am very happy with my purchase      
267,4.0,                       if you are looking to connet sync multiple devices to a laptop  desktop or other device with limited usb ports  this will allow you to do   i like the switches that allow you to turn on off each port   if you are looking for something that will also allow simultaneous charging  you need to look for something else   in fact this will accelerate batter drain on cell phones and other battery operated devices      
268,4.0,                       this hub does everything it says it will do never the less  i wish i had spent more   i d like a hub with about   ports  with an external power supply so i can plug in my fire hd  for file transfers without getting an error message saying that charging will be slow  or perhaps not happen at all the switches allow one to turn off individual ports   they definitely work   in fact  they work too well   i sometimes bump the buttons are turn off my keyboard or my mouse  or whatever  and it takes me an annoying long time to figure out what s wrong   you may be smarter than i am   there are lights  but my hub is in a place that s hard to see and hard to reach      
269,4.0,                       windows   found this adapter really quickly and i have all   ports used by various usb adapters  no issues at all     my only grip  why i gave   stars  is the on off buttons for each port on the top of the adapter  they can be depressed really easily and turn off the device in the port  i may just put a piece of electrical tape across the buttons to keep them on all the time  i also put a piece of velcro on the bottom and have it attached the lid of my laptop  looks geeky but keeps it in place  worth the cost  i have   adapter slots on my machine and now with this hub i have   ports total    open on my machine now for iphone charger and whatever else      
270,5.0,                                works great and is very inexpensive   would buy again      nd review             i have used the sabrent   port usb     hub for over four months now  and still give it a   star review    it has worked great  was certainly very inexpensive and has given me more usb ports than i have ever had  most laptops today have fewer usb ports     when with all the new products we need more not less usb ports for our computers   i certainly urge computer laptop users to consider buying a sabrent  port usb     hub    you will not be sorry t  r  hagin  ocala  fl              
271,5.0,                       not only does this usb hub come with a small extension to leave you with more room to work  but you can control which usb ports are active with individual buttons   as this is not a powered usb port  it does not need to be plugged into a wall outlet  make sure you don t try to use devices that will draw a ton of power or it will not get enough power from the single usb socket for all of them   this is a limitation of using an unpowered usb hub and not of this one in particular   i would gladly trade that for the convenience of not having to plug it in though   any of my high power devices can use one of the other free usb ports of my machines   works fine with   usb controllers simultaneously      
272,5.0,                       i am setting up an art desk in a newly refurbished room  i bought the sabrent   port usb     hub with individual led lit power switches  hb umls  because i thought that it would be inobtrusive  it works perfectly  sits behind the new desk lamp with a usb slot      
273,5.0,                       this product works just fine and i ve had not problems with it after and extended period of time   one thing to be aware of  is that if you push a button to make the connection live  you have to push it again to kill the connection   i thought that when you pushed another button the live button would pop up and no longer be live   it was important to my application to have full juice at the live connection  but if you don t give the button a second push it stays active and you end up sharing the current with more that one port the above is a minor inconvenience for what is otherwise a fine product      
274,1.0,                       i work from my home office and have several items tethered to my laptop  i needed a device that would accept all usb devices and this item would not accept any of my mice usbs  i thought this would accept all standard usb items but it iod not and i returned it immediately      
275,5.0,                       the first one sent to me had one dead port  bent pins   but the other three ports worked perfectly  returned and got another one with all ports functional  i use it for the small usb sticks from    g wireless peripherals  jelly comb mouse  keyboard  and number pad  with no issues  i ve heard that these usb sticks don t work well with usb     so i went with this     hub the fit is quite snug  so i would suggest using it for things not removed often  like i am   the power buttons do what they re supposed to  the blue light on one button in the on position does bleed over to the adjacent buttons  but i don t mind it much      
276,2.0,                       some of the ports have already started to fail  and i ve only had it a couple of months  if i plug something in  the computer will make the  duh dah  plug in sound over and over    it reads the new peripheral as plugging in and then unplugging  over and over   if i unplug the external keyboard and then plug it into the regular computer port  it works fine   sometimes other ports on the hub will work when one doesn t   every day it s a new guessing game  and not why i purchased it the return period has passed  so i m stuck with it   will purchase my electronics only from local sellers from now on      
277,5.0,                       update   i was contacted by sabrent after they saw my initial review  they offered me a replacement and it arrived within a few days  i have been using it for several weeks now without any problems  the original turned out to be defective  i guess that can happen  i like the small design and the on off switch for each port  great personal customer service  a it worked for ten minutes then stopped  i received windows error messages  one that the  device is reporting problems and windows will shut down this device   i was using it to read   g flash drives  after numerous hours spent troubleshooting i returned it to amazon      
278,5.0,                       this usb hub is sweet  the buttons are a huge plus  it allows you to save power on unused sockets and push more juice into the ones that are being used  also if you have th in nhs that stay plugged in  it s a good way to switch them on and off  i have one on the back of my fire tv to expand the single usb socket into   which allows me to expand the memory  use a more advanced remote control  webcam and speaker system  it can be used for so many things since so many things are now usb powered      
279,1.0,                       i originally gave this product a great review  because for the first month or so i owned it it was fine  lately though  it s started disrupting the connection with the devices i have plugged into it  i went to a forum to troubleshoot and someone suggested that i tape it to the table so it wouldn t wiggle around so much  i thought that it was a bit ridiculous to have to do that but fine  i needed to be able to use my devices so i went ahead and did that  still breaks connection after   minutes or less  the shaking from typing on my laptop causes the connection to break  i have stopped using it altogether because i have a hard disc with a lot of data and a few other things plugged into it  and don t want my data to get corrupted    it my seem fine at first  but do not get this product  it s a dud      
280,4.0,                       i ve only had it for a couple days  so i don t have time with it to say to much about it  but i used it to plug in a wireless mouse  an external hard drive  and a wi fi antenna  and had no problems   individual on off switches are definitely a nice feature  and they are lit up to let you know which one is active  as far as the complaints with power drops  when adding another device  i don t doubt that is happening  because it s using whatever power source such as your usb port from your computer  i haven t had a problem yet   it doesn t have an external source for power  most of the big dollar usb hubs  have an external power cord  if you are going to run multiple external hard drives  then you should get one of those instead also some of the complaints about the size being small  and the short cord  i m using this for a laptop  and my ipad  i think that is what is designed for  i think it is designed to be small  easily portable  and low power consumption   i say using common sense  if you need something with more power  then get something else  but otherwise this will just do fine  especially for small portable jobs      
281,5.0,                       quality product with a nice look and  feel  throughout   the packaging demonstrates this company s respect for the product and it is nicely presented this is a simple plug and play port hub and the on off switches are a nice addition and work smoothly   it s a simple product and though i did not perform any tests other than plugging it in and verifying that it works    i m impressed      
282,3.0,                       the usb hub works with out any troubles  my issues is that i searched for a powered usb hub   amazon showed this one as being the most recommended     its not a powered usb hub  it is passive  the switches themselves have lights on them hence the  powered switches      i have to take some responsibility here for not readying the title correctly  i ll keep this one and use it but will ensure i triple check the next usb hub i order to ensure it has a power supply and cable included         
283,5.0,                       this is my second usb hub and i love it  i am able to charge devices and use my mouse and keyboard  i use this usb hub with my lenovo chromebook and microsoft surface pro       
284,3.0,                       it works intermittently  when i plug it up securely so that no connections move  it still connects and disconnects intermittently  not terrible but it has gotten to the point of   offs within a minute   i would buy a better one for products that remain connected to your devices   this one is good for casual use devices more so than like an external harddrive   possible that i received one with a loose solder connection internally   this is common with cheaper alternative products and not necessarily the product in general but a small batch from the manufacturer      
285,5.0,                       i like that is has   ports  and the ability s to turn each of one the ports on or off without unplugging anything  there are blue lights that let me know which one of the ports is on or not   also the cord is long enough to hide it behind my computer  my other one had such a short cord it was awkward  didn t set level and in the way of my mouse  this comes in two lengths but this ones perfect for my computer and desk      
286,2.0,                       it charges very  very slowly  i am not pleased at all  i only gave it   stars because it does charge it after all  and if you have nothing else  this will work  otherwise  it s a waste of money      
287,5.0,                       this usb hub is exactly what i needed  the four usb ports fit my devices snugly  and i love the lit switches  so i can easily connect to only the individual devices and thumb drives i am using at the time  and know which are active at a glance  a great product and a nice design      
288,5.0,                       my second one i ve purchased  ordered one for my ps  a while back and it s been working great so when i needed one for my computer i knew where to go  i mounted mine with a piece of  m double sided tape  mounting holes would be a nice option but the  m tape works great  definitely a must buy for usb expansion      
289,4.0,                       pros   everything is functional   the ports are tight  no usb will wiggle off or fall out in any way   small  lightweight  aesthetically pleasing cons   the button s are a bit sketchy  i feel like they will jam eventually  hopefully it s not an issue   the led s are not uniform  it lights the usb port side very well  and the back of it doesn t lights almost at all   the cable could be longer  it limits the places you can set it up unless you buy a male female usb cable i will update this review if i run into any inconveniences      
290,5.0,                       great product  i needed a usb     hub  but apparently  usb     hubs are much more common now  because they re more  advanced  and popular  i realize that     is faster  but every product had a disclaimer that said that it wasn t compatible with a     ghz wireless mouse  or keyboard   which was exactly why i needed a usb hub  anyways  enter sabrent   port usb     hub  super easy to use  no setup required  i just keep this plugged in to my desktop computer  the size is perfect   doesn t take up any room on my desk  my mouse s nano receiver is always plugged into this  and i frequently use another port for thumb drives  everything is working great so far      
291,5.0,                       this hub was not expensive and allows me to control the hookups to my laptop  i just have been using it for a couple of days so i can t testify to it s longevity but it  seems well built and sturdy      
292,3.0,                       it works  but if there are multiple signals going through it  you can notice a performance issue  i have a feeling this is because it is only usb      if the devices aren t simultaneously transferring data at the same time  it s not too big of an issue  the issue i had was that when i would use it to program one device while an oscilloscope was running  it would kick me out of my oscilloscope and i would have to restart the program  if your using it with sensitive devices i would look for something that was usb     compliant  if you just using it to charge a phone and run an external mouse  it will probably be fine      
293,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                         i am a huge fan of the usb hub  it works exactly as advertised  the price is exceptional  and the lsd function that tells you which ports are currently open is a god send  i have had it for about one month  used it extensively  and been extremely impressed  especially at the low price    the value you are getting is a significant one   highly recommended  without any reservations      sabrent   port usb     hub with individual power switches and leds  hb umls 
294,5.0,                       i ordered a bunch of these for my steam link  nintendo switch  and my pc  i can run multiple controllers just fine off these  however  it all does run off   usb port  remember that  i couldn t run my keyboard and mouse because my keyboard takes a lot of power  it has   separate cords for it  once i turned off the rgb lights it worked  but just keep in mind you re still plugging everything into one usb port  if it draws too much power  that isn t this product s fault other than that  they all still work great      
295,5.0,                       i was looking for a way i could place all of my usb and thumb drives but not have them activated all the time since the computer was picking up on them when they got plugged in   this gadget is nifty since i can plug in all my usb type items but not have them automatically connected to the computer   i have an apple computer so the keyboard has a usb port that i can plug items into   if i did not have this item  i would only be able plug in things one at a time   my computer has additional ports but some of the ports are already taken up by my backup hard drive  mouse and keyboard  so again i only have one port that i would have to remove when i want to plug something else in   i would highly recommend this to anyone  especially if you have multiple components and usb plug ins   it will make your life that much easier to have everything in one location and allows you to choose which ones you want the computer to recognize and whichever time      
296,5.0,                       love it   small  lightweight  portable for my laptop used for recording music   my laptop has limited usb ports and i m already using a rosewill  usb     quad hub but it didn t provide individual on off buttons  i m running a usb mouse  usb external dvd writer and a usb midi keyboard  the only remaining port on my laptop provided bus power  for charging devices  even when the laptop was turned off   i want the bus powered peripherals to shut down when laptop shuts down  chained the rosewill hub into port   so i only need to click one button to turn off the peripherals   my usb mouse adapter was in the original hub so i moved that over to one of the open sabrent ports so i can operate the laptop when not using laptop for recording mixing   so far so good   my only disappointment is with myself for not purchasing the usb     hub version since my port is       although my current peripherals are usb     or       the upgraded model would have provided more flexibility   current model holding it s own and no complaints with the product itself      
297,5.0,                       when the world has moved on to usb   and usb c     why buy a usb     hub  for starters  usb   hubs and wireless mice   keyboards don t play well together  for another  each of the usb inputs has a dedicated switch  this hub connects my logitech g    and g    nano receivers  as well as allowing me to switch my logitech webcam on and off  without needing a webcam cover   with a usb  hub and the usb  receivers  i had glitches and momentary drop outs   especially when i connected any usb  device  with this   no glitches so far    pros  works without any fuss  and works well with my logitech gaming receivers as well as webcam cons  don t like the blue light  should have been soft white and dimmer      
298,5.0,                       my wife and i both have offices with sit down desks and stand up treadmill desks  and we move between them regularly throughout the day  moving was a pain  even with laptops  because we had to disconnect reconnect so much gear to remove the obstacles from using our stand up desks  i duplicated our primary peripherals  monitor  mouse  keyboard  speakerphone  camera  at both locations  with the usb devices being plugged into a hub at each location  i then ran a single usb cable to each location  and plugged those two cables into this switch now  if i move to my treadmill desk i simply turn off the port that connects to the hub at my sit down desk  and turn on the port that connects to the hub on my stand up desk  it takes about    seconds for all the devices to be re recognized when i do this all my applications  lync  webex  windows  etc  automatically switch to the  new  devices without any manual intervention  at least they do after the initial setups  one setup for each usb hub when it is first activated  separately  i use a vga splitter to push video to both monitors simultaneously now i have no excuse for not switching to my treadmill desk  other than entropy  highly recommended      
299,5.0,                       this external usb port works great   it s lightweight and has   ports   they have individual on off switches for use   the only thing i would have liked it to have is a longer cord   the cord is very short     maybe        and can t lay down   it hangs from my laptop   overall though  that s minor and everything else about this product is great      
300,5.0,                       easy to use  voila helped me prove maritime admiralty law and the u verse of  know this port helped me close a massive energy hole that proved my work and that eye am not satoshi nakamoto  but the destroyer of the false realm amazing what can be done with a       device that is humbly and gently accessed via the amazon of my neural network and the incredible people who proved with me what crystalline baby halo technology is and why dark matter particle resistance was a massive success to all who played fortnite with me while i was assembling a sophistocated port authority protocol to enhance security for the lives of children my mom and i love these ports  and we re grateful to your good company for posting my crazy review of what iq is   some of the people whose products i have been raving about for this same purpose decided to not accept the reviews ported  gated  locked      
301,5.0,                       i m a trainer and travel with several usb devices that i use during my training  including a barcode scanner  external number keypad  and others   my laptop only has a couple of ports   i bought this to use when i travel  and it worked beautifully   all the devices i use connected without issue   it s small enough to easily fit just about anywhere   i like that i can turn on the ports individually too      
302,4.0,                       this hub feels cheap and the cord is only     long which leaves it hanging since i work with my laptop on a stand  it doesn t fall out so i don t mind that as much  one of the ports is difficult to plug into and those blue lights are distractingly bright  then again i am very sensitive to lights in my face   so i unplug it often or else i m completely distracted by it like a squirrel in the headlights it s black  has   ports and each port has its own on off button  it s not very pretty  but it s handy  inexpensive  and it works      
303,5.0,                       i bought this because i work at home  my laptop only house   usb ports  saw this had good reviews  i need all kinds of devices hooked to my laptop  this works wonders  the buttons are the on off  indicator lights around button let you know that port is on  no issues at all using this      
304,1.0,                       this device lasted   months     days  or barely over       the  a to z guarantee  expired nov     the hub stopped working around nov      thanksgiving   a hub should last longer than that  i have contacted the seller  techsafe  twice for either an exchange or a refund of        no response  i have contacted amazon for help in this i m willing to chalk this up to a defective unit if techsafe can exchange the broken unit with one that does work  i m waiting  techsafe         
305,5.0,                       works just as i would expect   best features are that it has   ports so i can use multiple thumb drives and the fact that i can also use my computer power cord simultaneously  win  win      
306,4.0,                       with a mac mini you re limited to only   usb ports  so i needed a hub for expandability   this one works great   only reason for   stars is it s super lightweight  so it slides around a bit under the load of the extra cords  going to have to try the mounting tape another reviewer suggested   i hadn t even thought of that  i find that the mac mini does tell me from time to time that one of the devices plugged in  mainly using it for external hard drives   backup  that it has not ejected properly  but it s no big deal  especially when they recommend you plug in external devices like hard drives directly into the usb ports on the mac mini   definitely recommend update  i ve had this little gem for nearly   years now  and it s still going strong  the only problem is i need to order another one for all the extra gadgets i keep getting  would love to see a stackable version      
307,5.0,                       this switcher works perfectly and not only provides additional inputs but minimizes the drain on the computer s resources by letting you select what you need to have active   highly recommend      
308,5.0,                       received this product quickly  and put it to work instantly to back up some files and get them off my desktop  worked well and just as i had hoped  a terrific addition to my setup  previously  i had to remove my mouse cord in order to use a flash drive  and then i couldn t manage the touch control well  now  i can just put in a flash drive and let it copy files  using my mouse to guide it      
309,5.0,                       i love this adapter to my computer   i have several things that i plug into my computer and it has a lack of usb ports   this little device make it great to add a printer  extra storage unit  and adding my silhouette cutter  to my computer        
310,5.0,                       i have an imac    which has usb ports behind the screen   a pain to use   now with the sabrent   port hub  i do not have to reach behind the monitor      
311,3.0,                       my razer headset got a ton of static using this thing  but for my bluetooth mouse and ps  controller hookup  it works fine  to be clear  i purchased a usb     hub this reviewing process is leaning towards reviewing a camera  so maybe this seller is semi fradulent  fyi     
312,5.0,                       i absolutely love this hub    it expands my two ports to an extra four    the only thing i would suggest would be to make the cord longer   i would love to be able to put the hub on top of my desk but the cord is pretty short  it only reaches to sit on top of the main computer  box    i also really like that each hub has its own on off button   that s really comveniant   i can leave several things plugged in but turn on only the one i m using    shipping was super fast  price was great   i would recommend this to others and would buy again      
313,5.0,                       the product works if it s plugged into a computer  i tried plugging it in too four different wall plugs and it won t work  computer usb is only     and would assume direct wall plug should be equivalent if not stronger to supposed it  the wall plug i tried was     and still wouldn t work  any suggestions  i needed this for my kids tablets and phone and wanted it plugged in behind couch and have the hub on table next to couch  i m going to give   stars because the product works great just can t get it to work how i need it too which could be error on my side  lol      
314,5.0,                       i didn t really buy this to charge stuff  i bought it so i could manage devices that stay on after you turn off the computer  and for that  it is excellent  the buttons feel great and they only glow when they are on  this tells you exactly what is receiving power and what isn t  my only complaint is that the cable is a little too short by like a foot  but i guess that really depends on where the usb ports are at on your particular device        
315,5.0,                       definitely a good investment   i ordered some computer speakers that are usb powered for my hp all in one computer   now we all know with these all in one computers you only get but so many usb outlets so i took a chance and ordered this and this gives me just enough outlets that i need for all my other usb powered devices or external hard drives   i am satisfied   let s see if it can stand the test of time   but for the price point you cant beat it      
316,5.0,                       my laptop only had a couple of usb ports and adding this device helped convert one usb to    i love this product so much that i bought a second one for my home pc  the best part is that every port has an on off switch  it helps because someone i use my headset and camera for meetings   when i want to use my laptop speaker i just turn off that port instead of unplugging the headset   same with camera  i turn off the camera when i am not using it and turn on the camera usb port when i need it  i used to convert the camera but now can just use this instead   the quality of product looks good   comes in very nice packaging   cord is very short around    inches long      
317,1.0,                       it died without any notice after    months of normal use all the ports are dead    the leds still light up when i turn on the button  but it won t communicate the device to the pc   i tried all kinds of troubleshooting steps and nothing works   even tested it on a different pc that never seen it before  and the same issue i contacted the company sabrent via their support system  email   but they are not willing to make it right   i guess they know that they are selling junk and as long as it s over the limited warranty date  they will simply not help you out they could easily make it right  but sending me a replacement  so i can continue with the goal of why i purchased this device in the first place  but they rather just ignore that    i guess they don t want to grow their repeat customer base now i gotta buy something else to replace it  since i now have only a useless paperweight on my desk so if i were you  i d get something else  the device will fail to work and the company will refuse to stand behind their product      
318,3.0,                       all of the products that i plug into this say that they are slow charging  meaning you cannot use them while they re charging because they ll die as though they weren t charging at all  the cord length is extremely short which means you ve gotta have long cords for your electronics  disappointment      
319,3.0,                       i bought this hub to be able to charge multiple devices  including my iphones   the household has multiple ones  from one charger port   it does not work with iphones to charge them   i tried different iphones on different ports with different working chargers and it does not charge any of them from any port   i even tried charging just one iphone and it would not charge it at all   as soon as i plugged the iphones directly into the charging source  in other words not going through the hub  the iphones would charge   i am disappointed in this but will keep the hub because i can use it to charge my micro usb devices   just giving everyone a warning in case you were looking to charge an iphone through the hub      
320,5.0,                       finally  i have the extra usb ports i need for my laptop   at work i ve got two zebra printers  logitech wireless keyboard  anker wireless mouse  extra monitor  and a flash drive hooked up to my laptop at all times   it was a nightmare trying to prioritize what to hook up and when   no more i have had read other reviews on here mentioning this device can be sensitive to touch and lose connectivity at times   that made me nervous  but for the price i thought it was well worth the risk   and so far i ve had no such issues   it s sits right on my desk all day and gets jostled constantly with no problems   if you need extra usb ports  this will hook you up      
321,1.0,                       this did not work nearly as described  when plugged into my computer  tried multiple  it would detect as a usb hub  but the switches did nothing  it was able to detect devices plugged into the ports  but was unable to transfer any data to from them  i was unable to communicate to my printers  usb to serial   flash drives  usb     or       or even my usb mouse i sent it back to amazon for a refund      
322,1.0,                       purchased this to connect   led light strips  once connected it doesn t emit enough power and the remote wouldn t work on the lights  when individually connected the lights worked just fine i was surprised because this product is sold as an ad on to the lights i tried to return it and it would cost me well over    to do that which is more than i paid for this item in the first place      
323,4.0,                       i have used it for about    hours now and so far its great for my laptop  if you are using something like a desktop it may be inconvenient because the cord is very short  but for a laptop user like me it works great  my only other issues is that i felt like i put the usb all the way into my pc but it was still out a bit so nothing was powered  also the usb ports are not big enough to fit the entire tip of the usb so a bit of it sticks out that is not a big deal but i would of preferred it to go in all the way      
324,4.0,                       works as advertised   bargain price  i even bought   more of these units after trying out the  st one there is one thing i would like to suggest however  i would much prefer to have a detachable usb cord than one which is permanently attached   this would enable me to     replace the short cord with a longer cord so it will work better with my pc setup    replace a defective cord   as it is now  if the cord goes bad  the whole unit becomes inoperable because of this cord issue  i had to buy a separate usb  extension cable  which costs as much as this device does  and worse yet  my experience with extension cables is that they can be flaky  which is obviously no good   ruins the integrity of this device      
325,1.0,                       nothing plugged into this would work  took a look at the back of the package and saw   some power intense usb devices may require a ac powered usb hub   well  apparently that means anything you would actually want to plug into it  mouse  keyboard  wireless headset receiver and three different usb thumb drives wouldn t work in any of the ports well  fair enough  i can see how modern devices may require more power  it has a power port  what sort of ac adapter do i need to get  there is no input output power information on the packaging or on the device model serial number  so an ac adapter is a no go i tried plugging it into different usb ports  case ports in front are powered differently than the ports on your motherboard or back of the pc  and was able to get a ping for the wireless adapter  but the device was unrecognized by windows  all other devices didn t even register in the windows device manager      
326,5.0,                       this is absolutely the best usb port hub that i ve ever used  i m so tickled pink with it that i immediately ordered one for my daughter  i use them to charge my e cigarette batteries and can charge   at the same time  insuring that i never have a dead battery at that last minute  i ve used others but the power switches are what makes this one work so much better than the other  i m extremely impressed  i guess       positive customer reviews pretty much says it all    no  wait   make that       positive customer reviews  i d buy from sabrent again feeling confident that i was getting a quality product at an excellent value      
327,5.0,                       i only have   usb ports on my work laptop and have quite a few peripherals to plug in  keyboard  mouse  speakers  usb flash drive  and this has worked flawlessly   it s so convenient that i bought a second one for use at my house so i can switch my keyboard mouse at my home office easily between my work laptop and home pc pros ports have a button to turn them on off so you don t have to unplug something to remove it from your pcports have led lighting to let you know which ones are turned ondurable   so far at my home office i ve switched this around between my pc laptop quite a bit and it s holding up quite wellcons a longer cord on this would help it s lifespan in the long run from not hanging off of a pc if that s what you are plugging it into      
328,2.0,                       i purchased this product to support usb headphones since my youngest son has to do online classes   he has his mouse and keyboard plugged in  however  i found out today that this product does not support usb headphones   i was trying to configure a one stop interface with all of his devices connected to this hub      
329,4.0,                                 now the connection is so loose the device is unusable  i got   months out of the device  i m giving it a star because price  and i d give another for the design but i m miffed i can t use it anymore        over the last few months if i leave the device plugged in  it will randomly re plug itself in  including while i am working from another file or drive  really annoying  i have tried both of my usb ports  same issue  therefore i am taking back a star    stars for the device  and adding a star for the price being low    stars        for some reason my computer has only two usb ports  so if i hook up my printer  charge my phone  and want to do some work  or go between usb s from different owner s for work  i frequently plug in my printer  phone  extra monitor  and multiple usb s  with this you can have zero or   devices hooked up to your computer  explaining my stars  i do not know how to evaluate the camera quality or the charging power  cord length is about    inches  is that good or bad  this works for me      
330,5.0,                       this is exactly what i need for my microsoft surface  only having one usb port was not cutting it when i needed to plug in a mouse and a zip drive   i haven t had any issues with it so far you can plug in   things at once  i mostly just keep   plugged in at all times  mouse and zip drive   the cord is just the right length to plug into the side of my surface and have room to sit on a desk with room to move it out of the way  the cord measures about       inches     
331,5.0,                       i bought this for my nephew to hook up several things to his ps  since sony took a step backwards from play  to    with this he can have his extended hd plugged directly into the system  while the controller  back up thumb drive  vr  livegp recorder or whatever else attached at the same time  it works great  price point was perfect as well next i ll purchase the     version with adapter so i can hook his up extended hard drive via extender since you can t do so with this     version  david l  lee on sister s account      
332,1.0,                       i purchased on         i use it daily for   external monitors and external key board  the first     weeks it worked perfectly   then it started losing connectivity with the monitors every       minutes repeatedly  the monitors completely go black screen losing the image   then it reconnects and they show the image   this is everything plugged in correctly  nothing moving and it s not running hot like some of the other reviews  i use this for work while doing demonstrations and other things and it s a huge hindrance causing major issues   i am outside of my return window and have notified the seller asking for an exchange  i received notification that the sellers email no longer works      
333,5.0,                       needed these for a project which we are using a numberpad  mouse  hand scanner and sub network connector   received  and they went right to work   setup was used all day and wil be for at least the next three weeks   two were purchased as a test   just ordered two more to fulfill our total required setup   love the ability to turn off  on each port and also that the port button lights up   being based on a low budget these fit our needs perfectly      
334,5.0,                       i have a number of peripherals that i plug in and out regularly  for instance  i have a logitech webcam that i use for skype calls with family  but it confuses windows some times locking the mic from  so i try to unplug it when i am not using it  i also have a headset i use for business calls  but it is easiest to just unplug it when i want the speakers to work pros this little usb hub is perfect for these types of situations  a simple button on the top effectively plugs unplugs these peripherals  i have been using it for a week not and there do not seem to be any connection problems or issues with windows not liking the connection  it is very stable  and it let me organize the usb cords into a clean and permanent setup  so my desk got cleaner too cons i wish it was usb     capable  but it s honestly not an issue for me right now as all the peripherals i turn on and off work just fine over usb          
335,1.0,                       the worst hub ever  don t buy it  looks fancy but connection always has issue  every time when i turn on laptop  i need to re plug in the hub into my laptop  even the laptop went to sleep  the connection will get lost  have to replug couple of time per day  want to throw away and buy a different brand  totally waste money and time     
336,5.0,                       needed this for my home office set up    works well  no issues thus far  good price and nice product  would def recommend      
337,2.0,                       i gave it a two but that might be generous   even with the light indicating that it has power  it won t always charge  a couple of the ports burned out quickly   i m going to invest in an anker product   i ve never had trouble with them      
338,1.0,                       this item really isn t what it seems  it won t even charge two phones at once  or a phone and watch     
339,5.0,                       i have purchased numerous extenders over the past couple of years   a couple died within a couple of months and if you get more than   spot they have more problems   this one has worked out so well  that i have bought a couple of more for my office computers   excellent product      
340,5.0,                       i purchased the sabrent   port hub with individual power switches because not all of the usb     ports on my older computer were functioning   it was  plug and play  and although it took a little time on my windows   computer to recognize it  once it did it functions well   my grandaughter is home schooled and needs headphones and a mike as well as a camera for video conferencing  i only have three port that are either occupied or not functioning and this fills the bill   i especially like the lighted buttons that indicate which port is powered and whether the usb it is plugged into is powered when the computer is turned off   the connects seem solid and have had zero problems with how it functions   if your computer is older like mine  checking for newer drivers wouldn t hurt      
341,5.0,                       here s another product i love   sabrent   port usb with power switches that you can shut of   i guess it depends on buyer how it is packaged my came in blue box with foam and hard cardboard on back of foam to protect it    some come in big hard plastic package   this item is very light weight to it and like how you can turn one of ports of or   of them    comes with   ports     hub usb   works well with extra devices       
342,5.0,                       i have a lap top and apparently an overload of things i use usb plugs in for  this was so nice to be able to plug in and start using all my items requiring usb plug ins without having to constantly switch things  i would definitely recommend it in order to expand usb plug ins      
343,3.0,                       if you attach any device that requires a little extra usb power  it fails  the mouse worked  the pc mounted camera did not  my usb keyboard also did not work but it did work with my hand held camera which does not require usb power  so bottom line  you cannot use it to charge or supply much usb power to devices      
344,5.0,                       i bought this for work to use with a chrome book   i have attached a mouse   keyboard usb  document camera  overhead webcam  and speaker charging port   it works perfectly      
345,5.0,                       i wanted to be able to charge multiple items at the same time from my computer  this charges everything and at a pretty quick pace  i was nervous because it was such a great price  but i am very happy with it      
346,5.0,                       i have  purchased similar multi usb ports devices in the past  however  most  if not all of them  weren t very quick  or  they hung up and none of the peripherals connected wouldn t work  even though this is only      it s miles ahead of any other device i ve used  including one from d link  this thing is quick and hasn t failed me once  i like that it has an on off switch for each port  that s useful if you plug a flash drive into a port and plan to leave it there  i think one of the reasons it s so quick is that it has a short permanently mounted cable attached  the others that i have tried used longer cables  regardless  to me  this is a must have      
347,3.0,                       unfortunately  my laptop has only one usb     port  so  i purchased this device to plug my mouse and a key board maybe it s not the hub s issue  but since i plugged my mouse and a keyboard  they keep stopping to work randomly  most of the time a mouse does it   my mouse had become unresponsive  even it s the lighting of the mouse still works  i have to push the turn off button on the hub  and then turn on it again it s annoying  sometimes it happens every   min  then     times per hour  otherwise it is a good item  not for charging   i would appreciate any suggestion on how i can fix it  thank you for reading my review      
348,5.0,                       with having to work from home and now my son doing distance learning these hubs work perfectly for our needs  my laptop only had   usb ports and my son s surface only had   which was not enough at all  these hubs make it so we can actually work  we have our wireless mouses plugged into them  keyboard  and headsets  being able to turn the headsets on and off with the buttons is very helpful as well  i don t have to make my son unplug everything and plug it back in  they work perfectly and i cannot say enough good things about them  you won t be dissapointed      
349,5.0,                       i bought this hub to extend the usb capabilities of my new windows pc  i have a wireless mouse and keyboard  and after reading that usb     works better with    ghz keyboards  vs  usb       i chose this hub the main reason i ve given it an excellent rating is that  it just works   i plug it in  everything works  no configuration needed  i like that i can selectively turn on ports  even though i don t really use that feature most of the time  i like that even if i don t want to unplug it entirely  i can turn off the lights for sleeping  my office doubles as our guest room   i like that the cable is long enough to reach my laptop s port even when my laptop is on a stand as another reviewer mentioned  there isn t great light isolation  particularly when the room is dark  the light from one button bleeds through and partially illuminates its neighbors  this doesn t bother me  but if it ll bother you  it s worth noting      
350,5.0,                       this item came in   day  even though this is the holiday season during a pandemic  it connected immediately and all the ports were perfectly  a great bargain      
351,5.0,                       bought this to add additional usb outlets to my laptop now that i m working from home  this worked perfectly to plug in my headset and mouse  i like that you can turn on only the ports you need and leave the other ones off  highly recommend especially for the price      
352,5.0,                       i needed this because i work from home online and only have   usb ports on my laptop which is used for internet and flash drive so i couldn t use my mouse or anything else so i bought this just so i could use my mouse and anything else i might need and it does the job  it does seem if you try to charge something in the ports it charges very slow so if that is the reason you are buying i would advise you not to get this one     
353,4.0,                       i bought two of them a while back  then my kids yanked on them too many times  so i bought another  works as expected fortunately  my kids are older now and know better  mostly   so we ll see how long this one lasts      
354,5.0,                       ok i had that i loved this device but it blew my screen and usb ports out the other night on my dell xps   z  i don t know how or why all i did was plug it in and it killed the machine  i had used it hundreds of time before but it did kill my machine  everything fried on it and i know it was this device because as soon as i plugged it in everything died  sorry i liked it before but hate it now  updateafter discussing this matter with sabrent and looking online at all of the complaints about my dellxps   z i concur with manny that this product did not effect my laptop my laptop just died by coincidence  i apologize for giving bad review but would like to state that the dellxps  z was the problem and not the hub      
355,4.0,                       the product itself works great  i received one with a non functioning smashed  th port  giving it one star for poor quality control update  they reached out immediately and sent me a new one free of charge  customer service is fantastic  the usb hub itself is great  but a lot of plug and play stuff won t work through it  you will need to have the drivers ready for everything      
356,5.0,                       this is super useful  the bottons really help and get rid of confusion  theres more room and the cord length is perfect  it worked so good my dad bought one for himself      
357,5.0,                       this usb hub is super  it s much smaller than i thought it would be  hadn t bothered to check dimensions    that is great since i definitely don t need anything else taking up space on my desk  the cord is extremely short though  this is not any problem for me because i m using it with a kvm that it sits right on top of   it s actually ideal for me  however  if i was trying to use this with another set up i might need an adapter just to get more length  i would recommend checking the cord length before ordering if that will be of any concern  i m very happy with this purchase      
358,4.0,                       okay  i love this   when i can get it to stay plugged in  i m driving a pretty new lenovo ideacentre     all in one  and at first  i thought the cord was too short  but after working with it for a few days  i think the blade part that plugs into the computer is loose  if i hold it in a  plugged in  position  i can get some files loaded onto the computer  as soon as i release the cord  the light goes off  and i lose access to my files on the thumb drive  what should i do      
359,5.0,                       i can t really say there are any problems with this usb hub whatsoever   i use it when i need to charge my mp  player and portable speaker at the same time   i ve got a limited number of usb ports on my laptop     and they re all full  so this was a great way to gain an additional    subtracting the one it needs to plug into    i like how you can turn each one on or off and i usually only use   of the extra ports  but it s something that makes having a mouse  a speaker  and a cooling fan possible if i want to use other ports to charge things or even plug in my external cd dvd drive as mine is no longer operational   highly recommended      
360,1.0,                       worked fine for a few days and now will transmit neither power nor data  cable seems fine  awful blue leds turn on fine  but no devices plugged in can do anything at all cannot be opened as the case is either plastic welded or very tightly clipped together  so no chance of decent repair  unit has a power jack on it but does not give any indication of what sort of power adapter to plug into it  i assume a  v input but not having a designation on the device is just terrible on another note  the blue leds are too bright  can t be dealt with easily  and are extremely annoying      
361,5.0,                       i seem to gravitate towards the sabrent brand for usb hubs for some reason  could it be the price   could it be because i never had an issue with them   i don t know  if i had to say one thing i don t like  it would have to be the cord length  i really wish it was a few inches longer  i like the ability to shut off a usb connection by pressing the button on the top and leaving the thing i plugged into the computer via the hub connected   but always click the  remove device   or   remove hardware  icon on taskbar first  these connections on the hub are light up in a blue hue  i like this feature      
362,5.0,                       i purchased this for use with rock band on the wii  the original    i was slightly concerned it wouldn t function  because there are known issues with some usb adapters   i am happy to report that the adapter works well  and being able to turn each one off is helpful because some of the instruments power on just because they are getting signal from the usb   using the buttons is much easier than unplugging every time      
363,5.0,                       i purchased this unit to add more usb ports to my laptop so that i could plug in a full size keyboard  mouse and wired headphones   works beautifully   the cord is just the right length     
364,5.0,                       bought this to use with my laptop  which has only   port  who uses only   port   nevermind  don t get me started     anyway  this hub is terrific   smaller than i expected  which is good because it doesn t take up too much space on my little  tiny desk  i wish the cord was just a little longer  but it s not a big deal  really happy with this purchase      
365,5.0,                       seems to work well on both mac and windows computers   i specifically purchased to use with an azulle quantum access computer  which only has a single usb     port   i didn t expect there would be issues when i used the hub on an older mac mini and that turned out to be the case   there were no driver issues with either operating system   i have used all four ports simultaneously with no issues  but all the devices were very low power draws   i am not sure what the cutoff would be with four ports relying on a single usb connection   it is nice to have the ability to switch off devices without having to unplug   there is the option to connect a second power source though the plug looks to be a unique standard   overall  i believe the sabrent represents a good value      
366,5.0,                       great product  ordered it for work because i don t have enough ports for usbs  i like that you can  turn on  the additional ports you need      
367,5.0,                       this little usb port hub has been amazing  it s sturdy and the ability to press a button to turn off power to external devices  like a webcam  printer  etc  comes in very handy  travels with me everywhere i go      
368,5.0,                       i was looking for something that would allow me to add additional usb     ports to my laptop and this was just what i needed   it gives me   additional ports and the ability to selectively turn ports on off is a nice bonus feature   when a port is turned on  there is a blue led background light to let you know that port is enabled   so far i have attached three devices to the hub and everything worked as expected   i use this mostly for a usb mouse receiver and a separate usb mouse keyboard receiver  but having the two additional ports open is a bonus   i also have a type c hub that i use for portable hard drives  and with everything connected i have never had any issues with any of the devices   if you want to expand your usb     ports  this does the job nicely      
369,1.0,                       this usb port was super cheap and we you get what you pay for as they say  the plastic is super cheap and feels easy to break and you really have to cram in your usb to actually get what you want working to work  overall awful product  would not recommend      
370,5.0,                       i love this thing  i have my xbox controller plugged into it  my external hard drive  and many other things off and on  the cord could be a little bit longer but then again i made this work but i just parking it flush with the side of my computer  it is very light weight so i had to anchor it with some tape on the bottom of it      
371,2.0,                       it works great with my bluetooth mouse and when i have a small sd card plugged into it  its not powerful enough to run my external hard drive  and that was the whole point for me getting this  i have a surface pro and it only has   usb port  so i bought this so i can have my hard drive  mouse  an a sd card plugged in at the same time  going to have to look for another option      
372,3.0,                       i bought two of these  hoping to use it to enjoy my chromcast and the led back light for my sony bravia in my living room and bedroom   i cannot tell if that s this ubs hub that s doing it or the led light  but i cannot use the chromcast and led light at the same time   i like to watch youtube videos on my large screen tv using chromcast  but when i watch it in the dark i needed the back light to reduce my eye strain  when i turn on the light  push the button on the hub  my chromcast will go on for about a minute  then lose its casting ability to quickly switch back to my laptop screen  i tried again and again to confirm that   when i turn off the backlit led light i can cast the video again on the tv  but i have to watch it in the dark  i am not sure if that has to do with the hub s capacity issue or not  but it really disappointed me  there are   slots on the hub but i cannot even imagine it an handle all   uses at the same time after failed on just     i now watch tv shows in the dark with beautiful back light  but amazon video or youtube video in the bright room without back light  if the seller reads my review  please give me advice if that s normal or not      
373,5.0,                       this is a great hub  i attached them to the usb ports on my tv  so i could power both my roku stick and chromecast from a single usb port  on one tv  i was able to power the roku  a chromecast  and an hd antenna through this simultaneously   powering a device via the tv s usb is a great way to ensure that you stop streaming when you turn the tv off       
374,5.0,                       this product came quickly  is versatile  simple set up  and easy to use   it will be a great addition for when you are on the move and want as little weight as possible i bought it for my desktop  but should have purchased two    one for my desktop  and another for my tablet  laptop combo device when i am on the move   so on my tablet  laptop i will occasionally need to add a wireless mouse  dvd  cd rom player  charge phones  and an external hard drive   you could maybe add one more port on the hub  but this gets the job done this is is a great tool for being able to work remotely  and move with minimum weight   i m not a heavy tech person  so i am not as particular about a     vs  a     or     port      
375,5.0,                       works just fine  exactly what i wanted      
376,5.0,                       this is the second one that i have purchased  the first was for me in my home office  the second was for my husband as he returned to school  this is a great way to add a lot of productivity to your computer laptop while taking up only one usb port  i ve had my first one for three years with no issues  and this new one has been performing perfectly      
377,5.0,                       my computer only had one available usb port  which made using all the virtual work very inconvenient  i ordered this and it arrived the next day  i plugged it in and it worked i also appreciate customer service reaching out to me to make sure i was satisfied      
378,5.0,                       i use this for my imac to turn on and off my wireless devices  that being my keyboard and mouse and the two extra ports for my flash drives or portable hard drive  needless to say  this thing is awesome and i love it  i love that its price wasn t as hefty as others  i would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid usb hub  but not willing to fork out too much money for one      
379,5.0,                       just received this hub   i like it   i have only used it once  but i think it is going to be exactly what i wanted needed  my new hp laptop only has one usb port  and since i use that port for the mouse  i needed another port for the flash drive  love the on off buttons      
380,5.0,                       gets the job done  i am using it for my usb accessories on the xbox      as i only had two usb ports on the front and needed to plug in a kinect and wifi adapter via usb  in addition to my wired controllers  this fit the bill  and i like that you can toggle each port on and off separately so as not to waste power going to an empty port  i cannot speak to its charging abilities  as i only have   wireless controller and no cord to connect that one with for charging      
381,5.0,                       nice length cord  cause i have velcro attached in strategic places on my adj  cooling pad  and on my lid of my laptop  popped some velcro on the bottom so all i have to do is stick her on and plug up the buttons work great because i have a bunch of usb s  that have diff  programs and os s loaded on them  instead of unplugging them  all i have to do is press a button  saves on wear and tear  the lights show which ones are active nice price for a nice product  i give this   thumbs up  a must have for someone that works with computers and their accessories         
382,5.0,                       i have a little dangle i need plugged in close to my mouse in order for it to work with my computer  it will not work without it  so i used this to have it closer and it turned out useful for plugging in my phone for downloading pictures  updating music on my ipad and so on  very useful  especially with separate lights so i can turn them on and off as needed   very well make and works perfectly      
383,4.0,                       i have had this hub for a few months now and have been using it daily on my desktop setup for gaming audiophile video production  the hub has all   ports used by gaming keyboard  gaming mouse  blue mic  and webcam it works well as a stand alone hub with individual switches  but i have this inline with a usb     hub and it is very slow to initialize  it seems to not want to quickly recognize new devices and install those drivers  once it does download the drivers and recognize the devices  it works great  other than that fact  it works well and is able to connect my peripherals      
384,5.0,                       i bought this product to add connections for my other devices i wanted to have available on my pc   it is great with on off buttons for each connection port that are lit so you know if they are on or off   perfect for my needs and it is small enough not to get in the way of my other desk items     
385,5.0,                       i have a couple sabrent usb switched hubs   i run most everything through these because i can easily turn off and on the devices i want to use without having to un plug them   saves wear on the ports and reaching behind the computer   i use usb drives for backup  so i don t need them portable  lost  or running all the time    click  problem solved   same thing with my scanner  i don t need it on every time i sit down to my computer   also  i like being able to switch off my wireless adapter when i don t want to be connected to the internet   it s especially handy if you are using a metered internet connection  like a cell phone   if you plan on charging items or running multiple high bandwidth devices at the same time  transferring large files between multiple external hard drives  etc    i would recommend comparing this hub to sabrent s   or   port switched hubs  usb hpss   usb h ps  which include a power supply that is optional to use   the power supply just ensures maximum power to each port and can even be used off computer as a multi charge dock   for simple accessory expansion  flash drive  wireless mouse  bluetooth adapter  etc    this hub is just right      
386,5.0,                       i can t speak to the longevity as i ve only had it a month or so  but so far works great   i m a bit perplexed with the on off buttons for each port  but other than that  it does exactly what it was made for   good price  good delivery      
387,5.0,                       our computers only have one and two usb  respectively  so charging a fitbit and phone or downloading to a thumb means longer wait time   this solve the problem   i did buy an additional cord so things weren t hanging down   worth the money      
388,5.0,                       initially thought this was defective   i would plug one usb in and it d be fine but then i would plug another usb in and it d stop working entirely  i use this as a usb hub to my work laptop  found a solution from another review windows     or windows in general  defaults to turning off usb devices in order to save power  go to device manager   usb controllers   select your hub   right click   properties   power management   uncheck the boxesi almost bought a     usb hub because i thought this was faulty  it works perfectly after i followed the above steps  hopefully this helps someone too      
389,5.0,                       handy   external hard drive  for backup storage   mouse  easier than trackpad   full size  real  keyboard  digital camera download  via usb   iphone ipad sync with itunes  verizon dongle to connect via cellular to internet    the list of usb connections to my trusty      macbook pro laptop is long and grows longer  and it only has two      count em  usb ports  more than recent macs  but that s another story    i do not want to wear out the usb connectors on trusty       motherboards are pricey and difficult to replace   and would prefer to plug stuff into an external usb hub  replaceable expandable as necessary   this sabrent   port usb hub fits the purpose  this rugged fellow is just what you need to expand  but allows you to remove just  one  connector when you want to walk off with the laptop for truly portable use   recommended   highly     stars      
390,5.0,                       i purchased this hub to use with raspberry pi   mod   setups and functions quite well with the raspbain os  as most likely will other hubs  individual switched ports are a definite benefit to conserve power drain from the small rpi when those devices are not in use needed  and obviously the additional ports allow for other devices to be connected since the rpi only presents four  i connect a wireless mouse through it that i also use on a laptop and thus need to easily remove when using the other machine  has functioned quite well and continues to do so  the only con is that it in not powered  which would also make the device more expensive  for the price it is a good buy and seems to be of good quality      
391,5.0,                       i liked the first one so much  got one for my bride  note to self  not the best anniversary gift  but works great and the one off toggle switches are very handy because sometimes i have to toggle the bluetooth mouse in order for attached storage to be recognized by windows      i would buy more if i had more machines      
392,1.0,                       i got this to extend my pc usb hub for the mousepad lights  and occasionally my oculus rift sensor  it gave up on me  and i got it on july     almost one month  it was working fine until one day i turned on my pc and it reads   usb i had plugged in as  malfunction  and it wasn t connected  i ve tested out the usb cables by plugging it into the mobo usb  works fine  and i ve try plugging other usb plugs in here as well  and it didn t work either  tried plugging it into a different pc  same story i would not recommend     
393,5.0,                       used this to connect a mouse and keyboard to my pi zero w that has only one usb port    yes  there are two  but the other one is for power only      
394,5.0,                       this hub is awesome   the great thing is i can have   things plugged into it at once and turn each of them off  individually  with the buttons that power the ports   i write computer software so i have a scanner  a usb stick  a signature pad and my usb rocker launcher on the ports   i have the hub on my desk connected to my computer with a usb extension cable   so  i don t have to reach under my desk to plug and unplug these things anymore   great product i bought a second one for when i travel with my laptop   love this        
395,5.0,                       we bought this to plug into our tv   i used to have to unplug my roku anytime i wanted to plug in my tv antenna  and with this i can have both plugged in   i like the on off buttons for each usb plug   the blue lights also turn off if the power is not on  which is nice because i thought they d be on when plugged in  no matter what   especially for the price  i highly recommend this usb hub      
396,4.0,                       so far so good working well my xbox one powers up a thrustmaster tmx pro wheel and wireless headphones  it s charging my headphones and wireless controller with the system off  would have been nice if some velcro had been added too keep it in place had to add my own but no big deal  update  well staring to lose faith in this unit  the port i used for a wireless headphones dongle started to mess up kept disconnecting and reconnecting the signal  thought it was the dongle but it s the port  moved it to another one and it s working again  going to experiment with turning it off while not in use and charging the headphones and controller  for   bucks shouldn t have expected top of the line      
397,5.0,                       my new pc arrived with just two usb ports  i needed a minimum of three usb ports so i decided to give this sabrent a try  it is well worth the small amount that it cost  the cord is somewhat short at about   or   inches but long enough for my purposes  each port has a switch and a blue light to indicate when the switch is on  it works well for hooking up my printer  the exterior disc drive that came with my pc and a sandisk that i use for backing up data  could not be simpler to install or easier to use  wish it was made in the usa instead of china but i can t really complain because it is such a useful gadget      
398,5.0,                       i bought the  port hub as i didn t have as many ports as i needed for my key pad and external hard drive  it performs flawlessly  the cord length is just long enough for me  i have not used it to charge external devices or cameras  costs less than half as much as a hub from a retail store        
399,2.0,                       i purchased this in      and still use it once in a while but i ve noticed it disconnects and then reconnects every once in a while  if i have devices connected to it  it gets annoying that i won t be able to use my wireless keyboard and or mouse until it reconnects  either it was faulty since i ve had it or poor quality  but you could spend a little more on another one such as the anker multi usb  which i also have       
400,5.0,                       i seem to use a lot of usb connections   a backup usb drive  cameras  keyboard  printer  external mike   i had a couple of old hubs that stopped working  so i finally ordered a new one and it works great   i have not used it for much yet   lights show you which ports are active      
401,5.0,                       i needed a small usb hub due to traveling between the office and home  this one is perfect and it has the on and off individual power switches which make it so easy for travel as well  i have only used it for a few weeks  but love it so far  recommended      
402,5.0,                       love mine  coworkers and i no longer fight over who gets to charge what whe  now we can all charge at the same time  easy portably   great for camping and the car too      
403,5.0,                       this is great for adding multiple adapters to my laptop while working from home  one of my laptop usb ports doesn t work  but now i m able to use one port for   plugs  i m using my wireless mouse  wireless keyboard  and hdmi   split adapter for two monitors all plugged into this usb splitter  highly recommend for a great quality product that makes working from home a lot easier and more productive      
404,3.0,                       i bought this to primarily use with pen drives  i do a lot of work with them and figured the on off switch and the usb lighting would be a benefit  and they are  the problem  you can only use two and sometimes   of the ports at a time due to them being too close together and pen drives being wider than usb cord ends  if they had given a quarter inch more between ports then all would work  and i would be happy  but  alas    i will use it until it fails which i suspect will be quite a while as it seems to be durable  it would have benefited with say a        cord instead of the      the port on my desktop is too far up so the unit dangles which will probably accelerate wear on the plug wires  the price was too good to be true  and once more that old adage holds true      
405,5.0,                       i have been pleasantly surprised by this item    it is small  which is a plus  and the ability to turn each port on and off is amazing  i am a teacher running my classroom from home  and i was exhausted switching out different microphones  clickers  cameras     with this new setup i can leave everything in place  i love it and highly recommend to everyone working from home     
406,5.0,                       super easy setup   just plug it in  i needed a couple extra usb ports and this is perfect  sleek and small so it s tucked out o the way behind my laptop  works easily  all ports were immediately recognized by my laptop  great find for so inexpensive      
407,4.0,                       having used thus usb hub for about     months now  i feel it is of good quality and works as expected  except for one or two occasion did not have any issue detecting the usb through this hub      
408,5.0,                       this usb hub does something that i find should have been made years ago  it shuts the flashdrive off without having to actually select it on the computer screen to shut it down and then remove it  also  you have to press a button to turn on a slot to use in the first place  this allows you to add more than one flashdrive without thinking about which is which that you are using at the time  nice find  saves little headaches like when the flashdrive won t shut down because the computer has some phantom notion that it is still being used when you know that it isn t  i hate when that happens  makes me wonder who is using  because i m not  this usb hub  prevents  all that nonsense      
409,5.0,                       i love this little gadget  i built my pc but it only had a few usb ports because the motherboard and case i went with were budget and i have yet to upgrade  i was going to go with a pci usb hub but alas  my motherboard s pci slots are already taken  i was really skeptical with this because i figured  how could a usb hub support   devices by plugging into just   usb slot   it works though  and i ve had no problems with it yet  i have my mouse  keyboard  wireless usb card  and my webcam all plugged to it right now and there s no latency  no connection issues  no power issues as of yet  i d recommend this to anyone  and i may even buy another  this has freed up both of the front usb ports on my machine for game controllers  which i love      
410,5.0,                       everything has a usb charging cord now  or runs via usb  i cannot constantly be hopping up to change out cords behind the computer  nor do i have enough ports  this does its job  i use it for my printer  my webcam  charging my fitbit and my wireless headset  it s not amazing  but it s not lame either  it just works      
411,5.0,                       i use it for my wfh set up  it s made moving my laptop away from my full work desk setup much more convenient and allows me to hide most of the wires while working  i also like that i can turn the headphones on off for video calls with the buttons instead of unplugging      
412,4.0,                       i only gave a four because i ve just started using it   right out of box  plug it in to your usb port   it gives me a little more flexibility   i have a laptop and bought an external keyboard  so i was running out of ports  works great  and can turn off ports i m not using   blue light if on  i would give a five star if i had used it longer  great price too      
413,2.0,                       i have both the     version and this     version from the same manufacturer this     version causes all kinds of interrupt issues when being used while gaming on usb     only my headset was on the hub  nothing else and it caused sound to mute  controllers to stop working and would  occasionally  even  cause my mouse to report  close window  when in chrome i went back to the     and all issues went away again  i want to stress that the mouse and controller were not plugged into the     hub  only my headset      
414,1.0,                       when i first got this little hub  i was impressed with it  it was just the right size  had   hubs and individual on off switches  i use hubs a lot since i m getting my book ready for my manuscript and my laptop only has   ports and i need   tor my fan  so i was tickled to get this hubbut the romance soon disappeared as the hub started getting hot and kept getting hotter  heating my usbs along  now i m finding corrupted documents i m trying to complete each for my manuscript  the pulling a document of onetitle and it opens to another document and i can t find the one i was looking for  one thing that got eaten  misfiled or     a document with the first four chapters of my book  i can t find them  but something mysterious happened to them  i believe the heat from the hub is slowly corrupting my documents  but the heat today was frightening as i had located   documents that appear lost  and i was afraid of an explosion  so i d suggest you check your documents  and the heat generation  b   you lose chapters      
415,4.0,                       great product and an even better company  i purchased this   port usb hub solely because my macbook only has two usb ports which put me at a disadvantage because i have multiple usb flash drives and other tools that require a usb spot  the first item i received was faulty in the sense that only one of the ports worked  however  after contacting the company they sent me a replacement which works amazing  this item is a must if you use the computer often as it allows you to have your phone  flash drives  external disk drives and even more things connected at any given moment      
416,5.0,                       this usb hub is just what i was looking for   i had previously bought   other hubs for my laptop from various online stores because they were really cheap   i thought that a hub is a simple thing and there wouldn t be much difference   nope  i was wrong   those flimsy other ones are very finicky and work only when they feel like it  disconnecting and reconnecting my peripherals multiple times within the same minute or two   i like that with this hub  i can turn off power to any device that i don t want to have on  like an external drive or dvd player    some consumers may want or need the faster transfer speed of a usb   or   hub  so take that into consideration before purchasing this product   usb   is perfectly fine for my needs      
417,1.0,                       the piece started failing within a week of using it and now is as bad as the one i was replacing  i have my keyboard and mouse plugged in to it  and will suddenly find the keyboard or mouse has quit working  it revives when i turn the button off and on  but it happens all too often      
418,5.0,                       i bought two one for me and the other for my son and we love it   my son uses to work     flash drives at a time and really likes that there is enough space for each one and can use at the same time  i bought it because i have to work at home and need   monitors for my laptop that only has   usb ports  those ports are being used for the wireless keyboard mouse and the other for my headphone  so definitely needed this which works great for the set up      
419,5.0,                       good little device for the price  haven t had it but a short while  but it seems to meet my needs  it is a bit sturdier than other hubs i have used in the past  which is a primary concern for me  to a large extent a   port usb to   port usb hub is pretty much not going to produce a lot of surprises  it doesn t do usb    but i wasn t expecting that  in my tests  it seems to handle   peripherals at a time without slowing too much  this includes   hard drives that were powered through the port  so it does okay if that performance holds up the little power switches might come in handy when i am doing something that would require my turning devices off for a bit  such as video chat which might be more data intensive   i have not tried an external camera with this while using other devices   but they really don t seem important for the price  i basically wanted a cheap   port for my   port laptop and this appeared to be as tough as any i could see      
420,1.0,                       i got it at the end of september and now  middle of november  it stopped working for anything but to power a light  printer won t pass through  status lights aren t working  charging stopped working  and was very slow weak  to start with      
421,5.0,                       i absolutely love these  had to buy a second one for another device in my house since the first one is always being used on my pc with no issues  i ve had the first one over a year already and its still working like it just came out of the box  very good product for the price and durable too  i m thinking stocking stuffers next year for my family      
422,5.0,                       i could not be happier with this usb hub   i have never had a usb hub with individual switches but it does seem like a good idea and i like the led lights to let me know which ports are on   i have used it for many things and it has worked great for all of my purposes   the short cord makes this very portable and if i do need more i use a usb extension cord the biggest load i have put on this hub involved charging my two iphones  work and personal  plus a portable external battery       mah    this hub charged all three items as if they were all plugged directly into my laptop i would recomend this to anyone looking for a good protable usb hub      
423,5.0,                       great product  i ve had one of these for years and used it on and off  and ended up getting another one a few months ago  now i ve got one mounted to my desk  and another connected to a hidden usb extension cord that extends to the middle of my house  for wireless controllers and accessories to have better coverage  both are working reliably and provide better power to my gadgets than most of my usb ports do  the buttons are a great feature so you can easily reset a connection without even having to pull and re plug the cable  and the lights let you know which ones are active  this thing does the job  i can t think of anything that needs change or improvement here      
424,2.0,                       bought one of these quite some time ago  years   and it has worked perfectly for all this time  bought a new laptop and needed to add at least two more usb ports  so bought this one  had to set it up upside down on the cradle  so plugged in my two stand alone hard drives to ports three and four  port three worked perfectly  but when i clicked on port four it came on  then instantly went off  i did it again  thinking i did not push it hard enough to click in m and it did the same thing  really drove my new laptop crazy  four four has a switch that does not and will not stay in the  on  position  oh well  three out of four isn t so bad      
425,5.0,                       pleased with this product it helped to organize my usb wires while giving more usb ports  the item arrived very quickly and works very well  i especially like the fact that i can turn off any ports not in use      
426,1.0,                       my work computer has windows    so when i started to run out of ports  i picked this one because it specifically stated it was compatible got the package  plugged it in  nothing worked  even items that were working fine when plugged directly into my computer  saw no drivers were necessary  nice   so called support   they said this device doesn t work with accessories  like headphones  keyboards  and mice   only usb for data transfer why you d need to transfer data from   sources at once is beyond me  as is why they wouldn t support accessories  smh  returning      
427,3.0,                       i needed a simple usb hub for my xbox one so i could hook up more hard drives and controllers   day   out of the box  my joystick was having issues when hooked up to the hub   it would either not respond at all  or the controller would be constantly scrolling down over and over   i double checked to make sure the appropriate power button was active  and it was   next  i tried hooking up a rock band guitar usb device that made the old guitars compatible with the new rock band   while the device works when plugged directly into a usb port  it would not work when running through the hub   lastly  i figured i would hook it up to my pc so i have more ports for charging usb devices to at least get some use from the hub  but none of the devices responded when plugged into the hub   after trying the usb hub in   different scenarios  all with poor results  i gave up update   the manufacturer sent me a replacement product for free  which i haven t had any issues with yet   so i ve had a     success rate with this item      
428,3.0,                       i got this specifically for my apple watches and iphones  but it doesn t charge them  i connect it to my outlet strip with usb slots  then my   watches and   iphones into the product  turn on the top switch according to slot  and voila  it doesn t work      
429,5.0,                       product works as designed  very happy with device  since   out of   usb ports stopped working properly on my laptop  this device will help until i need to replace the laptop      
430,5.0,                       i bought this usb hub for my new gaming lap top windows    pc   i also got a lap top fan and a gaming mouse to connect to the usb hub  and becuse i had so many items i had to connect to my lap top this was why i made this purchase for a usb hub for a mouse n a fan and a small speaker this works great  i have been using this every day for about   weeks now for many hours a day    all usb ports worked fine on my hub   i did check all   ports so far i have not had any connectivity issues  so far this is working very well for my lap top  the other thing i was quite please with was when you push the button to turn on ur usb mouse or wat ever u want to connect there is a light around the button to let you know that it is in use  this is imo a good feature  i took   pic with no flash to show the lights and   pic with a flash to show the usb hub i am happy i made this purchase the pakaging of the usb hub came in a clear plastic package  the hub fit nice n snug in to the package   whit a paper insert on how to use the hub      
431,5.0,                       item shipped quickly and was as described  i like the fact the switches are on this model and serve a couple purposes  as a pc hub for usb  you can connect and disconnect flash drives instead at the push of a button  the only con to this hub over others is that the ports are aligned tightly  only allowing   flash drives   sandisk cruzer  to be used at one time  you might be able to fit   slim drives  but i m looking to add usb extension cables to the mix      
432,5.0,                       my computer for work only came with one usb  this is a great way to extend that  works perfectly  it was recommended to me by someone whose department has shared computers and the usbs are in the rear of the machine  this allows them to add and remove usb devices without crawling under the desk      
433,5.0,                       this usb hub works as advertised i m currently using all   ports while working from home during the pandemic i have headphones   k cam with light ring  keyboard  and external monitors running off this hub and haven t experienced any issues works great  i would definitely recommend      
434,5.0,                       this   to   usb hub  ver       is probably the best one i have worked with  i came across it in our lab while i was copying saved data to my flash drive from a shared computer  glad that it wasn t out of production and bought a second one for my wife  the provision of the switches  with led   to individually turn an port on off was very smart      
435,5.0,                       i have a windows   laptop and needed more usb slots  i just connected this hub into the usb  then connected the usbs  one at a time  each time turning on the usb switch  giving the computer time to recognize and connect   maybe i was being cautious going in this methodical fashion  but wanted to be sure all goes well have the printer  scanner  mouse and keyboard plugged in and works perfectly   i was concerned about the printer and scanner  they are separate devices  that they would draw too much power that the hub wouldn t work  but it does the price is great and shipping was super fast from the seller  lexivon      
436,5.0,                       my laptop only had two usb ports  once you fill them with keyboard and wireless mouse you are skunked for anything else  then comes this item  suddenly  i can add additional peripherals like anew scanner  for example  works great a nice to have the on off capability on each port  great product  thanks      
437,5.0,                       i ve used these for charging  even though it says not to  and is constantly on and running different things through all   ports  i ve had not static problems or charging issues or build quality problems  used these for years  definitely a great bang for buck  they also look cool        
438,5.0,                       at home  i ve a drawer full of usb hubs  all of which were supposed to be mac compatible  none of which were this unit performs exactly as promised   it works with mac and pc  sans any meddlesome software   it has on off switches for each port  handy if you plan to plug in powered components   i ve loaded it up all at once with an array of thumb drives  tablets  and phones  and the sabrent reads data and delivers power with no problems what i like the most is the overall design   non obtrusive  unlike those octopus style doohickeys you find at the discount electronics store   built solidly  unlike the cheap plastic hubs that fall apart in your briefcase   compact  making it perfect for wherever you set up your laptop   aesthetically  this might be less than perfect for a desktop cpu  but just as functional  i m sure      
439,1.0,                       i only have my headset and keyboard connected to this hub  i keep losing audio during calls  and my keyboard stops responding half the time it is connected to the hub  both peripherals work properly when connected directly to the computer  either i received a damaged item or this hub does not work properly      
440,5.0,                       full featured  tiny  nice click by buttons  durable for years of use  an ideal length usb rat tail connector to the pc  perfectly visible blue light around each button  clean plugin of all usb cables used so far  and electronic connections from devices to pc and back are all flawless   nice product      
441,2.0,                       it s pretty cheap  within a few months the first button port stopped working  and after a little less than a year only one port functions anymore this is not with heavy use  it is in my classroom and i plug it in once at the beginning of the day and unplug once at the end  no porting it anywhere or tough use  for something that stays in the same room all the time with mild usage it certainly didn t last long i am sure the selling point is that it is so cheap you can buy five of them for when they inevitably break  but my environmentalist heart can t get behind that practice  i m on the lookout for something that can handle the demands of minor desk work  sigh      
442,5.0,                       does exactly what i bought it for  i have an all in one desktop computer at the office  two of the ports stopped working so purchased this device  works great after two months      
443,1.0,                       this is awesome but as soon as i got it i tried to charge my phone  tablet  and portable charger and they weren t charging  so i pluged it in and left it alone for    minutes and came back and they were all charging  let s see how this guy handles extreme use and if it s worth more or less stars  this thing sucks we use it at work and to charge one phone and   sets headphones and takes forever to charge even when it is one set of headphones with half charge      
444,5.0,                       i got this to use at work where i have several things to plug into a usb  this is a perfect length and the four ports are great  i really like that you can turn certain ports off and on as needed as i have a lighted sign that needs to be on during the day and off at night which i can do with just a push of the button  would def buy again if need arises      
445,5.0,                       i have a globe of the solar system on my desk  i don t want it on all the time  so now i can just turn it on when i want it on l instead of crawling under my desk to plug it in or unplugging it      
446,5.0,                       after my company started working from home  i wasn t allowed to keep the dock for my work laptop  because of that  i no longer had enough ports for all of my devices  hence why i bought this usb hub  i currently have a mouse  keyboard  and headset connected to it and they all work perfectly  i would be skeptical of trying to use this hub for devices that are more demanding  but it s perfect for my purposes i wish the cord was a bit longer and i wish the lights that show you which ports are active weren t as bright  but neither of those have caused me any real problems      
447,5.0,                       first i ordered a     usb hub   i now use it on a pc and i m very happy with it   but i wanted to share my particular case in the hope this will helps others    originally  i wanted to attach a k    keyboard to an nvidia shield tv   i found out  after long research  buried deep in  nvidia  forums  that a     usb will not work to drive the k    keyboard   to use the k     you  must  connect a     usb so then i got the sabrent     hub   i first attached the     sabrent to my pc  loaded the logitech unifying software and it found the keyboard right away so  it all worked out  but not before a lot of digging and research   one feature that i really like about both of these hubs is the switches   you can turn devices on or off by simply using a switch   i think that is so cool and very handy   you might have an external drive that doesn t need to be on      constantly  i do   so that comes in real handy   these sabrent hubs do everything i need them to do the sabrent   port usb     hub saved the day    and i like the sabrent     usb as well  i put it to good use on my pc thank you sabrent  i will most definitely be buying gear from you again      
448,2.0,                       i m surprised this got good reviews  but it could be that they are mixing the ratings between different models  the unpowered units     i purchased only worked sometimes  the first one was fine with a wireless mouse usb  an external keyboard usb and one brick  the fourth slot on the unit would not operate simultaneously with the third slot  the drives would often make scary noises and disconnect  the second unit also would not operate more than   bricks at once  there might be some sort of pass through limitation  so i would advise folks to try the powered  faster units  although i have not tried them yet myself  limited functionality gets it two stars  at least it did allow me to transfer my data between bricks although with less convenience than for which i had hoped      
449,5.0,                       it works great for a usb extension for a ps  console  adding a string of usb connections for a headset and any other usb connector accessory is great if you have the older ps  model with only   usbs on the front of the console      
450,5.0,                       effective usb splitter that will increase your usb ports from one to four  each port can be individually controlled by a led switch  everything works fine on my laptop computer  it might be a good idea to spend a few bucks more for something that works like this device instead of buying some chinese junk at rock bottom price      
451,2.0,                       shipping arrived day late not everything you connect to this   port usb device will work  example an external hard drive will not work  in the onset thought loss all that wad on external device but was able to recover i ve had to adjust how i planned to use this   usb port device  i regret ordering      
452,5.0,                       four usb ports is the perfect size for me  i liked that each port had a button to turn off and on  works well for my purposes  not sure why camera quality and charging power was listed in the review of this hub rating by amazon  good value for the price      
453,5.0,                       i tried several other brands over the years but was very disappointment  this product worked immediately   i no longer need to purchase an additional card for all my usb devices      
454,5.0,                       awesome little hub that works very well   the leds on top let you know which port is on and which is off   no more powering down things to unplug them  just click the button on top   brilliant design what you don t know about hubs hubs used to be used in networks as the main connection point for computers to talk to one another   some people probably still use them at times   this is fine until you get too many computers talking to each other   a hub is stupid   it will send communication it receives to every port attached   even if the port doesn t need it   for networks  this is terrible because so much little talk is being transmitted and received across different computers   it will slow down immensely a usb     hub is no different   it s sending the data to every port   with this having the ability to turn off the ports not being used  it speeds up the communication   i like that i can keep some things plugged in and just turn them off when they are not needed   the speed does go up  but it s also handy not seeing those things pop up in my computer window when i m working yes  i recommend this hub   it looks great and works great     
455,2.0,                       a little flaky   turn one connection on or off seems to momentarily disconnect the others  not so good for external drives  but not a problem for keyboards and mice  will not charge an ipad  but otherwise works fine with mac updated for new model be aware that usb      this xib and all other  can severely interfere with bluetooth and wifi  this is a known issue with usb     since it uses spread spectrum technology  for me  i have to plug this hub into the usb port on the left side of my macbook pro  when i plug it into the right side  my mouse and wifi do not work well another minor issue is that when used with a keyboard  the usb hub seems to go to sleep with the computer disabling the keyboard s ability to wake the computer after sleeping      
456,5.0,                       during this covid time i am working from home and needed to plug multiple devices into my computer  this works really well for the four devices i have plugged in now  great if you want to add a light and microphone to your zoom sessions but not give up your mouse and ipad      
457,5.0,                       it is an excellent product  i like that you can control which one of devices you can turn on or off  for starting techies  each usb connection can have     devices attached to it of course this means a large power supply to handle all of the devices  so controlling what is running is a really nice feature  now my wife wants one also  i have purchased a total for   usb     sabrent hubs in matter of a few months and i am pleased with all of them  i have   computers under my desk  one computer has all usb port taken plus i have   sabrent hubs attached the other two computers have   each of the sabrent usb hubs attached and they are all full  i still have not purchased one for my wife      
458,5.0,                       perfect for what i needed  i have a      imac  with all the usb ports annoying located on the back of it  normally  i have to turn the whole screen just to see the ports and plug something in  so  i gave this a whirl to see if it would hold up and be a solution works perfect  and i love the little lights and ability to turn each port on off  i use it to charge my vape pens  iphone  gopro  and more  and   ports seems to be perfect would be nice to have a slightly longer cable  but i sit pretty close to my imac screen so it s within reach whenever i need it  and now i never have to move my computer around  if it ever fails or breaks  i ll buy another one      
459,2.0,                       it worked for me  but one of the issues i would have for some odd reason is that sometimes when i would have it connected  it would disconnect me from the internet  i spent a lot of time trying to troubleshoot this issue  as soon as i would disconnect the device  even though nothing was connected to it  the internet was able to be fine  keep in mind i m a mac user  also had this happen to another friend for the same reason who was also a mac user  not sure why this would happen  their tech support didn t really provide an answer other than an rma the other thing is that it doesn t play nice with wireless devices like mice  which is kind of annoying  but oh well  other than that it was great for hard drives and usb flash drives so if that s all you re connecting it  by all means it s a good product  just had a few quirks that will not make me want to buy it again personally      
460,5.0,                       i am using this product as a hub so multiple devices  printer  wireless mouse  and keyboard  can be plugged into it and  in turn  i use it in the usb port of my computer  i just got it a few weeks ago and i m very happy   i haven t used the camera feature  this is the best hub i ve had so far  and i ve had quite a few over the years  i probably will get one for my office computer as well      
461,4.0,                       it is probably a good hub  but it didn t work for what i wanted to use it for i bought it to plug into my usb port on my car stereo  jvc kw nsx     and the stereo won t recognize any device that is plugged into this   port hub  i tested it many ways  from multiple usb iphone cables to usb sticks to one single cable nothing was recognized when plugged into the hub  i was so bummed  jvc displays  device not recognized  on the screen  i thought this would totally work since it s not powered  it s probably not sabrent s fault and i still don t understand why it won t work  but i wanted to to warn others      
462,5.0,                       i use a     imac for retouching  because all of the ports are in the back of the monitor it is difficult to transfer images from cameras  thumb drives  and the like  each port on the sabrent   port usb     hub has its own dedicated power switch and blue led power indicator  this speeds up the process of juggling different devices as i can turn off the port after ejecting without having to physically pull out the usb connector  the usb protocol implementation works equally well on the imac  a macbook air  and a windows    laptop  the construction quality is excellent  this is a great usb hub      
463,1.0,                       this product may once have been a good one  based on reviews   my experience is that it is now useless   perhaps it is a different product or a cheaper version  but the design and manufacture of this item clearly used inferior parts and sloppy construction   don t bother   its not even worth returning      
464,4.0,                       the cord is short but perfectly fine for me  it s fine right next to my computer  a longer cord would be a bother  what camera   i assume it meets the usb specs  i have never charged anything other than a small cell phone      
465,2.0,                       it works fine but it started making really loud hissing sounds when charging   especially if you re trying to use a speaker or something  basically  it will charge one thing at a time ok without hissing  but if you try to have more than one thing plugged in  it will hiss  it will also create a nasty background hiss while a bluetooth speaker is plugged in  i lived with it for two years but i m on here now trying to find something better b c the hissing is driving me insane      
466,3.0,                       while it gets the job done  charged my wireless headset  some bluetooth earphones  and allowed me to use my mouse   note that it s made of lightweight plastic that feels cheap  you also have to use an unusual amount of force to push in a dongle into it  which leaves me feeling like i might accidentally break it      
467,4.0,                       i use this for my msi gaming laptop so that i have a place to plug my headset and mouse without getting in the way of my mouse with the port on the side of my mousepad  i also wanted to use this to plug in the massaging backrest of my gaming chair but as soon as i plug it in  it overpowers this hub and starts rapidly connecting and disconnecting my headset and mouse  so overall works amazingly  just annoying that i ll have to find another solution to be able to use the functions in my chair      
468,5.0,                       this product was exactly what i needed for an aging laptop that only had one functional usb port  i needed this device to simultaneously connect a wired mouse and a wired printer scanner combo  did exactly as advertised  and the light indicators showing which port is active is it great touch      
469,3.0,                       this is an ok product  the only issue is that the cord is too short  i bought this because the usb ports on my desktop at work are super inconvenient as they are in the back of the monitor and you have to move the whole set up just to get to the plug  this splitter works well enough but the cord is so short that the thing haha in the air from the ports in the back of the desk top      
470,5.0,                       i ran out of ports on my pc and this little hub is just what i needed  i like that you can press the buttons to turn the power on and off to whatever you have plugged in  i was thrown off by the small size at first  but after putting it to use realized i actually appreciate it being small and not taking up a lot of space  the chord for the hub itself is super short though  that doesn t bother me since it s plugged into my pc which sits right next to my desk  however this may bother some people who are at a distance from what they re charging or utilizing      
471,5.0,                       awesome product  really allowed for me to expand my availability of usb ports  and it has a real nice professional feel to it  love the blue lights and the effects they produce solid product      
472,5.0,                       does what it should  and gives me   usb     ports  the ports are a bit tight  and it s a little hard to plug things in and pull them out  but i d rather have that than things falling out during a data transfer  i like that you can connect a device  but that it won t activate until you push the button to turn it on  because it makes it very easy to connect and disconnect devices on demand  the ports are a little close together  so some usb devices may be too fat  but it seems to work for most things the plug you connect to your computer seems to be recognized by your computer as a fifth usb device  but i m not sure what it s supposed to do for you  it was recognized and successfully installed in both of my computers  and i was able to use all   ports with no problems i was able to plug in a wireless usb mouse  as well as a usb powered hard drive  both at the same time with no trouble my only complaint might be that the ports are a bit close  if they could put some more space between them  or stagger then on either side of the device  it would be perfect      
473,4.0,                       exactly as advertised  nothing more   i found the cord to be a little short for my purposes and had to tether it to a usb extender   the cord length is specified in the item description  at about four inches   i thought that might be long enough to plug into the back of my monitor and sit on the desk  but it s not   as such  it sits on my desk and is so light it slides back and forth a little too easily   none of these things factor into my four star rating  however  as they are clearly specified in the description   however  i found that it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the push button toggle is off or on  as the lights from adjacent switches illuminate part of the indicator on powered off switches   it is functioning well though  and is reliable   you might just have to look a little closely at the toggles to know whether there is power going to individual usb ports      
474,4.0,                       i m not a fan of products that have indicator lights  if a product works it works  if it doesn t it doesn t  the light is fluff   the but of all the electronic products i have purchased from amazon since the  rona started  this still works without any issues     
475,5.0,                       works great  just plug in and one usb     port becomes   ports only caveats  not a problem for me     not powered   this is not an issue for keyboards  mice  flash drives  etc   only an issue for portable usb powered hard drives or other high power usage devices    cord is short   the permanently attached usb cord is about   inches long   only an issue if you need the ports on your desktop and the computer is on the floor   works fine with a laptop or desktop where the ports don t need extension overall a great product at an easy on the wallet price      
476,5.0,                       this item was a great purchase  i like the fact that it has   individual power buttons for the four usb connections  this allows me the ability to keep my usb devices connected all the time  all i have to do is press the pertinent power button and it brings my usb device to life  then when i m done all i have to do is  power off  the usb port and it cuts the power to that connection  it s just like unplugging the usb device      
477,4.0,                       i received my usb hub today   first   it took over a week to get it   that s a little too long for someone that is having to work from home and needed it yesterday   secondly  the unit works fine   except the light for the first port  nearest the cable  does not light up   i have no idea if it is on or not   this was important to me since this is used to turn my extended drive on and off   the only way to tell if the the port is on  is by touching the button and feeling if it is raised or not other than that  it seems to work okay   only time will tell if it can handle what i need it to handle      
478,4.0,                       i purchased this item because i needed something to go with my toshiba computer   it possible to use and work with dvds and cd s  i have used up my usb ports with wireless mouse and keyboard and backup hard drive  i really like the convenience and looks of the sabrent   port device  the only thing i would change is the lengths of the cable that is used to connect the device to the computer  it is too short and limits where on the desk it is to be set up  the price and was far better than what was being offered in the big box stores  i am a  prime  member so i had it in two days by ups and it has worked as advertised  if you need extra ports and don t want to spend a lot of money this item is for you      
479,5.0,                       i use this for my tv so i can have my chromecast and digital antenna powered at the same time without having to switch which one is plugged into the usb slot  it works well and powers both things at the same time      
480,4.0,                       i bought the new xbox and its great new design only has   usb ports  and i have a external hard drive that needs a slot along with my wireless headset adapter  my battery charging station  and my wired controller  i could use a usb plug adapter for my charging station but then i would have to move my station   so i bought the sabrent   port usb     hub with individual led lit power switch plugged it in and it works perfect for the headset charging cable and battery charging pack  this cable is the right size to hide it away or out      
481,5.0,                       i had only   usb ports on my lenovo laptop  wish it was like dell   given  but i had to get extra ports and i am able to put my mouse  cooler fan and a usb light in  its worth the price if you need extra external ports  cord is a good length to me and as no charging or camera feature  i can light the hubs used and they work fine  i would buy another one for sure      
482,1.0,                       doesn t work  at all  i tried twice   thinking the  st device was defective  reordered  and same with the  nd device  simply does not work  no charge reaches my phone i plugged the usb into charging block  attached my phone cord  tapped the button to illuminate the blue light  and indicator that the port is live   and nothing  no charge      
483,5.0,                       teleconference sessions   with the advent of covid   it is vital to have a camera that performs well   i use it with my sons virtual learning  business meetings with virtual background  or video taping education sessions for posting on internet   as good as some of the very expensive products out there      
484,4.0,                       i needed this to use with my older laptop    out of   of the usb ports had stopped working so my only option was to purchase a usb hub and connect it to the   remaining usb port  needless to say this did the job well  was definitely a good buy  it actually still works perfectly also  however i haven t been regularly using it as of late since the laptop i bought this for stopped working due to a different issue several months ago  aside from that i have just been keeping this device in a draw for when the day comes that i need more usb ports than i have      
485,5.0,                       i needed a hub for my tesla model    the dashcam feature was added to a recent update to the system  but requires a front usb port  as both ports were being used for charging phones  i did not have a front port available for a thumb drive to record dash cam video  this small simple usb hub did the trick  i was able to plug in and utilize the thumb drive  as well as simultaneously recording dash cam videos  i highly recommend this hub for usability and portability      
486,5.0,                       quite happy with the quality of this and all sabrent items i own  all sabrent equipment i have bought  are of very good quality  and i have never experienced an issue with their operation      
487,5.0,                       works  hooked up a printer and mouse to a tablet with the usb port  this makes it so you can run several things through the one usb port      
488,5.0,                       my hub stopped working but it was very old   so i started searching for a replacement   i like this   port hub and the individual switches   i can keep my printer plugged but turn it off if i want   i also have a flash drive i keep in but can also turn it off when i desire   it is a nice size and doesn t take up much space on my desk   when the pretty blue light is on that means it is in the on position  and the light goes off when i press the button to turn off what is connected to that particular port   i would recommend this product  very nice      
489,3.0,                       will not charge my iphone    this was my reason for buying it  unfortunately  the seller did not indicate if it would charge phones  it only mentioned it s data capabilities  am keeping it for its other abilities  at least it powers my android and other small toys it would have been excellent if it could power my iphone        
490,5.0,                       i liked this usb hub so much  wish it was longer though  it s about     inches long in cable length overall around      but still works okay for its purpose  i needed a hub that worked for my playstation classic  i had a     usb hub but they were all     ports and would not work on the playstation classic  not sure if it was the brand or the fact that it wasn t     so this works great for the purpose of playing games through retroarch  does not work for playing other emulators through multiplayer though only works on ps  games strictly for that  still a great buy i can have up to   players with this usb hub  if you use after market usb controllers it works even better without having to shave bits off the usb on the classic controllers to get them all to fit properly      
491,5.0,                       i got this for my work laptop since it only had   ports and one was occupied by a mouse  i use it for my thumb drive and a little fan and it s awesome  i love that if i close the computer it turns them off and it only on when the laptop is on  i also love that you can turn specific ports on and off at will  very happy with my purchase        
492,2.0,                       i have alexa  fire tablet and my phone charger  this hub works but will not charge my tablet and phone  or what i mean is it will not start the extra charging  example if my phone battery is at     and i plug it into this hub it will stay at      and i have try changing to each different out port      
493,5.0,                       this product far exceeded my expectations   i have all   hubs filled  i just click on one  it lights up and comes on the computer  nice product for home use for my many flash drives      
494,5.0,                       i love this product i am still using it now  this product solve problems of having only a few functioning usb port on your computer  whether due to old system or due to big tech company limiting usb ports to exploit their customers  the hub comes with   available ports  i love that you can toggle each port on and off  giving you control of what device you want to connect or disconnect to the hub and the computer  the usb draws power from your computer so based on my experience  it works better when connected to usb     or     ports  i am satisfied with this product      
495,1.0,                       with light use  this usb hub has all of a sudden stopped working  whenever it s connected now  it will connect and disconnect every two seconds  so whatever devices i have plugged in do not function as intended  the usb hub i bought at staples years ago still works and is much more reliant than this waste of money  i would return it if i could      
496,5.0,                       this was smaller than i expected but that was a plus  very compact design that still does the job   i usually don t like lighted buttons since they are usually just for silly decoration but these lighted buttons really do serve a purpose if the switch is in the shadows under your desk   the buttons clearly show which port is active it was a little difficult to insert and remove a usb from the ports  but since i m not going to be pulling them out to switch them  the whole reason to get this  that shouldn t be an issue   delivered prompted and in good condition from seller      
497,5.0,                       this sabrent   port usb works great i bought this along with some  gold plated hi speed usb     type a to micro b cable   feet    cable not from this seller got it for my son to use with his xbox controllers  this allows him to keep all the controllers plugged in via the usb port on the xbox while playing games  this way it eliminates all the extra money we would have to spend in buying batteries    this is good because boy oh boy those controller really eats batteries   my son loves the idea of being able to turn on or off each of the four ports great product for such a small price  i would buy from this seller again  i recommend thanks     
498,4.0,                       i like the hub  i purchased the usb     hub and i am able to plug in all my usb flash keys to read  i would have given it a higher to   stars but durability cannot be determined since i just got it and it is a plastic hub  so it seems good but only time will tell  i am confused on the side it looks as if it can take dc power but then again it could be a metal prong design to hold the case in place  if it takes dc what is the voltage it can safely take      
499,5.0,                       i have now purchased two of these  i use a two laptop  or actually a notebook and laptop  setup with an external monitor and an external webcam and microphones  zoom and online teaching stuff   these usb hubs have given me more flexibility in how i set things up and allow me to attach and detach devices  my notebook only has one usb port  so this really helps  inexpensive and working well for me      
500,4.0,                       this usb hub works well with my mac and sits perfectly on my desk   it does not interfere with the speed of data transfer at all and its ability to power on and off each slot works perfectly   that feature actually makes it a lot easier to organize my desktop and deactivate usb s i m not using yet   i use a single command strip to hold it on my desk which holds it perfectly however pressing on it  the plastic feels pretty flimsy  so i don t think it can take much of a beating and the cord is a little short but it works well for my purposes of both charging devices and transferring data in mass      
501,5.0,                       i use this for everything that has a usb  this works with my canon printer  my logitech headset and gaming keyboard  my external hard drive  all my flash drives  my fans  and my mouse  totally worth it since one of my usb ports broke and i only have   others  i m about to buy another one      
502,5.0,                       my computer only came with two usb plug ins   i ordered this hub and the cord length is perfect to keep right by my computer   i would recommend this especially with this great price      
503,3.0,                    pues compre este hub porque necesitaba un par de puertos adicionales en mi estudio casero de grabaci n  les ser  sincero el dise o y la est tica con los led brillantes le dan un toque de elegancia  pero siento que la calidad del material el cuales pl stico es un poco baja  siento que en cualquier momento se puede romper  cada vez que presiono los botones para apagar o encender uno de los puertos siento que algo truena ligeramente  el cable se siente un poco barato tambi n  pero es una opci n por si necesitas un hub y n tienes mucho dinero         
504,5.0,                       needed to add   to   more usb devices to my laptop than i had ports   this hub does the job and i like how it has a power switch for each connection as i do not always need one of the devices  so i can just switch it off      
505,3.0,                       the ability to turn off individual usb ports is handy if you have more than one power hungry accessory to plug in  as long as all aren t in use at the same time  they can all stay connected and ready to use w o having to disconnect one or more so there s enough power available  i e webcam  portable drive  etc  the on off buttons are on top  and the cord is on the left side  if the cord were in back  it would be a little more flexible in placement on cluttered desks  an input port instead of a mounted cable would also provide more flexibility in situations like having the cpu tower under the desk and keeping the hub close at hand on the desktop      
506,4.0,                       i am quite surprised at this sabrent usb hub  i have always considered sabrent as one of the best manufacturers of hubs and such  i never experienced any connection or  recognization problems  however  i bought this   port hub  and when i plugged it into my notebook computer  the entire computer became unresponsive  so  i tried it on a nother pc that i own  and i got the same results  since this hub came from a third party seller on amazon  and he asked to be contacted directly on the amazon returns page  i did so  and he promptly replaced the hub for me  there was evidently an issue with the first hub  because so far  the second one has been working just fine  i like the individual switches for each port  because it allows for the easy removal or exchange of a device  i recommend      
507,5.0,                       my        laptop only has one usb port    so  i could not use my usb powered cooling fans while also using my usb game controller  this was a great option  i like that you can individually turn off on each port  the cord length is a bit awkward  but it s better than having one usb port      
508,5.0,                       bought a new laptop and it only had   usb ports  this allows me to dock and connect accessories as needed  i can even switch them off on the fly great product     
509,5.0,                       i have been using this for the last   days and it s helped me access my flash drives every single time i want to retrieve files and move them to my embroidery machine   simple to use  and hopefully it will allow my machine to not wear out the port anymore      
510,5.0,                       this little hub is awesome  my wife bought one first and recommended it to me  so now we both have one  i love having the individual push buttons  as i keep three charging cords plugged in all the time for my phone  smartwatch and bluetooth headset  i hate wasting power when i don t need them on  so that s quite a handy feature  and it seems the hub has no problem passing plenty of power to the individual ports via usb   though i ve only had to use two of my charge cords at once so far for the fourth port  i ve used an sd card reader and my two factor authentication dongle  i actually ended up moving the card reader to a port on my laptop dock because the sd card sticks out the side and interferes with the other cables  i think that s my only gripe  and it s a pretty minor one that not everyone will run into  having my  fa dongle in the fourth port is pretty nice so i can turn it off when not needed  eliminating the potential for some malicious code to give hackers access to my accounts somehow with the dongle sitting there unattended   i ve never heard of that happening  but i d rather not risk it  so yeah   good hub      
511,5.0,                       it seems every item i buy needing a usb port to charge or connect and my laptop only having   ports  seeing this made me hope it would be easy for me to figure out and use  i literally took it out of the box  plugged it into my laptop  plugged in my usb cable from my desk fan into it and pressed the button and it was on and running  i had every port filled in a few seconds with a solid connection  my iphone charged up with ease also and allowed for data connectivity as well  great little gadget that was so easy to use and compact enough it takes up no room on my desk      
512,5.0,                       this is the  rd purchase of this product i have made in the last   years  they all work great  will continue to buy the sabrent   port usb as needed  it would be great if the cord was longer  i don t use them in conjunction with a camera  mostly for charging and connecting small portable usb lights  highly recommended  can t beat the price either for a quality product      
513,5.0,                       i have an older raspberry pi with only two usb ports and no built in wifi  i needed this usb hub so i could use one usb port for a corded keyboard   corded mouse while leaving the other usb port for a wifi dongle  this configuration works perfectly and i didn t notice any power problems due to overloading a usb port  i m sure that adding a hard disk drive would require a powered usb hub  but for less demanding devices this was the perfect solution at a very reasonable price      
514,5.0,                       it works well  but only used it for two devices  i m not yet sure if it can handle   without a problem  i like that i can turn off the connection to the attached devices individually  the cord is long enough it to rest on the table  it is light  so far so good      
515,3.0,                       this is a nifty little thing in that you can control each port individually  the leds behind said buttons give off a glow  but at a certain angle  it pokes past the translucent plastic and straight into your eyes  at night  the glow gives off significant blue light  making it difficult to sleep  after about three months of use  the device stopped working  it still delivers power and i can still toggle the switches  but data will not transfer and my computer will not recognize anything i plug in      
516,5.0,                       i currently have my headset  my keyboard  and my mouse hooked up using this usb hub and i love it  the buttons to turn on and off each port have been super handy for when i want sound to toggle between my speakers and my headphones without needing to unplug anything  i didn t expect to like this product so much  but it has been an unexpected blessing  works like a charm      
517,4.0,                       i bought this   port usb     hub because my laptop only has two ports and i need to use one for my usb wireless mouse   i do not like using the touch pad   since i have had past experiences with computer crashes and lost data  i store all my  stuff   documents  photos  videos  etc   on usb flash drives  if i wanted to transfer info from one drive to another i either had to copy to my desktop and then to the other drive or disconnect my wireless mouse  while i am satisfied with this product  bit it does have both pros and cons that i will list here pros   i can keep up to four flash drives connected to the hub without having to remove them once i m done  each port has an on off button allowing me to only turn on the drives i m using   the hub is small and light weight and each port has a blue led indicator light to let you know which port is in use cons   the cord is only about    long  so the hub will dangle if the desk area isn t wide enough   the ports are very close together and it is impossible to plug usb flash drives side by side  i use only sandisk flash drives  but other brands may be narrower and fit better  my solution was to use usb extension cables  their plugs are narrow enough to fit between the flash drives for me  the pros out weigh the cons  it allows me the convenience to have up to four flash drives connected and ready to turn on and use at a moment s notice  i give it   stars      
518,1.0,                       it simply doesn t work  i tried plugging it differently  every device  e g  flashdrive  i attach doesn t work  while i can attach it to an old multi port and it works with no problem i dumped it      
519,5.0,                       the laptop had only   port and i needed a extra port or two  works good on the older module  i order a usb     from the same company when upgraded to a new laptop  excellent build and works good i had no problem with either      
520,5.0,                       a life saver   my work laptop has only two usb ports  one is hidden  so i thought it had only one usb port when i bought this hug   i wanted to plug in a keyboard and mouse   plus i need to use a usb encryption key  and sometimes plug my phone in for charging   this handy little gadget handles all of that   i recently bought an external cd drive  and that will not work through this hub  it needs to be plugged in directly to a port  i m glad i d found the hidden port for that   so be forewarned that not everything will work through it  but so far the cd drive is the only thing i ve found that doesn t   in fact  the encryption key vendor had suggested that the key would not work through it  but it does      
521,5.0,                       my laptop comes with only   usb ports  i have a monitor  a keyboard  a mouse  a printer all need to be wired for company security purposes  plus you can charge your phone and other apparatus      
522,5.0,                       i really like this usb hub  i bought it mainly because my macbook air only has two usb ports and i wanted to connect my new mouse and keyboard and still have ports for connecting usb drives  etc  i really like that you can turn each port on and off  this way i can leave things connected even if i don t want them active  highly recommend this hub      
523,5.0,                       i originally bought this for my main laptop so i would not have to unplug the usb every time i wanted to transfer pictures from my camera   i have a wireless mouse plugged in as well as a remote keyboard   i also have a external hard drive that i use for backup that i do not want to have plugged in unless i am doing a backup or retrieving something   the switches of this hub are perfect for this   i can just push the button   this hub worked so well i bought another one to use on an old laptop that i am using to teach me how to play the piano   the old laptop only had one working usb port   with this hub i can connect the piano keyboard and a mouse   i highly recommend this device      
524,1.0,                       i wish i would have tried it out when it arrived few weeks ago  i needed to use it today for first time and it s broke    don t charge nothing  and i can t return it anymore       days too late  don t buy piece of crap  don t works      
525,4.0,                       i didn t read the size  but i underestimated the proportions   it works perfectly well  just the cord is too short so it kind of hangs from the back of my monitor   i was hoping it would lay flat on the desktop   still gets the job done      
526,5.0,                       i purchased this product to use with a laptop  the laptop only has   usb ports  and when some of the keys stopped working  i hooked up a desktop keyboard to it  and i use a usb mouse on it  so that took my   spots up  i d have to unplug the mouse to plug in the usb charger for my phone  or camera  and that was just getting annoying  i didn t want to spend a ton of money on a usb huh  when i came across this one i read the reviews  some were good some where bad  but i went with it anyway  i figured for the price  it wouldn t break my bank to give it a try for myself i m very happy i chose this product  yes it has a short cord  but that is not a problem if its used on a laptop  or the front area of most towers  i also like that it has individual on off buttons for each usb slot  so that way if i have my phone docking station in one  and my usb cord for my camera in one  but am not using those atm just keeping them plugged in  so i don t misplace them  i can shut those   sources off and only keep the ones i am using turned on i will be recommending this product to family and friends who are in need of extra usb ports  it s made nicely  it doesn t feel cheap or flimsy   which i did expect it would for the price      
527,5.0,                       works perfect  working from home and needed extra usb ports for laptop  really helped      
528,3.0,                       the product does what it says it ll do mostly  i use it to connect peripherals and not to charge so i can t attest to charging speed  cord length is short but i just taped it to the top of my desktop  i had the product for roughly   years and like another review mentioned  i kept getting the disconnect and reconnect sound  the hub would randomly stop working and then after a few seconds would work again  i contacted sabrent directly and they sent me a new unit even though my warranty expired  a slight caveat is they sent me the usb     version instead of the     version that i purchased  overall  for the price it isn t horrible  thought next time  i ll probably go with a different hub from sabrent      
529,2.0,                       i plugged in this port to laptop  and plugged in the usb for mouse and usb operated small fan at the same time  both worked fine for about    min  then mouse stopped working  switch were on for both  fan was still running  after checking all possible causes of mouse not functioning  i had to restart everything for the mouse to come back to life  not using this port anymore      
530,5.0,                       my one is usb    version  it works in good condition  when i connect my keyboard and mouse to the hub at the same time  they work well and there is no interference between each other  switch is a good design good for usb devices that do not need lots of data transport or power consumption but i don t know if it works for recharging of smartphone or tablet  i dare not to try charging four qc    devices at the same time with it      
531,5.0,                       i used this product with an ouya gaming console to expand the number of usable usb ports from one to four  i read on forums that a powered hub would more likely work  but since there were at least a few people who had success with non powered hubs i decided to take a chance and it looks to have paid off  i can now use mouse and a portable      hdd simultaneously on my ouya and i ve got two extra ports i can use for other peripherals later down the road it s worth noting that i had to use a y usb cable to get the portable hdd to work because apparently the hub didn t supply enough power  after i plugged the cable into the hub and the ouya i had to plug the extra connector on the double end of thy y cable to my desktop via a usb extension cable  no big deal  the mouse worked fine without any adjustments  just plug and play      
532,5.0,                       the sabrent   port usb is perfect  i am able to turn on off any of my devices plugged into one of the ports at the push of a button  the buttons are easy to see if they are hidden in the dark because they are lighted      
533,5.0,                       working from home has presented challenges and this little gadget was exactly what i needed  super handy to be able to turn the ports off or on individually      
534,1.0,                       no matter what usb slot i plugged this into it made my headphones have this horrible feedback in them  it also caused my other hardware plugged into usb spots to not show up as connected and whenever i pressed the buttons on the device to disable that usb slot or activate it it would cause my screen to flicker and weird sounds to be made in my headset i m not even maxed out on usb slots on my computer  i just wanted this so i could shut off certain usb plugged in devices that have lights on them at night since i sleep in the same room as my computer is located  my computer is a decently new high end computer that i use everyday for streaming top end video games just fine and i plugged it into my wife computer that had the same headset feedback problems and button pressing problems  these things happened regardless of how many devices were plugged into it      
535,5.0,                       my laptop only have one usb port  i bought this macgafter and it works great  i m still not sure why i want to switch the usb port off on the macgafter but the blue light is nice  i m glad i got it      
536,5.0,                       works great needed more usb openings for all my cords  laptop only had one   this gadget works great  thank you      
537,5.0,                       this neat little gadget lets me expand my usb ports in the front of my machine and very neatly lets you turn on only the ports you need with a blue led to tell you which ones you turned on   it seemed to take quite a while for windows to recognize what it was and load appropriate drivers for it   there must be some functions the operating system does not like about it  because it messed up an update the first time and corrected the problem when i turned off all of its ports and did the update again   weird  but no show stopper   i like the functionality and presentation      
538,4.0,                       it works well  it is a hub and hard to eff up  i suppose  the buttons are useful to cut power to a device you are not using  and being a passive hub can solve problems  but i ended up finding them annoying as they are so easy to toggle i do it every time i handle the thing  i wish i had gone without the buttons  imo  ymmv      
539,5.0,                       i needed additional ports with switches for my old vista os lab computer and these work great  i wish they had a   or    port version but i added a second   port and both seem to work fine  the buttons can be sticky when depressing on off but not a big deal  the main usb lead to the pc is very short     or so   but that worked fine for me  i ve tried a few other switchable usb hubs from other manufacturers and the quality was terrible  i recommend these from sabrent      
540,5.0,                       i was originally going to give this   stars because the lights can t be defeated even if the port is being utilized  but then again  i could ve simply bought one that had no lights to begin with  i guess i was just getting fancy with these lighted ones  that said  this hub works fine  my friend uses it with his smart tv  when he plugs micro memory cards via usb adapters in them  his tv recognizes them as usb connection    usb connection    usb connection    etc  comes in pretty handy if you only have one usb port in the back of your tv but you have several memory cards of movies and music like we do      
541,5.0,                       after i  upgraded  my macbook to os x yosemite  it wouldn t recognize my digidesign mbox   audio interface    i d hardly call switching to an os that renders your favorite apps obsolete and or non functional an  upgrade   but that s a different conversation for a different product review  a few different avid digidesign forums presented viable solutions  including downloading previous audio drivers and or plugging the mbox into a usb hub rather than directly into the macbook s usb port   i dutifully downloaded a separate driver  the mbox responded to the mac but still wouldn t send audio out   with nothing left to lose and my studio monitors getting lonelier with each day that audio wouldn t pass thru them  i opted to try the usb hub route a quick search on amazon turned up the sabrent   port usb     hub   the price was right  it arrived right on time  and it was the simple solution to what had been a complicated problem for several weeks i have not used the hub for anything other than connecting my mbox  so i can t speak to its performance as a multi connector for external drives  etc   i can only say that this simple  durable device has been a lifesaver at my particular work station   if you work with usb devices and the recent  upgrade  to yosemite has caused trouble for you  a separate usb hub may be a simple and inexpensive solution and the sabrent     is perfect      
542,1.0,                       i bought this exclusively to use with my logitech unifying receiver and my remote htpc setup  pc is upstairs and hdmi usb and ethernet run to the living room    not only would my receiver not work with this hub  but it stopped working altogether even when i plug it directly into the back of the pc   im beyond pissed right now as this is the second receiver that i have gone through with this thing   im sure its the hub as each receiver stopped working immediately after trying to get it to work with the hub   this piece of crap may be alright to charge an iphone or two  but it definitely is garbage when it comes to actual hardware      
543,5.0,                       i have this plugged into my laptop and use it every day for my wireless mouse  removeable hard drive  thumb drives and a whole host of other usb accessories  it works great and i like the ability to turn on off ports not in use      
544,3.0,                       i have two hp laptops   one is far superior to the other  this works for my good one but not my weaker one so i don t think the issue is the dongle itself  it will charge devices using my weaker laptop  but the computer won t recognize devices  like my wireless keyboard and my extra monitors  plugged into it      
545,5.0,                       works exactly as described  so much easier to keep it plugged into the back of the pc and rest the hub on top than constantly having to plug the removable device directly into the pc  each port has its own on off switch and indicator light  i ll be buying another for my laptopn      
546,4.0,                       the feel of the device is a bit flimsy  but it works like a champ  of course  i considered the lighweight design an advantage while traveling i bought this to use with my transformer tablet which only has one usb port   during a trip where i was swapping pics with other travelers  i was constantly swapping out flash drives and portable hard drives with no issue   i really like the feature of the individual power items for each device   it means that i can eject in software and power off  without necessarily having to pull the drive immediately from the hub i was able to put most flash drives side by side  but as we ve all seen some flash drives are bulky and they sometimes get in the way of the adjacent port   the next model could be spaced a bit more  but i tend to put the blame for the problem on the bulky flash drives i would definitely recommend this      
547,3.0,                       the four usb port work  but they apparently don t generate enough  power  or connection or something    because i can t charge my phone or use my headset for work with these  not sure why they don t    but that s what i bought it for      
548,1.0,                       well mine didn t work  there was no power to any of the hubs even with the lights on  so i returned  also the cord length is ridiculously short      
549,5.0,                       i use this with xbox one and ps   connect keyboard  mouse  and console remote control to it  it all works as advertised and with no hiccups      
550,5.0,                       this product took some getting used to  i originally thought it was broken but what i did not realize is that this product is not  plug and play   i have a surface pro   and it only came with one usb port  i use a usb mouse because it s easier to use and i have my usb with all the stored documents  not to mention  i also have my back up  tb hard drive  at any given moment  i may need all three on at the same time  sometimes i hook up speakers via usb as well  this device not only allows me to have all four plugged in at the same time  but allows me to switch on and off the device i am not using without going through wires and set  i literally set all my devices once and all i have to do is plug in this device instead of several other devices  so  if i am listening to music  i press the switch for usb and usb back up drive to off  leave mouse and speakers on  if i m working from home  i leave everything but the speakers on  if i m on skype or havine a virtual meeting for work  everything is on  this device can handle multiple devices without overheating or becoming dysfunctional  great product      
551,5.0,                       the first item sent would not work at all unless i used a power cord that did not come with the product  the one they sent me the following day is identical but works perfect and does not need a power cord      
552,1.0,                       i can t get this product to work for me the way i  wanted   i am trying to put my brother mfp on a splitter using the sabrent   port usb  i thought it would work with the on off switches but it s not   i already bought a   port splitter and that didn t work   i have tried it with both computers plugged in   but one off  then i  tried it with  only   cable  plugged in  but only the original  computer prints   i know the new computer  is compatible with  the printer  because it has printed from that printer before i started buying splitters and cables      
553,5.0,                       love this gadget  for laptops with limited usb ports  this is a must  i ended up getting   to be able to have everything at the ready  printer  mouse keyboard   speaker mic  cd dvd attachment   flash drives all at the push of a button   when not using or needed just shut it off  button       
554,5.0,                       my wireless keyboard s and mouse s receivers must be located close by to work reliably   in addition  the keyboard  logitech k     requires power via usb for recharging  and used the third port for this purpose   because this hub is very low  it fits under the computer s display   the hub s usb cable was too short to connect directly to my pc  therefore  i added a   foot usb extender cable   this hub provides a clean and simple solution and installation for me   i would certainly buy it again      
555,5.0,                       first off  no idea how these would work with devices that require usb power  what the transfer speeds are  etc i use this    item to connect the receivers for wireless mouse  keyboard  etc   small items like that which need to be plugged in all the time   this way  the wireless keyboard  mouse combo are plugged in to one thing togetehr that i can disconnect and re connect  i dont have to worry about losing the little things whenever i disconnect one  and they aren t eating up all my ports on their own if you just need a few extra ports  then this is perfect   costs almost nothing and what else could solve the above problem for that price      
556,4.0,                       used as hub to power keyboard and mouse along with camera and seems to be working perfectly  nice addition when your older computer loses some of its usb ports  or just didnt come with enough  good quality and great price      
557,5.0,                       in the world of usbs  i was finding i needed more than the couple usb slots my laptop was providing   i purchased this one so i could plug in my phone  my watch  and my keyboard   my keyboard actually behaves better when its fob is plugged into this product  than directly in to the laptop for some reason   it can charge all three with no problem   another reason why i love this particular one is that you can turn the usb slot on or off depending if you are using it or not   when your phone is charged and you are busy  you can just hit the button and turn it off and keep working   doesn t sound like a big deal but you would be surprised how helpful that is   a great product for a great price   i would have paid more      
558,5.0,                       i misplaced this item and finally found it   glad i did  because i replaced a   port usb switch that s been acting up   no longer using the second computer  so i don t need the  switch feature connecting my keyboard  wireless mouse and usb microphone with this hub the short lead  were it longer  could have let me put the hub right where the switch was  here on the computer table   so the led feature goes unnoticed   on the other hand  my cable jungle on the table is now behind the table      
559,3.0,                       i did not carefully read the tech specs in the detailed product info  this will not charge an ipad mini  read the tech specs carefully  this is a hub only  i can transfer photo files from my iphone  s and canon sx    easily to my mac air  no problems there  i have never connected more than two devices through this hub  it is so lightweight that i cannot leave it permanently connected because it flips around and causes problems  if i am careful  i can have my le cie porsche connected and backing up at the same time that this is connected  i will use it to take with me around town  but for my work desk i am going to purchase the http   www amazon com easyacc  charging smartphones specially included dp b  mlvtl   ref cm cr pr product top  look at the video reviews for that product and read the tech specs and you will see that it is a superior product for daily use      
560,5.0,                       use it to extend ps  usb ports  there is an extended storage connected directly to the ps   this added four more ports to use for a fan stand  headphones and charging other devices  each port has a light that lets you know which port is being used and allows you to turn it off  no more plugging in or out     also makes it look more organized        
561,5.0,                       i ve bought two of these now to fix the same issue that a lot of people experience these days when building a pc   lack of the older usb     ports on the case itself   for my personal pc i bought an internal nzxt usb hub so it s out of sight and mind for a cleaner look for my wireless keyboard mouse but i like using this for others that i build computers for as they don t want to have to open the case and would have no idea how to even unattach something from a board   this little device is perfect for slapping a piece of velcro on the back and just plugging it into one of the usb      ports available on the back of your pc thus changing it into a     and allowing you to plug in those little wireless adapaters for your keyboard  mouse etc   so if you re frustrated from your wireless keyboard mouse seemingly not working correctly  do yourself a favor and pick up one of these  it has to be the usb       they do make an identical looking      some velcro tape and just slap this puppy on the back of your pc out of sight and problem solved   cheap and effective solution   when s the last time anyone could say that      
562,5.0,                       this very little usb hub works great  i saw some reviews of what must have been defective ones  which i guess is a possibility with these  but mine has worked very well  and i thought i would write a review  since i couldn t find one before  that mentions how this little guy works as far as music and a mac goes  the answer is very very well  no latency what so ever with my mac mini and nanokey   or my other types of midi inputs controllers  it is very simple and the power buttons are very cool for turning on and off keyboards without having to unplug them every time your done using and don t want to shut your computer down  these things are awesome and i m gonna order three more      
563,5.0,                       this hub is perfect basic usb     connectivity   it does not supply power it is working perfect for an old usb printer to a mfp storage server device i use it to provide a networked print station for android and pc   works perfect for this scenario a modern solution for old hardware it may not work with all hard drives not a fault of the device or manufacture  more fault of usb     in general and this era of electronics remember usb     is backwards compatible with       so if you need power  get a newer hub for that those have   amp powered connections you need for external drives because they are designed for modern devices this hub was designed before those drives were ever invented   of course it may not work with newer usb devices i needed a tiny inconspicuous usb     hub with exactly   ports and this is perfect for that   the switches were nice bonus consider your options before you buy anything always cheap  chinese made  but well constructed and does the job nicely      
564,5.0,                       this goes great with my laptop   i like that each button can be turned on and off as necessary and it adds a nice amount of usb plugins to my laptop which only has three   it works great and the blue led s match my laptop keyboard although that is completely necessary   it just looks pretty cool      
565,5.0,                       this is exactly what i needed to extend my use of usb peripherals   the cord length isn t long but adequate for my needs as i like to have the on off switches close to my laptop anyway   my only wish is that the length of the item was perhaps one inch longer giving a little more space between the usb ports for ease in installing or removing a usb cord   i found it easier to leave the cords attached and just remove or switch the items that were charging since most use the same style of cord   i love the light up feature on each of the on off buttons      
566,5.0,                       i love this product    multi plug for all our devices  i gave one to each of my boys  two to my husband  i have one my bedroom  office   kitchen  living room  and home office  i can have multiple devices on one  when people are over  they can charge their phone or portable charger  great value and product  and highly recommended      
567,5.0,                       so far this hub has been great   i have only had it a week   so far it is doing its job   i am not sure if it was the hub or a peripheral device  but it took windows    a while to get drivers right   the mouse and such had been previously installed somit may have been this device   it worked out in the long run though i wish the cord were a bit longer and replaceable   i am hard on cables and foresee having to change the device out when i wear it out  instead of replacing a cable      
568,2.0,                       for me  it keeps repeatedly shutting off and turning back on  i enjoy it and it works well but doesn t seem to work well  even typing this out is difficult for me since i connect it to my laptop and my keyboard connects to it  if it is the only mine that has this malfunction i would wonder if there is a way to get a new one since this malfunction has occurred      
569,5.0,                       it has been a phenomenal help for me at school i have a tiny little notebook with   usb hubs and connecting my printer  mouse  thumb drive  and other items has been a constant game of  which one can i unplug right now  it is easy to see which of the hubs are active the blue light behind the buttons is clear in the fluorescent light and the buttons stay pressed so i know which ones are turned on   all in all  very good   my only complaint is that the ports seem a little tight i had to work to get my printer cable out without pulling it apart      
570,3.0,                       worked fine with all ports in use   mic  camera  mouse and backup drive   today the port for the mouse  probably the one with the least power draw  failed   the button would not latch   in use about two months   three stars because it hasn t totally failed      
571,5.0,                       i really like this hub   i have two others   one that is a c powered and one  like this one  that is unpowered   the sabrent worked perfectly right out of the box   performing flawlessly so far  i also like the push button feature that connects or disconnects any usb drive or other component connected to it   so far  i have only been using it with usb     devices  so i do not know how it will do with my one usb     device  however  i have to assume it will rock  too   i also liked the immediate and unsolicited follow up from the seller manufacturer to inquire as to whether or not i am pleased with the unit   altogether  a most pleasant buying experience      
572,5.0,                       i ve found this works really well for both charging my devices  using flash drives  and hooking up my wired or wireless mouse  and i ve used it for a secondary desk light that works off usb   love it for all of them   does whatever i ask it to do   great at multitasking   i can use   usb devices on the computer and charge   devices at the same time and it s as fast or faster than other devices      
573,5.0,                       this is nice since so many laptops are taking away all the ports to be lighter which having to buy this defeats the purpose of that but whatever  it works awesome and i love that i can turn off the drive to have it removed from the list of available drives  wish cord were just a bit longer used at school for transferring data and it dangles a bit      
574,4.0,                       this gizmo is pretty neat  i bought it because my flight stick tends to confuse some games that think i m using it for a controller  i needed a way to turn off the flight stick so i could use the normal keyboard mouse  this works like a charm  even going through a kvm  it still has enough power to power my devices and i can turn them off as needed  my only complaint is that the cord is very short  you likely will need to plug into front ports  this thing simply won t reach to the back ports and still be close enough to turn on off devices      
575,3.0,                       i was using this for my wireless mouse keyboard adapter  bluetooth  and wireless headphones  it ran just fine for the first    months with the kb mouse   headphones  but after introducing my bluetooth adapter  it failed after about   month  this could be due to the data stream going to and from my pc for so many devices  which may need more testing  i m giving this a tentative   stars pending more testing  but it definitely helped me for the use case and time that i needed it      
576,4.0,                       it s extremely helpful in helping us free up electrical outlets to charge more than two devices  i like that the lights tell me if the particular port is on or not  the price was outstanding what s keeping me from   stars is there was no clarification on the fast charging adaptors  my androids have a fast charging adaptor but when used with this   port slows the charging wayyyyyy down  so this was useful for when we have a lot of time  and maybe traveling long distances and need more ports than our vehicle has to offer      
577,5.0,                       i bought this hub as we needed several ports for our machines in addition to the docking stations   i actually bought two   i like the fact that the ports have individual power buttons which is different from models from years back   it is performing exactly as i would expect it to and that is high praise for many tech devices being sold today      
578,5.0,                       the product is as expected  purchased this item to expand my usb ports on my lap top docking station  works great  the item does what i had hoped but i am more excited about the stellar service store pc provides  one week after receiving the product they contacted me asking if i had any questions on the product or anything else  amazing   not many stores do this  thank you for the wonderful product and the service you are providing  i would recommend this product and this company to others      
579,5.0,                       wonderfully good product     cheap pricing under           this   port usb hub has   individual switches with blue lights  just beautiful     my laptop mouse pad failed its point and click function   i bought in an external mouse   this   port hub serves it right     here we go   i have just finished a video talk all the way to san diego  ca   clear picture and sound   meaning connection is smooth in all  purchase recommended      
580,5.0,                       i have come to the point where i needed more usb ports   i ve got so many devices hooked up to my computer and didn t even think about buying something like this usb hub   so  i selected this one   it was cheaper than the others  but it also had on and off buttons for each usb port  which i love   its made sturdy  does the job  and i m extremely happy with my purchase   yay      
581,5.0,                       this is a really good compact usb hub and works for all neolithic laptops provided by offices which eschew usb c and more ports  like the ability to switch off any unused port      
582,5.0,                       i use this with my laptop that only has   working usb port  i can now charge my phone  use my mouse  control an arduino  and plug in my external hard drive all at once  i really like the buttons that allow you turn turn off and on the ports  they supply a satisfying click and light up when they re on  i haven t noticed any slower speeds or heating up when using all four ports  it s lightweight and small so it s easy to carry with you to anywhere you use a laptop  if you feel like you don t have enough usb ports and do not want to spend a significant amount of money i would recommend this one      
583,5.0,                       first day using this and works fabulous  i will update this review if i notice anything in the future  price is unbelievably low vs  quality for value  i had another component from sabrent a few years ago and was very impressed with the quality for the very low price and this motivated me to buy their components again this time  this hub component is listed on the official sabrent site at      plus shipping  product arrived in a retail presentation package and the carton was secured with seals suggesting that it was probably not a used return  the only other feature to speak about are the on off buttons  the   buttons can be used as   or all   or any combination of on off   thru   and that is convenient  only thing i can point out that does not show up easily in advertisement is that the hub is about the size of a  large pack of    stick chewing gum and is lighter in weight than expected so  the lightness of the hub weight will not necessarily allow it to stay lying flat on desk or table without cords flipping it over while using  however  the plugs stay in securely and it will remain connected  one must be alert and observe that moving one of the wires does not cause this hub to turn over and  then   may press against one of the   buttons and turn off whatever one is charging  i combined this hub with the   sabrent   awg usb     extension cord   feet  cb          this is available from same amazon seller as hub  extension cord allows hub to be behind computer and moves the clutter and chaos of wires out of the way  note  both of these items are available in an identical    usb       from sabrent      
584,1.0,                       cord length is very short i am returning for a replacement because only one of the ports works on my device  hopefully the replacement will function properly      
585,5.0,                       i really like the ability to turn off ports that are not needed  cord could be just a little longer  but i would say the same about most usb hubs  worth the value      
586,5.0,                       i bought this to attach to my laptop  i works perfectly  i can hook up my external mouse  keyboard and monitor when i need them  it only takes one plug to disconnect and make my laptop portable  love it      
587,5.0,                       works great   powers my wd  tb passport drive and a second drive at once while plugged into my laptop   having lighted push button switches is a bonus too  since i don t always want my portable drives accessible to the local network and can connect disconnect with the touch of a button   i use my laptop with the screen out flat and an external monitor  so this is really handy for attaching usb devices without needing to move things around to access the usb port along the back edge of the laptop      
588,5.0,                       needed additional ports at work and this is what i needed   would recommend it for anyone and love that you can turn off the ones you do not need      
589,5.0,                       it will power multiple devices  what i mean is     it will do keyboard  mouse and external hard drive no problem  most do not  i have   others that won t  i have also used it with keyboard  mouse and laser printer  it is very convenient to turn each slot on or off as well  great bang for the buck in my opinion      
590,5.0,                       i bought this device because my daughter had an artist tablet she needed to hook to the computer  the problem was  one usb was on one side of the computer  and the one was on the other  so the cords she had wouldn t reach  i love this device because now  she can plug up to four things on one side  all nice and neat  plus you can turn each one off and on with the touch of a button  they re even lit  so you can tell how many you have plugged in at once  we love it      
591,5.0,                       i particularly like the on off switch for each port  because i use an external had drive as backup via usb   the switch is an added layer of protection   possible improvements      would it cut too much into the profit margin for the included usb cable to be about twice as long      two double faced adhesive pads to anchor the device  which is very light weight  might be helpful   i would definitely buy this product again  even without the above suggestions amguez     
592,5.0,                       i needed a usb hub because i was trying to jailbreak my iphone but i only had   usb port on my laptop and i needed   usb ports to fulfill the jailbreak  so i bought this and it worked out well  the on off switches for individual usb ports comes in handy so you can t go wrong      
593,1.0,                       product didn t work and when i contacted the company their wanted it to be shipped back  i explained it would cost way more than the product to ship back from the caribbean but i was still ignored  crappy customer service and even more crappy item      
594,5.0,                       even though this is only a      its  still great and serves its  purpose for my needs  let me know when u have another device with a     or higher  other than that i really like this device  i can keep up to four    devices and when not in use  i can just hit the either of the switches and shut this device off until need again  great product for hooking up multiple devices      
595,5.0,                       bought this back in may      and it s honestly worked so nicely  i m only writing this review now because now   ports are dying and   died  but only within past   months  given the fact that usb     ports are especially finicky and can break very suddenly  this has worked like a champ  the lights under the buttons are decently bright  which helps when getting up from desktop at  am  to stumble into bed  and doing tasks that require focus can be tough tbh  i m buying a new one now  april           and going to choose this brand  most likely usb   model though      
596,5.0,                       i don t pretend to be a computer expert or anything  but i m not sure what most of these negative reviews are talking about   doesn t work with any of my devices or accessories   really  because i plugged in my mouse  my keyboard   my monitor and they all work just fine   it gets too hot   really  because mine sits right on top of my tower and has never once become hotter than room temperature  don t let the low price fool you because it works fine for the needs of     of us who use a computer everyday  thanks to this hub the entire back of my computer tower is wide open and i feel i ve alleviated a lot of the clutter  i recommend it      
597,5.0,                       i bought this because with my camera and ring light  i don t have enough ports for when i want to download pictures  etc   it s very nice that you can turn off the ports that you don t need as well  the cord length is perfect for me  not terribly long  but all my cords were already reaching past that to the ports already       
598,4.0,                       i am glad that i purchased this product  i will likely get more  it s nice to be able to press a button to turn off one of the ports  not sure why it s necessary but the longer i own the product i might be able to provide an answer  haven t experienced any noticable latency  yet  the registration process is simple      
599,2.0,                       i have purchased more than ten of these little hubs over the years and loved them  they have been my go to hub for a number of needs  but i just bought a new one and was sorely disappointed when i opened the box  they used to have a high quality cable with a thick  robust housing sleeve   close to       thick  this new one is barely an      and very flimsy  i don t think it will last long at all  i don t think it is durable enough for travel purposes  so sad to see another company ruin a perfectly good product to save a few pennies  i would have rather paid the difference to get a quality product  now i will have to find another go to usb hub      
600,3.0,                       it doesn t like it when i plug in my galaxy s   the computer recognized it and i was able to transfer files and then all of a sudden it starts flashing in the task bar and my netbook starts beeping saying it doesn t recognize the device  sometimes it works  sometimes not  i have a dino lite microscope  usb flash drive  and an external hard drive connected  not all on at the same time   i was able to successfully run a backup last night to the external drive  it seems to be okay when i connect the cellphone but once i wake the screen  then i start having problems      
601,5.0,                       it is a charger and it works so you wonder what else can be said   however  there are two things that makes this item stand out   first  each port has a switch to turn in on off   so every port does not have to be drawing power when you have only one device plugged in   second  the company very generously offered me an extension cord at no charge after i had purchased the charger   the cord that plugs into the wall is quit short so you have to be selective with which outlet you use   i got a message a few days after the item was delivered offering me a free extension   the cord adds flexibility to the charging device      
602,5.0,                       you will be quite pleased with your purchase of this usb hub   i love it  it s a nice  minimal  clean design  with just the right length of main usb cable attachment   by far my favorite feature are the toggle buttons above each usb port  that toggle power to the ports  and is indicated by a subtle blue led light  unlike so many others  bluetooth devices looking at you  that become an annoyance overall a great four port     hub   i have one for my game consoles  ps  xo  and another connected to a usb extension cable to a usb    to ac power adapter so i can charge devices without being hinged to a pc      
603,5.0,                       i ordered this so i can plug in my printer  scanner  mouse and keyboard that i like to use with my laptop  i have a work laptop and personal laptop and i wanted to be able to switch in between without having to unplug everything  this is very handy because now everything is plugged into the hub and i just unplug the hub and plug it into the other laptop  i also like that there are individual power switches for each usb port  great deal      
604,5.0,                       i just started working a remote job and had trouble connecting to the internet through a hotspot and had to teether connection through my phone  it s a problem when you have a headset and mouse with only   ports and you need to connect a phone  a quick google search told me to get a usb port and i looked for something affordable and looked like it would suit my needs based on the pictures as i m not good with extra tech items  quick and painless to use and it was delivered the same day  everything works perfectly      
605,4.0,                       it looks really cool  not built terrible  but the mechanism inside is loose    still works fine  still great product  but because of the loose mechanism  it can be difficult to press the buttons because in certian positions they dont go in all the way  not a problem for me with how i have it set up  but i could see it being a hastle for someone else   caution   do not plug in anything that is volatile in maintaining a specific voltage    using this to plug in an external hard drive can damage the disk  using it for paripheral devices like webcams  mice  keyboards  or usb printers will probably have no issues  but it can damage your external hd      
606,5.0,                       this item was shipped quickly  plug and play   fixed all my compatibility issues in about five seconds   fabulous    it s very lightweight   not sure about durability  but for this low price unless it only lasts a month or so  it s well worth it   highly recommended      
607,5.0,                       i read too many reviews which could poison you on every one of these types of hubs which are for sale   but sooner or later  you have to buy something   my new mac has only   usb     slots  the rest are all thunderbolt   but my nikon cameras use usb as does my i phone charger and camera for my computer   all the ports work although i have not used them for hard drives as they consume more power and i don t know that this can take more than one power hungry devices  it worked and that is what is important   price was fair      
608,3.0,                       this little usb hub works okay  it works with my keyboard  my mouse  and my usb thumbdrive but will not allow my portable harddrive to connect   i have tried in all   ports and it will not come up   anytime you plug something new into the hub  it seems to power cycle the rest of the devices connected which is annyoing if you have a usb stick connected   also the cord itself is a little short so i had to purchase a usb extender      
609,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this   port usb charger is compact and easy to use  the buttons all worked  turning on and off the ports  the blue led lights turn on for each port as it s used  arrived on time and as described      
610,1.0,                       this is the first time i have to give a negative review   it worked well in the beginning but now not even a month later it has begun to malfunction   i use it plugged into my smart tv to control a mini wireless keyboard and also to host my usb to watch downloaded shows   it will work for   minutes if i am lucky then the tv will indicate that my devices are not connected   i decided to try it on my laptop only to be informed that the device has malfunctioned   good thing i did not discard my previous usb port hub      
611,4.0,                       i would have to say that this product is decentt  it connects very easily and runs smoothly  i would have to say that it is very useful and responsive  it has a couple of flaws one of those flaws is when i went to plug it on for the first time it would unplug and plug back in  i finally got the dricer to install after restarting the computer a couple times  by the way it has not done it sense then another flaw is that it does not come with the power cable for the dc charger which i jonestly did not even realize was there until i fiddled around with it for a while i got that plugged in and realized rhat you can use it as a charger when its plugged in like that  the lights already quit emulating all the way  its just halfway around the buttons other than that i would have to say worth what you are paying for it      
612,5.0,                       i love that i can put   items into this port  you can also control which port you want on  because each outlet has a power button that lights up blue when on  the only dislike is the cord is to short but nothing a usb extension didn t correct  it s a great device      
613,5.0,                       i ve got an imac and had some trouble getting this to work  it seems like it draws too much power for it to actually function and my imac turns off that usb updated            within    hrs of writing the review on this product  sabrent contacted me and offered me a replacement  i just received it and it s working great  i m so glad because it s a nice looking hub  gosh that s girly of me  and my imac was sorely in need of more usb ports  right now i m charging my iphone through one of the ports  i m very pleased with the customer service  it d be nice if the cord was just a tiny bit longer  but that s my only complaint  love the blue lights      
614,5.0,                       i bought this equipment to use on my work laptop so that i could plug in a full sized keyboard and a trackball   the laptop has only two usb ports and the second port is being used for a usb headset to take calls and participate remotely in meetings   for the purpose i intended  the device works great   it is low profile  unobtrusive and does the job more than adequately   i am very happy with it and it is well worth the cost which was very reasonable      
615,1.0,                       garbage  plugged in  os does not recognize it at all  tried all ports and nothing  attempted to plug wireless mouse  didn t recognize that at all  complete garbage  left plugged  and restarted pc  to see if that worked  still didn t      
616,5.0,                       i purchased a surface pro this past january and as we all know     there s only one usb    when purchasing the surface i told myself that the   usb would not be a problem    i m not sure who i was kidding  i love gadgets and most of my gadgets revolve around the computer     this was the solve all for me    so many hubs require additional power to support various hard drives or even an iphone  this bad boy just makes my day  it is able to support an iphone and numerous other usb devices without the use of an external power supply  i know    draining my battery like crazy   also  let s stop and think for a moment about the ability of the buttons on top  i can eject my devices  those of you who do not eject your thumb drives should hang your heads now    and leave them plugged in until i m ready to pack up  better yet  the buttons allow me to control my connection to other peripheral devices without even unplugging them this gadget gets         star approval    yes full gadget approval  stop here    take a look    consider the applications it can be used in    i doubt that you ll regret it   travelers especially      
617,5.0,                       i purchased this product to re position some wireless receivers for my gaming mouse  keyboard  and controller  all logitech   i think i was having issues either due to distance  or proximity to usb     ports  or possibly both as soon as i moved the receivers to this hub  my problems stopped and i ve been able to get my game on without annoyance of input device connection dropping or lagging all of the ports on the device worked  and the ability to turn on or off certain ports is appreciated      
618,5.0,                       i needed a usb hub with switches and this one works great   i have two usb ports on both side and only one in the back  it makes it cumbersome to use the wireless mouse on one side and looks disheveled with wires on all three sides   now i have plugged into the hub my usb powered speakers  scanner  printer  and external hard drive that looks more organized  so far i have the speakers and the hard drive that works well with the switch on  i really like the light indicator indicating what is on and off      
619,5.0,                       i ordered this for my wife   she works at the local school as a lunch lady  hair net and all   hands off boys  she s mine      the school district supplied laptop doesn t have enough usb ports for the usb pin pads that the kids use to debit their food purchases from their lunch plans   this allowed here to install four pin pads which helps kids get through the line faster   since it doesn t require an external power supply and it is a simple plug and play it made it east for my non techy wife to make it work the first time every time   in other words it does what it says it will do  and it does it well   she s been using it for nearly   months without fault   would definitely but it again      
620,5.0,                       aside from the cord being short at around  in  i have no major complaints  the lights are very bright blue  keep this in mind if this is in your bedroom as it may disrupt your sleep      
621,5.0,                       i have used many usb hubs in the past  all of the ones that were used by me had a external power supply  and they didnt even perform as well as this one  which did not come with a external power  the only things i needed it for was my mouse  keyboard and wired game controller  my  desktop replacement only has   usb ports  however one port is reserved for my bluetooth usb adapter  so i was constantly unplugging things  because most of the time i am hooked up to a monitor for better resolution  my setup pretty much demands that i use a external usb keyboard  fed up with unplugging things  i began the hunt for a usb hub again  past hubs would often disconnect randomly  even when there were few devices plugged in  once i saw the reviews for this item i decided to give it a try  i was also on a budget  so this one was fairly priced  having been using it for nearly a week now  i must say this is the best working usb hub i have ever used for my setup  have not had one disconnect since getting it  it does not come with a power supply  yet i see what appears to be a port for one  all i had to do was plug it in and vola  it also has buttons that activate and deactivate each port on it  usually i only keep two ports active at all times  other than whats plugged in  i dont use it for anything else  because its powered from the computer  i am not going to plug high power devices into it  like usb external hard drives  for things like that i would recommend a good one with a external power  for what i needed it for  its actually really great  i am also running windows     and there are no compatibility issues    our of   stars      
622,3.0,                       not really the fault of the product i guess but this isn t what i needed  was hoping to be able to charge my ecig and play music in my car at same time  my car has one usb  device won t allow music to be played so  defeats the purpose of why i got it  seems to work fine for charging through      
623,5.0,                       this is another product that i have purchased that is very convenient  have you ever thought to yourself   man  i wish i had more usb slots where i am able to place a certain amount of devices into one computer   well  this item has answered your wish  and whoever just happens to have a macbook this works even better with this usb type c adapter  here is what i am talking about  https   www amazon com gp product b   z xb   ref ppx yo dt b asin title o   s   ie utf  psc  i like how it lights up when you press the button after it has been plugged in  for me  it does not charge your device but i did not purchase this item for it to charge a device such as phones and etc  i got this item specifically for my flash drive and to sync up any data that is on my iphone  i am glad that it came in clutch  now i know what to use when the time comes for me to store data or do whatever i intend to do  if you feel that you need more usb slots  go for it  the more space you have  the easier it will be for you and it will be more convenient      
624,5.0,                       in case you haven t noticed today s laptops have changed  gone are the fussy  overheating  jumpy cursor  poorly lit  squinty  on again off again models of yesteryear  nowadays  they are not only as portable as ever  but as powerful as all but the top of the line desktops  this capability is possible because of gadgets like the sabrent usb     hub  got a laser mouse  no problem  need an external hard drive  no problem  how about a chillmat to keep things cool when the gaming gets hot  well  no problem  you get the idea  using too much battery life when everythings hooked up  how about individually controlled units that can be switched on or off as needed  it works very well indeed and the best part is that it doesn t take up much space to do it at a very affordable price  highly recommended      
625,5.0,                       this is a nifty little product  i wanted additional usb ports and this is perfect  it s compact  i can elect which ports are on  and works like a dream  i ll plan to order one for my home office and a spare  great product      
626,5.0,                       i bought these to hold my   sdr sharp dongles so i can run unitrunker   police scanner software   they work well  but sometimes getting the software drivers to distinguish between the two dongles is difficult   other than that  it s perfect   the only negative is the   inch cable   i wish it was at least    inches long so i can put it on top of my desktop tower      
627,5.0,                       this is an inexpensive solution to the problem of expanding the number of usb ports   the strip of   usb ports can expand the number of devices connected to a microcomputer   the device is small and lacks little space in a bag   the ports are in line  so if an external device has a wide plug  it will block at least one port   the strip has an off on button for each port      
628,4.0,                       it s a simple device and easy to use  i have   of them and they are handy to have  one of the ports stopped working so i gave it the   stars  i think i would have liked the cord a little longer  of course that is no fault of the product      
629,1.0,                       update changing to one star cause now it s usb is keeping in connecting disconnecting every now and then from my laptopso annoying since it s was bought just few months backworks fine connecting mouse  keyboard and lync speaker     
630,1.0,                       i can t use this at all  that s why i originally purchased it but it s not powerful enough  now i just use it for my mouse and keyboard and one of the ports is broken  i have to keep everything connected in the exact same slots or i waste time trying to figure out the exact combination of ports and sequence of connecting them in order to get everything to work  which is disruptive to my workflow      
631,4.0,                       this usb hub arrived as scheduled and i was able to connect it to one of my systems running windows    anniversary edition  i did not have to load any software  just connect it to the pc and then connect some usb devices to the hub  it works like it should  and having a separate switch for each port allows you to prevent wear   tear because you do not have to repeatedly connect and disconnect your devices  also good when charging  devices because you can send the power to just the devices you want      
632,1.0,                       i love the idea behind this and the price was great  but it is not worth the price because it is as cheaply made as it is to purchase    i bought one previously somewhere else and only   of the   ports worked on it  and i had bought it for my son  so i decided to purchase one of these for myself   the one i got all of the lights shine blue when you plug it in and it appears to be working great until you go to use the usb   none of the ports charged my phone or did anything when i attempted  i made sure they were turned on and the ligths were on and i tried multiple different sources to rule out each usb port  all   did not work   returning product and won t be attempting another purchase      
633,3.0,                       these hubs are merely okay at best   it is partly my fault for not paying attention to detail in the description   i was expecting powered usb     hubs with switches   i had previously ordered the usb     versions with the switches  but needed a couple of usb     hubs   i figured this was from the same company and bam i would be done   it is okay  i do not blame the company for my laziness   i am sure i will find uses for these hubs   they work as intended  but not exactly what i needed   the company was insistent on me giving a review  so i am giving one   for anyone interested in these hubs  please note     these are not powered hubs   they only get power from the usb port that it plugs into  which is never enough in most cases      
634,5.0,                       good  it s a space saving area for usb for our kitchen island  one star for that bad  it doesn t charge but maybe one thing at a time    if you re lucky  tried various cords  items and maybe get one thing to charge      
635,5.0,                       i have had this product for a month  now and it works great   for the price  this device is one of my top    life purchases   my    foot russell westbrook  okc thunder  fathead vinyl wall decal is another  this device is so convenient and easy to use  this is one of those devices that makes so much sense i purchased this product for my pioneer a v receiver  that has a usb port  so my wife and i could listen to the different genres of music we like at the press of a bottom   for example  i like a mixture of rock  country and r b  my wife  mainly  likes r b  i also purchased some sandisk cruzer fit flash drives which fit perfectly in this hub  each flash drive stores the different genres of music things to remember  ports are close together  so if your flash drives are normal size or bigger  then you may  only  be able to use   or   of the ports  when you first insert your flash drive  for the first time  be extremely carful not to force or shove it into the port  there are tiny contact pins in the ports that will bend if not inserted gently and straight    i speak from experience   this is my second one   after the first insertion  i pull out and insert the flash drives normally      
636,5.0,                       if my review headline makes sense to you  this will work perfectly for that particular use case   it also is pretty small and was easy to conceal i ve used velcro to mount this on the underside of my tesla model   s phone charging holding area  with the update that brought the dashcam feature  one port had to be taken by the usb thumb drive used to store the video  so this allows me to still have the integrated dashcam setup  but still have the charging cable on both sides the ability to enable disable each port with a physical hardware switch is quite nice  i can keep other things plugged in and not worry about phantom power draw  unless you are going to secure it somewhere or keep it out of the way  this may not always be the best choice though  i could see it may increase the likelihood of accidental  unsafe  device removal if the buttons are accidentally hit  so be cognizant of what you intend to use this for and where you ll put it      
637,1.0,                       unfortunately there was a loose connection or something  because when plugging in my headphones or mobile device i kept getting that beeping sound that windows makes when things are getting plugged in   i tested all of my cords and devices out by using my laptop s usb port and everything worked fine  so the fault is with this device   i really wanted this to work because the price point is right  the reviews were quite good  and the size   number of ports is perfect  sadly  i did not have the same experience as other customers  i will definitely be purchasing a different brand      
638,5.0,                       i dropped my laptop one too many times  and all of the usb ports on the right side stopped working  i have way too many chargers and accessories for the one remaining port to cut it  so i bought this thing  it works well  it would be better if i had a desktop and didn t have to drag it around  i guess that s what i get for dropping my computer  the lights are a nice feature as is the ability to turn ports on and off      
639,3.0,                       i was so excited to get this  so when i received it  i immediately plugged it into my computer and    nothing   ok  i m no tech genius  so i had to try several different things before i could finally get it to work    plug it into your computer before turning the computer on   plug the chargers or other items you want to use with it before pressing the little on off buttons   occasionally jiggle the chargers or other items you want to use it with to ensure good contact    sometimes you need to remove and reinsert the charger or other items several times before the hub will  see  itonce you can get it to work  it s great   oh  would have been nice if any instructions were included in the packaging      
640,5.0,                       i m using it at present only to connect a dongle for my keyboard to my computer  and it works well   the port lights as it is supposed to  and the hub dangles from the back of my computer  sight unseen      
641,5.0,                       this device provides utility to notebook computers     this one just does it a little better than most  it s well made  the status led s  and all ports on a single side which makes access to the ports and cable management a breeze  this hub is limited to the power available only through the connection  while this seems like a disadvantage  it s really all you ll normally use because of mobility  data transfer rates are good given this hub is     if you need a place for an rf or bluetooth adapter  jump drive  card reader  etc  this is the accessory      
642,5.0,                       just like the title says   my computer s usb ports are all used up for keyboards and mice and external monitors so it was a necessity to get this in order to plug in my xbox controller and headset  the cord isn t very long so what i did was buy those velcro picture hanging things from the dollar store  and stuck one on the back of the usb hub and one on my desk next to the side of my laptop  it stays firmly in place  so none of the bajillions of cords on my desk are tugging it  the soft blue light it emits matches my speaker system light and it s not too bright  the lights turn of when the port isn t being used and you click it  and also when the computer powers down   a must have      
643,5.0,                       i have a viking pro tablet which has a usb port on it  i wanted to use a full keyboard and mouse with it since it was hard to type on  after discovering i could indeed use a keyboard i bought this so i could plug a mouse and keyboard in at the same time  it works perfectly  love that i can turn off   of the ports so i save a bit of battery life  now my tablet has the comforts of a full sized computer but with portability  if your tablet has a usb port this definitely works      
644,2.0,                       it seems like this thing can t power the items attached to it  simultaneously  one at a time goes ok  when i plugged it into my usb c dock  the dock had a fit and had to be power cycled to recover  i used it on a tv to simply power   usb  v    amp bias backlights  it couldn t handle both lights  one would illuminate  and the other would start to flash in a weird accelerating pattern  i ll keep it for the occasional use  but it s mostly drawer filler  if you have power intensive accessories  move on to something bigger   better   faster   stronger  perhaps the powered usb     version is better equipped      
645,5.0,                       i love this product  i bought one about a year ago which still works just fine but i wanted another one  the new one i bought has a little bit longer cable which i find more convenient but other than that it is still the same great product  i have run a number of things through the usb ports  usb piano keyboards  mice  computer keyboards  turtle beach headphones  etc  i haven t had any problems with them so far and would recommend them to anyone looking for a discrete usb splitter  i also would add i love the way the product looks  the light up blue lights for which usb port is activated are great     
646,5.0,                       so i purchased this item in december of       it came in and the next day  i plugged it in  and it works amazingly i definitely love the fact that i am able to turn on and off which usb i want to have in use  whether it s al four or just one of them only  the cord length is perfect  which allows it to stay close to the computer and doesn t take an ample amount of space  if you have a desk that has limited space or plenty of space  this little guy is perfect for you      
647,5.0,                       i purchased one recently to enable me to have more usb ports on my hp laptop  it worked perfectly right out of the box  the computer recognized it and all i had to do was plug it in  so  i wanted more usb connections for my imac and the description said this would also work on os systems  i purchased a second one with the same results  i m a very satisfied customer      
648,4.0,                       it works  but if i touch it or something jars it  my devices disconnect from windows   after i move it a bit or sometimes it connects back by itself of course i tried different usb ports but it s the same   i use different mouse devices and the push button option to turn one mouse off to use another is a desirable feature for me update   contacted sabrent about the disconnect problem   they sent me a new one and now i m having no problems   it works well      
649,4.0,                       this usb hub was purchased with a few other items that were being fulfilled by amazon  this shipped the next day and arrived at my home the day after so that s always a bonus with the shopping experience regarding the hub  the overall feel is a little light and cheap like  which i was expecting for the price  however  once plugged in and you get things plugged into it  you don t really notice and it works perfectly  the blue leds that are around the power switches for each individual plug in are also a nice touch  being able to turn each port on and off is also a feature i don t normally see when looking into these usb hubs overall  after you get over the first impression that feels like it s not going to last  the rest is smooth sailing as this is a solid little usb hub with some nifty features      
650,5.0,                       i have purchased several of these already and  when these start wearing out i will definitely be ordering more of them   i try to aim for computer items that are plug and play easy  with no confusing installations or being forced to go hunt down a bunch of driver files online   all of sabrent s products fit that bill   this     usb hub is a great one to keep on hand for when you re going back and forth between newer and older computers without the usual arguments from win    wanting to snub  legacy  software and drivers   highly recommend      
651,1.0,                       extremely disappointed  only one of the   ports actually worked when i turned it on and that died after a couple of weeks  i liked the size and the concepts but this one was just rubbish      
652,4.0,                       the ability to quickly turn on and off individual ports is a great feature  especially when you do no want to expose critical files to cyber mischief or hacking the only downside is that the cable to usb plug connection does not seem to be strong enough for my type of use   what happens is that the cable wire connections to the usb plug break loose and lose connection it is connected to my laptop usb port so i can connect multiple simultaneous devices   however  since i frequently change location the unit gets treated roughly   using it in a fixed location would subject it to much less abuse   have not seen a unit at this price point that offers usb port on off repeated plugging in will eventually wear out the usb port receptacle  especially if it is jostled while plugged in   just be careful about using it      
653,1.0,                       i bought this to use with my usb cruzer flash drives  unfortunately there isn t enough space between the slots to fit them  i can only use     one at each end  so for my purpose this item is almost useless  the inputs should be spaced apart a little bit so you can use them  if you re using regular usb wires it ll be a tight fit but it works fine  i gave the product one star so people would know about this  if i wasn t using any flash drives  i d give the product a   or        
654,5.0,                       i have tried several others and kept having issued with a wireless headset and other items randomly turning on off   i believe it was because those ones had a     port on them from what i ve read   so i bought this one and haven t had any issues with it    months at the time of this review    i can plug my external hd into my playstation then my headset  controller  and keyboard into this and everything is fine   plus the power button on each usb is a nice feature to have      
655,4.0,                       i bought this hub to be used at work  it functions pretty well for the most part but i have noticed that when i have multiple flash drives plugged into the hub and i push the on off switch for one port  the other drives plugged into the remaining active ports disconnect momentarily  i m not sure why this happens but it does cause problems if i m in the middle of transferring files to the online drives  i normally don t even use the switches but i have hit them accidentally when i m trying to pull a device out of a port      
656,5.0,                       i have a very old computer that i am using since my laptop broke  unfortunately for me  this computer only has one usb port on the front with a hard to reach   more in the back  as a seller on   different forums i am constantly needing more usb ports to get pictures from my cannon camera onto my computer so i can sell  this is one of the best investments i have made and it didn t break the bank  for me this was a wonderful and necessary investment that i have not for one moment regretted  i use it daily and i paired it with the amazon basics usb     a male to a  female extension cable and it gave me tons of room to move it around just what i needed  i highly recommend this item     
657,5.0,                       love that amazon makes suggestions   point of purchase for similar products  we were purchasing a logitec webcam and this product was included with it as a suggestion  neither my husband nor i were aware there was such a product as the sabren   port usb hub  we thought it was a good idea and being that we only have   port left on our tower  we did purchase it  we were so glad we did because it helped us not only with the webcam but ended up having issues with our printer  after doing all the pc directives on trying to get the printer functioning again  i thought why not plug it into this sabrent rather than our pc tower          it worked then      i m no geek  and really don t understand why this worked but i m extremely happy we had the sabrent   this moment of frustration  l o v e it  for this low price  get one      
658,5.0,                       my computer only has one usb port  so i needed a trip that would allow for multiple usb devices  this one fits the bill and is a great value for the price point  i like that there s buttons so you don t have to unplug  and lose  a tiny usb if you re not using it  just click off the button      
659,4.0,                       i purchased this to add a few more usb ports to my pc   i installed it on the back and wrapped around the side and added a small piece of  m double sided sticky tape to secure it to the side of my tower  all the ports work and the lights as well for each port  the lights turn on and off for each port when you toggle the power to that port  its a bit chintsy that each light spills over to the next so when one is on it almost lights up two  no biggie just kind of cheap  but for the price what can you expect  it does the job its supposed to do   the cord itself is a bit short for what i wanted but that s ok too  no biggie  over all i m satisfied with the product      
660,2.0,                       it s good for    well almost nothing  if all you re doing is transferring a low bit files off of     drives then you shouldn t have a problem  but don t expect to thread your accesories through this thing and have the same quality of a direct connection      
661,5.0,                       i recently was given a laptop from my employer and the model that they use only has one usb port per side  as i need to use a wifi stick on one side that blocks the port  that left me with only one usb port  i ordered this product  as it would allow me to plug my cell phone charger cord  mouse  larger desktop screen  and flash drive in all at once  i have been using this for a few weeks and it has worked out perfectly  i also like that it gives you the option to  turn off  a port by pressing a button  i don t always use my desktop screen or my phone charger  so it is nice to be able to cut off power to those items without messing with unplugging and plugging back in wires all the time  this saves battery life on my computer as well      
662,3.0,                       one of the buttons is broken and really  i did not need the buttons  just needed an inexpensive hub  so this works for what i need it for   the broken button is only if i try to use it  it does not stay in the locked position      
663,5.0,                       this is an excellent product if you need to plug in lots of things into your usb port   i am a tech coach in a school  and i purchase these for my teachers to use with doc cameras  wireless mice  and anything else that requires a usb      
664,1.0,                       i purchased this hub to use it for charging my apple devices connected to a charger and not my computer  being able to keep them in the stand and turn on the one that needed to charge  it looked very smart for that purpose  the trouble was that it just doesn t work  the first line in the product information should have said   note  this hub can only be used connected to a computer and not to a usb charger   if it had  i would not have purchased just another usb hub  it is only because it is too much work returning it for the cost of       that i don t      
665,5.0,                       a perfect solution to expanding available usb ports  extremely reliable and just as well built for great dependability  it has a cord length that is long enough to provide distance from your computer  perhaps     yet not too long that excessive cord length clutters your work area i use mine with my laptop that i use both at home and away  while i have four ports available  i leave it on my desk connected to my mouse  iphone charging cord and wd mycloud backup device to it  so that when i get home and connect to it  or leave  it s a single connect disconnect   i have a travel mouse for working away from home  am i lazy  that s not unfair  but on a practical level  forgetting to reconnect the mycloud device after reconnecting the mouse and iphone cord means i miss backing up that day s work  i m diligent about backups because murphy stalks me and his fourth law says something will happen to my laptop or hard drive the day it isn t backed up  for seven bucks  life is just a littttle less complicated  and i am worth it  in fact  i may be worth     as i am considering a  nd device for my computer bag  even if there are a mere two devices plugging into it  the travel mouse   iphone cord i   am   worth      ordering now        
666,4.0,                       i bought one  just to try it out  well  in the end i bought three more i didn t expect the size to be so small and when i got it  i immediately felt like it was a good purchase  it had a very modern design  travel sized  everything is necessary and nothing was over the top it doesn t feel like a top of the notch hub  but it doesn t feel cheap either  i d say it feels good  reliable second thing i like are the individual power buttons for each usb  sometimes  you just want to keep things plugged in but turned off and it s so easy with this why did i buy so many  there are a lot of people in my family   i am usually the one that buys items and if it s good i buy a few more as gifts for my aunts uncles and siblings  even friends  my sister has a surface pro   and brother with a surface pro   they both love this hub when i gave them one each i would recommend this to anyone who needs a reliable  travel sized hub with good design      
667,5.0,                       four switch controlled usb ports  like a gift from heaven   this is my second one and the first one is still working well   highly recommend if yu have the need for such a device      
668,1.0,                       i plugged the splitter into   different usb ports  and tried all   of the power switches on the splitter and none of them would charge my iphone  i even made sure to try   different charging cables  i was sad to see this  especially after reading all the other great reviews and it being the    best seller      
669,5.0,                       i was looking for a inexpensive way to expand my usb capacity   it is perfect for my use   i hooked up my wireless mouse and my back up drive   this hub is small and unobtrusive  and it gets the job done   i accessed my smart phone to download some photos and i noticed there was a some phone charging going on   nice      
670,1.0,                       doesn t charge cellphones  charges anything else just not my iphones  i bought   of these and the both have the same issue  also  cord is extremely short      
671,1.0,                       i bought this because i have only   usb port on my tv and i wanted to hookup   devices at the same time  so i connected a set of led lights and my chromecast to this thing  it didn t work  when i turn on the lights my chromecast shuts down  it seems like this device doesn t have enough power to feed both things at the same time  the whole point of this item is to feed more than one device  so pretty much it didn t work out for me      
672,5.0,                       using this usb hub with my laptop to supply extra ports   press the button to use a port  and it also lights up   very economical and efficient      
673,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i was waiting for it for almost   weeks but i was very excited when i starting to use it  i connect   speaker    usb    gb    mouse  and   mechanical gaming keyboard  automatic install and going and all of the plugin ports work together  also  the light can show the plug is working or not  but only one point is the port is a little bit tight  it makes you push your usb and pull out your usb more hard  however  my device no often plugs out  so this no problem for me  it also makes my device better fixed to the usb hub i wish this review helpful to all of the others      
674,5.0,                       just got mine in the mail yesterday  and i love it  the reason i got it was because my macbook only has   usb slots and i needed more  it works exactly the way i need it to  all of the slots work for it just fine  the only thing is that the cord length isn t long  but that s not a problem for me      
675,5.0,                       when i first received this hub  i tested out all of the ports  they were a tad tight for a logitech wireless mouse and keyboard usb drives  so i had to push a bit to get them in  one of the ports didn t work  and i noticed that the drive didn t go all the way in  upon inspection  i realized  and i know this is probably not the technical term  that one of the teeth were bent and folded in  while i was hesitating over whether to contact the seller  since i couldn t be sure whether i broke the port when i pushed my usb drive in or if i received a defective product  the seller reached out to me for feedback  i wrote back explaining that one of the ports were broken  but that it could have been my own fault  the seller immediately sent me a replacement and told me i could keep the defective hub as well  i couldn t be more satisfied with their customer service  this was a situation where it s possible  maybe even probable  that it was not their fault  i spent quite some time pondering the likelihood of a bent tooth in the port being a manufacturing error      and without hesitation they sent me a replacement  they were customer oriented and responsive so far i ve had zero issues with the hub aside from their being a bit tight for my logitech usb drive  other drives less so   it is a great product at a great price point  overall  i am      satisfied with the purchase and with the seller s customer service      
676,5.0,                       i gave the sabrent   port usb     hub   stars because it does what it claims to  inexpensively   the ports are spaced far enough apart to accommodate thumb drives   the cable is long enough to let the body rest on a desk  but not much longer than that   if you use a laptop on a very small surface  the hub will hang off   i tried it  and it did not unplug   i had no issues when turning on or off the power buttons   note that i used only flash drives  and have not tested the device with an external hard drive   for an external hard drive   also note that it is usb       if your laptop has usb     ports  i suggest that you buy the usb     version in sum  i purchased this to use with an older dell studio       with only   usb     ports   the hub is compact  and fits nicely in my computer accessory bag  and lets me work with all my thumb drives at the same time  for less than       it s perfect for this use      
677,5.0,                       i ordered this because my pc has only   usb ports  this works just as i had hoped  plugged it in and immediately had the extra ports that i needed  it solved my problem      
678,5.0,                       love it  it was a tangled mess before and i did not have enough usb ports  this is great   now i have options if i want to connect anything else  i love that i can turn and off the ports not being used  have not had any issues and i have had it for   months      
679,3.0,                       i purchased a new comput that had just one  ubs port   i have a mouse plugged in and that s about all this decice will charge   cannot plug printer into it  cannot plug iphone into it and other things  i sure didn t get my monies worth i would not recommend to buy      
680,5.0,                       this gadget is really nice  the buttons light up when they re being used  it helps me connect more things to my laptop that use a usb  laptops tend to not have very many usb ports  so  this is an essential purchase in my opinion     
681,5.0,                       i bought this along with a usb extension cable to give myself an easily accessible usb hub  my computer is off to the side of my desk and it is a pain to lean over to connect or disconnect something so far the hub stands up well and i am able to quickly connect and disconnect whatever devices that attaches to it  especially with the power buttons on it i have a controller and a keypad connected to this hub  the power buttons help with disconnecting the controller especially because some games i don t use the controller and it vibrates in response to games  a resting controller not being used makes a lot of noise on a table when it vibrates i can t speak to whatever power supply it provides because that isn t what i bought it for      
682,5.0,                       this works perfectly for my work needs  i would honestly suggest using this product  may get more for my kid s computers as well  i know so many people write reviews even the  ones  who own the product will make reviews on their stuff to enhance it  this one they don t have to it speaks for itself  small  easy to use  and out of the way      
683,4.0,                       i wish i could say this was the best item i would have ever spend money as a computer nerd  but it isn t only because i wish i had    more of this but that would cost me alot so   yea i love this product  i plug my yeti and other usb stuff only when i need it i press the button which gives blue led when it is on  since my yeti    does not have a on of switch i have to use this which makes my life much more easier but i would recommend to buy the    usb port one   is just not enough          
684,5.0,                       i have a laptop on my desk and a desktop underneath it  and one external mouse  keyboard and headset that i switch between the two  it was a pain to switch to and from the desktop because there aren t enough usb ports on the front for everything and scrabbling around on the floor to use the rear ports was a pain  now everything is plugged into the hub  and my phone is currently charging on one of the ports too  and all i have to do is move the hub connector from the laptop port to the desktop port when i need it  since none of the devices is data heavy  usb     meets my needs just fine  which is why i chose the cheaper usb     model over the     version      
685,5.0,                       i ve got a camera and a couple of mini usb charging cables plugged into it  it works great for what i need it to do  no issues      
686,5.0,                            satisfied   this is the second one for us  now we each have one   love that we can turn off or on individual ports with a button  fast delivery and packaging was realistic  not overdone   don t you hate when you buy a pen and it comes in an apple crate    this is especially nice for us folks that don t have a lot of ports  priced well within reason  probably cheaper than any you can buy in stores      
687,5.0,                       works well enough  and i enjoy the individual control for the usb ports  my only two gripes are the insanely short cord length and the flimsy weight that makes it hard to use on a desk  the lights are nice but the rings around the buttons doesn t fully light up and only the forward edge shines blue      
688,5.0,                       nice   port hub  i don t think the switches are really necessary  but it s an ok feature  the leds are very bright  so don t put it where you can see it in the dark   the usb wire is a little short for my linking  about   inches  it does work with chromebook which is what i needed  have my keyboard  wireless mouse and printer hooked up with no problems      
689,5.0,                       works great  wife needed a small device for her ms surface pro  it only have   usb port this allows her to have her wireless mouse and portable drive hooked up at same time  the slot power buttons are nice also allowing to conserve battery power      
690,5.0,                       the   port usb arrived from amazon early  as usual   this sabrent     usb hub was a replacement for a unit where the strain relief started to crack  the  st sabrent unit lasted well past a year so i m satisfied  i shove this piece in n outta my backpack at least   times a week so i think it s held up pretty well  i bought the     rather than the      as my hp has        usb ports already  to satisfy some peripheral demands  i know  i know i ve heard been told that     s vertically compatible with     devices but my experience is that     shall not mix with      so  this hub takes care of my problems for a low cost  i haven t had any     devices rejected with this hub  this hub is plugged into a     usb    alliswell      
691,5.0,                       wonderful usb hub  working great since one year now and i am buying a second unit  i have a computer keyboard  a mouse  an external hard drive and a usb piano keyboard plugged on it and everything works perfectly  i can also plug my iphone to back it up and charge it  i really like the lighted blue switches that allow me to disconnect my backup drive when i don t need it  push the switch back on and my drive appears on my desktop after a few seconds  highly recommended      
692,5.0,                       very happy with this purchase  i bought it to replace the old usb hub that came with my rock band set over a decade ago  my old ps  has one consistently functional usb port and all of the rock band components worked great once i plugged them into this hub and hit each switch      
693,4.0,                       i gave this   stars only because it has a bit of a delay  purchased this for my surface pro to connect a usb mouse and keyboard  it is easy to use and i love that the buttons allow you to turn specific devices on and off but there is a noticeable delay  at times  which can be solved with the double click of the mouse      
694,2.0,                       i like that they hub connections can be individually turned off and on   when on they are lit up   but i do not like that fact that the connection is extremely slow   when i back up my files to a hard drive connected directly to the computer it takes about minute to process   when i have the hard drive backup connected to the hub it can take up to    minutes   so not a good choice      
695,5.0,                       the device works great    the price was excellent   went to two hardware stores   nothing in stock   i agree with  shop local   but finding you want is difficult at best
