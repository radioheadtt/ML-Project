0,5.0,                       the best   fastest  ethernet cable  well  before i have no ideal of cat  and never heard about it    after i got this one  i plan to upgrade my network to gigabytes station    smart householdcompare with the old yellow cat   the cable was shielded and each pair was also shielded per cat  spec and there was a grounding wire after i test it via fluke  you can see the performance is really fantastic  insertion loss is tiny   brand with is big   have to say   it support   gbps     mhz high speed gigabit  and its spec really meet everyone s requirements  works very fast and steady with my imac        to improve the best experience i ve called comcast and now upgrade to a xfinity     mbps package  the wire is well made and easy to manipulate not being to stiff but still thick durable material  the main feature that i mentioned before that is my favorite part is the durable head piece connector which is the main piece that has given me problems in the passed breaking or becoming unusable meanwhile the outdoor material jacket of cable is tough enough for the daily use       
1,5.0,                       i have an area with lots of known   hz interference  no reasonable way around it  shielded cabling seems to be the answer  this one works great  but  the fun doesn t end there  this isn t one of those crappy cables that you have to pray doesn t fall apart as soon as you leave  this thing is built to last  it s flexible  and solidly built  did you have too much to drink at the last christmas party and break all of your patch cables swinging through the warehouse like tarzan  have all the egg nog you want  this cable will still work perfectly      
2,5.0,                       i upgraded to this cord from a cat   cable  i use it to connect my tv to the router  there was a noticeable difference in the sound quality while streaming video  there was a slight improvement in video  this is comparing cat   to this one the cord is a little stiff which is understandable with all the insulation on the wires  the cord is round good value for the money      
3,5.0,                       the cables appear to be of high quality and i ve had no issues attaining some of the faster speeds that cat  cable allows for  however  i haven t tried pushing the cable to the limits the shielding is good and the connectors snap in firmly  the gold plating around the edge of the connectors is gimmicky  though  but it looks cool and might help you differentiate these cables from others      
4,5.0,                       it s awesome   so far as i can tell  i just wish i had the electrical testing laboratory available to verify the quality   like i had in the calibration lab i worked at in the air force   i cannot see any issues  and everything seems of a better quality  and construction  than anything you would be able to purchase locally  or would be installed  or provided by local technicians   much  much better than what was installed at my property  not included the ruggedized cable buried underground    for anything above ground  inside  and outside this is the  gold standard  for installation of services and perfect for gaming  and general home use  in my opinion      
5,5.0,                       i got this cable to hook up a nas with a   gbps port to our nighthawk router which also has a   gbps port and it works perfectly  the cable is just the right length  heavy duty  and gives us max transfer speeds over the network  would definitely recommend this      
6,5.0,                       have att internet      on wifi on bedroom firestick  was experiencing drops due to atts arris bgw    modem that they give you  awful  unreliable   purchased this cat  cable in    foot and plugged it into the amazon ethernet adapter which i also had to purchase  thanks amazon for not making an ethernet port ready firestick yet  and now i am blazing through music and movie streaming   i should bill att for this expense  nice cable as others have said  very sturdy      
7,1.0,                       i bought these to improve the stability of my internet usage  there wasn t any issues with my existing cords  but   i wanted to see if investing in new  top of the line cords would make it even better  the moment i started using these cords  hardwired into my pc  i experienced severe packet loss   something you re not suppose to have with a wired connection  and i never had before  so i am returning these cords asap  glad it worked for everyone else  but it was worthless for me  disappointed      
8,1.0,                       damn  it didn t make any difference at all  bought a     ft  and   ft i thought this damn thing would help me out  still freaking the same idk  pretty much my cat  and this one just gave the same speed yep  it makes it more slower instead      
9,5.0,if you want a real technical review  there are some really good ones in the other reviews  i m a novice   it made absolute sense to change out all of my old ethernet cables   the one from the modem to our wifi router  and     from my child s ps    computer that connect to our wifi router  the difference in noticeable   i encourage everyone with old ethernet cables to upgrade    note  i bought my child a digital storm lynx   level   gaming system    below i have included all of my   star purchases from march august to support my child s computer experience  i hope this review helps to shop   compare with other sites as well                                           mr ironstone l shaped desk           https   www amazon com dp b   y dspt ref ppx pop mob ap share                                           knodel desk pad  office desk mat      https   www amazon com dp b  jw zj m ref ppx pop mob ap share                                           apc ups      va ups battery     https   www amazon com dp b  vy fxmm ref ppx pop mob ap share                                            k hdmi cable     ft atevon high     https   www amazon com dp b  xnrjssw ref ppx pop mob ap share                                           cat  ethernet cable      https   www amazon com dp b  qlxc qr ref ppx pop mob ap share                                           amazonbasics    outlet power     https   www amazon com dp b  gpf  bz ref ppx pop mob ap share                                           displayport cable  silkland dp     https   www amazon com dp b    qvlhq ref ppx pop mob ap share                                            jeecoo usb pro gaming headset for     https   www amazon com dp b  tc j hk ref ppx pop mob ap share                                           gtracing gaming chair racing     https   www amazon com dp b  n rj hi ref ppx pop mob ap share                                           soundance laptop stand  aluminum     https   www amazon com dp b  d  dt b ref ppx pop mob ap share                                           adjustable cell phone stand      https   www amazon com dp b    dm y  ref ppx pop mob ap share
10,1.0,                       i used this cable for less than three weeks under the hood of a motorhome   outdoors  yet with protection from the elements   the contacts corroded as you can see in the photo   i doubt the claims about gold coating      
11,4.0,                       bought this around april      to support working from home during the covid shutdown  speeds seem to be up to the specs claimed by the manufacturer from what i have tested  the cable itself and the gold plated connector seems durable  but the clip for securing the connector to the target device  pc  router  etc   is made of an absurdly cheap plastic  it broke in     week during light indoor use at home  most ethernet cables have the plastic clip  but i ve never seen one snap off that easily still gets the job done so long as the cable isn t disturbed  which for my wfh setup is fine  but be aware  seems like an odd yet annoying component to skimp out on      
12,1.0,                       this cable feels very cheap  unlike any other ethernet cable i ve handled  i connected it to   different devices and didn t notice any difference in speed vs my cat e cable  cat            
13,5.0,                       we had some home wi fi issues in our house and long story short   a sharp comcast techie explained some internet and wi fi things to me via chat and phone  of which i was not aware   ignorance is no excuse   one of several issues was down up speeds to my xbox one x  via our gateway  and then via the old cable from my xfinity pod   so  i upgraded my ethernet cable from one i d owned for something like   years  to this one   bingo   this cat  effectively trebled my down up speeds via our xfinity gateway to the console  via the pod   great value purchase imo  based on some great advice   bottom line   if you re having some speed issues in house  check to see     if your device s interactions may be faster via a cable  and     if your cable needs to be updated to a      version   and a big thanks to everyone that helped me with this       
14,5.0,                       recently i bought a   gbe card setup for   of my computers  my machines are a bit distant from each other and there are live ac power cables in the way  i am well aware that   gb s is a bit overkill  but at the same time  i know that ac electromagnetic radiation can interfere with a lot of things the main selling point for why i got this product was   things    the insane amount of shielding and protection it has  it s way better than your typical cat  or cat e cable   you can tell due to the thickness and the stiffness    i needed a cable that is capable of handling a   gbe transmission speed  i could have gone with cat   for sure  but at the same time    gb s is the  maximum  that cat  supports up to  there s no guarantee that i would ever  see  the full bandwidth of   gb s    the price  this cable is super cheap  i was surprised  while the available overhead is quite much  yes  the good thing i can say is this   at least i m prepared for usb   while i cannot confirm or deny that this cable can handle   gb s data transfer rate speeds  i can confirm that it handles a full   gb s transfer speeds  for sure  when   gbe network cards come out  or become cheap enough that they re more affordable by the consumer market   i ll update the review and tell you my findings      
15,5.0,                       all i got to say im literally blown away  ive had to move the gateway literally    ft and then the switch and mesh with it  walking around the house  two story  with my phone doing speed tests  the   cables that i used are a dam game changer  no pun intended   all this time  freaking months  trying certain routers and never dawned on me to move the gateway with long cat cable to improve range and speed  hardware is seriously half the battle      
16,4.0,                       good ethernet cable  but my internet plan is only     mbps  i use it for gaming  i d been told  i need to upgrade internet service to a faster connection  only then i will see and feel the true speed and quality of this cable  like everything else in life  you need a b c in order to get d         
17,2.0,                       i am not sold on cat   cables after my experience with these cables  they are stiff and because of that they have a tendency to hold my router at an angle and not flat on the table  the biggest gripe however is that my old cat   cables out performed them in a speed test   not once but every time i tried  i m using my old cables   these are going in my spare parts box for an emergency      
18,5.0,                       so i purchased these along with  k hdmi cables for my then ps   i tested speeds and they were great once the cables were updated  i have since switched them to my ps and re tested and i was getting speeds of     plus and i pay for     mpbs  so that a great improvement  the picture is fantastic and the wifi is supercharged  no lag or buffering on my firestick wired and my other connected via wifi on the second floor  for this price they are well made and feel like good quality and they work  so with the combo of the cat  and  k cables streaming and gaming are great now      
19,5.0,                       i have very fast internet      mbps  but i kept getting lags while i was streaming  i did a little research and i came to the realization that my ethernet cables were the cause  once i replaced the ethernet cable connecting my modem to my router  and my router to my ps   things instantly changed  for most people  cat  cables would be enough  but i like future proofing everything so i got cat   keep in mind that cat  cables are good for small spaces like apartments but not so much for large spaces like estates  so if you re planning on installing ethernet cables on acres then cat  is the way to go      
20,1.0,                       i bought this to hard wire a computer in different room from the main router  it ran directly from the router right into the computer there was no hub or switch  started having problems after about two months thought it was the router thought it was my internet provider looked everything and of course the very last thing i checked was the wire  i had purchased the   ft version of the same wire from the same company and didn t have any problems they work spectacularly   and it was a brand new wire so i didn t have any reason to think it was the wire  buy the shorter version stay away from the longer version      
21,1.0,                       this cable was great when i  st got it  then in january it just stopped working  i waa in the middle of a meeting and have another cable i plug into my personal computer so i switched to that one then  i just plugged this back and my connection is through wifi  i tried troubleshooting and neither my work nor personal laptop can detect the cable  it was great while it lasted but only lasted like   months      
22,5.0,                       cable for now and the future   i have at t fiber      which is blazing fast  i recently had troubles and they said my modem was bad and they replaced it  the ethernet cord from the modem to the wall was loose so i replaced it with one of those yellow cat   because that was all that i had  bad idea  i ordered this cat   and i am getting      mbps in every test i perform  absolutely great cord especially if you are a gamer and i have two gamers in my home      
23,5.0,                       had serious connection issues with a tv i had never had issues with    a new one  i might add   google fiber replaced the boxes but still nothing   i could use my pc but could not stream a program   google csrs work remotely now so i always had one ready to help     they would problem solve with me and one suggested a new ethernet cable   i had never replaced it in decades   after i upgraded my speed nothing changed  so i bought a new ethernet cable and a new roku since the one i currently had had had issues almost on regular basis   the moment i plugged the new ethernet cable in my connection issues vanished     and the new roku is working great   i wish i hadn t upgraded from basic    i think that was just a gimmick to get more money out of me    but i am streaming and i am satisfied      
24,1.0,                       i really like this cable unfortunately the very light plastic tab that locks the cable into the port has failed in less than    days i would like to hear from customer service to make things right iam a vet in the hospital right now   need a little help so i can stay on line directly from modem  customer service is most important to me in this mater thank you gl     
25,1.0,                       now i understand the technology behind these ethernet cables but they did absolutely nothing to improve my ping or download or upload speeds over a cheaper walmart alternative  i am att gigabyte speeds and their latest modem with wifi  and other technologies  i am also using a brand new computer built by a professional gaming company using up to date and top of the line parts        pc  this is such a gimmick  just go to your local walmart and pick up a cheaper alternative      
26,1.0,                       how is it possible for me to be taller than the  ft cable when i am       what a disappointment      
27,3.0,                       upgraded by running these new  cat    cables from my garage to my router and hard wiring in as many devices as i could  running a speed test showed    ms ping times and    mb s  not bad  noticed when it was running the test that the push would fluctuate  but didn t think much at the time  now playing any game i get huge lag spikes  about every minute or so it would spike and almost lose connection  it makes gaming unplayable  regular surfing and streaming it is fine  but gaming is impossible swapped all my cables back to cat    and i get exact same performance  but no lag spikes  disappointing  the cables appear to be well made  nice ends  etc    but they just don t jive with something  wasted money      
28,5.0,                       i currently have at t internet and i have the fiber package which gives me about  g of internet speed in my area  i personally never had an issue with the wifi signal on any of my devices or tvs for streaming  however  when i got the new ps  i just wanted the best experience i could get with the console and the  k     native fps tv i have  i noticed the slower download speed when downloading digital games and when playing cod cold war public multiplayer matches  i checked the ps  internet connection system for wifi signal and download upload speeds  even though i technically had  g internet and the router was unobstructed and high up for better signal coverage what the ps  was getting was about     download speeds and    uploads  this was noticeable in cod and other online games as there would be connection issues and lag  after i bought this   ft ethernet cable and set it up to my router i restarted my ps  and now i consistently get about     downloads with about     upload speeds  a drastic change over wifi alone  this makes a difference when gaming online as i have a stable internet connection a low ping  personally  i recommend this to any serious console or pc gamer forget about a good headphone set they are useless if you are lagging all over the place and have long wait times  overall  anyone who is looking to gain an increase in the internet connection for either console  pc  tv  or other compatible devices will benefit from buying this cable assuming you have a decent internet plan to start with  obviously  this ethernet cable can t turn for example a max of    mbps internet plan into  g internet speed that is up to you and what you are willing to pay for a month offered in your area      
29,4.0,                       i was a bit skeptical about the cat  type cable but decided to try it after some research  i immediately saw a good improvement in my internet connection and speed i use a bridged connection between the isp modem router and my own wi fi router  just by replacing the old cat  w  the new cat  ethernet cable to connect both caused my internet speed to noticeably improve  that affected my desktop connected via ethernet cable and also all wi fi devices on my network as well  i wish i had purchased this sooner  i ll never by another cat  cable again i recommend the product  this has good build quality and comes in a nice package as well      
30,5.0,                       with all the teleworking and distance learning i upgraded my internet to   mbps    i was not seeing these speeds and was upset with my internet provider   after reading a bit about high speed internet setups i discovered that a hidden flaw in many households is the poor ethernet cables installed by internet providers or that come in the box with a router   i used these cat  cables and saw a     increase in mbps instantly   i highly recommend these cables      
31,3.0,                       i plugged it into my router  and the internet speed out is only  mbps  whereas if i use wifi the speed is around   mbps  returned the product      
32,4.0,                       the wire is nice and sturdy but it doesn t work with verizon fios as a wan connector  i had to contact verizon several times and try three different wires to figure this out  i was very dissapointed that it didnt work with this as it seems like its very well made      
33,5.0,                    excelente cable tenia un categor a   instalado en mi wifi y router y en ocasiones se quedaba guindado el internet no entend a porq ya que solo yo usaba el internet    cambien a estos cables categor a   y ya tengo un par de meses us ndolos y mi internet es super estable no se a ca do en ning n momento lo recomiendo para cualquier conexi n de internet de da mucha estabilidad en la conexi n        
34,4.0,                       honestly i am not an expert on these  however the price is right  it came in within a day  it fits  it does exactly what i expected  and i would get it again      
35,5.0,                       i m not an expert when it comes to electronics so i watch youtube to get ideas on how to increase my internet speed   i have     mbps fiber optic cables to my house and it is normally around     mbps  i also have an eero mesh system installed which show the same download and upload speeds all thru the house   once i connected this updated cable my internet speed increased a little more than i expected   download speeds are now        mbps and upload speeds went to        mbps  this updated cable helped increase my internet speeds      
36,5.0,                       while i still would tell the average home user its not a must  as a retired it professional  i just like trying to keep up with the latest   recently my internet provider upgraded me to a   gig internet connection  that is definitely a game changer that you wont see fully using wi fi only   i moved our desk tops  back to a hard connection and its amazing to see the difference there   i always look for cables here on amazon  i have never had a failure  price is good and with prime i get them fast      
37,3.0,                       the wire out if the bag is thick  well made and looks durable  i have a hp laptop and have  g wi fi connected to it  i wanted an ethernet cord to get the best out of my  g spectrum service as i have   level under the fastest spectrum offers residentially  i feel i m better off with the wi fi as i didn t see a big difference in speed  the only thing good is download speeds is quick and uploads  as for streaming on websites on browsers  k is slow and sinus the     k settings which i think is a smaller tlrate within  k  i will buy a macbook pro soon and see if it s this laptop as i am fully customizing the mac to it s best settings      
38,5.0,                       i purchased this ethernet cable due to my old one was having issues   this is the cat   cable  when i hooked up this cable  i could tell a major difference in how quickly my web pages was loading etc   my previous cable was just a cat   cable so this cable new cable can handle a much higher connection and you can tell a difference in the speed of your web pages loading   i would recommend this cable to anyone who is replacing theirs      
39,5.0,                       i had to google the difference between the cat cables    or   or   or     looks like the   is the most recent version   i needed something from the directv receiver to the source of the internet and this seems to do the trick   the cable that came with the directv stopped working so when i needed a new one i choose this one based on transmission speed  etc   is great so far      
40,1.0,                       i ve used ethernet cords for many years i ve always gotten them from best buy and i figured well i tried with amazon thinking i was getting top notch but this one really sucks because i m constantly having to unplug my android box and then it reloads and plays my shows again where the one i got from best buy i didn t have that problem so this one i was going in the trash  and probably from now on will not be purchasing from you guys anymore i m going to delete my app and everything on it goodbye     
41,2.0,                       my speed actually dropped slightly moving to these cables  i wonder if these are even cat   to begin with  ordered other ones that are much higher quality      
42,5.0,                       i bought a new smart tv and xbox and wanted to make sure that everything ran as smoothly as possible   these cables arrived quickly and my tv xbox have never run faster   i have since bought a couple more cables for other systems   a great value for the money      
43,5.0,                       i had all this researched and recommended equipment for my wifi network  but i couldn t get the speeds up  i looked things over and realized i had an old old cat   or   patch cable from my modem to my router  i bought this new cat  cable and wow  up to speed now  i love the quality of the connectors  very sturdy covering so cable doesn t pull loose from the connector  i highly recommend  these cables from dbillionda  kept the cool business card they sent with my next order of   different cables i plan to create a backup server for my computers      
44,5.0,                       i used these to connect my ps  and my lg smart tv to me wireless extender  i had cat  lan cables on them and my download speed increased from   mbps    mbps to   mbps   mbps    mbps  huge difference  nothing on my tv or ps  takes anytime to load or download  best part is no lag when playing over servers  since i did this  i havent experienced lag not once     
45,1.0,                       i believe something wrong at this time my received cable was something wrong  down the connecting speed so i retuned it and try to buy again another one  hope second one will be working well      
46,5.0,                       ran it thru my garage to my basement house is set up in  l  shape directly thru modem    issues high quality  you can see where they silicone the wire so nothing gets into the connection  heavy duty cabling  everything as advertised  even came with caps for the plugs so i can route them without damage     
47,2.0,                       anyone that buys this cable cut one in half and strip the jacket off compare the conductor size to a quality made cat   or cat   cable   in comparison they are very thin made  the jacket quality is decent  the foil wraping is so thin you can tear it if your not careful  the same foil is around the pairs  the conductor size is very very small     awg or less  i counted   individual strands of copper  this will not hold up  the jacket around the pairs is extremely thin as well  i bought these cable under the impression i was getting a heavy quality cable  this is just not the case   i needed to use these for a site where i have fm interference and shielding is the answer  these cables conductor size is not up to the task for poe      
48,5.0,                       i can not believe how much of a difference this had made on my desktop and ps  pro  from the moment i opened the bag i could feel the quality of this cat  in my hands  the openings were secured with plastic caps to protect the threads  it s like i went from driving my car at   mph to    mph on the auto bon  this is the fastest wifi i have ever had  trust me  you won t be disappointed with this quality cord      
49,3.0,                       i m unsure about this ethernet cable  we are supposed to be getting  gb internet with a wired connection but i m maxing out at     mbs hooked up  on wifi i m at     mbs max  perhaps the length of the cable     ft  is causing some of the drop in speed  expected more of an increase      
50,5.0,                       i had bought a long  cheap  ethernet cable awhile ago not realizing that they are not the same  i was getting crazy slow download speeds so i tried to change up the cable  to another ethernet cable i had laying around cat e  and it worked better  after research i found they were not all the same and bought a couple of these  boy am i impressed  the lower download picture is that of the cat e and the higher is the cat    this should definitely help out with the rod times it takes to download games and even try to stream shows and movies on my tv      
51,5.0,                       i work from home and do a lot of videoconferencing  i was using a cat   cable and was having some issues and after trouble shooting  decided to replace my old cable and upgraded to this cat    i immediately noticed it was faster  and provides a better connection for online meetings      
52,3.0,                       i bought this cable in january and it worked well up until a week ago where the signal started degrading and wifi connections started to time out  it got to the point where my isp couldn t recognize my modem at all  i expect a  premium  cable like this to last longer than    months      
53,4.0,                       i have a  gb s internet speed  my cheap cable was only getting like      mb s average  with this cable  it jumped to around    mb s speeds  not the  gb  but definitely an increase from my cheap cat  cable i had before      
54,4.0,                       this looks a lot better than the generic old blue ethernet that came with my router  but my bf has noticed zero increases in speed for gaming      
55,4.0,                       i have a handful of cat   wire in use for short   gb runs  overkill  i know   all of which are thick  stiff  solid wires  this guy still does the job great at  ft  a lesser wire should as well   but feels flimsy in comparison  i imagine it meets the tech spec for cat    so i m not giving it   or   stars  but compared to others i ve bought  i feel like this isn t on the same level      
56,5.0,                       on a whim  i decided to upgrade my network cable  hoping that it would make a little difference  it doubled my speed  if you haven t replaced your network cable in the last   years  since they came out with upgraded ones   i highly recommend doing so  the newer ones work much better with the newer technology      
57,5.0,                       used to have cat  ethernet cables but decided to give the cat  ones a try to see how good they are  i have fiber at home  and i used to only get     mbs s with the cat  ones  as soon as i put the cat  cables in my internet connection jumped to     mbs s  definitely worth the money      
58,3.0,                       the cord is wrapped in a hard like plastic  not your typical  cord   i was expecting and firmer cord with a better casing  i ve had these for quite some time now and they re still not completely laying flat  i ordered  used like new  cables  i have horrible internet where i live and play online games  the cables definitely give me a better connection  if your ordering these cables and they will be out of sight out of mind then these will work      
59,4.0,                       does work  widens data pathway as suggested   materials used for construction need to be reviewed and possibly rethought out  cable should not feel as light weight as it does for such a lofty level of ethernet capabilty      
60,5.0,                       wanted to future proof my ethernet cables with cat   from cat  e  signal is terrific even over extreme distances  the gold plated connectors appear to be of extremely high quality material  they also have the nice  clip protectors  so they won t get snagged when pulling them through a wall or the ceiling  great price for a great product  two thumbs up        
61,5.0,                       this product is amazing well worth it  if you game on any console and don t use a ethernet cable from ur router ur a idiot even if u are a casual gamer  i have fiber optic hard wire with a nighthawk and this cat  just made it even better   look me up on youtube westend soldier     
62,5.0,                       we just upgraded our internet speed to    mbps  and our download speeds over there ethernet cables are actually exceeding that speed by a bit   absolutely no signal loss   the plastic protectors are a pain to get off the connectors  but the product performs as promised      
63,5.0,                       title says it all   i have gig speed at my place  but with everyone working from home these days  i ve noticed video conferencing   zoom   is getting taxed   i finally decided i needed to go hardwired for those calls just to be safe   the cable works very well and is good quality   as stated  i ve bought the same product in    ft  length      
64,5.0,                       my network doesn t even come close to the rated speeds this cable is capable of pushing  i mainly got it for the better signal quality for reliability reasons  also for the money  if i ever upgrade to   gig networking through my home its nice to know i m ready for it  i ll be buying more as i need it  these are great cables      
65,5.0,                       so i bought this item not knowing if it was really going to be a   cat or no but as it says this is a   cat i plugged it in to my ps  ran a test and everything was good and way better then before so  before i bought this ethernet i was using a   cat and was lagging alot while playing fortnite which my ping was between       so  when i plugged in the ethernet it was instant my ping was at    then it dropped to    and now i mainly run like       ping which is good because i have   mbps speed internet which is not as good  so if you have like a     mbps internet depending on where you stay  you would run about      ping steady  this item is great i would even recommend it to my grandmother        
66,4.0,                       only reason of a  star is i worry if this is not just a branded cat   though i enjoy throwing money away and spending on things i don t need more than likely   still get    mbps down    mbps up      
67,5.0,                       a lot of cables are more expensive and a complete rip off  cat   cables can go for         in stores  which is way too much  it s working slightly better than my old cat cable too  i only really needed a cat    but i saw this was just as cheap if not cheaper than what was available      
68,5.0,                       fantastic cable quality  gauge  sleeve  and connectors      of homes do not need this level of wiring and bandwidth capacity  but these will future proof your setup for at least   years  good stuff      
69,5.0,                       i purchased this cat  cable because it was cheaper than cat  at the time  i don t really have anything that can transmit at    gbps  so i can t give a completely accurate comparison between this and other cables  from what i can see  this cable does an excellent job of reducing latency and transmission times  after using this cable for my access point  it actually runs cooler than when i was using the cat  cable that it came with  i highly recommend this cable if you experience high levels of interference      
70,5.0,                       i wanted to move my smart tv and xbox one to ethernet since wi fi is spotty and you have to worry about buffering  so i thought i would go  extreme  with a cat  cable and never have to worry about future proofing the cable or it becoming outdated since tech isn t even close to catching up to this wire  the ends were protected with caps and each came in a box for protection  and my speed went way up after i did a test on the xbox  for how cheap these cables were and what they offer i saw no reason to ever go with anything else  i would      recommend them and will probably start using cat  cables over wi fi going forward from here on out      
71,3.0,                       cables seem very sturdy  thick  but they are also very stiff and not malleable have not seen any significant bump in speeds over the older cat   we have inexpensive so will keep them but wouldn t necessarily buy again for above reasons      
72,5.0,                       the cord does great for what its suppose to do  i just wanted to test it out with the  gb internet i have and see if i noticed any difference  i will say it was pretty much the same as using a cat   cable  i didn t get crazy in benchmark testing though      
73,5.0,                       conducted a few test  and it doesn t seem to be any faster  but i will say the material is better than the one i had before so i have no complaints  also my speed is pretty fast already  i bought one that goes from my modem to my wifi router and another one from my wifi router to my main computer my speeds are normally           
74,5.0,                       if you ve relied on wifi  not matter how fast  you re missing out on hard wired ethernet  my speed went from    mbps to  gig  which i ve paid for months to have      
75,5.0,                       got the cat  after reading how ethernet cables work  using the cables  bought    for the router and an arlo system   needed longer cords and have been working great   the signals seem to be strong with no interruptions      
76,5.0,                       this cable is way better than the cat   that it replaced   for working at home with fiber optics now my son is able to upload and download his cad files  no problem   the slowest part of your system is the speed that your system runs at   stepping down any other great attributes like processor or memory      
77,5.0,                       i was has having some various  computer issues and after checking things out i found that it was recommended to upgrade to a cat   cable connecting my modem to the computer  this did the trick and my problems went away  not sure of the technical reasons but the better shielding must of been a big part of it      
78,5.0,                       very well made  professional quality  no chance of broken wires because the sleeve wasn t made into the connector  cheap ethernet cables often don t have the sleeve attached to the connector which allows the wires to over flex and break   these cables are more than worth the small extra cost  these are lifetime quality cables      
79,5.0,                       as far as i know  it works as described  it s not officially certified or anything though so i m not sure how i would test it to push the limits  i definitely think it s better than my cat e i replaced though  i only have a    mbps internet connection though and it does push that just fine  but so did my old cat e cable        
80,5.0,                       this is a nice product  especially for the price  now i m a college student and my classes are online right now because of covid  with my not so reliable apartment wifi  my online classes would disconnect and break up during lectures  i hooked this up to my laptop and now the connection is so much better  no buffering or anything      
81,2.0,                       it s give me the same and sometimes slower speeds than my  e cable  id return it for my cash if i felt like dealing with the whole process but i dont  just dont buy this     
82,5.0,                       first off  you feel the product and it just feels way more durable than my past product purchased performance wise my performance has become way better  very more consistent as well  every test i run now on my computer is right at the same speed  the only thing i have changed it this cat  cable  will be ordering a few more      
83,5.0,                       i replaced the  standard issue  cat e cables that were provided by verizon and   voip with their hardware and saw an immediate increase in wifi speed and clarity with their respective services  overkill  yes  but actually a future proof investment and for the price per each  totally worth it      
84,5.0,                       haven t owned this product for very long  but i put it right into service connecting my modem and router   cable is thick  sturdy  feels very well made   does what it is supposed to   i am likely going to purchased longer versions of this cable down the road      
85,5.0,                       uh  i don t know a lot about these  so can t guarantee this is the best pick  but it does work well and i do see an improvement in my laptop internet speed when using it  i will note that my laptop also requires a converted  sold separately  so don t know how well either work on their own        
86,5.0,                       this ethernet cable appears to be like any others but it s in fact  cat    sometimes  the higher up you go  the more stiff the cable becomes   this cable is still flexible and gets the job done   speed tests over  gb and   gb look great   haven t been able to test   gb with base t yet      
87,1.0,                       i purchased   of these to connect my ps  and my laptop both via ethernet so i could get the best connection  well  i did not get the best or even close to what i should be getting with these cables  i have a      mbps  gb  up and down connection  i only get    struggling when using these cables  the cables in the walls are cat  and the connection is fiber  i plugged in one of my trash cat e cables from      and i got    mbps consistently while with these supposed cat  cables the speeds were consistently below    mbps  i def don t recommend these  make the investment and buy from a trusted brand      
88,5.0,                       bought this since i was using cat e cable in my home  so i needed something strong and reliable to bring it to another floor  i will say the connection was amazing it was much faster and it was exactly the same speed i was getting from the main router  so i will say if your looking to improve your home connectivity  these are good investment for the future      
89,5.0,                       came perfectly wrapped and transfers my  gig speed internet flawlessly   i been averaging    mbps   if you are going to wire it along the floor like it did just be sure to straighten the cord as it will be very curly when you unravel it   other than that it s fantastic   i bought this even though i don t need it now however i ll be living in japan so i need something that can keep up      
90,5.0,                       now with this cable my download speed is of    mbps which is rapidly flawless when it comes in games to play     
91,1.0,                       very poorly made  not anything to brag about  had to return it due to it begin very cheap     
92,1.0,                       its very week and almost not connecting at all  replaced back old one and was working   i check with my cable internet provider they confirmed i got bad connection between modem and router   bad cable or i had a bud luck with product     
93,5.0,                       i d never heard of this before  until a friend suggested i try cat   i m amazed  it works great with my mac laptop  a noticeable speed increase  it d well made  very durable for using multiple times without any fear of breaking  it does the job perfectly  so glad i got it      
94,5.0,                       from what i can touch and see  great quality  don t know that cable gonna support cat   but cat   is fully supported  i have run this cable from my house to backyard  from a    gb switch to other    go switch  it works great      
95,5.0,                       arrived on time  looks reasonably well made  honestly i did not notice a huge difference in performance  i use it to hook up an android box to a modem  run internet soles test and it s consistent with previous results the cable i replaced was old and did not want to take chances     
96,5.0,                       upgraded all the wired connections into the new router upgrade  what a difference  worth every penny  will be ordering for all the aimesh routers for a clean experience  at this price and quality  you re better off ordering a bunch and just leave on a shelf  good work guys      
97,5.0,                       i was having a problem with streaming frndly that i tried everything to solve   finally  after trying two cat   cables between a cable router and my deco m  mesh router  i tried this cat   cable   it solved the buffering problem      
98,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          very fast  i noticed immediately  my apartment s wifi is very unreliable and this helps my connection stay stable  push down on the black tabs to release the plastic covers  plug it in to both your computer and your wall and boom    very good      
99,5.0,                       after my old cat  started to fall apart it was time for an upgrade  after swapping the cables i immediately noticed a significant improvement to my online games connection speeds   exceded my expectations  this cable is a great buy      
100,1.0,                       returning   quality seemed good for the price  but speed  not so much   did speed test for comparison of this cord vs wifi and vs cat e cord       mbps connection  wifi and older cat e cord hit around     mbps while two versions of this cord one   ft and one  ft  weren t able to reach above    mbps      
101,3.0,                       stopped working after    days  i am returning but reordering just in case this is a fluke  while working i received speeds surpassing the     gbps that i pay for  today i had      upload and     download  switched to my old cat   cable and speeds are over     mbps      
102,5.0,                       kinda hard to rave about ethernet cables  they got here on time  they re decent quality  they work      
103,4.0,                       but if you are using cat   cables  you don t need to switch to cat    i think  the difference between cat   and   is very little  according to my speed test  cat   gives only      mbps faster speed than cat        
104,1.0,                       d lares tirados a la basura no funciono  lo compre para sustituir mi cable cat   que lleva por canalizaci n la se al a mi estudio me extra an todas estas rese as cuando el forro es tan sencillo  dicen que es para uso exterior pero desde que lo toque tuve mis dudas lastima que no puedo devolverlo porque me cuesta mas  enviarlo de nuevo a eeuu           
105,5.0,                       i didn t do any fancy test  but if i am not being throttle on the cable  i m super happy  cable is future proof and can handle more than what my isp provider  sturdy across the board      
106,5.0,                       a few months ago i bought   tera grand cat   cables to connect my dvr and my stereo to my router  both of them had unstable  inconsistent connections  i bought   of these cables and it solved all my issues  everything is working great      
107,5.0,                       was probably a bit overkill but i wanted to ensure there was no hinderance from the source to end point   the slowest point in the chain wil be the end point for sure   just did not want the bale to be the performance problem      
108,5.0,                       this product is great  i upgraded to this ethernet cable and two month of having it i have no issues with my connection  prior to owning this product i had a number of internet speed issues but once i changed the cable to this ethernet wire it improved tremendously      
109,4.0,                       i ran it under the house about    feet  then up the walls at each end  seems to be working      
110,5.0,                       bought this to connect my xbox to my comcast router  if thats what your looking for then look no further  if its not then i m sure this will still work for you  it has been great i do see a difference from just using the wifi      
111,5.0,                       i got it for gaming as i was tired of losing matches due to lag  it helped out and now i can play overwatch with minimal lag  it s there when the servers are overloaded  but it does make a difference      
112,5.0,                       purchase this cord so that i can have more stable connection for work and zoom calls  the quality of the cord is superb and the length is perfection me to route through my living room to my dining room office      
113,5.0,                       these patch cables cost more than some of the others that are offered  but if you have a need for cat  patch cables  you will get the high quality that you need by buying these cables  the cables are hefty  about      inches or      mm  in diameter and stiff  indicating that the individual wires are solid  not stranded      
114,1.0,                       i had better speed with the ethernet cable from my isp  don t waste your      that s like a happy meal at mcdonalds right there     
115,1.0,                       if this really is a cat  cable then i must have got a severely defective one  it only goes up to   mbps  its stiff as a board  theres no information on the cable itself at all like there is on every ethernet cable ive ever known verifying what generation of ethernet cable it is  glad i only bought a   foot one for cheap because if i wasted my money on a longer one id be furious      
116,5.0,                       i had upgraded my home internet and didn t know my old ethernet cable was efficient enough  after purchasing this cord i noticed a substantial difference  this cord is very sturdy and has a strong connection to the modem      
117,5.0,                       it works  is long enough  and even came with plastic caps covering the ends like an indoor outdoor cable it feels less flexible than the typical cable  designed to resist the outdoors a bit      
118,2.0,                       maybe it is just a bad cable  but the speed transfers between two computers was abysmal  much slower than my cat e cable  could not get internet with it at all  not worth the money      
119,5.0,                       didn t realize how fast these cat cables have been evolving now we re up to    it works  it s a nice thick cable  the connectors feel high quality and when it s plugged it in feels sturdy and doesn t move in the slot  if i need more i will definitely buy more of these      
120,3.0,                       the ethernet cable provided faster speeds as advertised  but there are some inconsistencies when connecting to the internet while hardwired into my ps   when the ps  boots up  it takes a little while for the connection to be established  i checked my older ethernet wire and i connect immediately  i m not sure if it s the gold plating causing the issue  but it is a minor problem      
121,5.0,                       got this to connect my work computer to our router in order to work from home  did exactly what it was supposed to do     included installation hardware was a nice bonus      
122,1.0,                       cat       it just said cat   a few months ago when i bought it  ha  if i knew what i was purchasing i would of just gone back to      and picked up their best cat cable    dont buy     
123,5.0,                       i have these set up for our ps  and roku device  they have been working well  speed is not compromised and we haven t had one issue while online gaming or streaming on roku      
124,5.0,                       i got  gb of internet  but wasn t getting the full speed  trying to find out why  i found the issue to be my ethernet cord  it sadly was dying and was frequently dropping connection  so i went online and found this one  it s amazing  it s an upgrade to my old ethernet cord  a cat   and gives me faster speeds then my cat  did at brand new      
125,3.0,                       this is my second internet cable i purchased  since work from home  i need a good internet cable  i shopped couple of brand  so i decide to purchase this cable  but  ft is really short for me      
126,5.0,                       great product that appears to be produced with great quality   the only thing i could think to make it better is possibly a stronger covering or fabric type covering   its almost a rubber type out covering that can tear if caught on a sharp desk corner or running through a wall snorkel to hook up a tv      
127,5.0,                       exellent cable  got close to   gig with at t uverse  with my other ethernet cable  cat    for some reason  only      mbps  huge improvement  highly recommended      
128,5.0,                       i moved my computer and my ethernet cable was about five to seven feet short so i bought this cable and it is awesome  if you need an ethernet cable get this one  you do not loose any speed  and it looks great  it might be more expensive than some of their competitors but it is worth it      
129,1.0,                       i was using a    cat   cable  i tested both many times and the cat     cable was consistently slower always by    mbps slower than what it is supposed to be      
130,4.0,                       the cable is super stiff  i ordered a different cable that is braided     
131,5.0,                       exactly what i needed  i had to move the wifi box to the middle room that is about    feet away from my gaming room so i purchased this wire and ran it through the walls to access my pc  very good speeds      
132,3.0,                       i had it hooked through xbox one x and worked fine for about   weeks   after that i was getting intermittent signals   this may be due to this being a cat   instead of  e or    but i removed and used my old patch cords with no issues      
133,5.0,                       i upgraded my computer and other equipment from   year old cat   cables  and wow  it made a huge difference   i am very pleased with the quality and engineering of these cables      
134,1.0,                       horrible  i compared this cat   ethernet cable to my nearly    year old cat   cable and the cat   is way faster  this cat   fuctuated on my internet speed and wouldn t go past    mb on my gigablast      
135,4.0,                       the cable is in good quality but no as flexible as others      
136,5.0,                       i needed a    ft ethernet cable and could not find one locally  amazon is my old stand by so i bought one from them  i normally buy the best rated and go  it is installed and is working as designed      
137,5.0,                       works great   i did notice my signal strength   was up and was running on no less than a     mbps as before it was only about       mbps     
138,4.0,                       these appear to be well made and are working fine but i noticed when plugging them in that the connection has slight movement   it snaps in but does not have a tight secure feeling      
139,1.0,                       this cable comes with plastic tabs at both ends that for the life of me i can t figure out how to remove  the packaging doesn t include any removal instructions  will be returning      
140,5.0,                       had a few changes over all made more than a difference made a lot  better connection   i would definitely recommend this product to any one that needs a cable replacement    one issue is my mother board has an outdated version of the killer ethernet device  only a     e probably have to get a new one some time in the future  other han that these are the best cables i have yet to have purchased      
141,5.0,                       if your speed     mbps to     mbpsno need for this onebut i like it     
142,5.0,                       i use this for my teleworking station and it works perfectly  gives me fast internet and they look durable and well made  i m happy with this purchase      
143,5.0,                       i use this for gaming and it has helped my connection be far more stable  i haven t really compared this with a cat   or cat    but it does what i need it to do for gaming stability      
144,5.0,                       i bought this for my ps  and it doubled my internet speed  i have not had a single issue with my connection since buying this  i will definitely be buying another for other devices in my house      
145,5.0,                       i kept getting logged out of my vpn for work and so i figured this might help  it does  so glad i purchased it and it came with two so i use the second one for a security camera      
146,5.0,                       needed direct connectivity to eliminate lag from wifi  this did the trick  zero connectivity and lag issues ever since for me  i monitor my pings   i m a happy camper     
147,5.0,                       this is probably good for something like else besides gaming i was lagging all the time that i had to change to my regular smh trust me my internet is faaasssttt  very disappointed     
148,5.0,                       i switched two of my cords out on the ps  and router  and notice faster speeds than on the prior cords   it s not earth shattering  but definitely improvement      
149,5.0,                       been using this for over a month now with no problems  this is my first time using an ethernet cable  but it has certainly given me the fastest connection ever with my fiber internet  the cord is extremely durable  and the ends clip firmly into the ethernet ports      
150,5.0,                       works as well as a cable should  we easily get the advertised up download speeds advertised by the internet provider  i would buy again   if i needed to      
151,3.0,                       like most things on amazon its from china   i hate buying chinese   wish they sold more american products but they are ok and they are cheap       
152,5.0,                       great item no more lag for gaming     
153,1.0,                       male fitting broke when protective cover was removed  you know your in trouble when the bag looks like a    year old spelled it  waste of time  amazon was great about taking the return      
154,5.0,                       quality signal to new tv directly plugs into modem into tv  significant improvement in quality of speed picture and signal      
155,2.0,                       just know that when you buy this cable  there s a little bit of luck involved  i bought several  and one cable clearly outperforms the rest by quite a bit  the quality isn t nearly as good as it looks in the pictures  honestly  there s a good chance that this is a scam product that pays for good reviews  in any case  they work well enough  definitely not to cat  or cat  standards  though      
156,5.0,                       a great cable  this cable fits and works perfectly  my download and upload speeds have significantly increased  i have it connected to an adapter with my macbook because the wifi i use has been shotty      
157,4.0,                       good     
158,5.0,                       i don t game but the streaming performance is great so i took that as gaming  also remember your network is only as good as its weakest link so you can have a       router  mesh   wifi   blah a blah blah but if your internet service plan is only    mb s then expect to get that split between all things using the service  same goes for your cables   get a good one like this or get a cat   e and wonder why your go internet fails to reach speeds     
159,5.0,                       quite a difference in speed from my last ethernet cable  worth the money  works well with fiberoptic internet speeds      
160,5.0,                       i have my internet through spectrum and a technician that came to the house recommended that i upgrade to cat  ethernet cable between my modem and my router   so far i am very pleased with this product      
161,5.0,                       replaced all my ethernet cables with these seem to be really high quality very strong hopefully they won t break like the others did highly recommended     
162,5.0,                       it s good  did give me a performance boost  lagged less  more consistent but cat e and above for the most part would work for majority of gamers     
163,5.0,                       just bough a cable i did not need    i am trying to hook two cpu s up to one wall space need a switch connector      
164,3.0,                       cable works fine but i didn t notice any speed differences on speed tests  could be my modem  gonna dog in deeper then do a follow up post      
165,5.0,                       top quality juicy fat ethernet cable  perfect for home av patch connections when only the best will do  this is  that cable       
166,5.0,                       we don t like using wifi in our home so we plug our devices straight into the wall using an adapter and an ethernet cord in each room we are in  this cord is doing a great job helping us to get internet to our devices when and where we want it without turning on our wifi       
167,5.0,                       i was looking for a long ethernet cable that could last me if i ever need to upgrade my internet and this was the best affordable one i could find i have    mbps internet and it transfers just as much  pretty durable too      
168,4.0,                       works very well the ethernet plug in connectors  are very nicely designed and work very well  the only reason this got   stars is because the cordage itself is not great to say the least  its almost like cheap plastic wrapped around an expensive fix     idk how to explain it  either way it does work as expected and was great with the timing  and price  if you could implement a cat  enet cable with fiber optic threading over the cording i would be very interested in purchasing again     
169,5.0,                       it s pretty hard to go wrong with the ethernet cable  i ordered this and i was delighted with the gold end connectors     
170,1.0,                       plugged it in to my laptop and my tv and it straight up doesn t work  will try getting a replacement and see if i just randomly got a broken on      
171,5.0,                       my linksys velop mesh system came with basic cable to connect to router  this upgraded cable increased speeds by     mps consistently as compared to standard cable  happy with it     
172,5.0,                       data transfer is so much better after upgrading from cat   to cat     amazing cables from modem to router  and from router to tv     
173,4.0,                       strong material  didn t really see much of a difference in speed on the      but on  g it really double it s speed      
174,5.0,                       bought this to connect my mesh router system with my switch for my hardwired devices  so far it has been working great  no lost packets that i can tell so far      
175,5.0,                       o had the cat  ethernet cable and this one knocks it out the park by far  my speeds are so much faster with transfer rate      
176,1.0,                       no signal  i was wondering why i wasn t getting any speed and i changed back to my old cord and the speed went back up  i was getting   down    up and other cord     down   up couldn t believe it   dont buy this waste of money     
177,5.0,                       this cat   ethernet cable is awesome for gaming  it provides fast internet to my xbox which cuts down on the lag time that occurs when you have a weak internet signal  i m glad that i was able to find a cable long enough to run from my modem to the bedroom where the xbox is located  the price and quality of the cable is awesome  highly recommend this purchase     
178,1.0,                       no one uses this type anymore don t buy for gaming or your router  bought it and i need a newer model  it s useless      
179,5.0,                       i m excited to leave a review on this product because i absolutely love it  been using it for a few months now and i can happily recommend it      
180,5.0,                       wow       i m speechless   used this cat  cable on my      samsung smart tv   and right off the bat   it s faster      than my old cat   i would buy again         
181,5.0,                       probably the best ethernet cable out there  great build quality and does what is it supposed to do like in the description of the product  would      recommend to people who use a lot of speed for internet      
182,5.0,                       have this going directly from my modem to my ps    i replaced a   year old wire   download speeds went up and i feel a smoother game play occurring   overall happy      
183,5.0,                       it s an ethernet cable and connects my computer to the internet  i mostly game and haven t had any connectivity issues with it so everything is fine  not much else to say      
184,5.0,                       used to connect router to smart tv  excellent picture quality no buffering  appears to be a well made cable  eric from lombard il     
185,5.0,                       i was pretty impressed by how smoothly my consoles run online with these  i m really happy i swapped out all my old cat  cables with these to get some more speed  if you game or surf the internet  these are a must have      
186,5.0,                       these really are better than old lan cables   there was a most notable increase in upload speed  some increase in download speed  and some decrease in ping times      
187,5.0,                       i pay for         and for the first time i actually get      of that speed without   loss excellent product      
188,5.0,                       very durable  gave me my full gigabit speeds   ideal for anyone transferring large file sizes  for gaming and all computer needs     
189,5.0,                       i don t know what makes one ethernet cable different from another  but after running several speed tests this one was consistently about     faster than the other one i had     
190,5.0,                       this cat   cable was much faster than my cat   i was using  i verified on internet speed test on both computers  both topped at the highest speed for my internet subscription     very  happy       
191,5.0,                       works well increase download  about   mps more  my service is about    mps now was    mps      
192,5.0,                       high quality  good shielding  ran this under carpet and cant even tell it is there  great peak speeds out of this cable  would definatley buy again      
193,5.0,                       comes nicely packaged  it feels like a good quality cable i haven t had any problem with it      
194,5.0,                       right off the bat  my internet speeds went waaaaayyy up  starting roughly a little over    mb download speed  shot it s way up just under    mb download speed       
195,5.0,                       this cat  cable works very well  in order to get internet on my samsung tv they recommended at least a cat  cable  i started out with cat   then i upgraded to these cat   cables  when streaming and watching youtube there s no buffering to ruin the experience  get these now    it s worth the upgrade      
196,5.0,                       not a gamerbut working beyond and above the limit capacity of my internet packageno more wifi interruptions     
197,5.0,                       i started my job with amazon and thought it would be long enough to have my laptop be used in my room but it wasn t long enough which was my fault for not measuring it  even though i don t have anything to measure with lol  but i love the packaging it came with and it worked great and i like the gold on it too     thanks again for shipping this to me in a hurry when i needed it for my job on time      
198,3.0,                       the cable was not six feet as i expected given that was what i ordered   i have not noticed any increase speed from my prior ethernet cable      
199,5.0,                       lighting fast  i don t have a top speed data plan  but for what i do have this cat  ethernet cable works wonderfully  just purchased a    ft cat  cable  i ll be purchasing one for each room in my home        
200,5.0,                       i ve been using this for a little more than two weeks now  and it s a perfectly good ethernet cable  my use case for this cable is in my room with a laptop that gets moved around frequently  and since the cable hasn t shown signs of bending or crimping whatsoever  i m inclined to believe it s pretty durable  i don t have any use for an ethernet cable outside  though  so i haven t tested that aspect  overall  i solidly recommend this if you need what it offers as a cat  cable      
201,2.0,                       i bought   cables to attach the modem netgear nighthawk cm     to route rbr   other cable the router to playstation   my internet speed is    mb  the cable did not improve the speed also gives me about    mb of the capacity i tried many sets up to improve the speed but did not work  so  this cable for me does not work well and did not improve my speed      
202,5.0,                       it was for my modem to router  and it was over kill but cheap  less then those cat       
203,5.0,                       i have it plugged into my eero and mac mini  and it works wonderful        would recommend        
204,5.0,                       i thought i would try this over my cat  cable connection  i have seen an immediate speed increase  the start up loads quick  i recommend this        
205,3.0,                       when streaming it s great but just suddenly stops working and i retry connecting after so many try s it connects again and i know it s not my internet cause when i switch to wifi it works but the streaming quality goes down     
206,5.0,                       great connection for playing online  better speeds than anybody could hope to have     
207,5.0,                    funciona perfectamente tal cual como se describe  y el largo del cable es suficiente para cualquier tarea normal que necesites hacer         
208,5.0,                       i think everyone should buy cat   cable for their gigabit ethernet connections  boosted frame rate by    mbs for a   gig internet connection     
209,5.0,                       very well made cable and good value for the money i will buy again  made my internet a lot better even if it s at    mbps   i do have a upgraded modem and wifi router  i own  i have cox cable      
210,5.0,                       what can i say  this was a necessary item to make my computer work  it works well     
211,5.0,                       had some issues with an older cable  ordered this and it cleared up any issues i was having with the wifi      
212,3.0,                       i got one of these and it unfortunately didn t work but the company made the return real easy     
213,5.0,                       using it to connect into a port for my macbook pro  speeds seem pretty fast for the isp speeds i have with my modem      
214,5.0,                       my speeds were not coming through on the cat  so i got the cat  and voila it s now testing at excellent speeds   upgrade guys and gals      
215,5.0,                       product is not a cat   cable   it has no braiding or mesh inside to protect it   it is even thinner than a cat  e and is absolutely garbage   it does not work as expected and has poor latency   the stability of the connection is bad and overall you are better off going to best buy and getting a     cat        
216,5.0,                       i like how this product is long and have a strong connection and no interruption     
217,5.0,                       my wifi before was very low and i needed better connection for gaming and streaming   i had a cat  e cable connected and i was supposed to be getting    mbs but wouldn t even peek    mbs   after the upgrade to a cat   the difference was unbelievable  i have it connected to a pc       
218,5.0,                       this cable is hooked from my modem to the router  since i hooked it up my internet speed is faster and reliable      
219,1.0,                       do not buy this product    this could damage any ethernet port you may use it it  it melted after   day of normal use         
220,5.0,                       i m a streamed to attached between my providers  giga box  and my android tv box and the colors and sharpness got better     
221,5.0,                       arrived quickly and plugged it into pc and wifi adapter for better gaming   it s been great so far       
222,5.0,                       looks like a nice  solid well made product  shipped with capped ends protecting male ends  making it easy to pass through desk and other objects      
223,4.0,                       fast speeds upwards of     mbps download and     mbps upload   works as intended      
224,5.0,                       definitely feels strong and had it for about several weeks now and has been working and running great  definitely trust      
225,3.0,                       plugged it in and made my xbox have high latency  i then tried using just wifi and game ran better  so i tried the cable again and back to high latency  cable is built good  good download speed and upload speed i noticed i had another ethernet cable that came with my equipment so i plugged that in and now my latency dropped and gaming is fine

253,5.0,                       i bought this cat  for faster internet speed for fiber internet  works great      
254,1.0,                       much slower speeds than with the standard cables that came with our modem and router  and these come rolled up and will not straighten out  so now all my cables looks like a birds nest that got hit by a tornado

258,2.0,                       the cable at first is awesome and operates great  i ve had mine since oct       and it worked well until two weeks ago  any slight touch of the cable and the connect from the modem to router is lost immediately  this could be a good product but durability definitely not the greatest  i did have high hopes for this cable  only lasted   months      
259,5.0,                       we bought this for our son s truck  it should serve it s purpose  seems sturdy

263,5.0,                       great cable  i replaced our cat   cable going from our modem to our router  we noticed a immediate speed increase and have maintained that since

266,5.0,                       this will work so that i can attend virtual classes when wifi goes out   thank you

272,3.0,                       i tried this cable cat  and made no difference  my tv would still say no video      
273,5.0,                       no problem right out of the package    of course these were are overkill for my    mb comcast internet system  but i like overkill at a reasonable price      
274,5.0,                       cable seems thick and durable  it s an ethernet cable though at the end of the day so just about any cat  should do  i get good speeds the    ft is a good length for the extra reach  delivery was quick      
275,5.0,                       love the fact that these are authentic twisted pair  as well as heavily shielded   as a network admin i know how hard these attributes are to find these days on amazon  matter fact  i m only here writing this because i came back to stock up on more

280,4.0,                       seems to be of good quality  only complaint is that it is a bit on the stiff side  had to make some bends to get it to stop pushing the router around

286,5.0,                       this ethernet cable was thicker than the ones my isp provider gave with my modem router  in   replaced a worn down cat  cable and seems to provide a more stable connection  overall a good buy  the price is better than most but still would like to see it be cheaper or longer for the price      
287,5.0,                           but it worked well for my application  cant complain

330,5.0,                       great little cable     
331,5.0,                       i liked this cable because it was perfect for my router and tv which helped connect directly to internet instead of using the wifi  this way it will work better and you will have less buffering issues     
332,5.0,                       works as expected  packaging was good and delivery was quick      
333,2.0,                       cable is not very flexible so when i insert it into my pc it pulls on the port  would not buy this product again  however it is a very durable cable and would be good for plugging it into a port were the cable doesn t need to bend      
334,5.0,                       pretty great cable  for a cat  it s a good price and comes in some really clean cardstock packaging  also great cable quality too  very durable sleeving and getting the max speed i can out of my gigabit router now  works perfect for streaming     p    p   fps over discord  would highly recommend

339,5.0,                       deserves five stars     
340,4.0,                       not sure if this spec  are true  cos i think not  need run test  overall ok      
341,5.0,                       the ethernet cable fits nicely into the port of a cat   cable however you have much more durability and safety using this cable     
342,3.0,                       did not improve my speed for ps  don t notice any difference in stability i just see something tech that says faster i have to have      
343,5.0,                       personally i make my own cable  but in a pinch i bought this for the house   works great as expected      
344,5.0,                       extremely good for gaming      
345,1.0,                       so i have    mbps broadband internet     using this cable and testing it with both my xbox and ps  it would only allow for a   mbps upload speed   a cable purchases from gamestop for roughly the same price allowed for the full    mbps    the connection also felt loose and cheap     
346,5.0,                       no issues with these cables     
347,5.0,                       super high quality  probably the best i ve seen  i ordered another   ft  thanks

351,5.0,                       i m no expert tech dude but this cable is definitely faster than my old cat e cable   i saw a noticeable difference in speeds         
352,5.0,                       works

941,5.0,                       works great     
942,1.0,                       there is no printed markings on the cable so i have no clue what this is  all ethernet cables have printed markings to define what it is wether its cat e cat  cat a cat  or cat    unless it is a braided cable in which its rating will be stamped on the flat spot of the ends  i have   different black cat  ethernet cables   yellow ones an one white  the black ones have white print that has a serial number  mhz rating an cat  every    inches and the white an yellow have black printing  but this cat   that i bought has no markings no print on it for all i know they are selling me something besides cat   because their is no printed proof an my speeds during test were lower then my cat       
943,1.0,                       this is a junk cable  it s stiff and like a plastic straw  it s kinked like if you bend a straw  should be a nice soft rubber shield  buts it s not  good pictures of the cable ends in the ad are what sold this cable to me  it s junk  beware      
944,1.0,                       i m sure this is a great cable but i used it for my ps  and it didn t help  made the connection slower     
945,1.0,                       i bought two of these  cat    cables for the ethernet cable between my router and modem  and between the router and computer  the original cable between my modem and router was a cat  e cable that was provided for by the manufacturer of the router  the cable between my router and my computer is a cat   cable from best buy  before i installed both of these cables  i had no issues with streaming  playing video games  and other devices connected to the same network  after installing these two cables  i ve had nothing but issues with these cables  they should not be sold on the market as cat   standards as they feel stiff and very light as if there are no cables inside  you will get severe packet loss on this cables  will drop the connections to streams  at any moment  i ve had these longer than the    day return policy  i thought it was my computer itself as i uninstalled all networking drivers  followed by reinstalling  and flashed the latest firmware onto the router  i wish i could return these cables as the manufacturer s words do not back up their product  the only words they provide is a fluke test that was most likely flawed      
946,3.0,                       there is really absolutely no point to any consumer buying this cable for use in their home  cat  supports up to      gbps  much faster than any consumer router or even consumer internet supports  remember  getting a faster rated ethernet cable does not make your network any faster  your network is only as fast as the slowest link in the chain  so if your router only handles  gbps  thats all you are going to get  you d be far better off saving money and buying a nice cat  or even cat e cable  furthermore  cat  is not a recognized standard by iso yet  they are working towards it but it s not a recognized standard yet  it has been ratified by ansi though all in all  this cable seems to be decent quality  good for fast networking if you have the switches to support it  i purchased this as a slightly cheaper alternative than other cabling for a   gbps switch and so far it seems it can maintain the speed  though i purchased a short length of cable  i do not have a longer version of this cable to test and see if it can even reach the distance speeds that cat  should provide according to ansi tl dr   do not buy this cable unless you have network gear capable of    to   gbps  if you are an average consumer  pick a nice cat e or cat  cable  this wont make your xbox multiplayer gaming any faster      
947,1.0,                       don t fall for scams like this  gold plated rj   connectors don t do anything  the   individual wires in the inside of the connector is your conductors  gold plating rj   connectors is just for show and offers no benefit  it allows the company to over charge you for pointless crap residential networking has literally no need for a cable that can handle   gbs cat  can withstand     gbs uplink that is plenty for any residential and commercial use and the best part is it is cheaper than dirt in bulk buy a rj   crimp set  watch a   minute youtube video and make your own cables again  cables like these are an absolute scam  data center technician      
948,1.0,                       description says braided aluminum shielding  i found there was no braided shielding at all   description says single strand copper conductor  the copper is not single strand   the wire gauge is smaller than my cat  cables   i ve been scammed      
949,5.0,                       i bought this cable to hook up my ps  to see if i d get faster upload speeds then wifi  the the cable outpriformed cat  cable i purchased at walmart for    i get the same speeds as i do when hooked to wifi on the ps   i feel it s due to the wifi  in the ps   i do only have the router that was supplied to me from xfinity and understand that other factors can come into play when it comes to internet speeds  i only wanted to have less of a dip in upload speed to live stream in  k instead of     p    when on wifi  in my opinion the cable is built very well and is very durable also  it did give me a solid  mbps upload without the dip i d get on wifi going down to     or so  i d say this cable is good and did give me the fastest speed i can receive from the slowest speed that my network provides      
950,1.0,                       i purchased this based on the reviews  when i got the cable it was made of extremely hard plastic and not very bendable at all  i feel like if i bent it too much i would crack the outer jacket  when i plugged it in it actually made my internet slower vs my cat   cable  i do not recommend this product and will be returning for a refund      
951,5.0,                       works like it s supposed to and is quite durable  i doubt anyone has a home router that can make use of the cable s potential but even so it s a great cable      
952,5.0,                       i recently upgraded my isp plan   gb   modem and wifi router   overall improvement around my house with wifi but ethernet performance with macbook still disappointing  finally found this cable and have noticed an immediate improvement in speed replacing a cat  e cable  the cable is also durable and looks nice  as far as cables go    so  very happy with this product      
953,5.0,                       i am very pleased with the quality and performance of the cat   ethernet cable     ft     awg that i bought for my son to directly connect his ps  to the internet cable modem  i am so impressed with this ethernet cable that i plan on purchasing another one for my lg tv for streaming  great product  affordable price  very satisfied  thank you for delivering as advertised mike edwards     
954,1.0,                       this is not a cat   cable its most likely a cat   cable when i tested the cable it rated very poorly  its upload speed is     and its download speed is very slow but reaches     my cat   cable reaches a download speed of     and an upload speed of      this product is a knockoff      
955,1.0,                       at   awg isn t this more like   gbs      
956,5.0,                       really sturdy and i can definitely tell the difference in speed     
957,1.0,                       i thought i was getting a deal with this cord but i guess you get what you pay for  tried a speed test on my computer and my xbox  both were slower than my cat   cable  i was lagging quite a bit more while playing xbox to top it off  such a joke  my wifi speed test without any ethernet gives me around    mb s download and   mb s upload  this cable gave me around   mb s download and   mb s upload on multiple tests  i also had internet provider technician do some tests with the cable when he was here and we both came to the conclusion that this is just a cat   cable      
958,5.0,                       excellent     
959,4.0,                       great product     
960,5.0,                       no problems works great     
961,1.0,                       if ur a pc gamer and u want a gold ethernet it s not this this didn t even fit in my pc very disappointed     
962,1.0,                       idk idle this product is the same one that everyone else s reviews are about but mine is garbage my internet lags harder now since using this cable than it ever did usoning just wif         
963,5.0,                       this product is heavy duty for sure  i ve used cat cables since the old days and never seen a  more heavy duty one than this one  it s truely made for out doors  tough   fast   underground      
964,5.0,                       upgraded from old cat   cable gained a couple    mb speed im on fiber but still huge gain from old cable     
965,5.0,                       nice  strong connection  easy to remove  looks clean      
966,5.0,                       great quality product for this company      
967,5.0,                       durable     
968,5.0,                       it works surprisingly well for its price great pickup if your on a budget      
969,1.0,                       i had never purchased anything above cat   when i recently purchased cat   cable from two different manufacturers when it seemed that my speed was slower with this cat   cable  i decided to test it  when the initial test confirmed my gut feeling  i decided to do a more rigorous test for reference  i pay for a  gb internet speed  so i expected to be limited by that  i compared my wifi speed as well as cat  e  cat    and two different brands of cat  for the test i plugged into the same port on the router supplied by my internet provider for each cable i tested each cable  six times over two days  and eliminated the slowest recorded speed for each the download results   this cat   cable was slowest  with results even slower than the cat  e by      the upload results were even worse  this cat   cable was the slowest  with results even slower than the cat  e by       in case the manufacturer is reading this  the reason i eliminated the slowest recorded speeds from each cable s test results is because this cable also had the lowest recorded speeds between the cat  e  cat   and the cat   from the other manufacturer  i was trying to help this brand s cable show better results  but it didn t help      
970,1.0,                       this product is mislabeled  the packaging reads  cat    ft ethernet cable    but  the actual cable is only  ft long and the cable isn t labeled as catagory   ethernet  so actual bandwidth is unknown  for the cost  i think there s better choices out there      
971,3.0,                       worked for about   months  i used it to connect internet to my smart tv  it worked great for streaming  netflix  youtube  etc   but it worked very slow for gaming  i had to use wi fi for gaming  because the cord stopped working  for general use  but not gaming      
972,1.0,                       i thought this will be better than my cat   but it s worse don t waste your money for garbage i would recommend a cat   or  e don t waste your money     
973,1.0,                       this is a horrible product  when you unwind the cable it does not unwind without any kinks   this cable has several kinks and those kinks caused tears   this feels like cheap plastic for a covering   no flexibility  poorly made   a straw has more flexibility without running a tear   i can t say anything on the speed  since this cable did not work cause of the tear   i only purchased this because of all the positive reviews   i have come to the reality that those are either fake reviews or paid reviews   no truth behind it   don t waste your money and buy this   not recommended at all      
974,1.0,                       idk how this product has the amount of stars that it does  material feels cheap and not to mention the plastic that is supposed to click in place sucks its cheap flimsy and won t stay in place i can t keep the cable plugged into my modem or my xbox one x it s slips right out and i don t want to push in harder cause the plastic piece feels really cheaply made and it will be worse it it breaks  highly disappointed smh and was had high hopes for this cable with the rating and reviews it had      
975,1.0,                       i have  gb download    gb upload speeds  when i hook it up to the router i get    mbps download      mbps upload  but when i bypass the router   hook it up to just the computer i get my download   upload speed  the only thing i can think of is that it has to be the ethernet cable  i m going to return it   go with another cat   cable from another company     
976,5.0,                       internet connection to pos at my business was always lagging  all the times a message used to pop up  no internet connection   i changed ethernet cables multiple times but no problem solved at all  even the pos company dis not find any issue with pos machine  i was planning to change the machine itself  and that would cost alot of money  he recommended this brand  oh my goodness  this ethernet cable solved all my problem  it has something extra quality that solved my problem that other cables never could solve  i strongly recommend this to those who is experiencing issue like loose connection  tearing off and breaking the cable      
977,4.0,                       purchased   of these cables   one cable was installed as a replacement for a cat   cable   the new cable is very flexible and the outer covering appears thinner than the old cable   new cable is    gauge wire compared to old cable at    gauge   this cat   cable showed not noticeable performance increase over the older cat   cable   i hope it has a decent life cycle i will also be installing one of these cat   cables as the primary conduit between my modem and my router   i m expecting a good data transmission rate with this  fast  cable   i will update when fully operational and speed can be confirmed      
978,5.0,                       this works perfectly  but there s really not much else to say   i will say that for most people a cat  or even cat  ethernet cable isn t necessary   in fact the only real reason to own this is for future proofing   a cat  cable will be able to do the job just fine   i have   gig internet at home and technology advances all the time which is why i bought it   if you can afford it buy this   some advice i can give is that stores like office depot and staples seem to only carry cat  and   cables and they re priced at     or more so really just buy one of these      
979,5.0,                       i went from old ethernet cables that might be cat   or   cables  words on them are too worn to read  to these and immediately noticed the difference in uploading and downloading files   cat   cables should come standard with modern routers   stability of larger downloads  such as hd movies  and computer updates also seem better and faster   highly recommended if you re updating your home router or wanting to maximize your internet connection that you ve paid for      
980,5.0,                       when i received this package i was surprised at the weight  these are incredible solid and heavy duty cables  i don t know that i ve ever seen an ethernet cable so thick  i am confident that this will hold up much better than those thin and flimsy cables  i needed something more solid with working from home and plugging in and out of my laptop every day  just be sure you don t have a dongle that this weight could cause to break off if left hanging too long      
981,5.0,                       i find these cable ready for my service completely  i am sure from my connection to my unit s  or devices is very good  but from what i see from my units connection to the provider can fluctuate at times  i can see this more sensitive now than before which is either a little weird or exactly what one should see happening  there great      
982,1.0,                       can t ever tell what style cord you will receive with this company  ordered       cables one has a softer  thicker cable shroud that the other and is labeled  outdoor  the other is thinner and has a more plastic feel  i ordered the same cord twice not   different cords      
983,5.0,                       great cable  recently upgraded from some old cat  cable  and within the first day i notice my wifi was significantly faster for my phone and laptop  and my hardlined desktop loaded things much faster  sounds cheesy but these    cables really helped reduce lag for my gaming experience  on top of that they made very durable  very pleased      
984,5.0,                       i haven t used it on my main pc so i was trying to use it on my old pc because i sold my monitor so i don t have something to like play with but we do have this all in one pc so i tried to use it and i connected the ethernet cable and almost instantly the wifi got to the pc and i started to use it and it seems quiet fast so i can only imagine how fast the internet can be on my main pc so i do recommend this ethernet cable the packaging was really cool they even gave you emails to people who knew how to use the ethernet cable so if you have questions you can ask them which can sometimes be helpful for people who don t know how to use an ethernet cable the ethernet cable is also really good quality looks good and feels good and it s also water proof very good deal for me keep it up          
985,5.0,                       i have a pretty powerful gaming pc and once in a while it would drop connection mid game for no reason  i swapped xfinity cable  reset my ethernet card  router and updated drivers nothing worked  today i plugged in this cable and voila  all issues gone and my download and upload speeds went up  zero lag  love it      
986,5.0,                       i had another ethernet cord   i lagged so bad  i couldn t figure out why     so i ordered this cord   their is no comparison   all  even my game speed went up so much    no more lagging for me    i m very happy with this cord        
987,5.0,                       good quality cables  bought one a little while ago and just got a second  does everything cat   should and at this price there s really no really to get a lesser cable     
988,5.0,                       bought this to replace the generic cable i had running to my gaming system which was becoming loose at the connector and causing me to drop packets and sometimes disconnect  the connectors are secure in my system and router and the cable actually increased my speeds a little      
989,4.0,                       great wifi signal for streaming  it s durable and cute  i would give it   stars but they get     stars because the price is now less than my purchase price      
990,5.0,                       love this product  the cord is your standard durable ethernet cable  but it definitely provides fast paced connectivity  very fast shipping too      
991,5.0,                       on time  great price  and perfect for what i need it for  my ps  pro runs very well on this cable  do recommend having the proper internet to get the potential out of this cable      
992,5.0,                       i have  gbps download speed internet  before buying this ethernet  i never got close to    mbps download speed  it was frustrating because i thought that my internet provider wasn t providing what i am paying for   after getting this ethernet  my speed download is always above    mbps  i love using this ethernet because its steady with the upload speed which works perfectly with gamin definitely  recommend this ethernet      
993,5.0,                       using the cable  i hooked up my roku to my gigabit hardwire network   and the cable works well with a  k tv  i am not  a gamer  so i could not rate the cable for gaming  but  seeing that the cable is rated at cat  my guess is that it would work well      
994,5.0,                       cable fits and works perfectly  as soon as i installed i got full speed on my computer  very happy with the results      
995,5.0,                       gives the increased numbers i was looking for  far faster than wireless connections  now just have to wait for isp to stop throttling down the internet to a third of what this cable can handle     
996,5.0,                       i bought this cable to direct connect my ps   it is very fast with connection  it actually at times is able to up my download speed past my service that i pay for    mb s up to   mb s   my upload speeds almost tripled as well with this cable  overall  very good investment to up your download and upload speeds      
997,5.0,                       i use it for my xbox one works great havent lagged and is pretty long wich i like  ft so it gives you a good amount of space to move around     
998,5.0,                       i was already using a cat  ethernet cable for computing  when i switched to this cat  cable  page loading was noticeably faster       
999,5.0,                       thanks again for the quality item item price is excellent definitely recommend this item      
1000,5.0,                       i mean i got a few mps from just upgrading to cat   but wasn t enough to go out of my way for with that being said it works      went from     mps to     mps
