1,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       it is a total misrepresentation that this is alcohol free      
2,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i was recommended this by my dentist  he gave me a sample to try first   and this stuff is a game changer i won t make any promises here   nor do i know if this is really the case for most people   but from my experience my dentist said i had a bit of decay   not quite a cavity  so he was hesitant to drill and fill he told me to use this very night   and it might go away on its own long story short   it did i like it because its also not as harsh as the blue stuff  and it protects your teeth for the future just remember that you should use it after you brush  before bed   and don t eat or drink anything afterwards      
3,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i like red wine and fruity candies  so sue me  i dislike how these vices stain my tongue  lips  and teeth  especially since i usually consume them in the evening  of course  i m not a college student anymore  i brush and floss my teeth with gusto now that i am on my own dental insurance  a retroactive apology  mom and dad   that alone is rarely enough to make my mouth feel clean after a couple glasses of wine and some delightful starburst candies  i m too concerned with my oral hygiene and mediocre dental insurance to be able to go to sleep with a mouth tasting of toothpaste mixed in with a hint of merlot  this mouthwash helps to break down the sugars  the stains  and leaves my mouth feeling clean  i also like the mild burn  it makes it feel like it s working while slightly punishing me  self flagellation via mouthwash even though i haven t had a cavity in    years  i was surprised during my latest dental appointment when both the hygienist and the dentist couldn t stop gushing over the beautiful state of my teeth  honestly  it started to get weird   the only thing that has changed since my last appointment was the fact that i now use an electric toothbrush and this mouthwash  i would bet the toothbrush made the biggest difference  but the mouthwash was probably a helpful addition  too      
4,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       love  most  listerine products and this one is added to the list  though the original is my favorite  i currently use the orange ultraclean  fights tartar  tastes like hi c  at night and this in the morning  has fluoride  recommended by my hygienist   it tastes fantastic  minty fresh without being artificially sweet  and it works wonderfully  it burns like listerine  meeting my expectation of it burning like listerine  the name of my band s next smash hit will be  burns like listerine   you re going to love it peace      
5,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       how does anybody swish this stuff around for a minute     seconds in i want to cry from the burning assuming it doesn t melt your teeth out  your breath will smell fresh afterwards      
6,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       did you know by using this mouthwash each day say      it not only keeps your breath fresh  teeth n gums free of bacteria and your throat  no sore throat while using this  i know their is bacteria that can n does collect in the sides far back in the mouth  some people have these pockets where the tonsils may be  bacteria can and does collect in these pockets  with repeated use of listerine those days are over  i thought i had strep  turns out food we eat can without gargling with a good mouthwash will cause the build up  despite flossing  water pic   electric tooth brush ect   these lumps of matter are small scratchy n annoying   the throat becomes sore  they are white with a tinge of gray and i m told common  dentist recommended  if i don t or skip  they form after a week or two of gargling no more lumps   the listerine brings the bacteria out of its hiding place  freedom  btw i don t get a cold ever       
7,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i used this product  switching from my usual go to  since it was highly rated on amazon  little did i know that i was about to embark on a week long journey to hell  the mouthwash caused a massive canker sore on my tongue  my gums  cheeks  and tongue all became incredibly sensitive and swollen  my throat got sore  and i developed a   day fever  i was unable to eat anything hard or spicy and even a week later there is some remaining swelling near my back molars  the internet leads me to believe it contains sls and there are many accounts of this causing similar symptoms  unbelievable that this is allowed to be sold to consumers without a warning  i ll never be buying a listerine product again      
8,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       kind of hard to fault a product that s been around longer than i have   as a kid  i remember the intense burn of this compared to scope and other mouthwash s      years later  not much has changed   leaves your mouth fresh and germ free as nothing can live through the fires of listerine      
9,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i am very happy i found this mouthwash on amazon  it would have cost me almost twice as much at my local pharmacy  it leaves your mouth minty fresh for hours after rinsing my mouth with it  instructions say do not eat or drink anything for    minutes after using  rinse vigorously for   full minute   edit           i just purchased for second time  that s all
