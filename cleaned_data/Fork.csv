1,1.0,                       after about six months of light use i noticed the insides of the tines were rusting  there are a lot of good reviews and also a number of reviews stating that the forks rusted  so apparently there is inconsistent quality of manufacturing  until the rust appeared i was happy with the size  weight  design of the forks  then i threw them all out so i don t have rust mixed in with my food

371,5.0,                       i m picky about the flatware i purchase  i like a nice strong and sturdy piece  but not too heavy  the handle needs to be thick enough to grip  i like the tines to be long  i was very pleased with my purchase of these forks  i received them quickly and they met all my requirements i mentioned above  i highly recommend purchasing them

373,1.0,                       i had these about   weeks and they already had rust spots       
374,5.0,                       another fine  amazon transaction      
375,2.0,                       not was i was expectingi like mine a little thinner and lighter     
376,4.0,                       arrived sooner than expected  similar pattern to my everyday service so mixes in well   fork tines are a little shorter than i like but for the price a good buy      
377,5.0,                       very sturdy forks  these aren t the flimsy utensils you get at the dollar store   very pleased with the quality      
378,2.0,                       the spoons and knives from these guys are great the forks we have had to toss a bunch due to suprise heavy rusting after the dishwasher  make sure to dry them when putting them away to prevent this  wish we did but i might need to buy more     
379,4.0,                       they look nice  feel nice  and generally seem like good forks   however  one is already rusty after   months  and it s mostly been sitting in a drawer because we didn t really need    forks   still  for the price if just this one rusts  meh i won t really care   but if you re thinking  i really need    forks and i m planning to throw my other forks away because all my forks must match   you may be upset when one rusts after some months the rusty one has many rusty spots   the others all have zero rusty spots   so maybe that one just didn t get made right  who knows   if the others turn up rusty in a few more months  i ll change my review      
380,5.0,                       the forks were perfect  very comfortable to hold

384,5.0,                       quite impressed with the quality of these forks does anyone else lose their forks over the years  i swear my teens must have thrown a few in the trash without thinking    anyways  don t think twice    buy these  i may even update some of my other silverwear with this brand    btw    someone reviewed the whole set that hiware also makes   complained that the steak knives rust in the dishwasher in my experience  steak knives should be hand washed or that will happen      
385,5.0,                       good     
386,2.0,                       these are fine if you need a lot of small forks  for example  if you have kids who constantly lose forks

394,4.0,                       my only complaint is that when you try to cut into something with the edge of the fork  the neck of the fork is thin and is sharp on your finger   i had expected the entire fork to be thicker

488,5.0,                       great product and conveniently sold as a pack of only forks  which is the only utensil that i really needed more of  i have an excessive amount of spoons and knives in all different sizes  but somehow over time  many of our forks have gone missing  i haven t been able to find a set of good forks sold as a pack at any of the home goods stores nearby  frustratingly  my only in store options have been to either buy the entire dinner utensil set  which will give me even more spoons and knives that i do not need  and therefore do not want to spend on  and then only get a few forks out of the deal  in my case  not a good deal   the only other option i ve seen at the stores is to buy the forks individually  but when you need more than just a few  like i did  then this option gets expensive very quick  also not a good deal   maybe i ve just been shopping at the wrong stores  but this    peice set of forks was exactly what i was looking for    i should have just started my search here to save me the trouble and irritation  anyway  i am very happy with this product  they work just as forks should  and more importantly i know i spent my money on items that we will get full use of in my household

491,5.0,                       these are the best forks i ve handled in a coon s age  they re wonderfully balanced  the long handle makes them very easy to control  and the weight is just right  i usually buy   tine forks  but we re so happy with these it doesn t matter about the  th tine  i can say that for the price i was very surprised by the quality of these forks  and highly recommend them to anyone  this was an excellent choice for us  and i m so happy with my purchase of them  i wish i could find some dinner knives by hiware  sigh     hiware    piece good stainless steel dinner forks cutlery set    inches

504,5.0,                       they pick up food very nicely and keep the food in place until it reaches your mouth  they re a little heavy but not enough to weigh your hand down  i m a tired mom so i let dishes sit in the sink occasionally and they haven t rusted so that s a plus  can t beat the price either  good purchase     
505,5.0,                       these are solid well made forks  so far the hardest thing i ve done to these forks is stab a raw potato to put holes in it  so far the forks haven t bent at all and i don t expect they will  the finish is holding up well after multiple wash cycles  i ll update this review if this changes      
506,3.0,                       i was looking for and found these budget dinner forks on amazon   received the order in a few days from usps nicely boxed and damaged free   the dinner forks are made in china and cost about a dollar each   i am satisfied with both product and vendor   i would order product again      
507,5.0,                       really great quality products and better than my expectation  would buy again

749,5.0,                       these forks hold up well  they feel nice and have a nice heft to them  i do notice red rust spots from time to time but they mostly wipe off      
750,5.0,                       these forks are so heavy duty and they look so expensive  they have a high shine and haven t rusted so far      
751,4.0,                       i kept looking at different stores and just couldn t find the right size forks for a reasonable price  these forks are just what i was looking for and the price was also just what i wanted      
752,3.0,                       the forks are pretty average   they are nicer than plastic forks for large crowds  but are not comfortable to hold in your hand      
753,5.0,                       i had previously purchased these forks  but with boys they were probably accidentally thrown away  these forks are great  they are lightweight and easy for all ages to use      
754,5.0,                       we have a beach rental and almost all of our forks have disappeared this year  i was looking for forks to supplement the remaining silverware and these did the trick  good value for the quality  will definitely purchase again if my forks go missing      
755,5.0,                       good quality and a great price      
756,4.0,                       i really like these forks   they are thick and sturdy and work well   be aware that the bottom flares out a bit  so it nearly didn t fit inside my dishwasher silverware slots   the real reason why i gave them four stars instead of five though  was because it left a black residue on our fingers when we used them  that was even after washing them in the dishwasher before using them for the first time   it looks like the polish wasn t fully removed at the factory  so after some scrubbing and polishing by hand  they were good to go      
757,4.0,                       like other reviewers i never had enough forks to last before i ran the dishwasher   i was always digging around in the dishwasher and having to hand wash a couple   these forks look enough like my stainless set that it is hard to tell they don t belong   the tines  however  are a different length and are between the length of my salad and dinner forks   they are also a bit lighter in weight   still  it is nice to have forks whenever i need them i looked up my set and discovered they are extremely expensive   so  it was nice to get replacements that were affordable      
758,5.0,                       well made clean and smooth      
759,5.0,                       great value     
760,5.0,                       these forks are great for parties  as i purchased them for  but also are every day usable  they have a good weight to them  with smooth lines  and a classic look  i will buy from this company again  when the need arises      
761,1.0,                       not rust free  this is after one wash  i haven t even even used them for eating      
762,5.0,                       we were expecting a lot of company during a weekend and didn t want to use plastic utensils   i went online and saw these  hoping that they would be ok  since it was last minute   they were perfect   nicer than the forks i had on hand   very reasonably priced   not thin and cheap but very elegant   thanks      
763,5.0,                       while planning our christmas dinner  we realized we were short a few forks  these were simple enough to blend in with our flatware and good quality  we ordered them on the afternoon of the   nd  they were shipped    minutes later  and arrived december   th  saving christmas      
764,5.0,                       these were perfect    forks fly out of our house     great deal

769,5.0,                       i cannot say enough about these forks   large  heavy  and very mice quality especially for the price          
770,5.0,                       got these forks because i have spent the last    years with just a couple of forks and i finally got tired of washing a fork every time i want to eat  the quality of these forks is far better than the cheap dollar store ones i had been using  i didn t know quality in a fork made much difference but these feel very sturdy but they re also fairly light in weight  i would recommend these forks to anyone looking for a good set for everyday use      
771,5.0,                       easy to hold  perfect size  thank you      
772,5.0,                       good silverware  especially for the price vs quantity  i keep getting drunk and throwing the old stuff away so this is a fantastic quality replacement

779,5.0,                       the nice thing about these forks is they have a handle and all four tines  have you tried using a fork without a handle  total hassle  missing tines also make me suspect   what are they doing with the extra tines  why are half my forks missing one   well  that wasn t an issue here  whether you re pulling a prank on the neighbor s lawn of utilizing the cutlery to deliver food items from plate to mouth  these forks win my approval

785,5.0,                       somehow we always run out of forks  i bought a cheap o set from walmart but they had awkwardly sharp edges  these forks are only a few buck more but they are sturdy  heavy  smooth  and durable  i will buy more      
786,5.0,                       we harbor an evil doer in the office who eats cup noodles with a plastic fork and returns the  washed  fork to the drawer afterwards  imagine me usually a pretty easygoing  happy individual who then picks up said fork and begins to eat my lunch with it  only to discover that it had already been used  evident by all the food stuck in its hard to wash crevices these kill two birds with one stone  first  they re not plastic  second  they have no grooves or crevices were food can get stuck  even if you have no dish washing talent  you can do a quick swish swish with a sponge and still be able to get it clean  yes ryan  that means you      
787,5.0,                       i ve had these forks for less than a week  but they look and work fine

797,5.0,                       the fork is well made and the design is classic  the color of stainless steel is very bright  overall satisfied     
798,2.0,                       the stainless steel fork is quite good  however there are some dark stuff on the gap that you will have to clean thoroughly every single fork  which took a while to clean and you need something that can go between the gap to clean it      
799,5.0,                       decent silver ware for the price

809,1.0,                       i bought these forks about six months ago   i really liked them so ordered the spoons that matched  which i m also returning    i never looked at the forks that close till today  when i noticed spots on them   i looked at all    forks that came in the order   they all have rust on them   it s  little hard to see in the picture  but its not good   i m going to trash them all and find new forks from another company   these are really nice forks and the spoons were really nice  but i m not going to eat  with rusty silverware      
810,5.0,                       it s pretty sturdy   and it s nice to keep  it looks like they will last i like to order dinner spoon   but i m afraid it will be like the serving spoons that i just ordered

815,5.0,                       i am very picky with eating utensils for some reason  i do not like plastic handles or flimsy metal  i bought these to replace an older more expensive set from which most of the forks had gone missing  you can barely tell the difference between these forks and my old forks  very heavy duty feeling and shiny  would buy these again

820,1.0,                       these forks have rusted between the tines after only a few weeks of use   such a shame since they are heavy  large and nice looking   i threw them all away last night and now i m back on amazon to find and order different ones

826,5.0,                       we are a household of   grown adults  so how forks disappear constantly is beyond me  we need more forks so we took a shot at these because of the amazing reviews and great value  they do not disappoint  they are sturdy and do exactly what a fork should do  also  the weight of these forks feel great  they are heavier than my other forks  in a good way   i would definitely recommend      
827,5.0,                       they pick up food well  and seem pretty durable      
828,5.0,                       i needed a few extra forks and was surprised at the price for the other  name brand  forks   so  i decided to give the amazon essentials forks a try   the forks are excellent quality   nice weight  nice feel  comfortable   they feel and look much more expensive than they are   definitely worth the money and i highly recommend   when it s time to add spoons  i ll order the same brand
