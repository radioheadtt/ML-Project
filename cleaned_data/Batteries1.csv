0,4.0,                       the quality of this batteries is pretty good specially for the price  they have a nice weight to them and have not leaked on any of my devices  their only weakness is that they don t seem to hold for a while as i noticed that the longer i have them the more they are loosing their strength  if you use them right away you will have the best results      
1,5.0,                         years isn t necessarily a lot in terms of battery shelf life  but i bought these over   years ago now  and they are still coming out of the box fresh and full powered  no need to waste you money on name brands  if you are buying some regular alkaline batteries  these perform just as well for less      
2,5.0,                       we bought these for a planned power outage to use in our battery operated fans  the battery lasted on full speed for a good    hours of non stop use  the power came back on before the batteries died      
3,5.0,                       thank you amazon for having a large stock of batteries when stores ran out   while others were frantically searching local stores  i ordered these on my couch at home and they arrived in   days   these batteries are strong and provided light during the blackout of hurrican irma      
4,5.0,                       i recently purchased   sets of the    d cell battery packs for my outdoor motion detector lights   upon receiving the batteries  which were packaged very well  i tested each battery with a volt meter before installing them in the lights   all batteries had a charge of between      and      volts   these batteries are rated at     volts  so all were above the listed voltage   how they hold up is another question that i will answer after some time has passed      
5,5.0,                       great value   don t know how long they last yet  but they work great so far     
6,5.0,                       they are d batteries  and are lasting a good amount of time in our outdoor motion sensor lights more economical than energizer duracell  and longer lasting than the  value  d cells      
7,5.0,                       best price i have found      
8,5.0,                       best batteries  i use them for battery operated fans and luminara no flame candles  they are reliable and last forever  they bring a confidence level that i don t find with other brands and you just can t beat the price      
9,5.0,                       their batteries that work oh  so far so good     
10,5.0,                       use lots of batteries for grandchildren toys so this was a value     
11,5.0,                       skip the brand names and pick these  just as good and priced to sell     
12,5.0,                       long lasting batteries   thank you amazon for these  i have a fisher price cradle and swing and it chugs down batteries because i use it everyday  so i was going through batteries like water and very      so j saw these on amazon and thought about giving i a shot and they re great  and a fraction of the price  very useful  thank you again amazon      
13,1.0,                       these do not have the life of abrand name product      
14,5.0,                       great value comparing to supermarket     
15,1.0,                       batteries seemed fine when new  but i put   of them in small closet lite fixtures  and   of the fixtures have lost charge   the  rd one still works   could there be something about my lites that is causing this   the return rules say that i can no longer return but replacement is possible through        but i don t see any way to request this replacement      
16,1.0,                       i purchased amazon basic batteries in every size i use     and all of them have had a very short battery life and several have corroded which  imo  shouldn t happen at all in fresh batteries  just about ruined my new optical mouse      
17,5.0,                       no joke  i would say i only write a review   time a year  and this is it   i bought these back in december for my luminara candles   which i have on a timer and they are stillgoing strong      i can t believe it  i don t even think duracell lasted that long  i m going to try the double aa s and hopefully i ll get the same results       
18,5.0,                       good value  i ve been using them in my outdoor lights for months and have not had to replace them yet      
19,1.0,                       these batteries seemed like a great buy until i needed them during hurricane irma and they couldn t power the battery operated fan i wanted to lend to my neighbor whose power was out i bought these batteries in may       and while they worked in a flashlight they did not work in the battery operated fan  at first i assumed that the problem was with the fan  then this week i bought other batteries and tried the fan and it worked  i double checked and the amazon batteries still did not work in the fan so  if i could return these i would  don t count on them powering much other than a basic flashlight      
20,1.0,                       i never wrote a review before  these batteries are so bad i felt i needed to warn others  they do not last  i put them in a flamelss candle that duracell powered on a timer for more than six months  on the same sceheulde i get about a week from these batteries  bad      
21,5.0,                       each battery was good for long time  but too big a package  i use more aa aaa  didn t have enough use for this large a package of ds      
22,5.0,                       bought for my battery inventory  getting ready for the holidays     
23,5.0,                       good     
24,1.0,                       these were the worst   i always buy my batteries from amazon but these lasted less than two weeks  i think i got a bad batch      
25,1.0,                       i got these batteries  d cell  to use in a maglite flashlight  the first pair lasted about    minutes before it was so dim it was unusual  the second pair dimmed from really bright to that of a battery nearing the end of its life after about    seconds  but has stayed at that brightness for    minutes now  this is not the experience i have had with other name brand batteries  or even something like radio shack badged ones      
26,5.0,                       always purchase my batteries from amazon  quick delivery and way cheaper than other places      
27,5.0,                       appreciate the simple packaging   i am using these in an outdoor motion sensor light  jury s still out on longevity      
28,5.0,                       good battery good price     
29,5.0,                       quality batteries  when the grandchildren need a new battery or device they come to grandpa  so far batteries work as well as the name brand at about half the price  order today and get day after tomorrow      
30,4.0,                       i put these on the voltmeter and got      v reading on each of   i tested   i compared them to two other new unused d cells  the duracell coppertop  assembled in us  and the rayovac fusion  both of which tested at     v   the amazon cell and the other two were all nearly exactly  within      of a mm  the same length and diameter   the expiration dates on the amazon cells were oct       the expiration dates on the duracell and rayovac cells were mar      and nov       respectively  and i ve had those cells for about a year   maybe amazon puts more realistic expiration dates on their cells  or maybe they ship older stock  who knows   the packaging of the amazon cells was very solid   two rows of   cells  each row shrink wrapped  and a cardboard divider between the pos   neg terminals as the two rows lay lengthwise in the box   the packaging makes them great to use for long term emergency storage  especially if the expiration dates are usually further out like the competition   unless those dates are all bs anyway   the voltmeter doesn t lie   i would not trust these to leave in a device long term   i assume they would leak like every other chinese alkaline battery i have ever used   i wish energizer ultimate lithium made d cells   their aa and aaa non rechargables are bulletproof and the gold standard in non rechargeable cells      
31,5.0,                       these batteries work great  no issues in terms of performance compared to other so called name brand  e g  duracell  batteries  amazon brand products that i have bought have held their own compared to name brand products  so while you can go for duracell i think you will be just find trying amazonbasics and be surprised at what you find      
32,2.0,                       i bought these to use with a minnow aerator  all other inexpensive batteries last     hours  these less than     will not buy again      
33,3.0,                       used in mr  beams mb    these batteries do not last   lucky to get   weeks out of these on a motion activated light  activated less than    times a day   energizer max d batteries have been working for months now   purchase these if you don t mind changing batteries often   decent value for the price  i suppose      
34,5.0,                       they dont sell d batteries at department stores anymore i guess  had to order them here so i could carry around my boombox without it being plugged in catch me in the streets  blasting power to the peeps     
35,1.0,                       purchased these the middle of july for wife to use in battery operated name brand candles which have a timer and these burned out in a very short time compared to other brand batteries we have used  expiration date on box is         and with a manufacture date was          very disappointing and can not recommend      
36,5.0,                       bought these for holiday candles in my windows which are on timers  i thought the batteries would last a few weeks  installed in nov  and   months later  still going      i guess they are now easter candles        
37,5.0,                       good value     
38,5.0,                       these batteries last just as long as the name brand batteries and seemingly without suffering any leaks   which i seemed to get quite often with the name brands   some much cheaper  in cost   but seem to be better made      
39,1.0,                       out of the box they only had     charge on them  i tested   of them  seemed like a good price but they are not a fully charged battery when receiving and they are short lived when using      
40,1.0,                         of the    batteries  which i stored inside my closet  were dead within    months of purchase  despite the website stating that there is a   year  leak free warranty   also  amazon had zero sympathy and stated that is not a warranty or claim that can b e resolved   i m having to throw away two thirds of the batteries i purchased   i will be sure to purchase legitimate batteries from a membership warehouse in the future      
41,5.0,                       work great and the price can t be beaten     
42,1.0,                       these did not seem to last long in a portable fan for my camper  my recommendation is to buy a more trusted brand then the amazon brand      
43,3.0,                       used in a device requiring   batteries  device stopped working shortly after  tested all   batteries    were dead   were fine  i suspect these batteries are garbage  should have paid a little more and gotten the energizer batteries      
44,5.0,                       cannot comment on longevity or battery life because they are put away for emergency use  but they were a good value      
45,5.0,                       best bang for your buck      
46,3.0,                       some of the batteries were dead     
47,5.0,                       great price compared to the store bought      
48,5.0,                       really can t beat the price of the amazon basics batteries  i have been using their brand for a few years now  both the regular and the rechargeable  these d batteries seem to hold a charge just as long as any other major brands      
49,5.0,                       these are my favorite batteries great value they do what they re supposed to do i have no complaints packaged with care      
50,5.0,                       thankyou      
51,5.0,                       i go through batteries often having lots of flameless candles in my home  i believe that amazon batteries  i ve purchased aa  aaa    d  are just as good as duracell or energizer  can t beat the price per battery      
52,5.0,                       emergency flashlight     
53,5.0,                       works good  thank you      
54,5.0,                       these keep on going  great for holiday lights      
55,5.0,                       i use amazon batteries exclusively and they seem to last a little longer that other brands      
56,2.0,                       i really wanted to like the amazon version for batteries  they are so much more affordable than the other name brands in the market  but there is definitely a reason for that  they don t last anywhere near as long as their competitors  so in this case you are really getting what you pay for  they are so much lower in price because you will go through them so much more quickly than the other brands      
57,4.0,                       you might think you are buying an iphone  the package came in a bubble bag  inside was a nice  sturdy carton  inside the carton are the batteries laid out in a cardboard insert like eggs  on top of that  the cells are shrink wrapped together  they are only batteries  people  how about a cheaper bulk pack method and reduce the trash by          
58,5.0,                       excellent battery life   we ve been enjoying amazon basics batteries of all sizes for many years and i love being able to buy them in quantities like this      
59,2.0,                       typical  store brand  product  batteries were dying in less than six months      
60,1.0,                       we bought these batteries for our air mattress pump and once installed our air pump was still working as slow or possibly even worse then when we had the dying batteries in  we were confused as these were supposed to be new and should be working  i took the batteries out to take a look and compare them to the energizer brand we had previously  the amazon batteries came damaged  the positive side ends were not extended out enough and therefore weren t secured tight enough into the air pump in order to work properly  wouldn t risk my chances buying here again  just spend the extra bucks on better batteries      
61,2.0,                       suitable for demonstration only   these batteries don t perform well in high drain situations  like running a fan  when comparing to higher quality batteries  like duracell  energizer  or rayovac   it actually costs less and lasts longer to buy an   pack of better batteries than the     pack of basics      
62,1.0,                       i honestly bought these  x because i thought one batch of batteries were defective but now i know that they re very bad quality  please dont waste your money on these  after  weeks they re dead and its frustrating to constantly replace them  the other amazon white batteries were the best but thsese are garbage      
63,1.0,                       these batteries leak acid and destroyed our hardwood floors   these batteries were placed in a keyboard   even though the keyboard was still working i noticed large dark brown splatters all over our hardwood floors and acid leaking out of the battery compartment   we have never had this problem in the keyboard with any other batteries   the cost of refinishing the floors make these cheap batteries incredibly expensive   remove these batteries from anything you ve put them in immediately      
64,2.0,                       these batteries are inexpensive for a reason  they don t last  i have battery powered flameless candles that usually stay lit at least a couple of months when using name brand batteries  these didn t even last two weeks  you get what you pay for  buy a name brand      
65,5.0,                       awesome     
66,4.0,                       i put the batteries in a flashlight and the beam was not as bright as   duracell batteries  if they don t last as long as duracell batteries the money value is not there      
67,3.0,                       as batteries go  these are okay  they work well in everything that i use them in  but they don t have the long shelf life of the more mainstream batteries  after about a year on the shelf  i ve found the amazonbasics batteries are typically worthless many knock off brand batteries are    v instead of the typical    v  these aren t like that  these are    v i will keep buying these as i need them      
68,3.0,                       formfactor slightly off  batteries are slightly larger than standard cause an issue if you stack more than two in series     
69,5.0,                       got these just in time for flashlights before tropical storm isaias blew in  they work fine      
70,1.0,                       you get what you pay for and these have a very short lifespan compared to duracell or even other brands  their aas are the same way  avoid this brand unless you like changing batteries often      
71,1.0,                         batteries where dead i will never purchase batteries from amazon in the future     
72,5.0,                       great bang for the buck     
73,5.0,                       amazonbasics makes really good batteries  these come with a claim for   year shelf life  for the affordable price  it is worth giving these a shot we had a baby recently and a lot of these products use d batteries  i have not noticed these not lasting long at all  if anything at all  these might last longer than the name brands also  the frustration free packaging is awesome  it comes in a cardbord case that helps store these easily on my shelf      
74,5.0,                       no issues with these batteries  seem to last a long time  and they arrive in pristine condition      
75,1.0,                       these batteries are subpar in terms of light strength and intensity  worse than that is their longevity  will not buy again      
76,5.0,                       what can i say about batteries   price is good and i buy in quantity for my   battery operated spot lites for my dogs in back yard     
77,4.0,                       pretty good value  they didn t last the full amount of hours they said that they would in my fan while camping but they got the job done      
78,1.0,                       i am not at all impressed with these   i have battery oporated candle that come on every day for   hours on a timer   when i use duracell i change them every   to   months   these lasted not even   months      
79,5.0,                       these batteries are as good as some  more expensive brands  i use them a lot in two flashlights  and the batteries have lasted very well  in short  they compare favorably with other brands      
80,5.0,                       ok as far as batteries go  these are the best   they provide power  light  just overall godliness when i need them   they are so good  i bought two boxes      
81,4.0,                       great value compared to competition  just don t know how long they will last  but emergency light has plenty of shine with these batteries in place and i like cardboard box making it easy to access and not mess around with cheap plastic blister pack that lets batteries fall out after being opened      
82,5.0,                       i use amazon batteries as my preferred brand  decent price good service     
83,5.0,                       just as good as the major brands      
84,3.0,                       these worked fine on arrival  but use them soon because they have only a three year shelf life  which i learned from the website and not from the packaging because i couldn t find an expiration date on the package or the battery itself  so who knows how long these will last   p s  to all potential hurricane sufferers   you probably know this but don t store your hurricane lanterns  portable fans  radios  seasonal big flashlights et cetera with the batteries in them   they ll die  leak  or both      
85,5.0,                       batteries top notch longlasting     
86,1.0,                       i had previously ordered batteries after hurricane maria and they worked so well  the leftover ones did not work anymore so i ordered these ones as replacements for me and my sisters  not one of them works  no juice   the process to return them from pr us not user friendly and costly  will not but again  more than    dollars wasted      
87,5.0,                       great batteries you won t go wrong last long i use them for my lanterns outside      
88,1.0,                       junk batteries   i had two leak acid  and another that leaked acid and almost set the house on fire while on the charger   it leaked on the charger and caused it to short out   a very cheap and dangerous item   also  they are a bit too large  long  to fit in some items that take a series of three or four d cell batteries      
89,3.0,                       got these for use in devices that need aa batteries  unfortunately they re not as good as energizer brand  the price is a bit lower  but not as long lastingthis review was meant for the aa batteries  haven t had the  d  cells long enough to evaluate     
90,1.0,                       had to be returned  completely dead        
91,3.0,                       it s  cheaper but not as afficient as name brands  i bought it for my daughter s swing and   of it won t even last   weeks on  hours per day use unlike name brands that lasts a whole month or more  not worth it  amazon can do better     
92,5.0,                       i ve bought a few of these packs  they are all great  well packaged and so far no discernible difference between these and the name brands      
93,4.0,                       when i first got them they didn t work  then i realized it s because it was so cold outside  after they warmed up they have worked just like batteries should      
94,5.0,                       good battery longer to use        
95,3.0,                       batteries are fine for short period oeration  should be removed from device for storage  may cause corrosion if left in device or extended period      
96,5.0,                       great value for the money     
97,5.0,                       i thought that my electric was going to be off for a day and a half  so i bought these  put them in my batterie powered lantern    and they re nice and bright now      
98,5.0,                       the per unit price is very good for d cells   the batteries are packaged in a cardboard and plastic sleeve to protect them from the elements and to keep them from touching each other   i haven t given it any tests  but i will report how well the batteries hold up  or don t hold up  when that information is available      
99,1.0,                       haven t got to use them yet  good for emergency stock     
100,5.0,                       these have held up great in my flameless candles  i followed the reviews and i m glad i did  great value  can t beat the price

102,5.0,                       excelente     
103,5.0,                       great batteries  i used a set of   for my automatic garbage can and the batteries last for a little over a year      
104,5.0,                       they seem to hold their own   haven t had an issues   using them automatic cat feeders  no issues     
105,5.0,                       priced right     
106,5.0,                       good batteries for the price  last as long as the name brands   a little better price            
107,1.0,                       i don t know how people got lucky with these  i m joining the many who received their d batteries dead on arrival  none of them will power a cat feed machine  let alone a flashlight  very disappointed      
108,5.0,                       so i bought these because of the price and how easy it is to buy things on amazon   gave them a try and haven t had one go bad yet   life on these things seems very good   they do have good weight to them as opposed to the cheapy ones from the dollar store lol   i would compare them to duracell      
109,5.0,                       i needed multiple batteries to run mole sound deterents in the garden   they seem to be working fine grateful for the battery pack i was able to purchase from you      
110,1.0,                       put inside lighted christmas garland on my fireplace mantle  a week later the garland didn t light up  opened the battery box and a liquid poured out  i immediately washed my hands but i got a battery acid burn on my arm from it splashing  attached picture shows the moisture on the bottom of the battery wrapping  ruined a     garland and gave me a chemical burn  i will never buy amazon branded batteries again      
111,5.0,                       i ve been purchasing these amazon basic batteries for two years now since i purchased my outdoor battery operated motion lights  i have only replaced the batteries twice it almost   years   definitely a great value      
112,5.0,                       seem alright     
113,5.0,                       used to buy  dollar store  as i thought i was saving money  but they don t last and tend to leak  bought a bundle price and saved money and know i can trust amazon batteries to last      
114,4.0,                       i m going to say to hit or miss with these batteries and sometimes they may be cheaper then the home depot brand but sometimes they do run more then the home depot brand  overall they seem to last about the same amount of time if you frequently      
115,5.0,                       i have purchased nearly every size of ab batteries  they are great for everyday uses and from what i have used them for have lasted just as long as name brand  i use these d batteries primarily in flameless candles  i see no point in spending extra when these batteries last just as long      
116,3.0,                       not so great  i put these batteries in multiple things  all candles but different sizes and shapes etc  the lager candles did not make it very long    weeks tops  the smaller candles are still going for now  i m     weeks in      
117,5.0,                       thanks     
118,5.0,                         haven t used them for long  but it was nice to get a whole bunch so i could trade out all my marginal flashlights  when you just buy a   pack  it s never enough        
119,5.0,                       i love these batteries  my daughters be niece loves the swing  so we have two of the same ones   they are battery only swings  so we go threw batteries and these are great for the price  they last a good amount of time and the box they come is makes easy storage      
120,4.0,                       value for the money and it s wonderful for the flashlights     
121,1.0,                       i literally bought these batteries less than a month used them for   weeks and they just died literally      
122,5.0,                       they are d cell batteries that arrived in a nice box that you can use to store them  unlike those weird molded plastic packages that takes an act of god to get into and then is impossible to stack or store anywhere  i have bought quite a few amazonbasics products so far and i have to say i m loving amazon basics so far      
123,5.0,                       these are excellent batteries  we use them in our electric williamsburg candles at home and they are lit on a timer year round  i use them in flashlights as well and they have a long life  the last time i bought these for my williamsburg candles was last year  we keep our candles lit   hours a day  i highly recommend these amazon batteries      
124,5.0,                       they seem to work just as well as the name brand batteries  and for an excellent price  the best thing is the  frustration free  packaging  it s a breeze to remove batteries  and put them back  if you decide you don t need them  goodbye  plastic clamshell packaging      
125,5.0,                       who knew amazon made batteries  placed them in an outdoor motion detector through rain and snow and they still doing the job      
126,3.0,                       ordered these to replace all my  d  flash lights with new power  yet to see how long they last  for the money however a great buy if they last  will update if and when i find out      
127,5.0,                       can t beat for the price   have mr beams outdoor motion lights   a dozen d batteries locally would put me in the poor house   i replace all of them about once a year  and the one on my driveway that s on a lot  every time a car drives by  about   times a year   they are the high output lights and these power them for a long time      
128,5.0,                       i bought these batteries for the outside net lights i put on the bushes for christmas   i saw they were cheaper than duracell or energizer and had good ratings  so i gave them a try   i installed them in the lights and put the lights out on my bushes a week after thanksgiving   winters in the upper midwest get cold  but these batteries kept the lights going brightly every night for   hours  for a month and still have juice in them   i removed them from the lights and packed them away until next christmas   i did not check them with a meter  so i don t know how much juice is in them  but i m impressed they were able to power on in the extra cold weather we had this year      
129,5.0,                       have had good luck with the amazon batteries     
130,4.0,                       good value     
131,5.0,                       use these in our big flashlight for checking cows that are calving  out there at least twice a night  sometimses more and they hold up just as well as the name brand batteries      
132,5.0,                       i just love amazon basics line      this line has great priced  durable items   i now will only buy these batteries as they work perfect and are so affordable   my family of five with three kids go through batteries fast and i needed a solution and amazon saved me   i now have a batteries box for the family whenever they needed batteries there are plenty   the packaging was perfect too  just the right size and easy to open   no more difficult plastic packages u would have to have a box cutter for anymore        
133,5.0,                       i don t think i will ever buy duracell or engergizer again  i find these batteries just as good and they are much cheaper      
134,5.0,                       i ve purchased   other sizes of same brand  they work well and last long  would buy again      
135,1.0,                       batteries are old dead     
136,5.0,                       good product at a good competitive price      
137,5.0,                       these work well and last about a week and a half in my led candles  i leave them on round the clock  would purchase these batteries again      
138,5.0,                       good     
139,5.0,                       i bought these for my two grandsons and their new nerf guns with the battery operated magazine  batteries lasted through several nerf wars and still going      
140,1.0,                       these do not last long at all  very disappointed  i ll go back to name brand batteries even though more expensive  it will be a much greater value      
141,1.0,                       i was super excited when i saw the price for    batteries so i ordered more than i needed it s disappointing to say these batteries does not last long  it also rust easily i bought it for my portable lamp  which i used as a night light sometimes  the battery only lasted for   week waste of money in my opinion to sum it up      
142,5.0,                       value     
143,5.0,                       both of my boat live wells hold   d cells  both wells are identical  i put copper tops in one and these amazon batteries in the other  the wells always turned on and off at the same time  normally my copper tops last     trips  this amazon batteries lasted about    minutes longer than the cooper tops  i then rotated the batteries in the wells  and the same with amazon batteries last about    minutes longer in the other live well  considering the price of copper tops will be using amazon batteries in the future  i use other types of batteries in my home remotes etc   and i had always thought they lasted longer  this was the real test      
144,5.0,                       great price and product     
145,5.0,                       these arrived very quickly  but it will take time to see if they hold their charge      
146,5.0,                       we used these in our babies swing every day  they lasted for over   months  great batteries      
147,4.0,                       several of the batteries  the positive pin is slightly longer  this made it difficult to get in battery boxes where it is very tight  all batteries have lasted as long as other brands in a high drain portable fan      
148,5.0,                       as expected good batteries     
149,5.0,                       good value  longevity remains to be seen      
150,3.0,                       really hoping that these were going to be close to as good as name brands   was on a hunting trip and running sets of   d cells in streamlight lanterns   all three lanterns were running low and swapped out batteries for all three at the same time   one lantern got a set of energizers that had been laying around for about   years  one got a set of duracells that had been around for about the same length of time  and the third lantern got a set of the amazon basics that were less than a year old within two days the lantern with the amazon basics was already showing the first level of depletion  green light    orange light    red light    blinking red light    within another evening of use it was to the red light   both of the other sets were still on green the whole time      
151,2.0,                       these batteries do not last any longer than dollar store batteries  i have purchased several packages of different sizes because the quality is so great however i will not be purchasing any more of the amazon batteries they just do not last nearly as long     
152,5.0,                       the price was good for the many batteris that was sold per carton   great price    order again when i need more      
153,5.0,                       good value     
154,5.0,                       good batteries  i dunno what else one could say about batteries  they work      
155,5.0,                       si     
156,5.0,                       thanks amazon for saving us money on batteries  nice substitution for energizer     
157,5.0,                       great item for hurricane prepping   i was prepared for hurricane florence      
158,5.0,                       for the price these batteries are great  having three kids in the house comes with having tons of toys  the majority of the toys all require some sort of batteries  we go through so many  these last really long  we also put these into our camping lanterns which all take d batteries  they last a really long time  i will continue to purchase these amazon batteries     
159,5.0,                       these worked great   great value for the money   cheaper than other brands and work just as well      
160,5.0,                       great quality and value switched to buying this brand      
161,5.0,                       during storms our electricity tends to cut off so  i make sure i m stocked up on batteries for my lanterns and flashlights  my lanterns take   d batteries and i only buy amazon s brand cause the are just as good  if not better than energizer and duracell  etc   they are the most cost effective as well  everytime  i ve ordered they have been delivered the next day      
162,5.0,                       work great and for long time     
163,3.0,                       i use them for my   cell led flashlight i use for outdoors working at night  doesn t last very long     
164,4.0,                       i am works good for the price     
165,1.0,                       i use d size batteries for my auto cat feeders  the feeders cycle same time everyday  the energy consumption is consistent  in tried these amazon batteries as an alternative to energizer  amazon batteries didn t even last half as long as energizer      
166,5.0,                       while i prefer rayovac  these work surprisingly well   arrived in cardboard box  no fancy packaging which is fine as far as my family is concerned   batteries tested out and all work   this is the first time i ve tried them   so far  so good      
167,4.0,                       thank you     
168,5.0,                       i buy all my batteries from amazon now  great price and fast delivery   i ve not noticed any performance differences  better or  inferior  to  name brand  premium ones  in other words  they are just as good and lasting   thus  price is the deal   the  d  cells are used for an electronic rat death trap and they work great  i ve gotten up to    executions per battery set        
169,5.0,                       bought these to have before hurricane irma hit florida   they didn t arrive until after the hurricane   luckily they weren t needed   however  i am going to keep them on hand since we need to have emergency equipment readily available  and these batteries boast of a   year shelf life   i m hoping to never need them but i m happy to know that i have them on hand      
170,4.0,                       good productfair price     
171,5.0,                       still the best value there is  and we ve had good success with the longevity of the batteries      
172,1.0,                       batteries were definitely weak   loaded some in a flashlight  and loaded some in a battery operated vac   both units were sluggish   i threw out the box and didn t bother to return them   i don t believe they were fresh will order a name brand in the future      
173,5.0,                       for what they look like and the price they last a very long time and are very strong      
174,5.0,                       usually i get my batteries at the grocery store or a big box place  but with the pandemic i m ordering online more  i always try to get the best deal regardless  i thought i was saving money with another brand  but those batteries  only lasted less than a week  i decided to try the amazon basics brand and these are seriously long lasting  i m using the size d for an air purifier and they just keep going  i decided  to splurge and buy a big box so i don t have to worry about buying them for a year or more  buying in bulk makes them about the same price as the other brand  very happy with these      
175,4.0,                       they don t last long with baby swings but are cheap compared to other brands     
176,3.0,                       these batteries were priced like other batteries i ve used  but did not perform as well   i only purchased them because there was a note that by spending a certain amount there would be no charge for shipping   the notice was completely deceiving because i really had to buy amazon prime to get the  free  shipping which was not free at all at     per month   i don t buy that often and felt deceived by the notice      
177,4.0,                       while the batteries are a good price  they don t last as long as brand name batteries  i m having to replace them more often  also  the packaging is terrible  they are tightly shrink wrapped in hard to open cellophane that i need scissors for  the box comes in   rows of six  and i have to cut each battery out  i don t see what s wrong with just placing them in easier to open packaging      
178,2.0,                       can t beat the price  however when using   at a time for my portable led spot light i ve already gone through    in under   months  i am considering buying named brand even though they are far more expensive to see if they last longer in the dead of winter in new england      
179,1.0,                       great price  but they dont last long      
180,5.0,                       a great battery  i have replaced brand name batteries with these and found these lasted longer      
181,3.0,                       won t last as long as name brand      
182,5.0,                       longevity     
183,5.0,                       good battery     
184,5.0,                       when you live in hurricane country  having a reliable source of power for lanterns and fans is a must   these batteries have proved their worth many times over      
185,5.0,                       hands down  least cost battery source with equal quality  no brainier      
186,5.0,                       got this to work with portable motion lights in the backyard  i am pretty impressed on how long they last  also in the harsh cold winters the batteries worked great with not loss of power     
187,5.0,                       these batteries work great a a fraction of the price of the name brands      
188,3.0,                       amazon batteries are just fine  cheap and they last long enough  i have a house full of flameless candles  so when i change all the batteries it s a project  their claim of  frustration free packaging  however  is a horrible joke  open the box and you ll find every two batteries separately sealed  that s   more packages to open  in a hard plastic which both scissors and teeth find challenging  just when you get a piece of the plastic ripped free  thinking this will finally help unravel the batteries     nope  the hard plastic breaks off and you ve only released one battery  ugh         do better amazon      
189,5.0,                       i was telling my hubby how my son uses his alexa to order things  like batteries  the next think i knew    doz  d  batteries arrived   be careful what you say around her  lol     
190,5.0,                       good batteries     
191,5.0,                       these batteries are a good value they last as long as any batteries on the market  i have tested them  would buy again      
192,3.0,                       these batteries are fine  the issue i have is that they in the  frequently bought together  with a motion sensing garbage can  so i assumed they must be the correct size for the garbage can  nope  the garage can takes c  not the d s  i will make sure i look better before purchasing the recommendations      
193,1.0,                       i left them in my trailer over the winter and they were all dead  other batteries  including some well known chinese units were still fine  disappointed in these      
194,2.0,                       they work  for a very short period of time  even when not being used the batteries lost their energy      
195,5.0,                       great batteries  long lasting and inexpensive      
196,5.0,                       these work great for the fans   each set of   batteries last a week with the fans running constant  great value      
197,3.0,                       i ve bought other sizes of amazon batteries in the past and have been very pleased with the quality and value   the d cells  however  didn t seem to last any longer than cheap dollar store batteries i ve bought in a pinch   maybe i received a bad batch or maybe my gut feeling about their longevity is mistaken  but other size amazon batteries have significantly outlasted cheap ones and it was very evident      
198,4.0,                       decent batteries at a decent price  they are cheaper than name brands without sacrificing quality     
199,5.0,                       no complaints here   the batteries work as intended   the work just as well as top brands      
200,5.0,                       well priced and seem to do the job well  we have some  sonic mole chasers  buried in the yard  they need replacement batteries every   months  instead of having the critters remind me of when to replace the batteries   i get a pack of these d cells sent automatically via subscribe and save    not only do i appreciate the discount  but it s a built in reminder to change the batteries on time      
201,4.0,                       can t beat the price for these size batteries for this cheap  they work and get the job done  i can t speak to the longevity because they ve only been in for about a week  but again  can t beat the price      
202,5.0,                       they seem to be okay   haven t used them too long as of this rview      
203,5.0,                       nice     
204,5.0,                       no     
205,5.0,                       first time i ve purchased this brand and purchased for my new motion light from amazon  will have to see what the longevity is with a motion light turn off and on  the price was good      
206,5.0,                       the amazon basics batteries are great   most of the batteries i buy are amazon basics   they work well  last a long time  and the price is good      
207,5.0,                       good quality batteries   the power output and longevity of these batteries in my equipment seem comparable to the rayovac and duracell alkaline cells i use  and i haven t had a single rupture or leak   out all the cells i ve used so far  every one performed well  without a single dud   for the money  i think these are the best d cells out there   and i ve tried a lot   here s my results of real world usage  most favorite  to least favorite  amazonbasics   good power output  average longevity  consistently low price rayovac   good power output  great longevity  varied price  i find good deals every few weeks    never seem to leak ikea   average power output  flickers a little   fair longevity  usually the lowest price maxell   good power output  great longevity  good price  but one in every few dozen eventually leaks duracell   good power output  great longevity  varied price  but one in every few dozen eventually leaks sunbeam   average power output  fair longevity  consistently low price  but prone to leakage energizer   inconsistent power output  some flicker a lot  some don t   average longevity  can be expensive  and seem very prone to leakage as such  i now use the amazonbasics in all of my everyday use d cell flashlights  lanterns  and motion sensors   i save the rayovacs for stuff i keep in storage  and in my emergency kits   i m currently storing a few amazonbasics to test them for leakage  and   thus far   i haven t had a single one leak   i ll update my review  as i use them further      
208,3.0,                       duracells last    year or a complete season in my  d maglite used in my rv occasionally those only   month  just put in a second set and will see my confidence level for these batteries is now very low they behave more like zinc coal instead alkaline may be amazon got tricked by chinese suppliers        
209,5.0,                       seem to work well in the application we are using them     
210,3.0,                       i have bought many types of amazonbasics batteries because they are significantly cheaper than others   in  most of my experiences the batteries have held up well and i m satisfied with them what i m not sure of is whether or not these batteries are cheaper because they have less capacity  measured in mah  which is kind of important to know   you can t compare apples to apples unless you know how much you re going to get out of a battery   so these batteries may look like a better deal than the name brand batteries because they are so cheap  but if they have   x less mah  then you re not getting a deal   do these batteries have   x less capacity than energizer or other brands    i don t know     because amazon doesn t put that information in the description   i mean  mah capacity and the price are really the only two primary metrics people need to know to compare most batteries   it s like buying a light bulb and not knowing if it s supposed to last    hours or        hours   for such basic information as that i know it s not an oversight  amazon has decided not to be forthcoming about it so it s certainly perceived as something they want to hide with that concern in mind  my personal uses for batteries don t require a lot of power   for tv remotes  air pumps  etc the amazonbasics batteries seem to last long enough to be worth it   i did notice that these batteries didn t seem to last long in a simple strand of led lights we used for christmas decorations   i think it lasted for about   weeks even though we only turned the lights on during nighttime hours   i would assume those little led lights use almost no energy but that s the only example i have where the battery life seemed shorter than expected conclusion  for heavier activity i would probably buy batteries that i knew had longer life   for simple around the house usage these work just fine      
211,5.0,                       my wife goes through quite a few of these with her back massaging pillow   good value      
212,5.0,                       no motion detection     
213,5.0,                       i bought these for my     batter powered fan  there are    batteries so my fan takes   of them and i have   extras if we have a power outage      
214,4.0,                       good to have enough batteries a round the house when necessary      
215,2.0,                       didn t last very long in my nerf blaster  disappointed and won t buy again      
216,5.0,                       use them mostly for ring light which the ring lights uses a lot of them     
217,5.0,                        nd time buying amazon basics batteries  arrived super fast and working great for my daughters swing      
218,5.0,                       last a very long time       
219,5.0,                       why would anyone go anywhere else to buy batteries  than amazon      
220,5.0,                       these batteries are great  long lasting life  my kids have tested this with their toys  and a great price as well      
221,1.0,                       amazon brand batteries are bad   they don t last  i don t understand why other people give them good reviews   do not buy   it is a waste of money      
222,3.0,                       they do not hold a charge long enough in cold weather  i m told this is a function of an alkaline battery in general but that s not my fault  amazon or someone needs to come up with solution to that problem      
223,3.0,                       they don t last but a month in an auto opening trash can lid with   c cells in it      
224,5.0,                       good price  seem to hold a charge and deliver on performance  ive tried all battery sizes   v  aaa  aa  c  and d  used for flashlights and radios for power outages  our last power outage was   days  price is right to buy in bulk      
225,2.0,                       some of the batteries arrived with partial charge straight out of the package      
226,5.0,                       i switched to the amazon brand batteries years ago because i was sick and tired of paying crazy prices for name brand  alkaline batteries   the amazon brand batteries work just as well and last just as long as the popular name brands but are less expensive   why anyone would continue to buy the popular name brands and pay more when they can get a high quality  long lasting battery amazon is beyond me   i highly recommend the amazon brand alkaline batteries in aaa  aa  c and d cell sizes   excellent quality      
227,1.0,                       do not last  honestly almost every other brand of battery has outlasted these  even eveready    every size battery i ve used from amazon has been a huge disappointment  do not buy      
228,5.0,                       great value      
229,5.0,                         amazon basic product always good for money     
230,1.0,                       i bought     for driveway motion lights  lights run for    seconds at a time based on motion  batteries didn t last    days  spend the money and get the name brand batteries  lesson learned      
231,5.0,                       as described     
232,5.0,                       great price and very convenient to add when you know you re going to need them      
233,5.0,                       these batteries appear to last as well as my past use of duracell   they may be a bit different in duration  but not that noticeable to me      
234,1.0,                       i thought that since these batteries had the amazon logo  they would be of excellent quality or at worst  regular  but no  they are very  very bad  they did not last a week in the best scenario that was in a led flashlight  i do not recommend them     
235,5.0,                       the amazon basic batteries and their i just love the size of the m        
236,5.0,                       you can t go wrong  these things work just as good as the others for way less     
237,1.0,                       they only lasted   days in my small   inch fans  duracell and energizer batteries last close to    days of continuous use   i would not recommend this to anyone      
238,5.0,                       my go to battery  performance is what i expected  easy to order and a good value  i would recommend to a family member or friend      
239,5.0,                       i needed batteries and these were a great value so i bought them     
240,1.0,                       these batteries are horrible       didn t last a week in a commercial paper towel dispenser      
241,5.0,                       better than our energizers and much cheaper        will buy again      
242,5.0,                       sure beats buying these d cell batteries at walmart or walgreens at their high prices   i have two automatic pet feeders that require   of these d cell batteries  one for my miniature schnauzer  miles  and one for my cat  polo    now when i am out of town for   or   days  i know they are being fed with these batteries powering the feeders on my programmed schedule   i also have the large automatic water feeder for both of them  plus a doggie door on my covered back patio door      
243,2.0,                       product is fine  they re batteries  not much else to say  the packaging  however    is so incredibly wasteful  the box comes with   packs of   batteries that have been shrink wrapped together  why  so unnecessary  not only is it wasteful  it can also be hard for the elderly or disabled to open  amazon  please consider changing the packaging of this        
244,1.0,                       pictures tell the story  and now i can t return  seems that a battery that has an expiration date of        should not leak acid only after two months   what a waste of money     
245,5.0,                       accidentally clicked on these because they came up in the c batteries section  but i guess they work  i don t have anything that needs d batteries but maybe one day i will      
246,5.0,                       batteries are equal to the name brands and for less money      
247,5.0,                       works for any d cell devices      
248,1.0,                       i don t know if the manufacturer making these was switched  but these amazon basic d cell batteries lasted only one day on a nation sensor  previous purchases lasted over   weeks  very disappointing to be sure   spend more on better batteries     
249,4.0,                       reasonable quality batteries  shelf life is really good  some of the batteries have not been used for years and perform well once used  the life of the battery is maybe     of some other high performing ones when brand new  good overall value  had some issues with them stopping working when we dropped flashlights  where replacing batteries made flashlights work      
250,5.0,                       arrived in a timely manner and packaged perfectly for storing them in a small easily accessible cardboard box  i use these batteries exclusively for my touch free trash can      
251,4.0,                    buenas pero no duran tanto como otras marcas alcalinas        
252,1.0,                       i tried these a second time thinking the first pair was a bad batch  these are terrible  amazon should really stop selling these  period  they last for maybe about     of the time of the industrial duracells      
253,2.0,                       i purchased these for work   i was told by our staff that all of the amazon batteries that i have purchased have been bad   they don t last long at all   i tried to save the company money by buying the generic brand  but it totally backfired on me this time   i wish i had known about the issue before it was too late to return      
254,5.0,                       i love amazons batteries  i have them in monthly subscriptions so i am never forgetting which battery needs picked up and thats if i remember to add them to shopping list      
255,3.0,                       update   nd box on last of the  nd box           our lanterns are appearing to die more quickly with this last box purchased these get my vote  these are just as good as the  rabbit  or  copper  batteries  we are using these in our lanterns      
256,5.0,                       so far so good  i use them in my aerator in my fish box and my tactical flashlight  a lot of batteries take a crap after   months now      
257,5.0,                       amazon is killing it with its battery business  they last as long as the big boy s batteries at a much cheaper price  i ve switched to amazon batteries a long time ago and don t see myself buying anything else  great job amazon      
258,1.0,                       i have a rowing machine that uses d batteries  when i use duracell batteries the computer for the rower is fine but each time i have used these i have trouble with bluetooth and get error messages  i won t order again      
259,5.0,                       we use these batteries for the office     
260,5.0,                       not quite as long lasting as the top two brands  but a much lower price  they are a good  price to value combination      
261,1.0,                       batteries lasted like three minutes in my flashlight then died  i put some in my fan and they leaked and ruined it      
262,5.0,                       well worth the money which is cheaper than name brands      
263,4.0,                       can save lots of money by using a rechargeable batteries     
264,5.0,                       just as good as the more expensive ones and great value for the money  i have no qualms about them      
265,1.0,                       received the batteries and they were all dead  i went to the store to buy new batteries and the product worked      
266,5.0,                       all the amazon batteries we ve purchased have worked great  and at low prices   we are still stuck with batteries for some things and while that holds true we will use amazon s      
267,2.0,                       the hold up fine  but they ate slightly larger than brand name batteries  the positive side is a bit longer than on other batteries  this is not as problem for man devices  but at least on one device i have  it is  the batteries go on fine  but are very difficult to remove  i need a screwdriver to pry the first one out      
268,5.0,                       i use flameless candles on a timer so occassionally i need to change the batteries  i like to have them ahead so that when i need them i have them available  i have bought several types of batteries from amazon and have never been disappointed      
269,4.0,                       since i just received these within the last few weeks  it is hard to judge longevity  but they seem fine      
270,5.0,                       great price for a quality product   haven t had the batteries that long  but after reading the reviews i knew i would be happy with my purchase   nice to know when you see the name amazonbasics you can count on the quality plus a great price   bought amazon led light bulbs  again  quality you can trust      
271,5.0,                       works well   and no problems recharging at all      
272,5.0,                       can t beat the price and they last a long time      
273,3.0,                       not really satisfied with these batteries second time i ordered these  loses charge too quick    don t last long      
274,5.0,                       worth it to order  much better then name brand batteries      
275,5.0,                       bought this and did a side by side comparison for named brand batteries  performed the exactly the same as the name brand batteries  i like to have battery operated candles in my house with timers  placed the batteries in the candles and the amazon brand lasted the same   months the higher priced batteries lasted  buying again now      
276,5.0,                       i only gave   stars on longevity and motion detection because i haven t used them yet     
277,5.0,                       excellent value      
278,5.0,                         i love amazon batteries and the price you get for your money is great      
279,4.0,                       these batteries are great  just load them into a sock and you got yoself a prison        or you could just put them in something that needs batteries  either way  they do the job      
280,5.0,                       came on time  well packaged and very good value  very pleased      
281,5.0,                       great value for the money     
282,5.0,                       purchased for lanterns for a camping trip  batteries have along usage and are great for the price and ease      
283,5.0,                       these batteries work great and are long lasting  i use them in my sons rock play chair and they last about     weeks each  sometimes my husband leaves the chair on overnight and it doesn t seem to hinder them      
284,1.0,                       i live in the country where flashlights are in constant use  i bought these hoping to save some money  what a colossal waste of money  they come out of the box dead      
285,5.0,                       better than those available from the local hardware stores recommend it santa ray     
286,4.0,                       liked the fast delivery and used for toys     
287,5.0,                       good product  good value as advertised      
288,5.0,                       what can i say  they re batteries and they last a long time      
289,5.0,                       seems ok     
290,1.0,                       we replace batteries in a device once a year at most  these did not last a month  when they were removed i noticed they fell over on counter  they are deformed and egg shaped on both the top and bottom  upon further inspection  all the batteries were deformed  terrible quality  not worth the savings      
291,2.0,                       i purchased these specifically for my grand daughter s baby swing  i got   refills out of the    pack    each  refill  only lasted about     hours        
292,5.0,                       wonderful power packed investment  using these outdoor inside motion sensing lights  survived southwest heat  winter tests to follow  ohh rains are beaten as well by these batteries      
293,5.0,                       batteries work great and are lasting  i love that when you order a product  you re given the option to have the correct size batteries that actually last added on to your order just like that      
294,1.0,                       i tried these on electronic mouse traps  each set of four batteries per trap was dead after three kills  name brand batteries give me anywhere from at least    to as many as    kills per set  these amazon d cells are not good value      
295,5.0,                       they re batteries  why do you need a review for batteries  they re all the same  man      
296,4.0,                       i searched for and was comparing rechargeable batteries  amazon had this listed as the first non ad slot and i did not pay enough attention when i bought them    but i needed batteries so i did not send them back  they worked about as well as can be expected  but they should never have been in that search when i was specifically searching for rechargeable batteries  might be my fault  but i am still annoyed      
297,1.0,                       these are low capacity batteries  because they are d cell size  they take up a lot of storage space  best to use the space for a better capacity battery  even at twice the price of these  you get reliable larger capacity      
298,5.0,                       awesome batteries     
299,5.0,                       great value  great batteries  super fast shipping     
300,2.0,                       i generally only buy reusable batteries however i don t have too many devices that use d batteries  i gave this a shot and regretted it  they just didn t hold up to the test of time      
301,5.0,                       this is my second order   i like special lighting and use these c size batteries which are very dependable   i also like the little storage box and the packaging   they stay secure in the container      
302,5.0,                       good quality packaging and product looks solid and best price for the same product     
303,4.0,                       i hate the packaging on the amazon batteries so much that i have decided to go with another brand until the packaging changes  there is no need to package the batteries up in plastic wrap that is difficult to remove and then put them inside a tightly fit box  just do away with the plastic already      
304,2.0,                       they work  but they don t last long at all   it is surprising how fast these burn out no matter where i used them      
305,5.0,                       you know there s only a couple of battery manufacturers  so these are made by the big guys  just painted a different color  these last as long as the silver or copper colored one  i haven t had any problems like leaking  and they save me         
306,1.0,                       was buying because they are cheap   but since they are made in china i will never buy again   back to duracell or a battery made in any other country but china      
307,4.0,                       good product for the money      
308,4.0,                       it looks like it s about a battery case too and filled it up     
309,3.0,                       these batteries don t last as long as the better brands  but they do the trick  the price was right so i loaded up a little  its your base level battery      
310,4.0,                       can never have enough batteries these days for cya      
311,5.0,                       these d cell batteries sprout legs at my house   we use them every time the power fails   grand babies leave the flashlights on   i just can t get enough of them   when they go on super sale  i buy them      
312,5.0,                       use in motion lights

315,5.0,                       ordered these by mistake  thought i was ordering rechargeable batteries   i have had them in the flashlights for awhile and they seem to be doing fine      
316,2.0,                       value is good but lasted like   hours max

320,5.0,                       as good as any and a better price     
321,5.0,                       this line of amazon batteries is excellent   i have used various sizes  and they seem just as good as the name brand      
322,5.0,                       i bought these batteries for a fan  i leaned the hard way that everything i have in my house is operated by electricity  i lost power a month ago and boy oh boy it got so hot in my house  i had nothing to cool me off  so i bought a fan that is operated by batteries and electric in case i ever lose power again  i have only used the fan a couple of times but each time i used it to see if the batteries work  the fan works great which means the batteries are not going dead  the price is was sold me  i tried the amazon basics and so far i m happy      
323,5.0,                       so much cheaper than costco and they seem to store better and last longer      
324,1.0,                       i always thought amazon carry quality product  but this is not the case with those d batteries  only last about half of the alkaline personally i think alkaline is the best battery  i ve also tried energizer  but alkaline just last longer    amazon basics is about     comparing to energizer     comparing to alkalinei am not trying to recommend any brand  just a fishermen who uses those battery constantly on a air pump  so  usage is also constantly  i know how many fishing trips they last      
325,2.0,                       i received the box of d batteries in what appeared to be a sealed box from the factory  when i opened the box there were only    batteries    sleeve of   and   sleeve cut open with   battery missing  seems it was shipped that way  you should replace it but i won t hold my breath      
326,2.0,                       i am slightly disappointed in the fact that i was using these batteries for a circuit lab for my classroom science activity and the batteries were very weak as if they were old  i had to go to wal mart and by some durcell batteries to continue with the lesson  i m not sure how long these batteries were sitting in a wearhouse but they were pretty useless      
327,1.0,                       i am using these batteries in my christmas garland and i have to change them out every day   these do not last      
328,5.0,                       these stay on the shelf for long periods of time and have never had an issue with a dead battery right away  great for parents with kids

331,5.0,                       i placed   batteries in auto rotating light xmas tree on dec  th   the tree is over    and has over    lights  it lasted until jan   th  low lights but still illuminated  i was shocked by the time istremained  these batteries exceed store purchased any day      
332,5.0,                       last as long as any other and they are priced somewhat less than the named brands      
333,5.0,                       these get the job done  i m using them for a hotwheel s racetrack for my son  and they work  pretty much similar to most no names  but backed with amazon s great return policy      
334,5.0,                       great value for the price  i needed lots of these to take to the bahamas after hurricane dorian to run all of the fans that i also bought on amazon     
335,5.0,                       basic alkaline batteries that work well  they last as long as the more expensive alkaline batteries     
336,5.0,                       didn t last very long      
337,4.0,                       listed as   years  but the actual date on the batteries is        so closer to   years for this batch   good price  and should be ok for my use  but compared to the    year shelf life of major brands  not so good      
338,5.0,                       works great and works well with the  d cell mag light  and is a great value per battery

343,1.0,                       i just opened and tried these batteries and they are all dead      
344,5.0,                       amazon batteries are amazing  i had aaa in my fire stick remote for   years and used it every day      
345,5.0,                       hurricane batteries  whoo hoo  good value     
346,5.0,                       amazon batteries  really  well  yes   i tried them in several devices    flashlights  portable radio  and especially in outdoor motion detector flood lights    and then forgot about them  today i just put in new sets of batteries in my flood lights after    months of nightly service in illuminating my front and back doors  twenty months  not bad  amazon  not bad      
347,5.0,                       can t beat the price  i bought these batteries   years ago when there was a hurricane   our power went out and  my battery operated fan saved me from the heat  the batteries lasted the   days we were without power   fast forward to today   we are about to get hit with a hurricane so i re ordered these batteries and they are getting here just in time  i still have juice in the battery i got  yrs ago   just wanted a back up incase they die on me      
348,5.0,                       these batteries have been going for almost   months now after using them every night since i bought them      
349,5.0,                       batteries work great  i keep a supply on hand so when i need batteries i have them      
350,4.0,                       good batteries  ok price  i found that i can buy batteries cheaper at the     cent store  the box they ship it in is nice and i reuse it to hold the batteries i buy from the     cent store  they last about the same  if you don t have a     cent store near you or if they don t carry batteries  then i would recommend these amazonbasics batteries  much cheaper and does the same job as the name brand ones      
351,5.0,                       was missing some     
352,5.0,                       perfect quality and best for daily use     
353,2.0,                       i don t believe that these last any longer in storage or in use than grocery store batteries     
354,1.0,                       i don t know how these were stored or how old they were   these are really poor maybe     of a charge  i would never buy these again

358,1.0,                       these batteries were awful  i bought these to take camping to blow up two very small air mattresses twin to be exact and had to use all twelve just to fill them  i could have used dollar store batteries and spent way less than almost         these are junk don t buy them save your money         
359,5.0,                       i have   motion lights in my house that use these batteries price   quality are good

361,5.0,                       good value for general use  don t use for motion detection      
362,5.0,                       low output good for remotes but not so good for rx cars and higher output devices     
363,4.0,                       i use these in a pair of flashlights and in a desktop radio   i have been pleased with the performance      
364,1.0,                       junk   i bought these for a canada fishing trip to use for the minnow aerators   normal copper top batteries will run for about    hours and i will not have to worry about the minnows dying from lack of oxygen   these pos s did not even last    hours and i had lots of dead minnows   do not use  purchase these if you need the batteries to last for any extended period of time      
365,1.0,                       i have had nothing but problems with these batteries from day one  i don t know if it is the batteries or the charger but they have never held a full charge  i complained about the charger and the seller was kind enough to send me a new charger but the same   error  keeps appearing to the point that i never know if my batteries are charged or not  they are also very hot to the touch when i take them out of the charger   i thought i was doing the right thing for the environment by using rechargeable batteries but it looks like i will have to go back to using regular batteries  i am very disappointed and would never recommend these batteries to anyone      
366,5.0,                       amazon got these to me so quickly   i was concerned that i hadn t been able to find batteries for my flashlights in advance of an approaching hurricane   fortunately  i didn t need them after all   it is so easy to get things from amazon   i thanks to everyone there who makes it work so well      
367,2.0,                       batteries leaked in a fan i used them in  thankfully caught it early enough before it damaged the fan or the floor it was on  but then i went to get a few of the ones i had saved to replace the leaky ones  and they all were swollen  i had them stored in a drawer that i always keep batteries in  alongside many other non amazonbasics batteries that are all just fine  so not an environmental thing  just poorly made  wish i could return them at this point but oh well  going to find a place to recycle them because i don t just want to throw away leaky  swollen batteries      
368,5.0,                       good     
369,1.0,                       any parent of a toddler goes through an insane amount of batteries   we thought amazon batteries would be a great alternative to more expensive name brands   unfortunately  amazon batteries die twice as fast as name brand batteries  if not faster   not only making them more expensive but producing twice the waste and recycling   hope amazon gets its act together   until then  we will stick with duracell or energizer        
370,5.0,                       i love amazon batteries  they last a long time and the price is decent      
371,5.0,                       what a great idea subscribe and save with these batteries for those of you who have been through hurricanes most recently irma you know how hard it can be to get supplies at the last minute subscribe and save     every two to three months by this time next year you ve got plenty of supplies for very little money     
372,5.0,                       can you fast and just what i needed     
373,5.0,                       having kids requires always having batteries ready for all the toys   but batteries are expensive but these amazon basic brand batteries are great   the last as long as the name brand batteries   i have no issue with corrosion like some keep batteries will leak acid   i get these with my monthly subscribe and save order  as well so the extra     off makes it even a better product      
374,5.0,                       premium product at a fair price         
375,5.0,                       gets the job done at an affordable price

377,5.0,                       great price and arrived sooner then expected  so much easier to add these with the purchase i needed them for then having to get them somewhere else  i ve been using them for a few weeks and i ve had no problems with them      
378,5.0,                       great price  great product  will always purchase amazon basic batteries        
379,5.0,                       for the price of these batteries  i cant find a complaint  we buy all our batteries from amazon  with a newborn and a toddler  we go through a lot of batteries  but these work just as good as any battery we ve tried      
380,5.0,                       i wanted to try these out bc they had such good reviews  will have to check back and tell you how the longevity is bc i just bought them the first of the month      
381,5.0,                       back up box of batteries are great to have when needed  affordable unlike some places      
382,5.0,                       i used these batteries to power a motion activated light at the corner of my house and over my garage  i installed the light and the first set of batteries in april       i live in a climate with intense summer heat  in the hundreds  and cold winters  freezing temperatures during   months   the lamps and their batteries worked a lot  cats  squirrels  mailman  guests and us  the lasted until december        they still work but they are at the end of their lifespan   they are great value for the money      
383,5.0,                       i love amazon  i love their products and i know when i buy from them it s the best quality and i can trust them  these d batteries are great  well made  last long  works perfect  i also love their storage box that came with it  it s strong  easy to close and it has   rows divided  i can keep my batteries safe and not mixed around  i also purchased other types of batteries from amazon and they are all amazing      
384,5.0,                       obviously i bought these batteries due to the price   so far  i am satisfied with the length of time they are lasting   i will be looking at the shelf life soon since i haven t had to change any out yet      
385,5.0,                       great product at a great price       
386,4.0,                       great batteries for price  love you get more for your money on amazon  will order batteries off amazon from now on      
387,1.0,                       do not buy these batteries  they are cheap for a reason  i bought these for a friend who then installed them in multiple items  including her sons turtle nightlight which he d had since birth and he cherished  also  i bought that nightlight for him so i m rather attached to it myself  well these pos batteries promptly deteriorated and corroded to the extent that the night light ceased to function  these batteries are garbage  don t buy them  if you ve already bought them  return them  if you can t return them  throw them in the garbage so they don t destroy things you do care about      
388,2.0,                       dont last long at all     
389,5.0,                       just as great as your top brands  long lasting  durable and  ery affordable      
390,1.0,                       we mainly use these in outside motion activated lights  other brands last through the whole winter  these have already had to be changed multiple times this winter and it s still january this is really difficult since we have to get up on a ladder  in the snow  i ll pay more and get better battery life in the future      
391,5.0,                       seem to be working just fine     
392,5.0,                       works as expected and great price      
393,5.0,                       these batteries cost    a piece  now where do you buy batteries that price  i m a fisherman and their the only batteries i use  they run my bait buckets  flashlights  clocks  gas transfer pump and  many other things      
394,5.0,                       seems to last i use for my outdoor security light     
395,2.0,                       bought a box of     must of got a bad batch  the first   didn t last long at all  on my second set of   hoping these are good i love amazon and it hurts to say something negative about them  however we have to let them know what s good and what s not      
396,5.0,                       battery lasts long  perfect for what i was looking for      
397,5.0,                       i ve bought quite a few of these over the last few months  something like    of them  no issues on any of them  they re the cheapest d cells i could find and they work  they re packaged well      
398,5.0,                       a great deal compared to namebrands      
399,5.0,                       great batteries     
400,4.0,                       i like that i don t have to go to the store and get batteries that are going to last the same amount of time     
401,5.0,                       great buy i need it for my baby fisher price bouncer     
402,5.0,                       we have luminara candles all over the house   these batteries last   months      
403,5.0,                       despite the price  these aren t  budget  batteries that loose power quickly  instead  these are very long lasting and just a good value  i also appreciated amazon t no fuss packaging  so there was no struggle opening the box and putting the batteries right to use      
404,1.0,                       bought five different types of batteries and the d  c  and  volt did not have the full five year shelf life remaining   that s the problem   paid for five years and didn t get it   also the comparison of batteries compared your batteries with all the ten year shelf life batteries    not a true comparison at all    in fact misleading    like comparing a five year old car to a ten year old car    bad product comparison and not what was paid for   wasn t worth it to have to pay shipping to return batteries in order to get an exchange  unhappy      
405,5.0,                       i buy all of my batteries from amazon      
406,5.0,                       good as any other batteries      
407,3.0,                       they do not last as long as the pricier brands  you get what you pay for here      
408,3.0,                       batteries appeared to die a bit faster than competitor brands  probably would just pay the extra couple bucks and buy the name brands from somewhere else      
409,5.0,                       i mean they work   better than the rayovacs   not much else to say   heavy too lol      
410,5.0,                       we go through batteries quickly at my house  remotes  kids toys  adult toys  smoke detectors  etc  i have tried the expensive batteries  but we seem to use them up just as fast  using these batteries seem to be the best value for my money  never had a problem with them      
411,5.0,                       this is my  th order is of d batteries from amazon  they last longer than some of the big name batteries      
412,4.0,                       these batteries work fine but don t seem to last as long as the other name brand batteries      
413,4.0,                       i purchased these batteries to power my baby s toy  these batteries seem to work great  based on the reviews  i was a bit worried about purchasing a bunch of batteries that could be duds  then i looked at the reviews more in detail and realized that most of the bad reviews were from a few years ago  amazon must have fixed their issues since then some things i noted are that    these are not rechargeable  if you want rechargeable batteries  you should purchase the amazon basics rechargeable batteries    there s not much of a price difference between these amazon basics batteries     pack  and the energizer max d     pack   at the time of this writing  there s only a    cent difference  amazon basics           energizer max        if you want a brand name  you may as well go for energizer max    a duracell   pack          is only approximately    cents less than the amazon basics    pack          overall  these batteries work fine  if you don t need a brand name batteries  you should just purchase these      
414,5.0,                       they re batteries  they work and they re priced well  what else can be said      
415,5.0,                       they re batteries  they work

418,5.0,                       we have three of these lights around our chicken coop outside and they work great  they even pick up when the cat walks by at night  bright light  responsive motion sensing and easy to install      
419,5.0,                       was in the path of hurrican dorian and this product saved us  all the store shelves here in florida were empty  arrived in   day  will definitely be buying more and would recommend to anyone      
420,5.0,                       just great  very cheap for the quality      
421,1.0,                       they don t last  the battery life is very short  not reliable      
422,5.0,                       works great in my d cell maglight  buying in bulk is wonderful because of spring summer thunderstorms and in winter for long term outage  i have plenty on hand to keep prepared      
423,4.0,                       batteries seem ok  but they are shrink wrapped in hard plastic film which is very difficult to remove  takes a knife or some other kind of blade  and then one risks cutting oneself  couldn t a different kind of plastic film could be used just as cheaply      
424,1.0,                       unfortunately  i ordered two boxes of these worthless batteries  they do not last more than     weeks  bad investment  tossing them out  very disappointed      
425,5.0,                       many uses     
426,1.0,                       i used these as a replacement for duracell batteries in my newborn s swing   the duracells lasted   months and these batteries barely lasted a week   we did not use the swing anymore than usual and the only thing that changed was the batteries   pay a little extra and get better batteries      
427,5.0,                       i use these  to me they are economical  expensive ones may last longer but i do not see much difference as you have make sure batteries do not just set in the unit and go bad  for a number of reason i am comfortable buying this brand     
428,5.0,                       i don t use many things that require d cell batteries  but i needed them for an automatic pet feeder i bought  they do what they re made to do and have been supplying the feeder with the power it needs when the building s power goes out  so i don t have to worry about my cats starving to death     thanks      
429,4.0,                       i buy the amazon brand batteries and most of the time they match up with the name brands for a lot less cash  who can tell if they last longer or shorter  i m not sitting there measuring how long my smoke detector works      
430,5.0,                       these alkaline and do last better than others  price is right and i like the packaging      
431,5.0,                       these things last forever    i have luminara candles in my salon that take   d batteries each  it can get expensive   i tried amazon basics and those candles are on about      hours a day  at least   days a week  i change the batteries about every other month or so   don t waste your money on  name brand    save it and get the same  if not better  quality of product      
432,4.0,                       my first impression is that they are good batteries   i purchased several sizes  aa  aaa  d etc  and have used them in kids toys and flashlights  battery life seems good  nothing has failed so far   based upon other reviews i checked them over and all seem to be manufactured correctly   these look different from older reviews so i m thinking they are  new and improved  the area for improvement is the packaging  i know  minor detail   while i like the cardboard sleeve that they come in  the batteries themselves are shrink wrapped in plastic into groups of     depends on size    the sleeve is fragile and now i just have a pile of loose batteries  a mix of shrink wrapped and loose ones    it would be nice if the cardboard sleeve served as something to store   organize   dispense them  like pez candy   the bottom edge of the box needs to open   not the side   duck tape to the rescue so far  yes i d buy them again  although i still use name branded  v in the fire alarms      
433,1.0,                       i put these batteries in the core lantern i bought  i used the lantern two times and the batteries leaked and ruined the lantern  not i good product      
434,4.0,                       good batteries for money   they last pretty good      
435,1.0,                       spent   hours changing out batteries just to find out all these batteries are  low or dead  straight out of the package  want my money back      
436,5.0,                       great     
437,5.0,                       great for an easy install without hardwiring       
438,5.0,                       they are batteries    what can i say      
439,1.0,                       these batteries have no life in them  we normally use duracell in our christmas decorations and they last the whole season  we ve had to replace the amazon basics d cells we used this year   times   definitely not a good value when you use   times as many to do the same job      
440,5.0,                       fits perfect   worked like it should     no issues at all with quality      would by again     
441,3.0,                       i love amazonbasics products but looks like i should step back a little especially for these batteries  last time i ordered and was having same problem when i opened this box  every piece of these batteries were having battery level     or less      
442,5.0,                       i was very happy with my first order of amazon aa batteries    especially the price    that i ordered them again along with c and d batteries   wonderful of amazon to have their own brand   they are great batteries     
443,1.0,                       thought i would try the amazon brand because they offered more value  instead i got a pack of size d batteries that were all dead on arrival  unfortunately it took me two months to realize the issue was not in my watch winder but in the batteries  finally purchased some energizers and the device works fine   will think twice before buying the amazon batteries again      
444,5.0,                       there is a guy on youtube that tested many batteries and for the money  amazon basics give you the best bang for the buck  duracell scored well for a longer charge but for the cost  these won  i use d  aa and aaa over duracell now  excellent battery        
445,4.0,                       these d sized batteries are a good value  they do not last as long as some other brands but are adequate at a good price  i use them in a camping fan and old style radio for pulling in distant signals  over the summer i went through a set of batteries in each which is decent life for these batteries      
446,5.0,                       you can t miss by buying these batteries  they are great  i ve had them in a battery operated garland for the entire holiday and they re still running strong  the price you can t beat  worth every penny      
447,5.0,                       great value for the money  i ll always buy amazon basics batteries      
448,1.0,                         of amazonbasics d cell     volt everyday alkaline batteries   pack of     appearance may vary please take this item off auto deliver  i sent this and other items to bobby morrison       westover rd as a one time purchase   he does not want the batteries and i do not want to continue to paying for them      
449,5.0,                       batteries and they work as they should and save a substantial amount over the duracell or energizer  the batteries seem to be long lasting in various items  will purchase again      
450,5.0,                       my family has been buying these and using them for years they work great     
451,5.0,                       i m sure they work well enough gave them as part of a gift so again im not sure yet       
452,5.0,                       have no idea how i lived before discovering your auto delivery on batteries  i live back in a small farming community and off the grid and depend on my motion lights for safety and security being home alone so often  all use d batteries and my inside power outage lights also use aaa d batteries and amazon brand saves the day  or night as it were  due to so many power outages and my pets to also be able to see while outside  this is a wonderful service  often gift batteries to other friends to spread the word of price and quality  huge thanks for my safety net for lighting and more  great shipping and customer service  a          
453,5.0,                       the batteries in the motion sensor light is good  it s been   months and the battery still has life

455,5.0,                       fast service great price      
456,5.0,                       awesome product  thank you      
457,1.0,                       i happened to check the batteries  and found  they burst open under normal temperatures and would have ruined the device  had i not found  it  will go back to battery brand batteries     
458,1.0,                       i used these in my baby swing  it was very easy to tell the quality in something we use so much i first used duracell  and the batteries lasted about a month  maybe a little over   i tried these  and i was lucky to get a weeks use out of them  usually about   days  very disappointing  after the pack was gone  i told my husband to pick up more duracell batteries on his way home from work      weeks ago    and they are still going strong if you re using a lot of juice  don t bother with the amazon ones      
459,5.0,                       looks as expected  works as expected     
460,5.0,                       i purchased these as a less expensive option for a small light and fan that we took camping   the batteries lasted the whole camping trip  and we had the fan on all night in the tent  and the light for a couple hours every night   these worked just as well as the more expensive batteries      
461,5.0,                       great    they rere duracell        
462,5.0,                       seem to work like most batteries did not really test side by side to others so cant really say what life is like on them      
463,5.0,                       i buy these for home or work and you can t beat the price they work as well as any other brand battery i haven t noticed that a lose power or  die  faster than more expensive batteries  give them a try      
464,1.0,                       batteries were used for christmas small strand lights and different candles   never lasted more than a week and were only turned on at night for maybe   hours   just not worth the aggravation to replace   or   times during christmasseason   will not purchase again
