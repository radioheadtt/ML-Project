0,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       after a fairly in depth search  ordered this stroller and am quite happy with it  so far it s ideal for my two girls   newborn and     year old  what i like the most is how well it suits kids with this age difference   it has a few full seat options for my older daughter  some double strollers have a small bench or standing option only which would be great  if the older child was maybe     vs      here are some pics of the two configurations we ve used so far it s also fairly lightweight as double strollers go and easy to push  it folds flat if you remove some of the trays canopies and fits easily into the back of my suv   a jeep compass   which is not overly large      
1,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       fits the trunk of a honda fit if you remove the front tray and canopy edit  after months using it i can review it better   pros the build is sturdy enough  and the back seat is great for older children to sleep because it reclines so much almost horizontally   cons  it is really heavy to lift  and long to make turns or stroll in corridors or elevators  folding it fully closed until it locks is quite complicated   when the back seat rest is fully reclined the under basket is blocked  to access it one must use the side openings which are smaller overall i still rate it   stars because having   children in a single stroller sleeping at the same time is a blessing   fiy  turn the front wheels so that they facing backwards  adjust the front seat back rest down  twist the grip and step on the basket until it folds  and make sure that everything is ok by checking on the left that lock is in place  phew      
2,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i m so excited for this new double graco  we have   children  with one more on the way  and i needed a stroller that would allow for my    month old to ride  as well as hold the new baby while in her graco car seat  we already have the graco ready grow classic connect double  but learned with our last baby that this particular style was discontinued  in       a month after we purchased it  and it is not compatible with the newest car seats  which are now  click connect   not  classic connect   minor differences between the two  so it s frustrating to have to get new gear  but also gives me an excuse to get new things for the new baby  i m sharing all this background info because it took a lot of onlins research for me to figure out why our car seat would not fit our stroller the graco duoglider is similar to the newest ready grow click connect double  but does not allow for all the extra ways for an older child to sit and stand  since we already have the old ready grow double  that s not a problem  my main concern was would a car seat fit in one of the seats  and  yes  it sure does  it can fit in either the front or the back  allowing another child  or car seat  to sit in the other  it s lighter weight than any other doubles i ve used  easy to put together  easy to push and turn corners  and the kids love it  so i love it  it also has a very large storage compartment underneath   a nice quality adult cup holder  i highly recommend this stroller      
3,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i purchased two of these strollers because i have   month old triplets and a toddler  it is really versatile because there are so many different positions you can use it in  i love that you can snap the infant car seats in as well as use the seats  the back seat fully reclines which is amazing  you need two hands to recline the back seat though which is annoying  there are latches in both sides that you have to release at the same time  not well thought out  it truly is a one hanred fold  opening is not as easy yet because we have yet to figure out how to unlock it  we ve only used these strollers   times as you can imagine how difficult it is to pull together   newborns and a toddler     which brings me to my next point  the frame of the front seat on one of the strollers has completely snapped off    this happened after using it only   times  i don t know if this is a quality issue or if we received a defective product i love the design but now can t use the front seat to hold a car seat after only   uses  huge bummer  would be a   star product if it didn t break so soon edit  customer service replaced the stroller super fast and both strollers are working smoothly     
4,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       so i love the stroller   i found myself in a stuck situation where my double stroller went missing  with a new born and a toddle  i was in need of a new one fast  even though my car seat is baby trend this stroller is able to accommodate to any car seat  it was really easy to put together  it s really smooth when strolling it around  love the fact the cup holders can come off and are easy to put back on  the only thing i did not like was the opening of the stroller  what i mean by this is the latch  you have to pull really hard to unlatch the stroller  but i would recommend this stroller to anyone with multiple children      
5,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i bought this stroller for twins  so my reviews is for two newborns prosvery easy to open and closecar seats snap in easilyvery smooth to pushcons  with two car seats in  you cannot access anything you put in the bottom without taking a car seat off   not ideal  i have to hang my diaper bag on the handle  front seat doesn t recline   this is huge   i have one bassinet like seat in the back but i have no where to put the second newborn   so essentially i cannot use this stroller for walks until the babies have head control based on the cons  i would not purchase this again for twins   not a good double stroller for newborns      
6,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       it is almost the perfect stroller  i love this because it is so versitle if you have a newborn and a toddler  i sit my    month old in the back and then my two month in the front seat so they are facing wchtoher and my    month just loves it  she will rattle toys for her brother out on walks it is amazing  the big basket underneath is perfect for holding the diaper bag with room to spare  some might  not like that when you pull the back seat to the laying position that you cannot access the basket very well  but it does not bother me  the downsides to the stroller are the cup holder  it is too shallow  any bump you hit little or big the cup of water bottle flys out of the stroller  i also not a fan that you cannot have anything left over in your stroller basket when you go to close it up  i had a sweater in the basket and the stroller would not lock when i was trying to fold it  overall i would reccomend this strollerover the double strollers out there that are side by side  it does fold up to a good size  i can still fit it in my trunk of a ford escape and still get some grocerys in the back as well      
7,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i debated for a long time over which double stroller to get  my youngest two kids will be    months apart when the new baby is born  but my toddler hates sitting in his stroller  i thought about a sit n stand  but i really wanted two seats so both kids could fall asleep of we re out for a while  i picked graco because i can also snap in my infant seat the new baby isn t here yet but i use this stroller a few times a week with my toddler and neice when i m watching her  they are both    months old now and they easily fall asleep in this stroller on walks  it also makes getting into the library  etc so much easier than pushing one in a stroller and carrying the other toddler while managing the bigger kids walking i also needed a stroller that would fit with some other things in my traverse trunk which isn t too deep when the third row is up  although i can t keep the front tray or canopy on to get it in the trunk i just leave those in there in case i need them as they clip right back on  i can fit this stroller  some blankets  a portable baby gate  an umbrella stroller and a golf umbrella in my trunk with some room to spare i didn t want a side by side as my little guy has trouble keeping his hands to himself  with this stroller  he sits in the front so he can t poke or pull the other rider   for the price this can t be beat  i m so glad i purchased it      
8,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       we owned one of these second hand since my eldest daughter was very young and we loved it  ours began to break down more and more and we were happy to purchase the newer version of it a second time  but we would be the first owners  it isn t nearly as nice as the one it replaced it s a damn nightmare to fold up now  the cheaper materials they are using now do not lien up as nicely and instead force you to bear hug the thing to fold it up  and that is only if the wheels are rotated within the    degrees that allow it to actually fold up  if they rotate away  as they are literally designed to do  you are squeezing it like a madman for nothing it also refuses to close if the front seat has the shade in place  and if you manipulate the shade to close the stroller then it is blocking entry into the stroller when it s reopened and has to be adjusted completely back into place i think they need to retire the strollers by helen keller line up
