0,5.0,                       oh my gosh my hair is so soft and silky i just love the way it feels   smells great too i stumbled across a youtube video review about the sleeve and conditioner and had to purchase one right away     buti forgot that i had brought it up until now and oh my gosh why did i wait so long to use this in my hair         
1,5.0,                       i use this about once a week if i remember  absolutely love this  my hair feels smooth and moisturized after using this product   you do not need to use a lot of the product and lasts for quite awhile  just know that it is a small bottle  you can make it last as long or as short as you want depending on the amount and how often you use it      
2,4.0,                       i know i shouldve expected it bc of sizing but idk why its just a really small quantity for a high price  it worked nice in the shower but i didnt really see much of a difference in my hair after religious use  maybe its just me but its not a bad product      
3,5.0,                       love using olaplex  it has really helped my damaged hair get back on track   i ve bought this product direct from olaplex and also from amazon   i notice that the amazon version is much thinner than the one purchase direct   they both seem to work but it makes me wonder if the formulation is different or diluted on amazon      
4,5.0,                       i have had dry  wild  frizzy  thick but fine  stranded hair my whole life  it breaks if you look at it very hard  i straighten it with a hair dryer and it becomes a broken straw broom  i have used  repair  products on my hair for decades with a  yeah whatever  attitude  so i bought this other  repair  product expecting more of the same  except maybe a bit softer  it works  it is literally the only thing i ve ever used that made a difference  i don t understand how and i don t know what kind of hair wizardry it uses  but it literally stops my hair from breaking  i even  gasp  bleached some of my hair and it is not damaged    where was this product when i was a dork  in middle school with hair so wild i couldn t fit through doors  thank you to whatever hair god figured this out      
5,5.0,                       fantastic for damaged hair  coat hair  wrap with plastic wrap and sit under heat for    min  or i sleep with it on  the cost is the only drawback  i have bleached hair on the top and it has really helped strengthen my otherwise breaking hair      
6,5.0,                       if your hair needs moisture you need this product  save money at the salon as this is very easy to do yourself at a fraction of the salon cost  great product  you will love the results and no strong scent      
7,5.0,                       this product is amazing  i purchased this for my daughter  and used along with no    shampoo and no    conditioner  who s hair was extremely damaged from a salon visit  she had her hair bleached   times in    hrs    differ hair appts  in order to lighten her medium brown hair to  almost  platinum blonde so that she could achieve pastel pink hair color  unfortunately  the hair dresser had no idea what she was doing  which resulted in straw like texture and uneven color   not extreme breakage yet  but wanted to prevent further damage    after   use of all these products  no          her hair was transformed    it was soft and was visibly healthy   we left no    treatment on for  hrs  and followed up with no      we did a  nd treatment with all three products a few days later  leaving no    treatment on for  hrs and followed up with no       again  so soft and healthy looking  we will continue treatment  x week to keep it strong and to prevent breakage  the smell is clean and light   for all   products      
8,1.0,                       this is literally worthless  iv used this multiple times in my hair  my sister s hair  and my cousin  my hairstylist even used this and same the same thing  those product is either a scam or a faulty bottle  because real olaplex has always worked  but yet this bottle didn t work on not only me  but   other individuals as well  super mad i wasted money on this  will tell everyone i know on the east coast to not use this product      
9,2.0,                       i ve bought this product from sephora  an authorized olaplex retailer and on amazon  the amazon product is hit or miss  i cut and color my hair a lot and my last purchase of the amazon olaplex didn t help or feel like other times i ve bought it  ultimately  if are buying this product to help heal your hair after damage buy the authentic thing      
10,4.0,                       there are a number of reviews here claiming that the product purchased through amazon is fake   to find out if this is true  i purchased one bottle here on amazon and one directly from the olaplex website  the product price is the same  but i saved    here on shipping because i am a prime member    i compared the two on appearance of packaging and product and on performance  verdict  identical  the stuff ordered through amazon is not fake  that said  it s expensive either way  and not a miracle worker   but if you have damaged hair it s worth a try   i have babyfine processed hair so i will continue to use it   and i will buy it confidently through amazon      
11,1.0,                    no es original es mejor comprarlo en el sitio directo no gasten su dinero en pirateria        
12,5.0,                       this product came as advertised   same as the one i had from sephora  i had read some reviews on here that it wasn t the same    i have fine texture  shoulder length color treated hair   this product is quite simple to use  you just totally wet your hair and towel dry it  you don t want it dripping    apply the product throughout  i use approx     of contents for an application  a little pricey but i want to take good care of my hair    afterward i put a clear shower cap over my hair and do whatever about the house or catch up on some tv shows  it says to leave on for at least    mins  i leave in  my hair for     hours  i want to reap as much benefits of the product as i can   afterward rinse it all out and shampoo  condition   blow dry and style as usual   i find it makes my hair silkier  shinier and gives it body and bounce   my hair has the i just left the salon feel after using this product   i really like that is doesn t have a strong scent  i would describe it as pleasant but very mild   i just snapped a pic of the back of my hair with my phone so you can see for yourself      
13,5.0,                       the hair perfector really does live up to all the hype  i had absolutely destroyed my hair from bleaching it  and nothing was helping  finally  i tried olaplex no    and it literally repaired my hair  i put it all through my damp hair  leave it in overnight  sometimes for    hours  and the results are incredible  you feel the difference immediately when you rinse it out in the shower  i cannot recommend this enough  as well as their bonding smoother  i can t wait to try more of olaplex s products      
14,5.0,                       before  my hair was very wavy  frizzy  and damaged  i spent      getting a keratin treatment and color  so i want to try to keep my hair looking gorgeous  after  i used olaplex    my hair was absolutely gorgeous  i get my hair damp then i put it in my hair for an hour  after  i rinse my hair feels so soft and silky  then  i use olaplex    shampoo and it smells so good  i did try the    conditioner  but i don t like the smell  it smells like chemicals  so i use the keratin complex timeless color conditioner  then  olaplex    bond smoother  while straightening my hair i spray keratin complex daily treatment spray on each section of hair  out of all the hair products i use i absolutely love olaplex     if your looking for a hair product that makes your hair soft  silky  smooth  no frizz  and smells great then  definitely go with olaplex    hair prefector it s the best product ever         
15,2.0,                       olaplex    works so amazing in the salon  but i can t say olaplex    is really worth the money or effort between treatments  truth be told  i haven t seen a difference when using this  i wanted to love it  because olaplex    is like some kind of absolute miracle   but    just doesn t deliver      
16,5.0,                       this product is amazing   i bought it after doing an at home color lift which was sucessful  but totally fried my hair  my blonde hair was very brittle  damaged  dry and felt like straw i used this product once and immediately noticed a difference in the way my hair feels  the only way this product could be any better is if it had a floweral smell to it  but truth be told i don t care since it works so well       
17,2.0,                       i ve seen several people say  this isn t a fake  i compared the real one to amazon s and they look exactly the same   if people actually did that  they would notice that the ingredients list from olaplex s site compared to amazon s  olaplex s no    is very different  i didn t realize this  because of the         reviews with an average of     stars  i just purchased it without comparing first  at first  then i used it and it didn t live up to the hype  so i did some digging olaplex s site ingredients list water  bis aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate  propylene glycol  cetearyl alcohol  behentrimonium methosulfate  cetyl alcohol  phenoxyethanol  glycerin  hydroxyethyl ethylcellulose  stearamidopropyl dimethylamine  quaternium     sodium benzoate  cetrimonium methosulfate  cetrimonium chloride  fragrance  polyquaternium     tetrasodium edta  butylphenyl methylpropional  etidronic acid  ascorbic acid  phytantriol  tocopheryl acetate  aloe barbadensis leaf juice  panthenol  simmondsia chinensis  jojoba  seed oil  citric acid  potassium sorbate amazon s  olaplex no   ingredients list water  bis aminopropyl digycol dimaleate  propylene glycol  cetearyl alcohol  hydrolyzed soy protein  ascorbic acid  vitamin c   tocopheryl acetate  vitamin e   retinol palmitate  vitamin a   aloe barbadensis leaf juice  phytantriol  panthenol  simmondsia chinensis  jojoba  seed oil  hydrolyzed wheat protein  wheat amino acids  behentrimonium methosulfate  cetyl alcohol  glycerin  stearamidopropyl dimethylamine  hydroxyethyl ethylcellulose  quaternium     cetrimonium methosulfate  cetrimonium chloride  fragrance  parfum   polyquaternium     tetrasodium edta  magnesium nitrate  butylphenyl methylpropional  methylchloroisothiazolinone  magnesium chloride  methylisothiazolinone  etidronic acid  potassium sorbate  phenoxyethanol  citric acid  disodium edta  sodium benzoate  prunus amygdalus dulcis  sweet almond  oil the ingredients list isn t even close to the same  if you want genuine olaplex  get on their site and find an authorized distributor or buy it directly from their website  very disappointed       
18,5.0,                       this product truly helped save my hair  my stylist always dyes me a level   cool blue black  and i was ready for a change and thought lockup was perfect time to lighten my hair since nobody would see me  well   lifting black is no easy feat  and i used a    vol quick blue double process and my hair was beyond fried  the frizzy photo shows how bad this was after i cut about   inches off too  so many tears i was hysterical  i googled  and ordered this and used once a week overnight  in conjunction with the matrix     bonding shampoo and conditioner  just got back to my hair stylist about   weeks later  pic      and we did a roof shadow and a toner to smooth her out  my hair is still trash because it s so short  but omg this seriously is amazing  i was at a point that i didn t think i could come back from with the structure of my hair it was like wet goo that never dried  three weeks of religious use     times a week will bring you back  you need this  it s actually amazing      
19,5.0,                       after a double dose of bleaching  my hair was so dry and brittle  it felt terrible no matter how much i tried to condition it  someone recommend that i try this and omg  thank god  i put it on my damp hair and let it sit for an hour  i noticed some change  but i used it a second time a few days later  and my hair finally was back to normal  it s a bond builder  not a moisturizer  so it really help rebuild your hair  doesn t fix it completely  but definitely helps undo some of the damage     
20,1.0,                       i ve heard nothing but good things about olaplex however i had some typical breakage from being blonde and figured i d use this to help  i have naturally curly hair and now after using this twice a week for about     weeks if i don t straighten it  i look like something you pull out of a drain  the mild and typical damage i had from bleaching is now insane  i m not sure if this stuff isn t real but i m just praying these effects wash out over time   my sister started using this the same time i did  from her own bottle and is now having the same issues        
21,1.0,                            fake  i was wondering why it wasn t doing much for me so you re better off ordering it on sephora    the size is off the label is also a bit off   the big difference is the month the fake says      real is    months  save ur money     
22,4.0,                       i bought olaplex no   from amazon a few years ago and it was alright  i probably washed it off too early since i bleached my hair recently  i wanted to get hair treatment products such as this to prevent further damage i bought it from amazon again and let it sit on my hair for good   min  few days before bleaching  bottom half had some bleached and dyed hair   i think it made my hair a little softer but not a miraculous result i ll be using this more often on my bleached hair and come back to update my review by the way  i saw so many reviews saying that this is not authentic here on amazon and so i ordered the same thing from sephora to see the consistency and the packaging  the only difference  very subtle  i see is that the label sticker on olaplex no   from amazon is not smooth and has that vertical fold crack going down caused by the bottle shape beneath it  the bottle from sephora looks exactly the same and the code is the same on the amazon one but the sticker label on the sephora one is smooth i looked in close on both bottles and the amazon s bottle is not completely smoothed out where the halves  the bottle is plastic and it s obviously made from sticking two halves together  meet are not sanded smoothly so the vertical center line sticking out causes the sticker to crease the one from sephora though also has that verticle line in the center but it looks like it s smoothed out really well or something so while you can see the line  the surface is really smooth   no crease on the label sticker other than that  the consistency of the product  the fragrance  the stickers  prints  fonts  quality are exactly the same i think it s important to get these from amazon and make sure it s not sent from other sellers      
23,1.0,                       didnt see any sort of difference  left the product on for over two hours  disappointed      
24,5.0,                       okay ladies  yes buy this  wow  literally the best hair product i ve ever purchased  i ve got thinning  lightened  damaged hair cause i ve got an unhealthy obsession with dyeing my hair at the salon  someone stop me  but i caaaannnttt   this took my dry  rough bleached hair and made it soft and shiny again  i usually dampen my hair with a spritz water bottle then apply for       minutes before getting into the shower about twice a week  which is how often i wash my hair anyway   you are supposed to wash it out using your usual shampoo and conditioner  i use a different brand  and the results are so amazing  i highly recommend      
25,5.0,                       all i can say is whoa  i put this in my hair the min it was delivered   i kept it in overnight as i read is ok to do  rinsed it in the afternoon the next day and with that one treatment   i m already impressed  my hair was broken and so overly damaged being a blonde  it was snapping off at the root but i couldnt figure out why because its never done that  i couldnt eben brush it  after one use  and washing with the shampoo and conditioner from the same line   no fall out at all   not one piece of hair in my hands or my brush  i wish my bottle was bigger for the price  but i will keep buying this for absolute certainty        
26,5.0,                       good stuff   i am just starting a new  healthier hair  routine  omitting sulphates  alcohols  and silicones  but my hair is belached and was in bad shape    i don t think i could survive without dimethecone if it weren t for olaplex  i used number   and number   together as directed on the packaging  i tried   by itself and there was an improvement  but it was at least twice as much improvement with the number   when i did my  nd treatment  my hair is silky smooth and looks so much better now        
27,1.0,                       i didn t see any improvement with using the  olaplex hair perfector for a full month      
28,5.0,                       it s olaplex and the real deal  this works great and i am very happy with my purchase      
29,5.0,                       if you want salon power moisture this bonding treatment is easy to use and works very well your hair will be in great condition in no time with little effort     
30,5.0,                       this product actually does what it says it will do   before i shampoo i dampen my hair  apply the product  and relax until it dries   then i wash  condition and style   i noticed a change in my hair the first time i used it   my hair is thick and so dry this winter that i needed something desperately   it really worked for me   smells great too      
31,4.0,                       i haven t used this yet  but the size kills me  for almost     you get this tiny bottle  i cant imagine something this small being worth the cost  i guess i will update after i use it   definitely disgusted by the greed in the beauty industry     
32,3.0,                       i honestly can t say that i ve noticed a huge difference in my hair which i bleached near death recently  i got    uses out of the bottle because i have fine low density curls  i m sure it probably did something  but maybe i need to continue using it for a while so i bought another one along with the no   from the olaplex website this time  hoping for more noticeable results this round      
33,5.0,                       let me start by saying this thing is a miracle worker  i ve been hearing about this for years but never had a damaging chemical process that i d need to use it  until now  i decided to dye my hair blue  it s something i have been wanting to do for years but didn t want to bleach my full head  i have reddish brown hair  a medium to dark brown  that i dye with permanent hair color  so i bleached my entire head with    volume peroxide and bleach powder  luckily my hair bleached easily to a very pale blonde that i didn t need to bleach again  but that first round destroyed my curly hair  i have loose curls waves and my hair looked like brillo when it was dry  i was so nervous  i couldn t comb through  it was elastic  it was a mess  i then dyed it using arctic fox hair dye which is vegan  no chemicals and moisturizes the hair  my hair then looked great color wise  it was soft but looked fried  and i mean fried    that was last monday  so i spent the week doing loads of argan oil  had to flat iron it to help hide the extreme damage  but still the ends would look super dry and pretty much like brillo  and we had the worst week in nyc  hot and very humid  which didn t help at all  so i decided to buy this  was skeptical about the  fake  reviews  so i bought directly from amazon and not third party sellers  just to be extra sure  i received the product sealed  looking fine  the consistency is thick  its very concentrated  i washed my hair with sulfate free shampoo to remove all the argan oil i used and then put olaplex all over my hair  combed  put a shower cap and let it stay for   hours  then rinsed  shampooed and put a  it s a     hair mask for about    minutes and massaged it on my hair  and wow  just wow  my hair felt like hair again  i was able to blow dry it straight with a comb  and no and i mean not a single hair got stuck or broke off on the brush  my hair is back to life  it s soft  shiny  super strong and  i m so happy again    this pic is from a couple of hours after i used it and you can see it looks like hair and not a steel sponge  only one application and it already did that  can you imagine with regular use      
34,5.0,                       this stuff works really well  it is a bit pricey   but totally worth it  you could use it without the olaplex shampoo and conditioner if on a tight budget      
35,5.0,                       this product has helped so much with the frizziness caused by bleaching my hair  i have been using it about once a week  have used it three times total  and already see a vast difference  i also let my mom try it since she has some frizz due to dryness  after just one application  i can see that her hair has gotten smoother toward the ends  four applications only used up about a quarter of the bottle  though both of us have fine hair   so i feel it is a good value  very impressed      
36,5.0,                       have you ever gotten a hair product and hoped it would be the best remedy for your split ends and damaged hair  after buying so many hair products  it was hopeless to rescue my damaged hair  until i found olaplex no     this product is a great hair treatment product for men and women with damaged hair  this creation helps strengthen hair by repairing and healing each individual hair shaft with less noticeable split ends  this product has quick results and after     washes  your hair is noticeably healthier and stronger  it is also leaves your hair very shiny and soft with the amount of hydration it gives  many celebrities like kim kardashian  drew barrymore  and chrissy teigen use this product and describe it as a  game changer   although the quality of this product is very good  it is not cheap considering how much product you re getting  this product will help your split ends as well as relieve its thirstiness many people might say   well is it a popular brand    it sure is  many famous celebrities such as kim kardashian  drew barrymore  and chrissy teigen swear by this product  kkw beauty owner  kim kardashian  says   when your hair is really damaged  if you sleep in that  it really works  i notice a huge difference   kim kardashian has gone from brunette to platinum blonde hair and expresses confidence in this product  drew barrymore has her own beauty company and she also uses this merchandise  she says   and so quickly my hair is remarkably and clearly better  it s curling and actually bouncing and looking like hair rather than coughed up bird feathers    she clearly states that she values this product because of how it leaves her hair looking  chrissy teigen is a firm believer in it since she colours her hair very often and says that it s a  miracle worker   although many people may assume that celebrities are getting paid to say this product is good  other review of this product certainly shows that it is definitely worth buying olaplex no    helped me rescue my damaged hair with split ends  it is a concentrated at home treatment that contains the same ingredients found in all professional salon products  it will fix split ends by relinking the broken disulfide bonds caused by chemical  thermal  and mechanical damage to the hair  this formula is made to work with various types of hair while reducing breakage and improving its look and feel  this treatment links broken bonds in the hair before  during  and after chemical treatment  this means your hair is actually being repaired and not just temporarily hydrated by using various types of oils with no parabens  sulfates  and phthalates  which are dangerous chemicals  this product not only brings life to your hair  but repairs it  which is why many people should buy this product although this product is astonishing  it can be a little high priced for the amount of product provided  when purchasing this product     ml is provided for      the reason that only    ml is provided is because only a generous amount of this product is needed to coat hair in one treatment  no matter the length of hair  only a small amount is needed to leave hair looking healthy  compared to other treatments  this product is considered over priced  but it is considered phenomenal  this treatment is definitely an investment for hair considering the price olaplex no    is the perfect hair treatment product for men and women with impaired hair  now  one might say   why should i use this product    well  this product strengthens hair like no other treatment  while not only leaving hair with less visible split ends  but also repairing them  the effect of this product is impeccable with only     washes to produce healthy and hydrated hair  many celebrities are advocates for this product such as kim kardashian  drew barrymore  and chrissy teigen  after constantly putting chemicals in my hair  this hair mask rescued my damaged hair by bringing my natural curly hair to life through a series of treatments  this product is an investment for hair and everyone with damaged hair should use it      
37,4.0,                       after the first treatment my fine  thin  dry  color treated  damaged hair feels soft  smoother  and maybe even a little thicker  i left it in overnight and i feel like i m still seeing the effects develop several days later  if this is what just one treatment feels like  i can t wait to see what the whole bottle can do for my hair      
38,5.0,                       i have long gray hair which is normally dry and looks like hay   i ve never really used anything beyond just regular shampoo and conditioner  i left this product on for       minutes  washed it out  shampooed and applied my conditioner   then worked in some argan oil while hair was damp   i have to say  my hair has never been better   it is flaxen and looks very healthy even down to the scalp   scalp even looks better   i love this stuff   small bottle and expensive    but worth it      
39,5.0,                       i lightened my hair a couple times trying to even the color and my hair  long  just under shoulder blades  got gummy and too watery porous  olaplex no    helped to repair some of those bonds and reduce the gummy texture and help my hair dry normally and  heal  from the lightening  best case  olaplex should be used before the damage is done to lessen it  but masking for a couple house every few days is still helpful after the fact  any longer than a couple hours and i understand it doesn t really do anything  so no need to sleep in the product like some claim  and remember it is not a leave in  you must wash it out   i used this in conjunction with aphogee      
40,3.0,                       i have long hair  to my mid back  and this  product  is  so  small i ll get   uses for basically      i ve used as directed but have not seen any  major  changes i ve used it twice all over so far i have silver hair and the idiot who touched my hair last totally fried it      all other times were smooth and easy  i ve been desperate to buy any product that will help preserve my hair  i assume this product is working but not noticeably per se    but again  i reiterate     its so small  not ideal product for long hair as it wont last and you ll go broke      
41,5.0,                       olaplex was amazing  my hair is color treated and my ends had gotten very dry and brittle  after the olaplex treatment it made my hair so much softer and shinier  and it really helped the ends of my hair  i used about     of the bottle to saturate my damp hair and left it on for    minutes for my first treatment   i used the remainder of the olaplex for shorter treatments in the shower  my hairdresser introduced me to olaplex  she was      right      
42,5.0,                       i recently started beaching my hair  and noticed immediately that my hair now has lots of frizzies   i tried the most popular frizz products on amazon to take care of that problem  and was disappointed to find that none of them worked properly i had used olaplex no   in the past and loved it  so i tried it again   am so glad it works pretty well on frizzies caused by bleaching   i use an amount of the product that will make my hair lay down without making it limp  and let it dry before combing it through with a fine tooth comb   i use it after every shampoo and then a couple of times each week   people compliment my hair and say it looks great   i really highly recommend this item if you have chronic frizzies      
43,2.0,                       as far as i can tell  this may not be the authentic olaplex     my hair was in good condition but after using one bottle and starting on a second my hair is dry  broken and frizzy   do not waste your money   buy this from a salon       
44,5.0,                       i have been bleaching my hair from my natural black to platinum for   years now  breakage is my normal  i heard about this product and wanted to give it a try  but after all the other products i ve tried in the past  my hopes weren t up too high  i left it in for about    minutes and then washed it out and dried it  and girl  the results  usually when i do my hair my shirt ends up looking like it lost a fight to a the floor of a beauty salon on a saturday  to my disbelief  after i used this product for the first time  i didn t have a single hair on my shirt  not even one       worth it      
45,5.0,                       i was skeptical at first because of the price and the small amount of product you get for it  however  i have shoulder length  fine  fragile  chemically processed hair  and i use this    x wk  and it has lasted several months  a little goes a long way  it has a light scent  my hairdresser keeps telling me what good shape my hair is in despite how much we dye it very light  i credit olaplex bond builder  this is a must have for me  it s worth the money but you have to use it regularly to see results      
46,5.0,                       absolutely love this stuff   my hair is very healthy already  i don t use heat products on it  i don t dye or bleach it  i trim split ends regularly  but i wanted it to be shinier and softer  this stuff did exactly that  my hair is so soft now that i can t stop running my fingers through it  it looks much more healthy and radient      
47,3.0,                       it definitely moisturizes your hair and it helps mend split ends  the container is super tiny and i have a lot of hair so i had to use it like once a week or once every   weeks  it doesn t smell too great      
48,3.0,                       i have been using this every  other week for some reason  it dosent do no wonders on my damage bleach hair at all i haven t seen no difference  or change at all   and this product is expensive  it should of worked or helped my hair but it didn t never again buying this product     
49,5.0,                       i have dry curly color treated blonde hair  i can tell this is helping my hair become stronger  i wet and towel dry my hair then leave it on for an hour or so and then wash my hair  i have used this twice and there s a noticeable improvement on my ends and the strength of my hair  i m a product junkie and have used so many things to protect my hair  i will continue to buy this      
50,5.0,                       wow  this stuff is amazing  every one saying it s not real oilplex is crazy this has worked wonders on my hair  i ve seen less breakage almost there immediately my hair is very poofy very frizzy and now it s always so silky and manageable      
51,5.0,                       definitely need to understand what this product is before you purchase it  my hairdresser uses this on my hair when i get bleach highlights  it is not a leave in product   it needs to left on for several minutes and then washed out  you then condition with another conditioner  i love this product      
52,5.0,                       i purchased this because a hair dresser friend of mine said it was what they recommended to their clients when they dye their hair  usually blonde   it helps bond the hairs back together to give it strength  i don t bleach my hair  but i do color it every few months  my hair was healthy when i was younger  but having a medical issues  my hair started to fall out and doesn t grow like it used to  the ends are split and it is usually semi course  after using this just once  i could run my fingers through my hair and not feel the rough parts  it felt almost silky  i ve used it about   times and still have half the bottle left  i cannot say if it repairs split ends  i know you cannot mend them back together   i mean more in the way of helping them not fray or split further   but i definitely recommend this product to help give life back to your hair  it s not a miracle worker  but it s definitely putting health back into my dry strands      
53,3.0,                       not sure what all the hype is about on this but i found a product from sally s beauty supply that worked better and was        too expensive for what you are getting    unless this was not actually genuine product       
54,4.0,                       but i ve used it  x now and i can notice a slight difference in my hair  i can see how people could think this was a fake product because it literally doesn t feel like you re putting anything into your hair and i hated that it says to saturate your hair because it felt that way  but either way like i said it does seem like repaired my hair a bit      
55,1.0,                       i was stunned at how small this bottle of conditioner is   it s approximately    tall  this tiny amount of conditioner does not warrant      it did nothing special for my wavy  colored hair  there are hundreds of better conditioners out there for this price      
56,1.0,                       used this product for a few weeks  it does nothing for repairing hair  gave   star as the scent is nice  its very thin  turns sticky then drys hard  this did absolutely nothing for my hair  i ve since had better results from regular priced products from the store      
57,5.0,                    excelente producto lo he usado desde hace   a os vale la pena pagar el precio mi cabello es rubio y jam s se maltrata ni con la plancha se lo he recomendado a varias amigas y quedan igual de impresionadas que yo con los resultados restaura completamente las puntas abiertas y maltratadas por la decoloraci n        
58,5.0,                       so thankful i ordered this product  as i was planning to chop off about     inches of my hair to get rid of bleach split end damage  what a difference one overnight application makes  my hair no longer feels like straw when i run my fingers through it  important to know that this is neither shampoo or conditioner  and you should both shampoo and condition immediately after rinsing out  also  the bottle says to leave on for a minimum of    minutes  but my hair was so damaged that i left it on all night under a shower cap while i slept  so happy with this purchase      
59,5.0,                       if you re on the fence about buying it like i was   but it  i bleached my naturally dark but also box dyed dark hair     times over a   month period and by the last time my hair was dead  it had the funny feeling when wet  took forever to dry  and get stringy and gross when i ran my fingers through it  i ve used olaplex only twice so far  i think i ll be able to get   uses out of this bottle and i have a decent amount of hair  and it feels so much better  the first use i left in for about   hrs and the second i left in over night  my hair dries much faster  doesn t feel gummy  and looks a lot more shiny  if you want an extra supplement to this or if you don t wanna spend the money on this i d recommend the whole total repair   line by l or al      
60,5.0,                       i use this a few times a week to help repair my hair  it s a small bottle for the price but a little bit goes a long way  helps make my hair smooth and soft  i have a lot of professional friends that use this and recommend it also  that s how i started using it  if your hair is damaged and in need of repair give this stuff a try      
61,5.0,                       i ve been using this product for   months  and it has made a noticeable difference in my hair   my hair was very broken and would not grow due to split ends   with slight trimming every   weeks and using this product     times per week for the past   months  the texture of my hair is really improving  and i finally am getting more length   i leave this product in overnight   the instructions say to wash your hair again after use  but i tend to leave it in until the next time i would have washed my hair otherwise   leaving the product in won t hurt your hair  but it also will not give extra benefits after a certain point      
62,5.0,                       i love it  my hair has felt a lot better lately  i typically leave mine on for much longer than    minutes though      
63,5.0,                       this stuff is incredible  i had been bleaching coloring my hair for   years so it was very damaged when i finally went back to brown  my friends and family are surprised by how well it has worked i put it on before i get in the shower  when my hair is still dry   then i do stuff around the house and don t really track how long it s in my hair  i might use more product this way but it s convenient and still works really well      
64,1.0,                       magic hair elixir sounded too good to be true  and it was  i ve used four times and while it s moisturizing it has not done anything to repair any damaged hair or help with frizz      
65,5.0,                       awesome   leaves my hair silky smooth   what i usually do is i put it in the morning of the day i am going to wash my hair and put my hair up  by the time that i wash it out my hair is super silky  and all of this is from someone who is super cheap and was hesitant to spend the money   is worth it      
66,5.0,                       this product is amazing  i have very long  undyed hair with decently damaged ends  a somewhat inevitable function of growing it for such a long time  splits are a struggle for me  and in the dry winter air  i ve been dealing with a ton of them  in spite of using various masks  i read a ton on olaplex  trying to figure out if it would be right for hair that wasn t chemically damaged  as i know it is primarily used on hair that is dramatically colored  i just used it for the first time and left it on for nearly an hour  then followed with my regular shampoo and conditioner  i can barely see any split ends  i keep holding the ends up to the light  and it s like olaplex almost cured my hair in one go  highly  highly recommend      
67,5.0,                       i received my product this morning and used right away  i used on wet hair   let for    minutes   rinsed and used my shampoo and conditioner i have got highlights and my hair looked like an old broom lol  after one use i can see the difference   my hair is smoother and not tangled as before   i will definitely buy the         
68,5.0,                       i have bleached curly wavy hair that is relatively fine  prone to breakage and feeling brittle  this product is an absolute game changer   before using  my hair felt sort of straw like and rather unpredictable but afterwards it feels    x softer  more manageable  and looks less dry  my flyaways decreased so much and my hair is the smoothest it s been since i began dying it years ago  i could not believe how wonderful and revived my hair looked after just one use  i have tried tons of other hair masks  conditioners  and treatments that claimed they would improve my hair but none have even come close to the results i got with olaplex  if you are debating trying this product or have reservations due to the price  this is your sign to click the button and buy it because it is worth it       
69,5.0,                       if i could give this    stars  i would   after one use  my hair was completely different   i have dry  coarse hair   medium to thick   and in these pandemic days  it s become even more dry and damaged  because i haven t had it cut in nearly a year    i watched a youtube video on how to use the olaplex no    and did it that night   i truly am dumbfounded that it worked that well in just one application   my hair is so soft and the texture is just amazing   per the recommendation on olaplex s website  i did leave it on for    minutes before rinsing   i wish the bottle were larger   i have a feeling i ll go through this quickly   i plan to use it once a week   wonderful product   smells good  too      
70,5.0,                       this is the best conditioner  i can t believe how much it calmed my frizzy gray hair  i was afraid it might be too heavy  but it actually gave my hair so much volume and shine  it looks as lovely as it does when i leave the salon  i took another reviewer s advice and used a clarifying shampoo before i applied the conditioner  i think this is especially important if you have well water      
71,1.0,                       tons of breakage   while washing it out of the shower  everything felt soft and lovely  however  i ve noticed with introducing this product into my regimen  i ve experienced a ton of breakage  my hair was frizzy before  not particularly damaged  i only had a few highlights in  but i had cut out a lot of the damaged parts  given this is the newer product in my routine  i will promptly stop using it  too much unexplained thinning and breakage of the hair  a lot of which was untouched by the highlights       
72,5.0,                       i am usually very skeptical about these hair products that claim to magically repair years of damage  and there s plenty out there  in a desperate measure to fix my own hair  i decided to give this one a try and i ve been pleasantly surprised at the instant results  with extended use  i don t know if it will truly repair my dry hair and split ends caused due to years of coloring and a disastrous perm but it has most certainly created a difference in just   uses  so i m sold  writing this review for the other skeptics out there  maybe the results depend from hair to hair but it does work  it s more than i would like to spend on my hair maintenance  but with the results i m getting  i m willing to continue to invest in this product      
73,4.0,                       i was a little concerned this might be a knock off  but it s the same that is sold in my salon  works as described  i ve damaged my hair a lot with bleach and color  and this makes it feel softer  i m still working on getting the  frizzy look  under control all the time  but this helps tremendously     
74,1.0,                       i wanted to try olaplex because my hair was dry frizzy   i have dry scalp   i started with the    only   worked thst into my daily regimen  my hair started to get way more dry frizzy than normal  it only got worse when i bought the shampoo  my hair was still is falling out super easy  all i have to do is run my hand through it   i get lots of hair falling  my scalp texture must have changed too  because the dry flakes are slightly different  more clear   way more of them  currently in the process of fixing my hair from this product   figuring out how to add moisture to the dryness      
75,5.0,                       this product is a hair saver  i bleach my hair and i use this every time i wash my hair    times a week usually   i have fine naturally blonde hair and when i lighten it my hair will fry without this stuff  since i ve been using it  few months now  i have noticed my hair is super strong and healthy  i m a loyal customer now      
76,1.0,                       sorry  but i really wanted this to work    followed directions  i washed my hair and dryed with no products the day before using this  i dampened my hair to almost it dripping water  applied generously olaplex  massaged it in  waited    minutes with a plastic cap on so it stays damp   then shampoo   conditioned hair  no visible result  my hair has been bleached damage at the ends and i did not see any improvements  sorry   i sent this back     not woth it     
77,2.0,                       smells really good   a little goes a long way  i m a caucasian female with very short  very kinky  curly hair that s dry   frizzy  i bought all   products as recommended on olaplex s website        followed all directions carefully   was so disappointed  it did nothing for my hair   i mean nothing  i tried again using just the    everyone raves about  then the shampoo   conditioner  nothing  if anything it was worse  i wanted this for so long   saved to get it       wasted  really mad at myself   i should have known better  if it sounds to good to be true    it probably is      
78,5.0,                       omg     i love this stuff  my local salon charges        per treatment for olaplex  although this bottle is small  it s powerful  the shorter your hair is  the more use you ll get  my hair is shoulder length and i ll get probably   or   full treatments with it  i put in my first treatment overnight and my hair was much  much softer and healthier looking  i get my hair bleached every   to    weeks so i needed this      
79,5.0,                       so i ve used olaplex in the past every time i ve gotten my hair bleached  normally  you get this product  as the third step to olaplex  from the hair dresser after your coloring session to take home   this time i went to a new stylist and she says she used olaplex in my color but i never received this step to take home  she actually damaged my hair so much  i was devastated  i decided to order this in hopes that it would bring it back to life  i used it   times each week for   weeks now  and wow what a difference  i am so happy i did  it is expensive  i have medium length hair and use about a quarter size of the product  its worth it  i definitely highly recommend it      
80,1.0,                       not eligible for return think about it before buying made my hair worse  total waste of money and you can t return it  even local beauty supply store would let you return product that does not work good luck sanaj     
81,5.0,                       i have been bleaching my hair intermittently for several months to achieve and maintain a bright warm platinum blonde  the color is finally perfect but my hair was wrecked from chemical overlapping and dryness  my ends were gummy when they were wet  i used this once on freshly shampooed hair  left it on towel dried for    minutes  rinsed  and it s like i ve never bleached my hair it s so healthy  now i have the color i wanted with the shine and moisture of my virgin hair  this is so worth the money      
82,1.0,                       my hair is pretty healthy  i endured a full set of highlights bimonthly for about    years  so my ends aren t fantastic  but i haven t color processed in almost a year and have been taking nutrafol for   months  so the first    in of my roots is about as good as it gets  i ordered this product as a prime day deal because i had been eyeballing it for a while with the idea that it would bring my bleach damaged ends back to life until they were finally all chopped off  and i gave it a good   weeks of exclusive use to see if maybe there s an adjustment period  but i m convinced that this product is just not meant for people with fine hair  or oil glands   in the first week or so my hair started falling out waaaaaay more than usual  i would end up with a handful every time i washed  falling out from the root  not breaking off where the bleach damage was   i ve had issues with excess oil since giving birth about a year and a half ago  but this made it so much worse  i wash my hair in the morning  and usually could go a day in between if i threw it up in a bun  but while using the olaplex system i would have to put my hair up before i even left work for the day  if i had plans in the evening i would have to go home and wash my hair beforehand because it would bee too dirty to go out after an     hr day  even hidden away in a clip  the no   shampoo and no   conditioner smell great  and the first few hours of the day my hair felt nice and had good body  but after lunch it s all downhill  the no   treatment is what caused the most fallout in my opinion  and the no   bond smoother leave in made it feel tacky and tangle easily  after my month trial run i decided to switch back to my beloved patchouli cannacell shampoo and conditioner  and i am so much happier at a quarter of the price  now to focus on regrowing what this garbage stole from me        
83,5.0,                       if this is fake  it s a dang good one  after doing a bleach bath and two rounds of hair dye  my hair feels better than it did when i started after one use  my hair is soft  smooth and just looks overall amazing  absolutely worth it       
84,3.0,                       having used a salon purchased bottle of this formula prior  i dont believe this to be a legitimate product   packaging is same but scent and texture of product inside is different and it did nothing for my hair   verified product used previously made drastic improvement in one use   i d advise buying elsewhere      
85,5.0,                       i tend to just use this bottle and not the whole olapex series    but it has really helped out my hair  i love how soft and easy to manage it makes my hair  if you re struggling with your hair  definitely try splurging out for this  you don t even need to use it so long      
86,1.0,                       for a while i thought this was what the product looked like until i ordered some more from the olaplex website and saw a huge difference with the consistency of the product  in the image you ll see a watered down version of the product versus the real deal with a thicker consistency  sort of like conditioner  i highly suggest just buying this product off of the official website to save from being ripped off      
87,5.0,                       this is by far the best hair product in the market  shampoo  conditioner   everything exceeds my expectations  i have long curly straight hair  this works wonders  yes  it may be pricey but with these products a little goes a long way        
88,5.0,                       this is a miracle in a bottle    works better when you leave it for hours  leaves your hair super soft     
89,5.0,jan          i do not know if it is the real olaplex or not  but i love this stuff  i started bleaching sessions since october       i probably bleached  x since  i reached to a point of extreme damage where my hair felt soo weak it would not even air dry on its own  it felt   looked like noodles   very gummy  it would take me maybe an hr to brush out my hair because of all the damage breakage   i started taking better care for my hair  i stopped using     shampoos   started buying quality shampoos   deep hair conditioners   hair masks   oils   oraganic virgin oils   all these products did work for saving my hair   i did see improvement in time   but with one use of olaplex   made my hair very soft   silky   healthier looking   i usually use a special detangling brush because of all the knots i get from breakage   from all the bleaching i ve done to my hair   with olaplex   i no longer struggle to brush my hair or run my fingers without them getting stuck in my hair from tangles of dryed brittle hair  this stuff is just what my damaged hair needed  this was just half the bottle used on my   inches of hair  i still have half left   at first i was hesitant on buying because not only was it very expensive but it is a very small bottle  i am soo glad i bought this   favorite hair products for damaged bleached hair   olaplex    redken ph bonder  redken extreme conditioner  redken shampoo for damage hair  redken diamond oil  redken heat protectant  loreal total repair   damage erasing balm  one n only argan oil  one n only aragan oil repair mask  herbal essence deep moisturizer conditioner  hair food sulfate free  redken extreme anti snap  silk elements mega silk heat protectant spray  organic virgin coconut oil  helped me alot   hope this helps someone  good luck  thanks for reading  
90,5.0,                       works well for curly hair after dying or highlightening  damage   small bottle size but not needed every wash      
91,5.0,                       the olaplex    may be expensive and onerous  but it works   i use it  x per week with olaplex    and have noticed my coarse  thick hair is softer and less frizzy   highly recommended      
92,5.0,                       but      had used my bottle twice and my hair did take to bleaching much better  now saying that     it didnt make my hair shiny or bouncy or moisturized as it just helps to protect the hair in between or after a bleach process  this is not a conditioner or miracle mask  if your hair was dry before    it will be dry afterwards that is why i would suggest  and instructions say  a deep conditioner after you wash out this formula what i did try was the overnight process  seemed silly  i m a level   color and processed to a level    over the course of   years i have bleached and colored and removed color to add color and strip color and bleach some more  etc  i m a bleach b  cant help it  i m also a  a b hair texture    half black and asian  by year       i had stopped going to the salon which uses olaplex   and   in my hair  which explains why i was able to bleach and dye my hair so much with barely any damage at all       and i would say     of ends are breaking off    i had cut about   inches of hair off and i still see i need to cut another   i pulled out my olaplex and said what the heck and kept it on overnight with my heating cap on  wash it out the next day and deep conditioned i used my regular oil and heat protectant  blow dry on cool setting and flat ironed my hair  which i stopped doing for a week  and my split ends literally looked like they disappeared  i wish i did a before and after  much better results than just leaving it on for    minutes  which helped but i got an even better result leaving it on overnight   my hair looks healthy and it actually feels stronger  yu have to personalize what you use after using this product to get the best results really good stuff update  uploaded a few pictures of the changes in hair color i go through   my hair has remained long and strong using olaplex  its incredible how often i can change my color now      
93,1.0,                       i bought this  olaplex    in      and i was disappointed  i just bought a bottle from my stylist and it was amazing  it s very clear to me that i received a fake product      thrown away  i wish they had better quality control      
94,5.0,                       i have very over processed hair and this did wonders  it is not completely healthy yet  but it s getting there  my hair would take so long to dry since it was so damaged but i have noticed from the very first use that it s drying much faster  i was very worried about the scent because i like my hair to smell nice but it honestly smells like generic conditioner and after shampooing and conditioning  you can t even smell it  my only problem is how small the product is  i have very thick hair and spending over     for only a couple uses is not that great  however  you have to apply it on damp hair which allows you to use a lot less product and when you see how good it works  it is worth it      
95,5.0,                       my hair has weak repairing ability on its own  but with this stuff it s no problem  i read a lot of reviews claiming this product to be fake  but that s definitely not the case  after using this my hair is noticeably healthier and much much softer  i absolutely recommend this product and this vendor to buy it from      
96,5.0,                       this product helped my very over processed  baby fine hair  i leave it on    minutes one time every week or two  it keeps my hair smooth   healthy looking  it is not simply a conditioner  which can weigh hair down   though i didn t use    or    olaplex first  i m very pleased  this vendor sent the real product  not a knockoff      
97,1.0,                       i purchased this to help repair my damage hair due to my highlights  i saw so many great reviews  however this has done nothing for my hair  the product is thin and leaves of feeling just as dry as before  a waste of money for me      
98,5.0,                       i ve only done   treatments and it works  ok last month i went to my hair dresser because i wanted the balayage look  well she left the bleach in my hair way to long  then days later after she applied toner for the second time   it still turned orange after a few days  and that is what you see in the pictures  well i didn t want to go back so i bought the shimmer lights shampoo and conditioner and it helped take that orange out  but my hair still looked nast dry and brittle  i decided to try olaplex treatment and so far its helping as you can see on the  rd picture   i will continue to use and will update  i recommend that you use it while hair is damp so that it spreads easily  i have very thick hair and i believe that i can get at least   treatments out of it      
99,5.0,                       this stuff is the bomb  my hair loves protein but is fine so i can also overdo the protein easily  this acts like a protein treatment and gives shape back to my curls  i have low porosity   a b curls that easily get weighed down with too much moisture and this stuff is amazing  i try to do it once a week but even every other week makes a difference  one bottle lasts me a couple of months      
100,5.0,                       i m not a professional but any professional hairstylist can tell you this is a game changer olaplex   and   are used at the salon  but olaplex   is your saving grace at home  i just bleached my hair from dark brown to platinum over the period of two weeks and i could not have done it without this product it is not a conditioner  it is a bonding treatment  which means it will bond your frayed hair back together  you can use it whenever you want  wherever you want and how often you want  the more you use it the stronger and healthier your hair will be  even if it is in terrible shape because of coloring and heat tools start using it now and you ll be flabbergasted at how it repairs hair i ve been doing my hair at home for many years  much to the chagrin of my hairstylist  but i could not have gone platinum at home without olaplex    miracle product      
101,2.0,                       i read a lot of good reviews about this product  so  i taught i find what i m looking to get rid of the end split and frizziness of my dry hair  i tried it for two weeks  but i didn t see any signs of improvement  for sure there is no miracle especially considering the price       for     ml  i returned it  and stay with an arvazallia hydrating argan oil hair mask      
102,3.0,                       the product is amazing  but what they lacked on was the fact that it exploded in my carry on luggage because it does not fasten tight enough for the cap  compared to all my other bottles this was the least secure and it can be said for the other products as well      
103,5.0,                       this product is amazing  my hair was so dry and unmanageable i couldn t even run my fingers through my hair anymore  the pictures are after just one use  i left the treatment on for four hours and then blow dried my hair like normal and the difference is crazy  i can run my fingers through my hair again  my ends are still dry but not nearly as bad  my next treatment i m gonna leave in over night  definitely worth the buy   i used about half the bottle for the first treatment so it is a bit pricey  let me just say you get what you pay for      
104,5.0,                       amazing product  my hair feels so silky just after using this and shampooing my hair  which you don t get with most shampoos without using conditioner  it really does help repair hair   i absolutely love this product        
105,5.0,                       my son is dating a hairdresser and she recommended this product to me   my previous hairdresser used a very harsh chemical on my hair giving it a very dry  damaged look   this product saved my hair    it is awesome     my son s girlfriend takes care of my hair now  but she still recommends i use this a few times a month   keeps my hair in great shape   fyi   i am over     have some grey  have normal to thin hair but a lot of it and am blonde   i swim and am in the sun  so this helps my hair       
106,5.0,                       my hair was over processed and i was left with crispy crunchy ends and some stretchy when wet sections  i applied some olaplex on damp hair and let it sit for about    hours with a processing cap on overnight  this stuff is the real deal  i m no mathematician but i would predict that my hair is at least     softer and my breakage has decreased significantly  this was only after one treatment  i will definitely keep using it and i m sure i will keep being pleasantly surprised  i know other reviews have stated they thought they had received a fake product so to avoid this happening to me i made sure it was through a reputable seller who had excellent feedback      
107,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          ok let me start by saying  what happened to my hair is the horror story they give you at the salon about why not to bleach your own hair at home i had gorgeous hair  for reals  it was long and thick and healthy and full and big and beautiful and it was red  which i had dyed it consistently for a year  i decided  got a bug up my butt  i wanted to go back to my natural blonde  que horror flick music end result was hair so damaged i had to cut it all off including shaving off the back into an undercut to eliminate the severe damage my goal for the last   months has been to avoid getting it wet  avoid washing it  and keep it moisturized at all costs i bought this as a hail mary  my hair has reached the state of non stop breakage  ive got   inch long bangs  i did not cut these hairs  they broke off  seriously i wasnt expecting a miracle  i just wanted to touch my hair without it breaking instantly i got what i wanted  after one application i can run my hands through it and its not breaking thats incredible  i plan to use it    x week as recommended for seriously damaged hair im very happy   yes the bottle is small  its     ounces  thats small  but i have very thick hair and when you apply it to towel dried hair it spreads like crazy because its super creamy i barely used any in my first application and i made sure it was on all the damage  double the amount in front i expect that my results will only improve with continued use i wish i could afford the shampoo and conditioner  alas  not this pay period  mortgage and such    so my suggestion is      buy it      
108,1.0,                       used the whole bottle     didn t do anything  sometimes even left it on for as long  as    hours  disappointed  i have bleach blonde hair so i was excited to see at least some repair     maybe i got a defective bottle      
109,5.0,                       i know theres some debate over whether or not this olaplex is legitimate  i would be upset if i did not have noticeable results but after even   treatment i m impressed i put my hair through the ringer with bleaching and hot tools and the deep conditioners i use only improved my hair for about a day  after my first session of olaplex    i noticed my hair was much softer  shinier and thicker  it doesnt have much of a smell which is nice since i wouldnt want my scented conditioner to clash with anything so whatever is in this bottle  it s still pretty amazing     
110,1.0,                       as many reviews stated  this is the worst thing to happen to my hair  my hair literally broke in half  i didn t change anything about my routine  it seems as though it either works or it really damages your hair beyond repair  for me  it was the latter and now i want to cry  if you dye your hair blond  be very very careful      
111,1.0,                       i m not      sure but i think this product may be making my hair fall out   i have been using olaplex         and    for a few months and i began noticing more hair than normal falling out afterwards  i stopped using it as often but used it again recently and noticed the extra hair fallout again  not sure if it s one or all three of the products that are the problem   i ve decided not to use any of it anymore      
112,5.0,                       i have platinum blonde bleached hair and i have been using this for at least a year and i will never stop  my colorist uses step one when she bleaches my roots and step   when she applies the toner  i use step   once per week  my hair is in remarkable condition considering the abuse i put it through  it doesn t feel like mush when it s wet and it doesn t look like cotton candy when it s dry which i see on a lot of bleached blondes  i think the recommended time to leave it in your hair is at least    minutes  i put it on the night before i want to wash my hair  leave it on overnight and wash it out in the morning  the results will amaze you      
113,5.0,                       i was able to   treatments out of this little bottle  it has made such an improvement to my fine wavy hair   hair damage consists of coloring a couple times a year   very hard water  i am buying another bottle for me and   more for my daughter      
114,5.0,                       most amazing product  i ve used this for many applications including perms  bleaching  color correction and extremely damaged hair  no product works better  if used as instructed at three times per week and you have long or thick hair think about buying two or the entire treatment kit  this is a very small bottle  although it does cover a lot if you don t get results from this product there  no product that can      
115,5.0,                       after dying and bleaching my hair so many times while in lockdown  it was super damaged  i was getting scared i was gonna have to chop it  after the first treatment with the olaplex   my hair was manageable again  very happy with the product  i know each hair type responds differently to treatments  my hair is really fine and this worked great for me  i don t know how it is for other hair types      
116,5.0,                       i am blessed with incredibly resilient hair but we all need a pick me up after a bleach job  i did a home bleaching  which you all know can be quite dangerous  over top some old henna  my hair needed a bit of a pick me up and olaplex is honestly magical  aside from the color  i wouldn t be able to tell i d just bleached my hair  it s so so so soft and there are no split ends  i literally can t believe how wonderful this product is i used it overnight  i got home  wet my hair in the sink  and ran the olaplex through my hair  i started at the ends and worked my way up so i got a light coating up around my roots  i put on a shower cap and a towel over top to keep it insulated  and when i went to bed i put the towel over my pillow  i woke up and washed it out  and put a little bit of lush s r b on the ends before i blow dried it  my hair is so soft now and not brittle at all  i am so grateful that this product exists      
117,5.0,                       i ve been using this product for years and i will always stand by it and i constantly recommend it to everyone  however  it is important to note that this product works best if you re already using other products that are good for your hair such as sulfate free shampoos and deep conditioners  nonetheless  this is what will make your hair soft and silky after several rounds of bleaching  breakage  permanent and semi permanent dyes  lighteners  and toners note  olaplex won t fix your hair or the damage done to your hair as only cutting it off permanently can give you the healthiest hair  but olaplex will help to build the bonds in your hair so that it doesn t split and break      
118,5.0,                       i am natural and after getting color and my hair straightened my hair was fried  i was working so hard to grow it and it was finally looking and feeling amazing  after i got my hair done  my hair just looked dead  my hair stayed straight after washing it  after several different protein and moisturizing treatments  i could see my hair on some parts trying to curl but other parts were just straight  i just finished using this for the first time had to write a review  there is not one straight strand  all of my hair looks amazing  its not like it was but it looks       better  i just purchased more because i am confident my curls will completely come back with this   i may just do the whole line of products but we will see      
119,5.0,                       i ordered this and then started digging into reviews  a lot of people reviewed stating that its fake  im no pro but i dont think thats the case  it comes directly from olaplex and has a factory seal  it made my hair feel amazing  similar to when i have olaplex done at the salon     
120,5.0,                       this product is amazing  i have very over processed dried out bleached hair  i am trying to go back to my natural medium brown color and restore health to my hair  i used this product for the first time and wow  am i impressed  after one use my hair is already fuller  less frizzy  and much more hydrated  after over processing  my hair lost a lot of its natural curl and after one use of olaplex no    i have my natural texture back  i have very long thick hair so i left the product in closer to    mins for my first use and it did not weigh down or over condition  feels great after shampoo and conditioner  will purchase again      
121,1.0,                       this product is not authentic  smells completely different  bad  than one from sephora and does not do anything to help your hair  i was wondering why this product that people rave about did not seem to do much for my hair  now i know why  you are better off ordering anywhere else      
122,5.0,                       i have not found a better product for my split ends  i have wavy hair that gets very damaged from highlights  for this reason i can highlight only once a year  i may be able to up that as this stuff is great  i put it on a couple times a week and leave it in overnight     wash in the am and believe me when i say   my split ends are almost non existent  would definitely recommend this product      
123,3.0,                       it s a small bottle and i never used a lot in my hair because i was trying to preserve it and make it last  so i didn t see much of a difference in my hair  i can imagine if you used more product along with the olaplex shampoo and conditioner it would really fix your hair  unfortunately too pricey to repurchase or buy the whole line      
124,1.0,                       so not worth the money   does not work as well as some drug store brands      
125,4.0,                       this product is not a miracle product but with consistent use it really works  i got three use from the bottle and it helps alot  but i still think it is over priced for the small bottle     
126,5.0,                       i am a box dyed blonde and i m not ashamed of it  i am very careful to space out colorings and i use pureology color care shampoo and conditioner to keep my hair healthy  this being said  any colored hair takes a beating and this is a great way to show your locks some love  this sticker price seems like a lot  but this stuff actually delivers  i applied this after a color and rinse then left it on over night  my hair looks good as new and feels silky soft  i also love that it doesn t leave my hair greasy during application or after washing out like other masques have in the past      
127,5.0,                       this is the best hair product i have ever used  i had a severe hair fall and i was able to see a visible difference after the first use  i love this amazing product and will continue to buy this  wish i had come across this earlier      
128,5.0,                       this product is a game changer for my dyed  heat styled hair  i am trying to grow out my hair while still having fun being a fake redhead  after each use     minutes left on damp hair  my hair is silky smooth and visibly in better condition  i will definitely be a regular olaplex no    user   this is my holy grail product      
129,5.0,                       update  i ve been bleaching my hair for over a year now  this is my  th bottle of this olaplex  i stopped for a while because i find it expensive  but my hair got trashed really quick from two bleaching sessions with no olaplex in between  i even tried doing rice water protein masks  but didn t notice a difference  my hair was so damaged it wouldn t dry on its own and was falling out a lot more than usual  went back to putting this on overnight once a week and after the first wash my hair felt semi soft instead of brittle  this stuff makes a huge difference and saves my hair so i can have that bleached look i enjoy it s pretty expensive for how little comes in it  also you have to leave it on way longer than the bottle says  i recommend leaving it on overnight or at least   hours  it didn t make my hair seem stronger or softer until after i did a     hour treatment on dry hair with it  online it says after    min it does something  but that s not my experience  also i have very thick hair halfway to my waist and it only did   treatments      
130,5.0,                       heaven in a bottle  i am not kidding when i say that  i slept with this in my hair and had a plastic wrap over it  then in the morning i washed it out as normal   shamppo and conditioner  and my hair was back to that before i ever died it feeling  i do this every     weeks but not every week  in between i use   art naturals argan oil hair mask  deep conditioner   oz       organic jojoba oil  aloe vera   keratin  repair dry  damaged or color treated hair after shampoo  best for all hair types   sulfate free  that yuo can get here on amazon as well  but this stuff is no joke   must have if your needing help asap   and  its afforadable      
131,5.0,                       i bought this and then read the reviews and opinions that it is fake  so  i bought an official bottle from sephora  they look identical in every way      label  bottle   cap  smell  consistency and results on a swatch  i m pretty confident this seller has the real deal  just so you can feel confident about it      
132,5.0,                       my results were amazing  i left it on for about   hours  i have curly hair and i air dried and then flat ironed and my hair felt so thick for the first time in years  it felt so healthy and moisturized but not oily  when i went curly again the same thickness was present and i hadn t even used the product again yet  i have fine hair but have always had a lot of hair until i got pregnant and apparently my daughter took all my hair  i ve been struggling with flat hair and this has made a tremendous difference for me      
133,5.0,                       my hair was so bleached it looked like cotton   toners washed right out with the first shampoo until i found olapex     it has changed the structure of my hair so it s smooth and shinier  easier to style  too   it s not a conditioner  it bonds your hair  closing the cuticle and allowing toners to do what they are supposed to do   no more cotton top   it s a little pricey but it s worth it      
134,5.0,                       this stuff works great  bottle is tiny but worth it      
135,5.0,                       i have use this product   times by now and i can definitely see a difference my hair was so fragile and thin and dry  the first time it felt stronger but still dry  i went and bought some silicone free products  shea moisture  to combine and then did the treatment again overnight  the second time was better still dry but i could tell it was feeling thicker and shiny  there third time by far have been the best  i haven t seen my hair this strong in at least a year  i m excited to try again i will buy again definitely to keep it healthy and also use silicone free oils and moisture    definitely recommend it  if you use it the right way you will see a result make sure you wash your hair before with a strong shampoo or rinse like vinegar to remove residue and you will see a better result in my experience      
136,3.0,                       ok i purchased this because i bleached my hair   this came recommend i ve never used this b   first time bought it here so i don t hv anything to compare it to  and i say that because unfortunately  i hv come to find out that some products sold here on amazon are not the real deal  even when in description bit might say it is  so with that said  i was hoping to see at least some moisture in my hair  a bit of softness  a lil sheen but this does nothing for my hair but except to leave it feeling starchy   ugh i wish i could return this but already past the due date so i leave u with this  buy at ur own risk      
137,5.0,                       i have natural curly afroam hair  type  abc  i get about     uses from this tiny bottle  cant lie the somewhat high price hurts but the stuff works  hair is lightened honey color  began breaking so much  got      done   salon   i purchased    to use between visits  i use twice month   salon visits every  ish months  definitely noticed a difference within  st month      
138,5.0,                       this isn t meant to moisturize or dry  so no comment for that  i have tried the shampoo  conditioner and bond smoother as well  if nothing else  get the hair perfector    this is a staple for life        
139,5.0,                       you guys i am shook  this stuff is out of this world  i ve always had super frizzy  rough and stiff wavy hair  even when it was virgin and  healthy   i bleached my medium brown hair tonight over coconut oil twice and then toned  i then applied this and just left it in because my hair dried with it on and i didnt want to get it wet again and my hair has never been so soft  my waves are back and they re not nearly as frizzy or stiff  my hair is baby soft  shiny and strong  it looks and feels healthier than it did before i bleached it   what   i will never stop using this miracle product      
140,5.0,                       this is quite possibly the most amazing treatment conditioning mask that i ve ever purchased for my hair  i have bought a lot of hair products and nothing compares to this olaplex  i was concerned at first that i would go through the bottle really quickly  however  you don t seem to need that much each time due to the consistency of the product  i use it about once per week  i notice a huge change after i use it  my hair is much more sleek and soft without being heavy or oily      
141,1.0,                       way to costly for little return  i have thick bleached has hair that is healthy but could always use more softness  i got nothing from using this that any product from trader joe s can t do  i guess i need the multi step  not interested at the bougie price  though      
142,5.0,                       this product saved my hair  my hair stylist recommended i buy this as a once a week treatment for my hair  and it s never been healthier i let mine stay in longer than recommended  and sometimes even over night and wash it out in the morning  if you style or color your hair at all this product will be your new best friend      
143,5.0,                       just bleached my hair pale ash blonde from a virgin level   black  only shampoo once or twice a month  no or very rare heat  hair masks in lieu of washing about once a week  so my hair started out pretty healthy and stayed pretty healthy through the bleaching and toning but it got a bit dry on the ends i used it after bleaching and before toning  i ve only used it once but have also been doing hair oil treatments and some other hair masks i ve never used before through the whole ordeal so it s hard to pinpoint what helped most  i ll update after a few weeks of use but whatever the cause  my hair is     back to its former glory     taken off because it s got way more volume now which i m assuming is due to some inevitable damage that i cannot feel with my fingers  even after   bleaching processes with    volume and one toning session with    volume  if you ve already got unhealthy hair and you don t take care of it  i doubt it ll help you but it will probably help maintain healthy hair through something like bleaching note  i gave it   stars because it s worth investing in but ideally i d knock off a star because the bottle is so small  expected this  added carmex to a picture for scale  and you have to use so much even for a guy like me with shortish hair  just not cost effective enough for me to buy it more than once seeing as i take good care of my hair      
144,5.0,                       purchased for my daughter with a hair net to help her curls  did not realize how tiny the bottle was so definitely expensive for the size of bottle but overall i think it s a good product      
145,5.0,                       this stuff is amazing   not to sound dramatic but maybe even life changing    i ve been using it for quite some time now  my hair feels like silk after i use this  it s so moisturizing and restorative and it actually smells good  perfect for bleached hair       
146,2.0,                       i ve been using redkins ph bonder treatment for a few weeks and decided to give this a try  my hair was pretty broken after my last bleaching toning  after one use  waiting until my hair was completely dry  i noticed that the texture of my hair appeared dryer than it did before  i found that the redkin product works much better and it s way less expensive  hair feels much silkier with the redkin product      
147,5.0,                       this product works so well  i bleached my hair twice in a week and as you can imagine it was damaged  while bleached hair will never have the same texture as virgin hair my texture is pretty good after sleeping with this in my hair a few nights  as they tell you  it is not a conditioner and doesn t act like one  but it s great for intensive repair      
148,5.0,                       great product that gives a nice healthy boost to your hair  i am currently transitioning to curly hair  i just got my second big chop and i massaged this into small sections throughout my wet hair  i left in in for about an hour then washed regular and it made my curls pop  my mom likes her straight hair and she blow dries her hair frequently  she has put this in her hair   times with a few weeks in between and her hair looks visibly healthier and and stronger  the bottle is enough for   times of use if you have medium amount of hair  i believe for thinner hair you can make it up to    i would recommend this to anyone       
149,5.0,                       shooked at how my hair transformed over   weeks from using this weekly  the moisturizing is a result after you style your hair  the scent while applying does not smell like a perm      
150,5.0,                       if there is one hair product i could recommend to anyone it is this  i have curly hair and this actually makes a difference  leave it on for at least an hour before you shower  if hair is really dry damaged do an overnight treatment  it leaves my hair so soft and the technology actually repairs your hair  get this      
151,5.0,                       this product truly will protect and save your hair  especially when bleaching  this is a must have if you lighten your hair  also recommend olaplex   and    make sure your salon stylist use this  and buy the new   and   shampoo and conditioner  i now have level    hair with gray coloring ombre  ps and i have long hair that did not break    olaplex made it possible and kept my hair safe      
152,5.0,                       so i have suuuuper damaged hair and i wanted to try this as it had amazing reviews and even brad mondo uses it  i have only used it once but so far i love it  it s not a miracle one use thing for sure  but i already have high hope s because with just one use i can see and feel a pretty significant difference  if you are on the fence  get it  it is small but you only need a little because it works through the hair really well  i have below shoulder length hair and i only needed like   dollaps  sp       
153,5.0,                       this helps my damaged hair a lot  i bleached it many times and i use this treatment to help with breakage      
154,5.0,                       i had to bleach my hair to remove stubborn dark hair dye  color remover would not work  after bleaching twice my hair was really damaged  my ends especially  they were very dry and coarse  i ordered this and no      time use of both and a deep conditioner brought my hair back to life  my ends are still a little dry but i feel if i continue to use this it will revive them  i am so so so happy           
155,5.0,                       i do not know what voodoo magic this stuff is but it rocks  my daughters bleach damaged hair is soft and not an unholy knitted frizzy mess  even better it is not heavy or oily in anyway  this is the best thing i have ever bought for her hair  i am beyond words how amazing this product is      
156,5.0,                       so grateful for this product my fine thin curly hair was always so unsightly that until i was    i would wear a bandana or hat and took the time to wear it down just a few times a year and it still flew away and looked like crap within    minutes     thats no way for a young woman to live  i had given up i decided i d relax it risking the chemical damage and there was a little  enough to risk length with my fine hair  the ends were so dry that they would tangle and break  this product made it as if i had always had long smooth straight healthy locks   and for that i am so grateful  i wear my hair down all of the time  have taken such delight in getting to know my hair and learning to style it  and feel like a new woman entirely  thank you olaplex  relaxing my hair turned into a wonderfully life changing decision rather than a choppy gummy nightmare thanks to you ps  i know they say it runs its course totally after    minutes but i feel like the result of the time i slept with it in was monumentally better than the time i washed it out after an hour      
157,5.0,                       i was foolish and tried to bleach my hair myself and dye it purple   of course that didn t turn out so great   i bleached it twice in one day because i couldn t get my natural dark hair light enough   after it dried i was horrified at the damage i had done and my hair wasn t even blonde lol   my hair was fried   when i touched the ends it felt like pubic hair   sorry for my description but that s the best way i can describe it i took the risk buying this on amazon   i was worried it wouldn t work since i never did step   and   but oh my gosh it worked   after watching tutorials on youtube on how to properly apply it to damp hair i was surprised at how much better it felt   it s not a miracle product  ladies and gentleman   i still had to cut some of my ends but i didn t have to cut as much as i originally anticipated   i may update pictures when i m in better lighting so you can see proof piece of advice   apply on damp hair   this helps you use less product   section your hair and make sure your hair is saturated   trust me  you don t have to use the whole bottle even if you have long hair   a small amount will coat your hair   i have hair past my shoulders and have done three treatments and still have a lot in my bottle   also  use a wide tooth brush on your hair to make sure it is coated evenly i left it on for about    to    minutes and then added a hair mask on top of it and waited about    more minutes with it wrapped   after that i rinsed it with cool water with a tiny bit of shampoo at the scalp area i did not towel dry my hair since it can be harsh on brittle hair   instead i gently twisted my hair to remove excess water   while my hair was damp i applied oil only to my ends and let it air dry my hair feels amazing   good luck guys   if you guys have just dry hair you probably don t need to do all the steps i did but i totally destroyed my hair   and i m telling you  just the product alone made my hair feel soft      
158,5.0,                       where to begin   first  this is not a conditioning mask   do not think that it is and try to use it as one  i use this on damp hair and left it on for    minutes  after  i washed my hair as usual  i blow dried on low heat and then straightened my before hair dry  unmanageable  frizzy  lacklustermy after hair i have my hair back from when i was     after one use  i am blown away  before  my hair wouldn t straighten even on the hottest setting  it would end up frizzy and immediately curl when i stepped outside  after my first use  i could turn my heat way down and my hair straightened like magic  i am ecstatic  i can t wait to see how it looks after a few months of using once a week      
159,5.0,                       i don t do a whole lot of amazon reviews but this one deserves it   i used this together with olaplex no     put no   on dry  clean hair  then i put no   on over top of that   i know it says to leave on    min  but i left on overnight   first of all  it smells incredible   i love the smell   and then the next morning i shampoo and condition and after i dry my hair  after just one use there was noticeable difference in the texture and flyaways   did not weigh hair down  i have long  very fine hair that was over processed and i use this     times a week and it keeps my hair very nice   i will get it again   have used about   times and only halfway through both bottles     
160,1.0,                       i wish i could ve seen results or enjoyed this product like others  this has not improved the conditions of my hair that i recently bleached  my hair is now much dryer and more dead and tangled  i ve tried switching shampoos and conditioners  including the amount of time i leave the bonder  in my hair      
161,5.0,                       i ve used this one time so far but i saw the difference in my hair texture as soon as i got out of the shower  i left it in for about    min before rinsing out  my hair has been so damaged  it didn t want to be it s bouncy  curly self  i ve bleached it many times over and finally saw the damaging effects  it was lifeless  straw like and kind of just limp  also it tangled a lot  i let my hair air dry and it felt soft and a lot less tangled for the first time in months  it was also curlier than i ve seen it since june  overall  super happy with the product  it s a small bottle but using this saves me money on buying a million other products to tame frizz  make it manageable  i used a bit frizz cream and i was good to go  i am going to use overnight this time like a few reviews suggested and see how that works      
162,5.0,                       so i don t normally write reviews  but this product is so unbelievable i felt compelled to  i ve had my hair bleached countless time over the past   years  and prior to that i colored my hair frequently with box dyes  i usually have a new hair color every few months so needless to say my hair was pretty brittle  well i got my hair done  balayage  again about a month ago  and touched up the color with toner at home this week  well after the touch up my hair was fried  i even used the lowest volume developer       so i found this beauty of a product and decided to give it a try and i don t regret anything  this stuff is amazing  before using it i couldn t run my fingers through my hair because it was so dry   i was afraid of brushing it because i could just see it all breaking off and i d pull heaps out of my brush  but after using this  for the first time since i started dying my hair i can run my fingers through my hair smoothly   i brushed my bed head out this morning with virtually no breakage and almost nothing ended up in my brush i only left it on yesterday for about     hours and only used maybe an eight of the bottle  i m going to try leaving it on overnight next treatment to see what that does  this product is      worth every penny      
163,5.0,                       bottle is small but a little goes a long way  i absolutely destroyed my hair bleaching it  after cutting off the dead i used this on the remainder of my hair and it really has made my hair feel soft and silky again  i did have to buy two bottles and it did take over a month to get the desired texture i was looking for  but it was worth it      
164,5.0,                       i have only used this product once and i can already see a huge difference in my hair  i had very dry  damaged hair after bleaching and not properly putting moisture in and after one use my hair feels less like hay  obviously this is not a miracle  i do still need to keep up with maintenance and moisture masks  but it truly does make a difference even on the first use  i would say it is worth the price if you were in the same position as me where your hair needed serious repair  but expect a small bottle for the price being on the higher side  bottom line  it really works and i would definitely purchase again      
165,5.0,                       hair savior  if you color or damage your hair  buy this  i have been using olaplex for years  prepandemic i used to go to a well known beauty chain to pick this up but due to not wishing to go out into the world i ordered this from amazon and i am very pleased      
166,1.0,                       i have used this product about  x since i purchased it  hoping each time might get better it didn t  this is a straight trash product   will damage your hair more then help it  i have some what dry hair from getting a balayage  so i was looking for a product to help put some moisture back into my hair  this is the total opposite  dried my hair out even more   had to go get a deep conditioning at my salon  if you re looking for a mask type of product this is not it      
167,5.0,                       this is the greatest product i have ever used on my hair  i use a clarifying shampoo first then towel dry then put this on  wait ten minutes  rinse then shampoo and condition with my normal shampoo and conditioner  i have waste length hair and my hair has seriously not looked this amazing since i was in my twenties  my sister has shoulder length healthy hair  i had her try this and we were both stunned at what a difference it made  you literally get noticeably repaired hair after just one use   i strongly recommend the clarifying shampoo first though  that way you have no product residue on your hair and get the full benefit of the olaplex      
168,2.0,                       i wish i would have taken a picture  i didn t actually use this because i looked through the questions and someone asked why the bottle said   m on the back instead of   m  the pictures on the website and even in the listing says   m  so i went ahead and returned it and ordered from sephora which indeed says   m  i don t know  i just didn t want to take a chance on something i m putting in my hair  lol     
169,5.0,                       i ended up cutting my hair short in august of      because my ends were looking pretty terrible and the rest of my hair wasn t too great either  i ve been trying to grow it back out while taking better care of it  although because my hair dries super weird and frizzy  i usually end up using more heat than i want to  the olaplex hair perfector no   has done a fantastic job of keeping my hair smoother and looking healthier the directions say to leave on for at least    minutes  but i try to leave it on for at least an hour  usually close to two  i know that isn t possible for some of us  but i have noticed it definitely works better the longer you leave it on your hair  my hair is so soft and silky afterwards  my hair has grown out quite a bit in the last few months and i think the olaplex might have something to do with that  it looks so much better than what it did before i cut it all off      
170,1.0,                       tiny amount for the price so  be aware it s only  oz  i got this because a friend reccomended it  honestly     i was expecting so much more  my hair is still dry  doesn t seem to have helped at all  i wouldn t reccomend this product to anyone      
171,5.0,                       i blow dry and either straighten or curl my hair    x per week  this stuff has definitely done wonders to keep it from becoming a bag of straw  smells good  makes my hair feel good      
172,5.0,                       my hair takes a lot of abuse   we have a vehicle that doesn t have air conditioning   my hair get blown and dried out   one day i had on a black t shirt and there was little broken pieces of hair all over it   it is a whole lot harder to get those little pieces off than it is a whole strand of hair   my hairdresser suggested i get olaplex and use it   wow i wore the same t shirt and there was hardly any hair on it at all   i will be using this faithfully      
173,1.0,                       i have a really brittle hair  it is not damaged it just dried  i used it and it gave me a super soft feeling for a few hours and then it s gone  such a waste of money  but i got my lesson      
174,5.0,                       i used this for the first time yesterday  slept with it in my hair and woke up this morning and washed it out  i can t believe how much better my hair looks and feels after the first use  i went from brown to platinum really fast and fried the heck out of my hair  my hair is still breaking a little but nothing like it was before i used this  i would have broken hairs all over my shoulders by the end of the day    no more  i can t wait to use this again  i will add an update after a few more uses with photos      
175,5.0,                       this is exactly the same as my olaplex   from my salon  it works very well  especially if left on overnight  i use in combination with the shampoo and condition       and have noticed a lot less breakage and damage  my hair is extremely long and bleached regularly  but i have very little noticeable damage thanks to this product      
176,4.0,                       olaplex absolutely worked for me  in two sessions  it restored my over colored over heated hair to a more attractive texture and has strengthened it noticeably  my pictures show my hair brushed after drying naturally before olaplex  then after a home coloring and two treatments of olaplex  i love that you can leave the treatment on your hair and let it work overnight and it doesn t leave your head greasy  the downside as many have stated is the price and amount you get  one bottle only contains enough for me to use it three times  and my hair could use more repair than that   i wish this product was more affordable so people on different budgets could treat themselves  will i buy it again  maybe once in a blue moon when my hair is especially dried out and when i can spend a little extra      
177,5.0,                       i was recommended this product by my hairdresser after i had decided to go from dark chocolate brunette to bleach blonde in a matter of   month  any who knows hair knows that my ends were absolutely fried  i loved having my long hair but i wanted healthy hair as well  after the  st use of olaplex no    my hair felt like silk  it was shiny  lustrous  soft to the touch  and most importantly returning to its natural health  while being a blonde was tiring and i eventually went back to brunette  i still use olaplex no   and i ll never use any other hair restoring mask again      
178,5.0,                       nurgle s wife here  i compared this with the olaplex that i bought directly from olaplex and it appeared to be the same in every way  i like olaplex and use   regularly  it works great for keeping my hair in good shape and keeping split ends at bay  my hair is naturally wavy and if i don t feel like trying to coax out curls  i ll use a small amount of olaplex in my hair after my shower  then brush my hair straight  and let it dry  it dries very straight  feels soft and smooth  and it doesn t feel weighed down  i don t use a lot of product  maybe a dime size  but i have thin hair so it doesn t take much for me      
179,4.0,                       with     you get smoothed hair and long term repair  the downside is  you have to use a generous amount of product to see immediate results  i don t use    or    but i m guessing this works better when combined with those  the scent is great  i didn t find it as moisturizing so the  rd time i used it i  washed  my hair with just conditioner afterwards and preferred those results  i did purchase    as well  which i gave   stars for instant  smoothing results and i only need a dime size of    on my long hair  my hair is colored but not damaged   i definitely recommend    for long term help with damage and    for smooth results that make hair look better instantly and over time      
180,2.0,                       i have graying hair which has been colored treated  it is naturally wavy  i followed the instructions and left it on my hair for    minutes  i feel no difference  my hair is coarse and frizzy  it doesn t look any different  it is not shiny or smooth  i am deeply disappointed given the rave reviews  would not recommend nor would i waste     on this ever again  i could bought any conditioner and it would have have had the same  lack of  results  then i d have     in my pocket      
181,5.0,                       this actually works  i leave it in as long as possible  usually i ll pick a day where i don t have to leave and just leave it on all day  it actually changes my hair texture  it s amazing  i wish the results lasted longer  you definitely have to keep up with it  ive fou d that using very little is still very effective  i ve used a lot  and used a little spread out very well with the same results      
182,5.0,                       my hair has improved so much since i ve started using this   it is finally growing and looking healthy again  i love this product   i watch for sales because it is expensive   i have shoulder length hair and one bottle will do my hair   times easily      
183,5.0,                       at first i was shocked at the size of the bottle  for this price    but after one use the difference is incredible  my hair feels so much softer and smoother  i lightly cleansed my hair with cowash  towel dried then applied the olaplex  put hair up in a clip and put a shower cap on and went about my sunday  puttering around the house and doing chores  eight hours later i rinsed  washed and conditioned and have enjoyed startlingly improved hair texture and manageability in the week since  so delighted with the results      
184,5.0,                       this product worked wonders on my damaged hair  i could immediately feel a difference when i rinsed it out  the individual strands felt stronger  and my hair overall felt fuller  i let my hair air dry  and my curls were bouncy and soft  i was also surprised by how little product it took to saturate my hair  i thought given the size of the bottle i wouldn t get many uses out of it  but i probably only used a tenth of the bottle to cover my medium length hair  i can t wait to see how great my hair looks and feels after a few weeks treatments      
185,3.0,                       pros   it does make my hair healthier and softer  not an extreme change  but at least     better than it was   it does smells good  although the smell doesn t stay in your hair when you rinse it off cons   very expensive  for the size of the bottle and the amount of product you get   not convenient to use  you have to wash your hair before using  as most of us with damaged hair  use products to keep the hair manageable   then apply the product  wait for it to work and take another shower to wash your hair again  i wish olaplex made a leave in conditioner with healing properties that wasn t so time consuming      
186,5.0,                       this is the real deal   i am totally amazed i am in my sixties but a young sixty   i always had silky beautiful hair   i begin having issues for the last few years   i am taking supplements and i have spent a lot on many products  but this one is by far the jackpot   i plan to by the entire product line       
187,5.0,                       i m not exaggerating   this literally saved my over bleached blonde hair   i was thinking of cutting off my below the shoulder length hair   i wish i had taken pictures of my hair before and after  my hair looked like yellow straw before   it was stiff and would not curl   after just one treatment  my hair looked better and had a softness to it that it had not had in over   years   i ve used it twice now and i bought the shampoo and conditioner so i think i will see even better results over time   thank you  olplex      
188,1.0,                       i have virgin all natural hair  however  my hair is very dry and i was looking for something to repair damage from blow dryer and heat  i used the bottle twice and follow the instructions exactly writing on the bottle and even went and watched youtube videos just to be sure  after using this product twice on my hair  i did not see any results  in fact  my hair got more dry and brittle  and i noticed every time i used this product  my hair is falling  for those of you who have natural virgin hair  be careful      
189,5.0,                       i didn t have a bad experience after my first use but i can t tell just yet if it has worked or is working  the bottle is small but a little goes a long way  i still have maybe three more applications left  i will continue using until the bottle is empty and then i ll be able to make a decision  also  i was skeptical about purchasing this because of some of the reviews i read  i will say  the product i received was not watered down  even though i can t tell if it s fake or not  if this product works for me i would order again      
190,5.0,                       i have used this product for    yrs and i can honestly say it saved my hair  this product restores my damaged hair due to chemical and heat use  i use it   to   times a week and it keeps my hair soft  intact and strong      
191,5.0,                       okay so i get why it s so expensive now  i had over processed my hair and it was so badly damaged  it was breaking  i tried everything  any hair product that said anything about  for damaged hair   and it was still breaking  i didn t want to chop all my hair off because i ve spent the last   years growing it out so i bought this stuff  no duh  it saved it  like completely saved it  don t get me wrong  i still had to cut a couple inches off the bottom but that was a lot better than  you know  having to chop like   inches of hair off  no breaking  it s slowly coming back to life and feeling soft again  i can t believe it  if you re wondering if it s really worth the money  i m telling you it is      
192,5.0,                       i have always wanted silky hair   had to color and highlight it at home heard nothing but raves so bought olaplex for processing and    it works          
193,4.0,                       i made the mistake of bleaching the ever lovin  out of my hair  so i ve been looking for something to help it come back to life without going to the salon  not something i wanna due during our current global situation   this definitely made a difference  just not as much as i was hoping for  still  any difference is better than nothing      
194,1.0,                       i read numerous reviews that sang rejoices over this product  so i had high hopes  i used the product     times per week and left it in for    hours or more each use and saw little to no results  my hair is still as tangled and dry as it was prior to using  wondering if i didn t get the real product  or what happened there  will not be repurchasing again  very disappointed      
195,5.0,                       so like many of you  i was stupid enough to bleach my hair at home   multiple times   my natural hair color is a dark brown almost black  and i lightened it to nearly blonde so i could go red   i loved the color but the damage  not so much   it s been like   months since i stopped bleaching my hair and it s come a long way  but i still get comments about how to deal with the damage to my hair   so i ordered this which came highly recommended   i also bought the conditioner   i left the product on over night and then woke up and washed and conditioned my hair   i definitely notice a huge difference both in the texture and appearance of mg hair   this is only after one trearment   i m doing round   tonight and will probably do     treatments a week for a while   this definitely seems like it will help reduce the length i will need to remove   yay      
196,1.0,                       im very disappointed this is not the same product i purchased from hairstylists  i finshed off the product purchased from hairstylists and have been using  olaplex  purchased from amazon for the past   weeks  the product doesn t smell the same  feel the same nor does it condition my hair  i am very disappointed  i didn t mind paying double      vs     via amazon to avoid having to bother hairstylists pickup the product for me  i d rather pay her      i will be returning if possible      
197,5.0,                       i am using this weekly along with the olaplex shampoo conditioner   i am pleased with the repair it seems to be doing to my dry brittle hair      
198,5.0,                       this product is amazing  it s transformed my damaged hair  i can t recommend this product enough  my stylist stopped using it in her salon in order to cut costs and switched to something else  her new product doesn t work so i ve been buying this myself and using it and getting the same great salon results  it makes my hair so soft and smooth  i have highlighted hair that only had minimal damage until i took a medication that caused my hair to fall out and break off  it was the worst my hair had looked in my life  it s slowly growing back and olaplex is helping it to look and feel healthier as it grows out  i m not great about using it religiously  but when i do my hair is amazing      times a week is ideal for really damaged hair and you don t need much      
199,1.0,                       i ve been using this product from my stylist and there is no scent when i buy it from a salon  i opened this a it has a fragrance  it didn t leave my hair feeling the same either  although the container came sealed  this is not the same olaplex   i ve gotten from hairdressers     
200,1.0,                       used around   times and i dont see any difference  im really dissapointed  all the good reviews and i got no resultsi i left the product for hours and still nothing  instead i got amazing results with a     hair mask  hydrating argan oil hair mask and deep conditioner by arvazallia   applied and left it in for   hours before washing      
201,1.0,                       my hair did not feel stronger or look healthier after using olaplex    i followed the directions exactly  instead of repairing  it noticeably dulled my dyed auburn hair color  then  gobs of hair fell out over the next couple weeks  regular shedding from the roots  not breakage from damage   i do not bleach my hair  i only use permanent dye to darken my hair  the good reviews i saw for no    must really be for no     used when lightening hair color in a salon      
202,5.0,                       i m an olaplex convert  i have virgin  shoulder length  relatively undamaged hair  but it s always been prone to breakage  frizzy  and not as shiny as i d like  i wasn t sure if this would do anything since my hair didn t have too much damage to repair  but wow    it s shinier than i ve ever seen it  no frizz even on a rainy day  and it just looks and feels healthier  looks like i got a blowout without the damage  i use it once every week or two to maintain results  definitely worth the money  i just wish i could find it in a larger bottle      
203,5.0,                       first   definitely use a clarifying shampoo  i actually used dawn dish soap  it is gentle and works great  lathering up   rinsing twice before applying olaplex    i was only able to leave product on my hair for    minutes but after rinsing  shampooing and following up with my usual leave in conditioner  i let it air dry while lying down  not even attempting to style it  lazy day   after i let it dry  my mother noticed how shiny my hair was instantly  she was unaware i had used it   very happy and will update as i use bottle      
204,5.0,                       i love this stuff  i typically put it on at night and let it sit until after my morning run   nothing drips into my face when i run  i sometimes put a small amount in my just showered hair and dry as normal  when i rinse it the following day  it is amazingly soft      
205,5.0,                       i almost didn t believe the hype  but believe it   i ve been using a mix of vitamin c  dove  and clarifying shampoo to remove semi permanent color from my hair and the process has been damaging and drying  come in   olaplex  i used as directed  and found my hair feeling     better in the morning   oh yah  they don t recommend you leave it on overnight  as the product may get into your eyes  however  they also state that those who have left it on overnight have had positive results  and i am one of those people  i immediately purchased the olaplex shampoo and conditioner  and my hair was back to normal and feeling amazing in two days  i just purchased the leave in cream  i m obsessed      
206,1.0,                       the olaex i got did not do the job it claimed to  it has made my hair more dry and brittle   i thought it woul take a couple of months to show effect hence i waited to write the review    my hair has started falling more while shampooing and it has become so brittle as when i got chemical straightening done  i bought the whole series of olaplex  i feel its a pure rip off    what a waste of money     
207,1.0,                       didn t notice a difference in my head at all  i ve used it for both short periods of time     min  to long periods of time  over night    hrs  and didn t notice anything different  it felt as though i needed to put on my conditioner on even after putting this on      
208,1.0,                       i see that there are many positive reviews for this product  but also several negative reviews   my experience was negative   i started off with some dryness   i was hoping this product would give me a smoother  silkier look like in some of the photos   i ve been lightening my hair for quite some time and touch up my roots every few weeks  i haven t dyed the length of my hair for a long time    i started using this once a week letting it sit on my damp hair for about    minutes before washing  deep conditioning and drying styling as usual   at first i thought it looked like it was making some small improvements   and then   my hair started breaking off   i was in denial about it being the olaplaex so i kept using it   and things got worse   now i have a      layer of broken off hair on the top layer   it looks awful   it s so obvious  i can t hide it unless i wear my hair up  difficult since my hair isn t very long    i cannot believe the breakage and damage this product has caused   i figured the negative reviews were nonsense since there were so many positive reviews   i think this can work for some  but for others it fries their hair off and causes irreversible damage   in my opinion  it s not worth taking the gamble unless you re okay with all of your hair breaking off   maybe it ll work well for you   maybe you ll end up with a fried mullet      
209,1.0,                       a friend recommended this product after my aveda colorist did a balayage treatment on me for the first time  i have  or should i say had  long thick blonde hair  i used the product twice and started to notice a tremendous amount of breakage  i went back to my salon on friday to address the problem and he asked me whether i was using this product  by name  and when i said  yes  he gathered his employees around me to demonstrate what happens when a color treated blonde uses this product  they ve had a number of clients have the same problem so he told me to throw the product out immediately  i was at the salon for   hours  and to avoid cutting my hair into a chin length bob   i have to avoid blowdrying or flat ironing my hair for the next   months  i wash my hair twice a week  and let it air dry whenever possible  this is ridiculous  i look like i have a birds nest in the back of my head  can t return it to amazon  window expired  so now i m throwing it away  unreal      
210,5.0,                       i had been dying my hair black for almost   years  decided to change it up so i had to bleach it  my hair was destroyed but this stuff saved my hair  so worth it  my hair looked like a birds nest but even after just the first wash there was such a difference  i got   washes out of one bottle but i have long and thick hair  after the first bottle my hair was almost back to normal  i used two more bottles which i definitely didn t need to but did anyways lol but i m so happy  also recommend using with the shampoo and conditioner  and it smells great  well worth the money to save your hair      
211,5.0,                       i have been using thurs for many months now  my hairdresser puts olaplex into my dying  bleaching sessions   i use this olaplex   at home for upkeep in between my salon sessions  it has made such an incredible difference un my hair  it s so much stronger  shinier  healthier    i m so glad my hairdresser introduced me to this product as i get my hair processed   bleached so much this has been a lifesaver  i would only use it if you ve have the olaplex treatment done to your hair already like       if not its not worth just buying the     expecting to see a difference   also make sure you use it at least twice a week        
212,5.0,                       love this product  ive had some kind of damage from an unknown source of product   i had virgin hair  but my curls were dull  stringy  no pattern  frizzy  wirey  straight  my scalp was itchy and i had flakes unlike ever before   this is helping me get back to normal   i hope it continues to improve   first application was ok  second had better results  i now have some shine and curl pattern is beginning to look better  jak     
213,5.0,                       it s magic  ok  it s not magic  it s science and it performs it s authentic  i have ordered from amazon as seller and from the olaplex website   leaving it on damp hair for as long as possible  then shampoo and a goodly amount of conditioner is incredibly restorative my hair is porous  it fades and it s not actually fragile but can get very dull and miscolored  this corrects that  softens my hair  sends frizz to the distant memory closet and adds shine average thickness  but longer than mid back  a generous amount of this means     uses it s so worth it      
214,5.0,                       i was recommended to use olaplex  shampoo cream rinse and oplaplex   since my hair became damaged after bleaching and toning my hair to gray  instead of just growing it out  or cutting it short  i use it once a week and have seen a noticeable difference in texture and how it lays since it have started  the only warning i would say is that olaplex does wash out the toner  so i have to reapply a toner and   lift after each use      
215,5.0,                       i cant say enough good things about olaplex  except i wish it was a little cheaper   it didnt do much the first time i used it  left on my hair for a few hours before washing it  but after the third or fourth time i used it i could really feel a difference in my hair  i now use it about once a week or so  i have really thick hair so it doesnt last me super long but i will buy olaplex for a long long time  buying from amazon i was a little worried it might be a dup product but if it is i have not been able to tell at all      
216,1.0,                       this product feels and works like a cheap conditioner  i was soooo excited to try it and repair my damaged hair  but it did nothing to my hair  i left it on for about    minutes  it s supposed to work in     and no luck  will be returning the product      
217,5.0,                       i have very fine hair and over bleached some stands around my face  to the point it felt and looked like dry brittle straw   i thought i was completely out of luck and there would be no reversing it but one treatment made a huge difference  i was hesitant with the price but it was well worth it      
218,5.0,                       tried this today  i left it on for about an hour before i washed it out  i definitely can see an improvement in my split ends and my hair feels super soft  excited to try this on a weekly basis to see the longer term benefits     
219,5.0,                       the first time i used it  i followed directions  put a small amount on clean  towel dried hair  left it in a few hours then rinsed it out and shampoo condition again  my hair definitely seemed softer  the second time i followed step one and two but i got busy running errands so i tucked it into a hat and then later took off the hat and just let it air dry completely  my hair is even softer using it as a leave in  it doesn t even seem like i need to wash it out  it feels amazing  for reference my hair dries pretty straight  it s fine and long so i m not sure how it would work for others  i use it once a week and try to only wash my hair     times a week  i hope i can continue to use it as a leave in because the instructions on the bottle are kind of time consuming      
220,3.0,                       i didn t see any difference in my hair   i may need the whole line      
221,3.0,                       this is the third time trying olaplex and it s just not doing anything for me  the bottle is so small and i have so much hair i thought   maybe it takes a few times to see any real results  but i think it s all hype  this doesn t work any better than your average conditioner      
222,5.0,                       i had brown hair and about   months ago made the decisions to go platinum blond it was fun for a while but many the bleach destroyed my hair  ive used this for   days and i ve already noticed a huge difference its made the frizz almost completely go away and its stopped a lot of breakage as well  a little expensive but you definitely get what you pay for  will continue to use for sure      
223,3.0,                       i think it is over priced  i use it most of the time over night as my hairdresser recommended  it definitely doesn t condition  i do use it an hour at a time too  the broken spot in my hair hasn t changed in months      
224,3.0,                       i m not sure i received authentic olaplex   the packaging  consistency etc is all on point  however  i gave myself a treatment yesterday and my hair looked crunchy today   my hair guy swears by olaplex and he s an absolute hair magician and he gives me olapex treatments regularly  but you can t buy no    if you re not licensed  so i opted for no      all i know is whenever he finishes with my treatments  my hair feels and looks       x healthier and restored  but the product that i received left me with my hair in what i felt to be worse condition      
225,4.0,                       i have used this product a total of   times so far  i finally bought it after reading several reviews  the first time i used it i left it on for    minutes  but i had already washed my hair  i saw minimal difference  the next time i put it on my damp unwashed hair  and slept in it over night  i can definitely feel and see a difference  it feels less dried out  looks more moisturized and less frizzy  i hope with a couple more treatments my hair will be a lot closer to normal      
226,4.0,                       i used olaplex at my stylist s recommendation  i have very brittle hair and extremely split ends  using olaplex once a week has made my hair significantly softer  but  it hasn t  sealed  my split ends as i hoped  my stylist recommended a different application routine than what s on the back of the bottle  i shampoo first  then put in olaplex with a touch of my favorite conditioner for    minutes  then thoroughly rinse   i do recommend this product as a deep conditioning treatment      
227,5.0,                       after i ordered this product i read the reviews   yeah  i know   a few were saying this wasn t the real deal so i went over to sephora s website and thought about ordering from them   i read a ton of reviews and decided to curb my rashness   for a change   silly to bounce around like an out of control ball   it arrived today and after putting it in my har i put a shower cap on and let it sit for three hours   i m older and alas  hair gets older too   it s in pretty good condition though and is   inches below my bra strap   the ends tend to be frizzy so hence this product   after washing it out and drying my hair i looked in the mirror and i was rather ecstatic with the results   plus it is shiny and feels like silk   so is it actually olaplex   i can t say for certain  not having tried sephora s   but i would say it is and the looks of my hair would say it is so i will be buying it from amazon in the future      
228,1.0,                       this product is not the real olaplex  i just finished a bottle up from the salon and when this one arrived at my house i compared the ingredient label  i ve used olaplex on and off since       this is different  it smells and feels different  the instructions are different also  however  it still contained the main bonding ingredient so i decided to try it  it made my hair feel worse and some broke off  i tried to save a few dollars and it was not worth it  just order it directly from the company and don t be out your      i want my money and my hair back          
229,5.0,                       have used this before and love it  says to used no more than once a week  formula   is not the salon strength it is specifically for at home use  worked great  brought my hair back from weak  stretchy over processed easy to tangle in just one use      
230,5.0,                       i use this a lot because i tend to damage my hair often  the difference is immediately noticeable with breakage and softness  i actually tend to leave mine in overnight because my hair is thirsty  smell great      
231,5.0,                       with first use i noticed an immediate difference in the quality of my hair  i do not relax or wash my hair without using this  i purchased a second immediately after my first use so that i never run out of this stuff  my hair had basically zero strands breaking off when i combed it through when before my hair was coming out in chunks at a time after dying my hair  it works wonders  i cannot say enough about this game changing product       
232,4.0,                       i hope is the original  i has a lighter scent to it and it s not as thick as the one i bought from my hairdresser  i haven t seen any changes and with the other one i seen an immediate change update  i m seeing changes  bottle is almost gone but i can tell the difference  so it does work not as fast but it does      
233,5.0,                       my hair was severely damaged because of bleaching procedures  after reading a lot of reviews  i decided to leave it for a night on my first try  my hair was that bad  that i took the risk  this is what i did  i washed  my hair  put     of the bottle and comb it  make a bun and put a shower cap  i also put a soft towel on my pillow  just in case   next day  i wash my hair and really noticed the difference  completely worth it  since then  i don t have to use any styling tool to dry it and to go outside  it made a difference in my hair  now  i use it biweekly or monthly because is too expensive  that s the part that i dislike   but like i said  it is worthy      
234,5.0,                       thus stuff is magic  my fine  easy to tangle hair is soft  brushable and has more volume  i highlight my long fine hair and bought this to help with the breakage around my face  i used it  x the first week and   people can t up and told me my hair looked great  my friends noticed the results immediately and   of them ordered the same       products  great stuff  i just reordered the    the shampoo lasts the longest but the treatment bottle is small so goes fast on long hair  still worth the         
235,5.0,                       i used this product with the leatherwood brush i have never seen my  b curls pop this way  now to keep it in that state  but my hair is smooth  moisturized    amazing product   no conditioner  hot oil treatment  does what this product does  this is a bond builder  vital for tight coils  b  c fine strand hair   try it please      
236,1.0,                       waste of time   money  i saw absolutely no difference in my hair  even after   uses  when my hairstylist uses her olaplex on my hair it does wonders  she leaves it on for       minutes and in that one time my hair feels and looks so amazingly healthy   this leads me to suspect maybe what i ordered from amazon is not really      olaplex   very disappointed  i would not buy this again   better off going to a salon or ordering directly from an authorized olaplex distributor      
237,2.0,                       i heard and read this was the best conditioner for damaged hair  it s not  very disappointing because its almost     for  oz  no smell  not thick and mosturizing  did not repair or hydrate my hair the pronexa worked like a charm made my hair feel amazing  less damaged opalex did not  will not buy opalex again      
238,5.0,                       i couldn t tell until after my hair had fully dried but it improved the look and feel of my hair after one use  i m going to add it to a weekly routine to repair the damage in my platinum ombr   a little goes a long way thankfully because this was ridiculously expensive for only     oz      
239,3.0,                       the product is not the big thing  if your hair is very damaged wont do anything  just get a keratine or ph bonder  this jar doesnt last anything and on top it trully doesn t change that much  i could ve achieved the same results with any hair mask  works but not amazing defenetly not worth the prize tho      
240,5.0,                       where would we all be when you need to do a deep condition on your damaged hair  we all know about olaplex so there is little to say except it works  those wild chemist guys in their garage help womankind and helped saved us all from bad hair stylist  thank you olaplex      
241,5.0,                       i bleach my hair every   weeks and do vibrant colors underneath  the olaplex locks in the vibrant colors and helps keep the integrity of my hair  i ve used it for   years now  i don t think i would be able to keep my hair how i like it with out it  my hair is naturally curly  this product keeps my hair healthy   curly      
242,3.0,                       i heard all the rants and raves about olaplex and wanted to try it at home  mind you  my hair was pretty fragile from lightening it to a platinum color previously  this did not take away the dull  lifelessness of my hair fried hair  it made it pretty soft  but not any softer than a brand from a local beauty supply store  the formula was very watery and felt more watery than most drug store brand conditioners  this was purchased directly from amazon so there should be no excuse for a  fake   although  this did absolutely nothing for improving my hairs quality  for your reference  i am a latina woman who has coarse  wavy  thick hair  maybe this will work for super fine hair textures  but it did not work for my hair type      
243,4.0,                       i have dyed blonde hair to base of my neck  i have been trying to use it sparingly  got   or five treatments out of the bottle  wish it wasn t so expensive  i do think i have noticed my hair has less breakage  looks a little healthier  plan to let my grey grow out  getting lowlights soon to help it look gradual  i would purchase it again after my next salon visit  but then just keep it healthy with no more dying blonde  blonde dye is better if you keep your hair shorter and get it cut regularly otherwise it is impossible to keep it longer and healthy looking  don t like short hair      
244,3.0,                       i saw this listed in an article of the    best health things to buy on amazon  figured i would give it is try  the instructions say use       x a week and leave on for    minutes or longer  i am almost done with the bottle and every time i use it i have left it on overnight  this is no where near as good as other similar products  very watery also      
245,5.0,                       amazing   it s literally the best thing i ve used for my hair  i have silver hair so i mix in my pravana silver with it and leave it in overnight  my hair was a level   and i had to lighten to a    almost    to get my hair this color and i ve lightened close to half a dozen times  my hair has never felt better      
246,5.0,                       this was recommended to me by a hairstylist friend to help repair and grow my hair  and it is amazing  my hair stays so soft for days  also  i know people are concerned with it being expired or a knock off  but this is the real thing and my friend who buys and works in a salon verified      
247,5.0,                       so far i love this product  it is easy to use  makes my hair feel soft smooth  pricey but worth it  smells great too  this arrived quickly  it was packaged in an envelope but completely intact  will purchase again      
248,5.0,                       when i first started seeing people talk about olaplex no   i was seeing the same old things  revolutionary product  will change your hair  repair  shine  smooth  reduce frizz  heathy hair in one treatment  uh huh  ok i have hip length   b  cgm hair  i didn t want to spend     on a product that was just like all of the other products promising the same things that i ve been using for years  and for me a bottle would probably be one treatment  i was wrong  this product delivers all of that on the first treatment  it is the single best hair product i ve ever used after one treatment  i can get about four treatments out of a bottle  my hair looked and felt better than it has in my entire life  i ve been using     x per month and see improvement with every application  this stuff is amazing  it s not a conditioning  moisture treatment  it is a chemical treatment that repairs the damage  it actually  makes your hair more healthy by repairing bonds broken by heat  color  ponytail holders  dry brushing  environment  hard water  chlorine  etc   my hair is mirror shiny  smooth  soft  and incredibly manageable  my curls are clumping on their own like they used to when i was a kid and i have increased shrinkage and volume  my hair is just healthy in a way it hasn t been during my adult life the directions say to apply to damp hair and leave on    min  then shampoo and condition  i leave it on until my hair drys which takes     hours and then i wash and condition  the extra time makes a noticeable difference in results for me  their website says it s safe to leave on for an long as you like  but they don t recommend sleeping with it because it might get in your eyes  but i think you could do this with a plastic shower cap note  olaplex   is cgm safe  but not all of the products from this line are  which is a shame because i would happily spend the money on the shampoo  conditioner  and leave ins if they didn t have silicones      
249,5.0,                       i love my stylist  but she told me this was hype   it wouldn t hurt to try it  so i did    and i m so glad it was on a prime day discount that got me to do it  wow  i go blonde streaks in my curly hair  half white half asian  and i can t normally finger comb through at all at a certain point where we may have accidentally doubled up on highlights  now  much better  it s not perfect  but   treatments later  i am so glad i did i ve read not to use it too much  since it only works to a point  but i m either there now or not done yet  haven t gotten to hating it    uses in  i have half a bottle left for my thick  waist length hair      
250,2.0,                       i was really excited about this product seeing as a lot of people rave about it but  unfortunately it didn t do anything for my hair  i have dry  curly  bleached hair and i was looking forward to the so called moisturizing abilities of this product but it did absolutely nothing for my hair      
251,4.0,                       didn t do a bad job  very soft hair  i just don t think this tiny bottle is worth this much as this is not a miracle product  i did notice that it did seem to lower porosity so that s good      
252,3.0,                       i ve been using olaplex   after my shower every day for   months  i leave it in all day for maximum results  unfortunately  i have noticed very little improvement   bottles of product later  it moisturizes well  but my hair is still falling out and breaking off at about the same rate as before      
253,5.0,                       after bleaching my curly hair  it was hard to hold a curl again  i started using this product after it was recommended by other individuals with curly hair who have used bleach and it has worked  i have only used it twice so far and it has already left my hair feeling healthier      
254,5.0,                       this stuff smells sooooo good  i ve used it a couple times now and each time i use it my hair looks so much healthier  i m trying to fix my dry heat damaged hair and i cant wait to keep using this product      
255,5.0,                       my hair was feeling a bit angry   maybe a bit more than angry    i am in the process of lightening from having had it dyed a very dark brown  add to that my love of a flat iron  okay  my hair might be very angry this product  unbelievable  i ve bought every product and tonic and repairer known  i will never buy anything else  i shampooed only with    first  think a lot of argan oil desperately trying to keep frizz and fried ends at bay already on my hair so needed to clear that away  and then put this on  when everyone says a little goes a long way  it does  i usually eye roll at that but in this case it is true i left it on for an hour while i did some housework and then shampooed back out and followed with    conditioner and a little leave in davines milk  o m g  my hair is silky  i let it air dry and there was no frizz  none   literally  not figuratively  went from frizzy  please help me from the humidity to walking a couple blocks in the rain this morning and my hair is not just silky   not just frizz free   it is bouncy  it feels and looks healthy  all this after one use  i will never not have this product in my arsenal  you will never regret spending the money on this magical substance love love love      
256,5.0,                       this product is amazing     amazing     have only used it once   cannot believe how soft my hair is     i bleach my short hair every     weeks  so it s always dry   brittle  now it s soft   shiny    after   application     unbelievable     love           
257,5.0,                       my hair is color damaged and dry   weak  and frizzy  after one application according to the directions  my hair feels smoother  looks sleeker and is shiny again  this definitely tamed my frizzies and split ends  it will take more than one treatment to restore my hair s strength  but with a regular maintenance routine   i am confident that will happen   this product does what it is advertised to do   a small amount is all it takes to get advertised results      
258,5.0,                       i learned about olaplex when the salon added it to my hair color   i had been coloring my hair several years and had keratin straightened hair  then wanted to go blonde  and my poor hair was so dry it s hard to even work shampoo through it when wet   i accidentally found a stylist video on youtube about olaplex recommending to use olaplex   at home to repair hair after coloring   the salon failed to tell me about olaplex    so i tried it   what a difference in my dried out hair   all i know is after using this one time  the shampoo and conditioner went through my hair like there was no damage  and after washing i can get a brush through my hair as well without tangles   after blow drying  my hair is swishy  which it has never been swishy   feels good against my neck   this is a tremendous product   i think for the price there are about   treatments in the bottle for length to the shoulder hair  if using once a week   i left it on my hair for one hour   very happy  this stuff is a miracle for my hair       vs another brand   procucts at       i ll take the olaplex      
259,5.0,                    lo amoooooo   me deja el cabello s per suave  brillante  manejable  con vida y disimula bastante las pintas abiertas  estoy esperando mi segundo envase y lo seguir  utilizando por mucho tiempo  mi cabello se siente como nuevo cada vez que lo uso         
260,4.0,                       i used most of the product by now and found it helps my hair but not a huge amount  i have moderately damaged hair and it has greatly improved the appearance for a short while after each use which is fine  the feeling of my hair before using was very close to the result after each use   i found that buying directly from the site would probably bring better results in both appearance and feeling of the hair  i still rate it four stars because it did help in appearance very noticeably      
261,5.0,                       i used this for damage control after bleaching  and that s exactly what it did  i bleached my hair twice  and then dyed and toned it all in less than    hours  while using this in between  and i have very little to no breakage  i did use a different brand of bond protector while actually completing the bleaching and dying process  with different ingredients than olaplex   but even after rinsing out the bleach and toner and color  i could feel that my hair was  dry  even while it was still wet  some of you know what i m talking about    this is where i applied the olaplex   it has a recommended  sit  time of    minutes  but i left it on for about    each time  my hair is very soft  no  crunch   has shine  and i sustained very little  if any  damage  i read somewhere that this no  is supposed to build off of their no  and no   but i used this as a  stand alone  with that other bond protector i mentioned and it worked  i will probably purchase their maintenance shampoo  also should be noted that even though i have done my hair many of times on my own  this past experience was a little more out of my control and i found myself having to do a few  hail mary s  to control the situation  my hair didn t turn out as i originally set out  but it turned out looking good and i am thankful i had the olaplex this time around      
262,4.0,                       all of my research about repairing damaged hair led me to olaplex  i have used it once so far  and i am not impressed  however  that doesn t mean it isn t doing what it is supposed to do  i should mention i live in a very dry climate  i wanted shinier  stronger hair that wouldn t break as much and would freely flow  my hair feels thicker  if nothing else  but in the way volumizing shampoo would make it feel  it seems to tangle worse than before  even immediately after brushing  though the body is smooth  the ends are still frizzy and my hair clumps together in sections  i think a keratin treatment is more what i m looking for  i gave this   stars because it is probably doing what it should be doing and would be great for someone who likes volume  but i don t think it is what i needed      
263,5.0,                       read this   i first have to say  i don t typically write reviews unless the product blows me away  which is rare  to give you a little background about my hair  i had extremely healthy  long  thick blonde hair  it fell to the middle of my back  it was absolutely beautiful  i went to get it colored to give it a break from the highlights  i was going to change it to a strawberry blonde  which i have been many times before and other than blonde  its the only other color i like on me  when i went to the salon  they messed up the color  i ended up with hot pinkish  purple roots and a grayish auburn  mid shaft to ends  i was in the salon that day for   and a half hours  they had to bleach my entire head and leave it on to get all of the screwed up colors out of my hair  resulting to extreme chemical damage and breakage  i went in with my hair being all one length to having bangs that were never even cut into my hair  my hair was destroyed and they had to take over  inches off just to get the ends to look healthy  my hair now sits on my shoulders and has broken pieces all over the top and mid section and all around my hair line  i have literally cried about this since it happened   weeks ago  it took me forever to get my hair exactly the way i wanted it and now i am starting over  my hair is no longer manageable  it is kinky and dry and looks it  the salon i had gone to was a new salon closer to where i moved  prior to this salon i had been going to my original hairstylist for    years  i m     so half of my life one person has touched my hair  i live two hours from her now so i decided to give a different salon a try and it was a mistake  i will now be driving   hours to go to her every   weeks  i texted her about   weeks after this all happened and she told me right away to order this product  i didn t hesitate  i ordered it and received it the beginning of this week  i have used it twice so far and i will tell you what  after the first time i noticed a difference  i am excited to see after a couple months and using this   times a week  extremely damaged hair should use it more than once a week   i also have been sleeping with it on over night which i notice gives me better results  this is not a conditioning treatment  so it does need to be shampooed out  i have a feeling this product will be what saves my hair  i will post before and after pictures once i actually do my hair so you can see the difference      
264,4.0,                       i learned about this product a very long time ago when i wanted to bleach my hair   i wasn t sure if it would actually work or not despite seeing all the great reviews   i recently bleached my hair from a dark brown almost black to a honey blonde which looked great but absolutely dried out my hair   i knew i had to get my hands on a bottle of olaplex to repair my hair somewhat   i was skeptical of ordering through amazon due to some people saying that amazon is not a licensed distributor   i don t know if this fact is true or not but the formula does work   i think it may be watered down though   one thing i must say is i saw it eliminated frizz which was an important factor for me   my hair is pretty thick and just a little frizzy still   i will definitely buy this again and continue to use it but purchase directly from olaplex      
265,5.0,                       i cannot stress enough how amazing this product was  after lightening my hair with bleach and dying it to a golden brown  my very curly hair was left very dry  it was very rough textured and lifeless  after using this product my hair feels amazing  it s moisturized  it s healthier  it shines  i am absolutely blown away by the effect of this product      
266,5.0,                       covid has been bad for curly hair  have not had a haircut in over a year now and had been doing it myself at home  this led to some very bad endsput this on my hair and completely changed my look  my hair had come together at the ends again and was so soft and shiny after just one use  i use it once a month now or when i really need it because it s so expensive and does not come with a lot i originally applied it after washing and just rinsed it out   conditioned afterwards  which did work  but i would do a deep condition after instead of just regular conditioner would definitely buy again     
267,1.0,                       this wasn t olaplex  i ve used olaplex many times  in the salon and at home and this smelled different  felt different and did nothing for my hair   awful      
268,4.0,                       works well on color treated curls  but curly hair will use a lot of product  i have fine  low density curls  and have to use a palm full to adequately coat all of my hair  i might get     applications out of one bottle      
269,5.0,                       i have always disliked the texture of my hair  it always  no matter the product i used  felt dry and frizzy  now it s winter time which makes it way worse  after watching some brad mondo videos  i just decided why not try this since i had lighter ends but virgin roots and mid tones and stuff  and i will now always have this stuff  my ends feel so much softer  my hair shines  i dont have near as much frizz as before  this product is a miracle product on my very dry  heat damaged hair  it does make my shoulders itch when i use it  so i can t always keep it in the whole time  but even then  it works awesome  i ll be buying more on my next payday      
270,5.0,                       my hair feels sooooo much better already after two uses  great product to use at home  i had my hair bleached to blonde so was worried about it  frying and this makes it feel health and normal     
271,1.0,                       i ve always spend a fortune on my blonde hair  from professional services to using high end products  my hair has always been in great condition  thanks to pureology and redken believing the hype on here  i decided to take the plunge  from the  st application  i instantly noticed a change in my hair and not a good one   no way was my hair like butter  like someone on here mentioned   again  based on the exaggerated reviews on here decided to use it again  omg   my hair became so weak it started to break  i kidd you not  this product will disintegrate your hair  i felt like if i was applying sally hansen hair removal onto my hair  i wanted to cry as i saw my hair falling into the drain  i wish i can say that i m magnifying  but no  my once beautiful hair is now ruined do yourself a favor save your hair and money do  not  buy  this     listen to the one star reviews on here  the ladies know what they are talking about if you really want hair like  butter  i suggest you buy redken      
272,5.0,                       i had used a lot of products to moisture and repair my hair  so far olaplex is the best  i used it twice a week for maximum results and left it on my hair for a whole night  next step i will try their conditioner and shampoo  i would definitely recommend this hair repair      
273,5.0,                       i used this for the first time today and left it in for    minutes   i don t know if this is  fake  or not  as some reviewers have claimed   but it worked so well i plan to purchase steps       as well   it s worth the high price   if your hair is thinning  damaged and making you want to shave it off  try this first      
274,5.0,                       i have type  c kinky  tightly curled low porosity hair  my hair retains moisture very well because i know what products work and what don t  the problem that i have is my hair is prone to breakage  i don t like going too many protein treatments so i wanted to find an alternative i was a little hesitant about buying it because i wasn t sure if they catered to my hair type  the directions say to apply the treatment before shampoo but i applied it last after i deep conditioned  since i have low porosity hair  i wanted to apply it last i immediately noticed a difference when i detangled my hair  i didn t have as much dead hair as i normally do  i m so excited to have discovered this product and also happy that they cater to natural girls like me it s pricey but it s worth it      
275,3.0,                       only used it a couple of time but i did not notice any improvements to my hair      
276,5.0,                       i m very satisfied with my olaplex    purchase  it is legit and it works  i ve noticed changes in my long  past shoulder length   a  natural spiral curl  hair  i ve noticed some breakage  possibly due to me wearing my hair in topknots everyday  i ve got dry hair and split ends  since using my hair actually feels thicker and stronger  and that   uses in in   weeks  full transparency  i have purchased olaplex    from sephora and using concurrently      
277,2.0,                       over     for a tiny  oz bottle so i expected something great  not so much  do not waste your money  sure it conditions  sure its moisturizing  but i have had others that were over the counter and they moisturized better  smelled better  came with more  and cost less  i have used joico as well as redken masks and they both did a better job  smelled better  and you got more for less cost  overall disappointed with the bang for the buck      
278,1.0,                       didn t do anything   if it needs multiple uses to get even the smallest results then a price reduction is in order immediately   don t waste your money  go get you some good ol blue magic     
279,2.0,                       i would not recommend this treatment for any hair type except thick  very strong hair  it has been    hours since using this treatment  i left it on the maximum amount of time  disclaimer  i have super fine  super thin  very very straight hair damaged over time by perms and color  neither of which  at age    i m likely to stop doing  lol  so  that said  this product did leave my hair soft  very soft which  given the thin  fine  straight nature of my hair  isn t as wonderful as it would seem  my hair does feel very soft but soft do not compensate for it being frizzy or flyaway  which my hair still is despite using pur ador cream rinse especially for thin  dry  permed hair  also despite my very tight  curly perm  here s absolutely no body left in the curls  imagine perming a   year old kid s hair and that s about what i have  on the plus side my hair does feel wonderfully soft and looks shiny so if you have no other issues except dry hair it s worth a try  but if you re looking for a salon conditioning result    not sure you ll be happy and at this price  happy should be a minimum result      
280,5.0,                       the product is an excellent source for volumizing fine hair   however  olaplex could develop a product that is more moisturizing   use sparingly due to drying out hair      
281,4.0,                       i swim weekly and also bleach my hair  weave   so i need conditioners that will help my hair to not dry out  after reading about alot of the products available i chose this one  i read one post where the lady said she does not wash it out of her hair  so that is what i do   i wash my hair  then put on the olaplex and leave it in    it feels so soft and i love it  worth every penney       
282,5.0,                       i m one of those that uses box dye because i m not rich and can t afford to get my hair done every     months  this product literally fixes my hair ends after just one use  i don t have a boyfriend  so i leave the product on alllllll night  definitely worth the purchase  and i am on my second bottle with no hesitation  completely worth the cost  doesn t compare to anything else      
283,5.0,                       i ordered this and i got the thicker version of it so i was sure that it was the authentic one   this did wonders for my hair i did this twice after bleaching my hair and it s completely bonded my strands allowing me to bleach again shortly after   i have a level   dark brown hair  and now i have a pastel lavender color due to olaplex      
284,5.0,                       i buy olaplex from sephora usually  i decided to give this a try to save some a few bucks and get it quicker  the product i received is authentic and i love what this stuff does to my curly hair      
285,4.0,                       i used this after doing balayage   ombre on my own  dark  hair  really great stuff   be sure to deep condition afterwards  though  kept my hair nice and soft      
286,5.0,                       loved it  made my sad frizzy curls waaay more defined  i split the bottle with two friends so i can t vouch for the effectiveness of regular use  but there was absolutely a difference after   hours on my head  i will definitely be buying more      
287,4.0,                       when i bought this product i just thought it was a deep moisturizer and i didn t expect much out of it  i bought it because my hair is in really bad shape it s very thin and it has lots of short hair is in phrase that sticks out  it also has a lot of bulgaria s because i had extensions they damaged it so much  it looks pretty bad  i use this product and i was so happy with the results  it somehow made my hair smoother  when i bought this product i just thought it was a jeep wish riser and i didn t expect much out of it  i bought it because my hair is in really bad shape it s very jason has lots of short hair is a phrase that sticks out  it also has a lot of bold areas because i had extensions they damaged it so much  it looks pretty bad  i use this product and i was happy with the results  it somehow made my hair smoother  it got rid of the tiny hairs that stuff out and it was very very smooth to the touch it also made my hair very beautifully street and i was able to wear my hair down for the first time in like three weeks and the damage just wasn t visible anymore  this is a product that i m going to use probably for the rest of my life unless i find something better which i don t think i will  i would recommend it to anyone who wanted to make their hair thicker and address the damage of their hair and who want to be their hair to be a long term  it got rid of the tiny hairs that stuck out and it was very very smooth to the touch it also made my hair very beautifully straight and i was able to wear my hair down for the first time in like three weeks the damage just wasn t visible anymore  this is a product that i m going to use probably for the rest of my life unless i find something better which i don t think i will  i would recommend it to anyone who wanted to make their hair thicker and address the damage of their hair and who want to be your hair to be a long term result  it is recommended to use   to   times a week you can use it once a week and have your hair looks great for the rest of the week so it s it s a semi permanent products meaning it will last a week  i m gonna get one for every woman in my family      
288,4.0,                       the perfector was used originally on damaged hair  it  made hair softer and easier to work with  i use it before i wash my hair and it helps with dryness      
289,1.0,                       unimpressed  followed directions   used many times before writing review  it s no better than conditioner to me  i have fine hair if that helps at all  i won t purchase again  disappointed      
290,5.0,                       of course you can look on any site and see that this product is fantastic  i have color treated blonde hair that gets dry looking after the glaze wears off from the salon  i also just purchased extensions and it make both looks smooth and soft  i also bought the no    shampoo and the no   conditioner  it s a quality product      
291,5.0,                       you put this product on wet hair and leave it in overnight and it makes your hair nice and silky  i bleached my hair like four times and this product made it feel healthy and shiny      
292,3.0,                       a friend of mine swears by this product so i purchased it  i read a lot of reviews first   seems like a lot of people love it and others say it s horrible and broke their hair off  i m kind of in the middle  while it seems there was some moderate conditioning to my hair  it s nothing to rave about and certainly not worth what i spent on the bottle  i can get the same result with some hot oil treatment  so overall  i rate it  meh       
293,5.0,                       olaplex is fabulous  i have damaged hair from a dry bar blow out experience  i have natural curls and this helped the damaged frizzy hair become a bit smoother  it s definitely still damaged but this product helped      
294,5.0,                       purchased olaplex          and    together and it completely saved my hair from extensive over processing   highly recommend  i m not sure why amazon asked to rate this product for drying power   that doesn t apply   product doesn t dry your hair at all      
295,5.0,                       i get the olaplex treatment when i get my hair done at my salon  this is an amazing way to maintain that softness  shine  frizz control between trips to your salon for a great price   i was worried the bottle was so small  but it goes a long way  now my hair looks like i just left the salon        
296,3.0,                       pretty expensive for the small amount received  not overall thrilled with the way my hair was after the first treatment  the way i understand it  hair condition gets better the more times you use this product  however  unless you have a lot of money to spend  i found this product isn t worth it  there are better hair treatments out there for less      
297,4.0,                       theres a lot of hype about this product  i do like it and it makes my hair feel great that day  but i m still trying to see the long term effects  cause i feel like after a day or   my hair starts feeling dry again  and i have been using it for a few months now     
298,1.0,                       ive bought bottles of no   from sephora and directly from olaplex and those has a more creamy consistency that stays on damp hair without dripping unlike this bottle from amazon             
299,5.0,                       is your hair frizzy  is it dry  does it feel like straw  then you need to get this product right away  i m not even kidding  it was first used on my hair at a salon and then i found out you could purchase it and i bought it immediately because it changed my hair completely  i wish i had a picture to show you but i don t unfortunately  all i can say is it works  it only took one time for it to work for me but i think for really difficult hair it might take two times to use  and then you just use it as needed or keep it up or whatever  my hair is so much more healthy now      
300,5.0,                       i was recommended this by a friend who has used it and this the best hair treatment i ve used  it smells great is easy to apply  makes my hair the softest it s ever been and is perfect for my color treated platinum blonde hair  a little goes a long way and you can apply and leave it in for    minutes or longer  some people even leave it in overnight but i left it in for like    minutes  my hair was so much easier to dry and brush after using this      
301,5.0,                       it is honestly the best thing for my hair   i bleached my hair and damaged it pretty much   my daughter suggested to try the olaplex and just by using it the first time my hair felt so soft      
302,1.0,                       this is not the same olaplex   that you buy directly from the manufacturer or authorized retailer  i first purchased olaplex here  then once i finished the bottle i purchased from an authorized retailer and that version is thicker  creamier  slightly stronger scented and has given me much better results  almost seems as if this version being sold is a watered down version or something  it s the same price other places for what works better  don t buy it here      
303,1.0,                       i have followed directions provided in each manner  and use   i bought every single product in the biggest size made   i am almost done using everything and have not noticed any change in my hair what so ever   my hair has now been treated over    times at least   sometimes leaving in     or     on my hair for extremely long periods   still nothing   i believe i had better results using moroccan moisturizing shampoo and conditioner   this was huge waste of money for over      for everything      
304,5.0,                       okay  wow  i m the kind of person that abuses my hair pretty consistently  i ve been blonde to red  pink  purple  dark brown  back to blonde  heat styling  etc this is my first encounter with olaplex  my frizzy  wiry hair is so smooth and silky i can t stop touching it  i have the kind of hair and skin that doesn t bat an eye at most moisturizers  this product definitely does some repair  i will repurchase      
305,5.0,                       i don t like the smell very much and i feel like it tangles my hair  my stylist recommended even sleeping in it overnight  it s seemed to help my hair i went from damaged to what my stylist said feels like  virgin hair   per her instruction  this product is supposed to help restore bonds in your hair at the molecular level  seems to be working  the results i ve seen were after i used it for   months  about once a week      
306,5.0,                       the first time i used it  i only left it on for like    minutes and it didn t do much  plus i did it in the shower when my hair wasn t really towel dry like the instructions say  mind you  my hair is severely damaged from bleaching it    times in one night lmao  to white  then eventually dying it brown  pink  bleaching it again and dying it brown  the next time i did it  i towel dried  put it all over evenly  and left it on for like     hours  my hair is drastically healthier and feels better tip  switch between this and a hydrating product  you don t want to use a protein treatment too often  or a hydrating product too often  i ll probably do this once a week and another hydrating one once a week on another day so i can eventually get my hair healthy again      
307,2.0,                       i kept this on for    minutes  olaplex recommends a minimum of    minutes  as i rinsed it out and shampooed and conditioned  clumps of hair came out  clumps  it really freaked me out  then as i brushed my hair afterwards  even more came out  i was afraid to even style it because i didn t want to lose more hair  i don t know how this could repair my hair when i was losing so much  although my hair feels a little smoother  i would not recommend this product because of the hair loss      
308,5.0,                          months ago i had a full head of purple hair  my hair has been bleached time and time again  i finally decided to go back to my natural brown with a blonde balayage  needless to say  even going to a professional who was very mindful with my hair  always doing things slowly as not to damage it  i still ended up frying my hair  i have thin hair and an oily scalp so i stay away from heavy conditioners or products that add to the oily look  being purple for a year  almost black before that  and heavily highlighted before that  my hair had been through a lot of stress  a few weeks ago i was so sick and tired of the breakage  visible when brushing   like bad breakage  i finally decided to try out the olaplex i had heard so much about  i didn t tell my stylist i was doing it  but i would be seeing her a few days after my treatment for a touch up  as soon as she started working with my hair she asked my what i did that it looked so so healthy  we ended up not having to cut much off because it was so great  i was preparing to cut off three plus inches and this stuff saved me  i listened to a friend of mine who is a prof stylist and works with vivids who reccomended i sleep with it on  i got about    hours with it on over night  washed and styled my hair like normal the next morning and i havent had to straighten it to  tame  it since  i have been styling it just blow drying it with a round brush  would        recommend this to everyone with damaged hair      
309,5.0,                       i ve bleached my hair a lot over the past couple of years and it s taken a toll on the health of my hair  my hairstylist recommended this to me and i ve been using it regularly   maybe once or twice every week and it s been doing wonders for my hair   it keeps it from breaking and wonderfully soft to touch   i highly recommend this for anyone who bleached their hair  even if it s not that often      
310,5.0,                       if you have damaged  fly away or dry hair   this is a great product  you need so little of this to make a big difference  add pea size amts at time to dry hair and run through your hair with fingers  i start just above the ears and get mid section and ends  whatever is left on my hands i use on top  this will last quite a while  i put it on for at least an hour before showering  i also use olaplex shampoo and conditioner  a little goes a long way      
311,5.0,                       i m very pleased with this product   my hair was feeling dry and straw like and this really brought it back to life even after one use   it is a small bottle for the price  but i ve used it twice on my should length hair and still have a little over half the bottle left      
312,2.0,                       olaplex is only receiving   stars based on the visible effect this had on my hair  potentially it did  strengthen my hair from within   but that s beyond my capacity to assess applied it overnight  but it did absolutely nothing for my chemically treated hair shortly afterward i did the formaldehyde free peter coppola keratin treatment   and got a new head of hair  i got so many compliments   you look so great  not sure if it s your hair or what      and it was  however  the question remains  does it really strengthen the hair  i ll do my research on this  as keratin treatments don t actually prevent the hair from future breakage      
313,4.0,                       i really liked how smooth my hair was after using       and    i feel like   and   did a good enough job   so i probably won t be buying    item again considering that product works better on my hair   i have extensions  so maybe it ll work better on all natural hair   olaplex    works really well with the shampoo and leaves my hair extra smooth and shiny      
314,1.0,                       no seal on the product  i bought this in at the end of april received it may and had a salon treatment so i haven t used this product my fault for not looking at the bottle right away  it is now the beginning of august and i wanted to use the at home product since my hair is now feeling very dry from the summer sun and heat styling   well low and behold i went to open and realized that the bottle does not have a seal  i do not feel comfortable using this product since it is not sealed and i am well past my return window         
315,5.0,                       it is a little bottle but the contents are strong  my hair felt softer  and i could tell a big difference in my hair after i used this product  imagine my surprise to see this product in an upscale salon  if they use this on their clients it has to be a good sign      
316,5.0,                       i do feel this product is expensive  however  i really loved how it worked for my hair  i don t normally use hair masks  but this one left my hair feeling amazing  silky  smooth  and i can go longer until my next hair wash when using this  i only use once weekly if that  i recommend this product      
317,5.0,                       i decided to grow my hair out and let it curl   my bestie  who is a stylist  gave me very specific instructions on curly hair care  including the once a week use of olaplex     don t let the  oz bottle size deter you  you only use a small dab once a week so the bottle should last several months   such wonderful results  people are now commenting on my awesome hair      
318,5.0,                       i discovered olaplex at a previous hairdresser and began purchasing it online after moving  i have thick  medium coarse hair and i use this once or twice a week to keep my hair in good shape  i find if i add olaplex to towel dried hair and leave it in all night  it does a really excellent job      
319,5.0,                       my green hair had to go copper due to job reasons and my long  thick  dense  curls were frizzy and constantly tangled  i want to get it trimmed and layered but   covid  so i ordered olaplex no   and no    i left no   on overnight and put no   on after that was washed out and my hair is already immensely better   i still have     of a bottle only no   despite having tons of hair too  with that and the fact that it absolutely helps its worth every penny      
320,5.0,                       my holy grail product  any time i notice my curls are lacking definition i use this hair treatment  i get definition  especially at my roots and my hair just looks and feels shinier and healthy  worth the money      
321,5.0,                       i had big hopes for this tiny bottle   my hair was double processed from a natural bark brown to a blonde then greyish brown  at the end of my day at the salon my hair was dry brittle and beyond repair i scoured amazon for something to help  before olaplex  when i washed my hair  it would feel strangely spongy  after the first treatment my hair felt the closest to normal since double processing my hair i had to do a double take and start the process over again when using olaplex no     you use it as a mask first on damp hair for    minutes and then go on to shampoo and condition  it felt very odd to do so but it s worth following the directions ps if you see that my hair color is different in the before and after  it s because i used a color boost with my conditioner  i didn t like the dirty grey the salon had given me      
322,5.0,                       i have been hearing about this product for months and i just used it for the first time  it is amazing  i haven t dried my hair yet but it is so soft and smooth and feels so much more healthy  i can only imagine how it will feel after continued use  i have done a lot of research on it and it seemed that the longer you leave it on  the better it is   i left this on for   hours while i did things around the house  i am not sure if that helped the results or not but i am so excited with the results and i m so happy to find something to help me keep my hair healthy  i naturally have dark blonde hair and get white blonde highlights about every   weeks so it needs all of the help it can get      
323,5.0,                       oh my  ok  so i was looking for a product to help make my hair stronger  i went from natural to relaxed  i did some research and heard about this product  bought and bottle and was amazingly surprised of what this little powerhouse product can do  you must use it before you shampoo  which is a strange direction  but this is a bond builder  not a conditioner or  treatment  as we know it  my hair is softer  stronger  shiner  i have salt  n peppa hair  so keeping it soft was always a challenge   adding olaplex    to my routine was the right choice      
324,1.0,                       this product ruined my hair i had just grown out my hair to my shoulders and then i used this product and it immediately started just breaking off after first use  it caused more shedding  more tangles  it smells awful  it s not worth it      
325,2.0,                       did not see any results on my hair   expensive too   would not buy again      
326,3.0,                       i will not buy this again  it did not work any where near as well as what my beautician applies and i did it the same way she does with the warm wrap and the heat      
327,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i always recommend this product to my other friends who bleach their hair  my hair is extremely damaged and all of plex save my hair  the only thing i don t like is that ola plex doesn t come with a very large bottle  it is a little bit expensive and you don t get that much  i wish we could have a little bit more for the money we spend on it  however i do really like this product and i have recommended it to two of my friends this week      
328,4.0,                       though the bottle is small  and it doesn t go a long way with my long hair  this stuff is amazing  i thought i would for sure need a haircut for my super dry and tangled ends but i left this stuff in for    minutes and it worked like magic  i made sure to use it after shampoo and before conditioner  i m trying to grow out my hair so i ll be buying more of this      
329,5.0,                       i don t care for the perfume scent but that s just my personal thing  i love this stuff  i see immediate changes in my hair after i use it  i will be repurchasing and trying other items in the line as well     
330,5.0,                       main point  i do highly recommend as i m familiar with olaplex and stand by the statement that it does wonders for your hair    but don t expect a miracle no matter how much you use or how long you leave it on your hair  what a lot of people don t know or they refuse to acknowledge is that you can t bring dead hair back to life once you ve heavily compromised it  only cutting it off will completely undo whatever damage you ve caused to your hair i purchased this perfecter in order to start strengthening prepping my hair throughout this  week for bleaching this weekend  i m going from washed out red orange back to blonde  so protection is def necessary   and after just      hour long uses so far i ve already got noticeably softer hair   downside i noticed is that my hair doesn t look any different  i have naturally wavy  sometimes frizzy hair and the treatments have so far not tamed my texture so if you re looking at before after pics where people immediately styled their hair after  then yes theirs will look really different because they styled it  i wouldn t recommend styling  until a couple of days after your last treatment as you ve just added all that moisture back into your hair and styling immediately after is just gonna fry it right back out      
331,5.0,                       i really enjoyed this product  as someone who has been color treating and bleaching my hair for almost    years now  my hair has definitely been through some damage  while i try to avoid using heat as much as i can  the bleach has left my hair dry and brittle  at this point  my hair has been breaking off  creating fly aways and overall damaged hair  i bought this product  under the recommendation of a friend  and am very very happy with it  i showered  combed my hair out  and applied this product overnight  i slept with it in  and rinsed it out in the morning  with just water  not shampoo   now it is three days later and my hair has never been more smooth  un tangled and shiny  i love this stuff  and will definitely be purchasing again  the only downside is the amount of product that you get for the money  however  you don t need much of this stuff for it to work      
332,4.0,                       bought this product for my mom who wanted to try it out  this is purely from her experience using this product  it moisturizes the hair as well as treats it fairly well  it does points out how pricy it is for a small bottle to be charged close to      nevertheless  it s a decent product and she doesn t have any problem since she didn t spend a dime on the product      
333,5.0,                       i swear by this stuff  the before is a month ago  my hair has grown a decent amount  about an inch  it grows fast  i started watching brad mondo and was introduced to olaplex  the before picture is before i started using olaplex and the after is proof my hair looks healthier  before my hair was dry and straw like now the ends are soft like virgin hair  before i started using olaplex  i was thinking about shaving my head but now i don t have to  it softens extremely damaged hair and the scent is amazing  if it doesn t work  you re probably not using it right  dampen your hair when your hair is dirty  put olaplex in for an hour  that s what i do once a week  then rinse it out  wash your hair and use regular conditioner  the directions state clearly on what to do  it is not conditioner so don t use it as such or leave it in  oil is for that not the type   olaplex  it works just follow the directions      
334,5.0,                       was nervous to buy such a small quantity of product for higher price than just a mask  but this stuff is awesome  for an at home treatment  it absolutely restores shine and makes your hair look unprocessed and healthy   i have   feet of highlighted blonde hair  and have used about a     of the bottle per treatment  even with fairly liberal application   i usually apply  and then leave on while i go to the gym run errands  over   hours each time   wash and condition as normal and my hair looks unbroken and super shiny      
335,5.0,                    este producto me salv  mi cabello  el  nico inconveniente es el tama o del frasco pero si rinde porq con solo una cucharita de postre  cubres todo el cabello lo recomiendo para todas las que tienen el cabello destrozado por las decoloraci n  ej yo        
336,5.0,                       this stuff will actually rebuild damaged hair   it has mine  anyway   olaplex was recommended to me by my hairdresser  and the price was so good on amazon that i had to buy it   using it       times a month really makes a difference in how my hair looks and feels  especially since i use hot tools quite often   i highly recommend this stuff   delivery was fast so that was nice too      
337,5.0,                       this a very good product  it makes you hair silky and shiny perfect for a dry curly hair     
338,5.0,                       i didn t believe all the hype   then i tried it   no    managed to soften my dry frizzled hair to the silky long strands i had as a near youngster   amazing   i just ordered another one   i am not one to over sell anything   i am a cynic at heart   but this product really works      
339,2.0,                       my hair is very dry and falls a lot which is terribly sad  i heard about olaplex from my hairdresser i do not over process my hair and do not use the flat curling iron often  i am giving it a low rating because it did not strengthen my hair in any way and did not improve the appearance of dry dull either  i was not hoping for a miracle but i did hope for smooth and shiny hair but it didn t happen      
340,5.0,                       you know those haystacks you see in the field  all yellow   dried out  that s my hair  or it was  i bleach alot and my hair is very processed  very fried  i ve used it once straight   twice in some hair bleach and it s made such a difference already  my hair feels like normal hair should  looks shinier even  would definately recommend ty brad mondo      
341,5.0,                       i don t know where this has been all my life  it s hands down the best product i ve ever used for my hair  i leave it in for a few hours at a time and my hair is so soft and smooth when i wash it out  it s not a conditioner but a bond builder so it s actually helping strengthen your hair  i love it and recommend it to everyone      
342,5.0,                       i was hesitant to use after reading reviews of it being a possible fake  i scanned the qr code and it brought me to the website  granted  i m sure there is a way to copy a qr code as well  i have never purchased olaplex from any place before  so perhaps i can t say it isn t for sure  without a doubt  fake  but it isn t bad i did a quick test strand  left in on about    minutes just to make sure my hair wouldn t fall out or break  and i seen others say   once that proved to be safe  i saturated my entire head  using around   dollops   my hair is a little past my shoulders   i left it on a total of     hours  followed by shampoo and conditioning as per the directions  i personally noticed improvement from this first use alone  my hair was so dry and brittle on the ends from months of bleaching  it actually bounces now for the first time in what feels like forever i can t speak for everyone  but i will say  when in doubt  test strand      
343,5.0,                       my daughter has a head full of curls and is damaged by heat  this product has helped will be purchasing again  it is only good for one use  very pricey to keep up        
344,5.0,                       i know i ve spent hundreds of dollars on hair products that others have said were  magic  or  life changing  only to be disappointed over and over again  but this stuff is the real deal   my hair is naturally curly  and therefore naturally coarse and dry  and i saw a huge difference after just one use   i also have a few spots that were damaged by some bad highlights and it even worked on them   it made my hair much softer and shinier and gave my curls real definition   love   just note that the bottle is little  much smaller than i expected     my hair is medium long  just past my shoulders  and thick and i used more than half the bottle in one use   it was worth it  though  and i m ordering more now        
345,1.0,                       i ve used olapex   for years  maybe twice a month for   minutes on towel dried hair for maintenance  was excited to find it on amazon  i have no clue what was in that bottle but my hair felt like it was going to fall off  it instantly felt dried out  seldom i m disappointed or write a bad review but that was definitely not the product i normally purchase from my stylist     i couldn t even brush my hair  had to re wash my hair and condition to make it manageable and my hair still felt yucky      
346,5.0,                    lo mejor para el pelo decolorado  si no fuera por este producto creo q no tendr a mi cabello  pues me decoloro  varias veces en el a o e impide que se rompa por la elasticidad que la decoloraci n produce       recomendable        
347,1.0,                       i used this olaplex     yesterday  my hairdresser recommended olaplex     but that can only be purchased by hair salons  after leaving this bond repairer on my highlighted hair for    minutes i washed it out then shampooed and conditioned my hair with my normal shampoo  when i went to comb my hair i noticed large amounts of hair coming out by the roots  i was shocked at the amount falling out  today i went online to read comments and found out that this has happened to many people  i threw away the remainder of olaplex   today   fortunately my hair is not still falling out so i guess i was lucky don t buy this product       
348,1.0,                       i ve ordered this before and this time i received a bottle of a thin  runny  cheap conditioner   it most definitely was not a legitimate olaplex product   wish you could trust what you re buying on amazon are the real products      
349,5.0,                       so i d like to start off  by saying i have natural  jet black hair like almost blue black that i decided to at home bleach to i d say a level      idk what y all consider    but definitely a lightest ash blond color  long story short i bleached my hair like    times and at first it was stretchy and i had some breakage but after using this  the aphogee   step protein treatment and the schwarzkopf keratin potion and mask my hair is soft and manageable  the olaplex no   is for sure what makes the biggest difference  the longest i ve left this on is for   hours but at a minimum i leave it on for one  that being said i find that my hair is softest when using this and then straightening it and using an oil  my favorite is the fanola crystals one      
350,3.0,                       not sure i like this  hair definitely does not feel moisturized after usage  maybe it s building your hair bonds and you need to use other products for moisture      
351,5.0,                       i found out about this product through my hair colorist  he applied it on my hair and insisted i bought some for follow up applications  the difference it makes in my hair is like night and day   i was tired of buying all kinds of hair products that promise all kinds of miracles  non of them work  unless i use olaplex  it should be used once a week but i do find the process time consuming  first  you must wet your hair  towel it dry  apply olaplex  wait at least    mins  i leave it on for at least      then wash and condition as usual  my hair feels a lot better after rinsing the product out  that s how good this product is      
352,5.0,                       i m so thankful for this stuff  i have fine  very curly hair with mixed texture  during quarantine i bleached my hair like   times and went from a level   dark brown to a level   blonde  i wish i had never even thought about bleach  it destroyed my hair  my hair now felt like straw and just would not air dry  i tried so many treatments and  hacks  before finally just buying this  for the first time my hair finally started air drying  it was the first time my hair even began to resemble itself at full health  i got about     uses out of it  my hair is just past my shoulders   the more i use it  the more my curl pattern returns      
353,5.0,                       this product is amazing  my hair is every damaged  it was so damaged  after i brushed my hair the ends would fall off all over the sink  i left it in for an hr and after it dried i brushed and straighten it with no hair falling out  it feels and looks so healthy after only one use  i loved the results so much i just bought the shampoo and conditioner      
354,4.0,                       great product and smells great  not too fragrant  very soft results  only annoyance is that you have to wash and condition your hair  towel dry  put it in and then rinse  i don t use it often because it s such a process but the hair really does feel great      
355,5.0,                       i purchased olaplex after reading tons of both positive and negative reviews   what i learned      you must was your hair with a clarifying shampoo prior to using olaplex     the chemical bonds can t reconnect if your hair has build up from product or hard water     olaplex needs to be washed out of your hair with a clarifying shampoo       olaplex is not a conditioner so it will not hydrate your hair   if you have dry damaged hair you must apply a conditioner after using olaplex   if you follow these three steps you should have a successful outcome   i m    years old and have been bleaching my hair since high school     years    i am pleased that my natural waves have returned and the frizz is gone after using olaplex       
356,5.0,                       my beautician started using this in my hair when i started lightening my hair from black to blonde  this stuff is a lifesaver for colored hair  it puts it all back together again  i leave mine on for longer than   mins sometimes overnight when my hair is really needing the nourishment  it s the best stuff ever       
357,5.0,                       my white grey curly hair was getting too dry and frizzy so i decided to give this a try   left it on for a few hours and when i rinsed it out  my hair felt very soft and silky   i also used the olaplex shampoo  conditioner and leave in  even with my hair wet  i could tell that my hair was healthy  silky  smooth with perfect curls   once it dried it looked fantastic and it did keep the frizzies away till i washed it again   very happy that amazon carries it      
358,5.0,                       i ve been using this for two weeks and can tell a huge difference in the texture of my hair   i damaged my hair by coloring it too much myself   this has really helped make it less frizzy      
359,5.0,                       wow  i wish i would have taken a before picture  i had severe brittle bleached hair and terrible split ends  after using this once  kept in hair for about   hours   my hair was noticeably softer  less straw like feeling at the tips  and my split ends have disappeared   there might be a few hair strands that are still split  but for the most part they re gone  it seems like the olaplex bonded them together  i heard that every time you use this   your hair just keeps getting better and healthier  and i m looking forward to it and will use once a week      
360,5.0,                       this product works   my very long nautural hair was bleached    dyed light ash brown color and so the hair texture was destroyed   damaged   it became brittle  frizzy  coarse   dry  no shine  tangly   unmanageable  my hair looked like a garden broom from the back  this product had such positive reviews so i gave it a try  i was so glad i did   would definitely recommend it to others who have damaged hair like mine  i used     of a bottle to saturate hair and left on inside a shower cap for   hours  followed by rinse with water  no shampoo since i washed hair a day but did conditioned   blowed dry right away to see the result  i rejoiced at what a huge difference it made  the texture of my hair felt like the one in a pantene comercial   it became so soft   bouncy and my fingers glided down the silky smooth hair without any chocks of knots  i didn t even use a comb at all  hair looked revived and healthy  the hair repair was so dramatic that i had to share a review on this product      
361,5.0,                       some of the reviews said their product was fake and watered down  this was not the case for me  i recently lifted my natural almost black hair to platinum blonde silver  it took   salon visits to lift me this much  so parts of my hair were damaged and stretchy   i received this yesterday and immediately got my hair wet  and put this all over my head  concentrating on the fuzzier parts  i put on a disposable shower cap  and wrapped my hair in a towel  i left it on for about four hours  i have very thick  coarse  shoulder length hair and used         of the bottle  it was not watered down  and it smelled very nice not like chemicals  after   hours  i washed and conditioned my hair as normal  when i got out of the shower  i combed my hair and could already see a huge difference  no more stretchy ness in the damaged areas  now that it is dry  it is much less fuzzy in the more processed areas  my hair doesn t feel softer  which is fine  my hair doesn t really soften anyways   but it looks way healthier  i am amazed by this product  i would recommend it to anyone  i think by the time i am done with the bottle  my hair will be back to normal  i would also recommend to just dampen your hair  not completely saturate it  i feel that i was able to get more coverage with damp hair than soaked hair      
362,1.0,                       i left this product in my hair for nearly    minutes on the first use and noticed no difference  i have since been using it consistently      times per week  and again  have not noticed any discernible difference in my hair quality or strength      
363,5.0,                       i wish i had known about this product a long time ago  my hair is relaxed  keratin treated and has red highlights  naturally  i like living dangerously and i have to always be looking for products that actually work i am addicted and i m going to get my hands on all olaplex products i can possibly have my hair is so silky and beautiful   i can t believe it s mine  i applied once in between the relaxer and the keratin treatment and saw an improvement  applied two more times after the keratin treatment  and i m really impressed  this is truly the best product i ve ever used  i didn t think humanity had come up witb anything better than k rastase yet  but this is it this tiny bottle only lasted me   treatments because my hair is mid back length and thick  and i also throughly soak the hair   absolutely worth every penny  spread the gospel  systers  you deserve it      
364,5.0,                       this was a pandemic buy and rejuvenated my hair  lovely     
365,1.0,                       i m pretty sure this is not the real product  i ve used olaplex from sephora before and it performed completely differently  the real product is amazing   this one also smells differently  beware      
366,1.0,                       if this is the real thing  it doesn t work  i left it in for over an hour since you can leave it in as long as you want per the official website  i didn t see or feel any difference at all  so disappointed  so expensive for it to be a fake product  if not fake  it s worthless  can t believe i wasted my money on this      
367,1.0,                       this product is trash  i have  c hair and it s completely natural   no relaxers  no color    days ago  i got a trim and decided to use the product for strengthening  yesterday  i applied it for    min and washed it out  then  i applied lots of coconut oil and wore it naturally for the evening  today i noticed it was super dry and brittle  so i decided to wash it completely out with my aveda shampoo and conditioner  when i brushing my hair with the conditioner in it  i noticed short pieces of my thick hair in my hands  it clearly caused breakage to my healthy hair  hoping this is the worst of it  i will never use this product again  and to many other reviewers  point  i will always order a hair product directly from the manufacturer  this also had a weird and intense chemical smell akin to a relaxer  if you have natural hair  don t use this      
368,5.0,                       if you bleach your hair to make it blonde  you simply must use olaplex because it justnplaun works  bleaching strips each hair shaft  makes it thinner  brittle and dry  olaplex number three helps build it back up  repairing weak spots  you end up with hair that almost feels as if you hadn t bleached it  your hair is stringer and sleeker again  instead of  fried   i remember long ago kim kardashian saidnshe leaves it on under a shower cap overnight and washes it off in the morning  i tried that and the sound of the shower cap woke me up too much and was coming off and messy  so now i just put it on generously and out it all up in a clip for several hours as i hang out around the house and wash it out  condition and air dry  i love this stuff and have bought it many times now  i have sort of long and thick hair  so i get three treatments out of one of these little bottles   it is so worth every penny for me  p s  it does not add moisture to hair  but rather adds proteins etc to build and heal hair      
369,5.0,                       i put this product on after my shower and leave it in for     days if i can  on the weekend and then walaa  instant smoothness  instant shine  instant miracle moisture  i cannot live without this product and now i want the shampoo  conditioner  oil and anything else they make     highly recommend  i get about   uses for my medium to long hair out of one bottle      
370,5.0,                       let me start off by saying that i never leave reviews of things i buy  but i tried this out as soon as i received it and it s my new holy grail hair mask  i have bleached blonde hair  and my ends were starting to look extremely dry  i covered my hair in this and left in for about    minutes and as soon as i washed it out my hair felt so soft  once it dried there was a noticeably big difference in my hair  i ve tried plenty of hair masks but none have left results like these on just one use  only downside i would say is that it s a pretty small bottle  i have thick and long hair so for one use i m already half way through the bottle  other than that i would definitely recommend this to anyone needing to bring their hair back to life      
371,5.0,                       i wanted to get the bigger bottle but it costed       if you re thinking the same way as me and are trying to get something cheaper then this would be perfect for u since it does last quite a while even though it s so small      
372,5.0,                       i ve heard the many praises of olaplex from coworkers for many years but i thought it was tested on animals  only recent have i found out it isn t  i m so glad i did because my hair is so much better  i hope it keeps improving after so my damage it endured      
373,5.0,                       my hair is curly and very dry and frizzy  this product was recommended and i finally tried it  oh my goodness it is fantastic  one use and much ofthe frizz was tamed  the texture of my hair was soft  i have never had soft hair  i noticed a shine  never had shine before either  i do recommend using it each wash day as it doesn t last between washings      
374,5.0,                       as a blonde i am no stranger to damaged hair  about   yes ago my hair got to the point where it was over processed and started to break  i was so self conscious about this because i always thought of my hair as my best feature  this product has made a huge difference    by no means did this work over night but slowly my hair has started to grow longer and thicker again  i ve been using     times a week and once i meet my goal length will cut down to  x  i have also been using collagen too which makes a big difference      
375,1.0,                       i dont know if this is the real olaplex or not but it literally feels like water  i used this about   times and got the same results  after placing on my hair i left it for   minutes  my hair started falling out little by little after i put the shower head on it  my hair never does that  this product will ruin your hair not fix it  i want a complete refund      
376,5.0,                       after my stylist left the bleach on entirely too long  my hair needed major help  my ends felt stringy  rough  and mostly just broke when touched brushed were wet  it was a mess i ordered this product from amazon rather than the olaplex website because i needed it now  when i read some of the reviews that said it was fake and counterfeit  i got nervous and ordered the other one directly from the company this is the exact same product  both this and the one i ordered direct have significantly improved the condition of my hair   i can actually touch it again and it feels like hair instead of hay oddly  the label on the one from the company was bubbly and looked more fake than the amazon bottle  i don t know if all these come from the same distributor but i m glad i got the real thing i would definitely recommend trying this if you have damaged hair  if your hair is generally in good condition  i m not sure the type of results you would get  i imagine it wouldn t be as drastically different as mine      
377,1.0,                       i bought this product and used it twice and saw absolutely no difference in my hair  i thought it just might not work for me  i then got a free sample from my hairdresser  used it and it was amazing  clearly what i bought from amazon was fake  extremely disappointing amazon   never buying hair products from here again      
378,5.0,                       this stuff has saved my hair and more  i have bleached my hair to the picture seen and it is now a bit longer  second picture  but feels soft and conditioned  when i use a comb or brush there is  and i swear      never a strand of over processed bleached blonde hair on either  since using this   to   times a week and leaving it in for at least an hour or more on towel dried hair  this stuff will make a huge difference  this is also the real deal just like from the actual seller  thank you olaplex no    i can stay a blonde all summer now          
379,5.0,                       amazing product  great for your hair  this is not a knock off  this is the real deal  i don t think my hair would be half as long without this product  i am planning on buying more  this is the take home conditioner of a   part system  don t know how it works alone but with the first   treatments done this is a hair savour      
380,5.0,                       this does what it says   i ve used it once in   weeks and my hair still looks great everyone is different   i have generally abundant healthy strawberry blonde hair  longer  mid back  with a lot of static  dryness   flatness   and more split ends in winter i applied as directed  erred on the side of thoroughness  left it on overnight  and rinsed in the morning to get the most out of the first application and it yielded the desired effect i still use quality products for regular washing and conditioning and my hair looks far better than it has in previous years  this product has eliminated all those winter issues  each strand still looks healthy and vibrant   weeks later  has wonderful body and shine  and no static i m pleased  and i imagine will get another application or two out if this bottle if i apply it the same way when the need arises      
381,3.0,                       this is moisturizing and works okay for dead or split ends  i ve noticed my ends looking much healthier  it has a nice scent and isn t overpowering  it just smells like salon shampoo  i will say it is a very small amount of the product for the price  i have been able to make it last longer by pairing it with other products after the first few uses  i have used it   times and have about     of the bottle left  that s just with me applying this to my ends and then gently distributing it upwards  so it doesn t last long  i don t think i will be reordering this because of the small amount you get for the price  i just don t feel like it made my hair grow or stay hydrated as well as it should  overall it s a good product and did moisturize but just not the results i am looking for in that price range      
382,5.0,                       i bleach my hair as pale as i can to dye it various fantasy colors  my hair was in very good shape when i started bleaching it half a year ago and i m doing my best to keep it that way  after hearing the glowing reviews i decided to try olaplex to maintain and improve my hair s health i started using olaplex a month and a half ago  my hair was newly bleached and dyed and felt a little dry  frizzy  and stressed  i applied the olaplex once a week  for at least an hour  but often longer  i also use a coconut oil mask every week or two i noticed an improvement  but wasn t immediately sure it was the olaplex until i bleached my hair again  right after the bleach and toner my hair didn t feel bad at all  a little dry  but not as bad as before and not at all stressed like the last time  i think it s made a big help to my hair and as long as i continue to bleach my hair i will be using olaplex  i m also going to buy olaplex   and   for future bleaching      
383,5.0,                       holy cow  used this for a half hour  followed with a deep conditioner for an hour  on wavy  fine  high porosity hair  i ve been dying my hair for years and the damage was visible in that it was frizzy and dull despite months of the curly girl method  this boost  this one thing i added to my routine  was almost emotional  the wave is now a lot more defined  it s been hours and it s still maintained it s moisture and wave  it s so much shinier it s ridiculous  this is it  game changer      
384,5.0,                       olaplex is amazing      i bleached my hair  x and the integrity was protected thanks to this solution  it smells amazing too      
385,3.0,                       i imagine that this product might be great for really damaged hair or dyed hair  i have long  wavy  fine  natural silver hair that has never been dyed  it takes a beating from sun and swimming  but i try to take care of it  i noticed that it was beginning to look a little damaged and i decided to try this product  i have now used it twice   a week apart  and i have not noticed any really difference  the ends might curl a bit more  but that s about it  i was hoping that it would feel smoother  silkier  stronger      but i can t say that it the case  i will finish the bottle and see if my opinion changes  but at this point given the cost of the product  i would not purchase it again      
386,5.0,                       this is a miracle in a bottle  my hair is processed and therefore a little dry and damaged but this totally brought it back to life  i use it once a week and that seems to do the trick but i leave it on for an hour  covered in a shower cap     
387,5.0,                       never in my life have i had hair so healthy  my hair is chronically dry from occasional chemical straightening  and i use oils a lot of the time to help with frizz  but this stuff has transformed my hair  i was so skeptical since it s a bit expensive for the size but it works      
388,5.0,                       like many others i ve been transitioning from straightening to cgm   curly girl method during quarantine and this is one of my best product discoveries so far  now that i know of this product  i d use it no matter how i was styling my hair  makes a big difference in the texture and smoothness of hair  lives up to the hype       
389,5.0,                       i totally love this product   i have read many review stating that this is not authentic   i am extremely familiar with the entire olaplex line   this is definitely authentic   the viscosity and the smell is exactly the same   i also have the exact same results as when used in the salon   i only wash my hair twice a week   i dampen my hair prior to washing and apply the product  then sit for    minutes before washing   perfection   my bleached hair is super healthy      
390,4.0,                    el producto es perfecto me encanta pero no le pondr    estrellas porque el producto llego muy golpeado  necesitan mejorar eso  lo bueno es que no se abri  o perdi  producto  pero en si el producto es muy bueno y repara mucho el pelo        
391,5.0,                       i had bleached my hair so many times then dyed it black  then decided to go back to blonde  it really took a toll on my hair  my hair was all strechy  i tore off if i wasnt careful while brushing after the shower  also when dry it broke off onto my shirt while brushing seemed like if i had trimmed my ends     was really bad  ive used this treatment about   times and  i am seeing the results    at the beginning it was like ehhh  second time was ehhh i can see a little something but not really   third time around  im seeing my hair looks way healthier dry  and when wet its elasticity is returning back to normal      small bottle but definitley worth it    also fyi i used this treatment once every week  still using product at the moment      
392,5.0,                       this treatment is very effective   this is the only olaplex product i use  but it has made a dramatic difference to my long  color treated hair   it s expensive  but it works      
393,2.0,                       completely over hyped  not worth the price point  especially because i have huge thick annoying hair  so i literally used the whole bottle  the size of the bottle was probably  x the size of the freebie shampoos and conditioners from like motel    and that s very much for     results  my hair exactly  tbh actually slightly frizzier which shocked me   i even left it on for three hours  regardless of the bottle saying    mins minimum   bottom line save your money  this stuff is not worth it      
394,5.0,                       i absolutely love this product  i use a dime size about in my hair after i shower every   days  not using as directed  i just leave it in and it has transformed my hair  i dye my hair a new color every   months or so and have to strip the old color out and had damaged my hair pretty bad   after the first use my hair was noticeably more hydrated i have been using this for a year now and it s a game changer    if you bleach your hair you should be using this   i buy a bottle every month       for a month is worth it      
395,5.0,                       i had my hair biologed two weeks ago  it looked really pretty when it was first done but dried my hair out fast and it started breaking   i had heard great things about olaplex so i ordered it and i m very happy i did  i received it yesterday and used it today  i kept it in for    min  this is a picture of my hair today after i used it and the other one was taken yesterday  i highly recommend it      
396,5.0,                       i heard great things about olaplex and seen       videos before purchasing  and i don t regret  the magic is real  my hair was badly damaged after bleaching several times  have been using olaplex once a week for one month already and i ve seen great results so far      
397,1.0,                       i read about this product in some beauty internet article  elle    it was to be miracle product to bring my blond dyed hair to shining healthy hair  i got fried  dry  and color stripped hair  just returned it but now what  i have to have it cut shorter and hope that my natural shine and health will come back  what a rip off  i should be able to charge the manufacturer for my haircut and emotional distress      
398,5.0,                       this is great for strengthening your hair  but it does bother me the company isn t honest about what it is  it is not a conditioner  after you use this  you need a great conditioner  i just wish they would be honest  now  i see they are selling shampoo and what     a conditioner  shocker   i have had a lot of breakage over the years for various reasons  thus is the best strengthener i ve ever used  adds a ton of volume  great product  i should disclose i bought directly so can t speak to authenticity here      
399,5.0,                       this is perfect for what i bought it for  i had to bleach my hair and was advised this would help from breakage and drying  it worked wonders  i would definitely recommend if you are looking to bleach your hair  i just popped a decent amount in the bowl with the bleach and put it on my hair  hair feels great  now the product on its own works well too but my hair is already oily so i only use it on the ends but it still makes my hair a little too oily  i will probably use it as a mask and rinse it out the morning after      
400,5.0,                       after using a non lye hair straightener my hair felt like straw   one small amount of olaplex  just a little over the size of a quarter    i have thick hair  brought my hair s softness back   my hair feels normal again      
401,5.0,                       soo upon reading the reviews on this olaplex  i was a little torn whether not if it was real or a fake  tbh   but i took the risk n ordered it  and since i received it the other day i finallydecided to do a treatment today on my hair  i can genuinely tell u that this is the real thing  i had a little left over from a previous olaplex that i ordered from sephora and i tested the bottle  smell and of course texture of the product  but most importantly  if it worked on my hair just as my other bottle  and it did   i got the same or better results  so if you were feeling like i was on whether or not it s real  don t worry it is  and if u have prime u can save a little for shipping  hope this helps someone      
402,5.0,                       i have grey hair   my own and the last thing i want is frizzy houston hair  i look witchy with frizz and though that s a plus at halloween  it s not my favorite day or night look   i was surprised by this and the leave in conditioner  my hair is smoother for about   days just in time for a wash or a ruining walk outside      
403,1.0,                       the first time i tried the shampoo  conditioner and leave in treatment it dried my hair out  i thought maybe i didn t leave it on long enough  the second time  my hair started falling out as i was combing it  like   a lot of it  i immediately threw it in the trash  i only purchased it because so many are raving about it  never again      
404,3.0,                        update  it took me a while to realize this is not a conditioner  once i started using it as a treatment instead of eclectic it tomake my hair soft   i understood this is like when you use a protein treatment or some other kind of repair  it s not softening it s repairing  i started using a small amount of leave in conditioner after my shower and i notice better hair  not a lot  not enough to buy again but pretty good if it we re cheaper i d buy it again  old review  i ll update my review after using it a while but my initial impression is that i don t understand the hype  i use cheap deep conditioning packets that are way better  it did temporarily soften and smooth but a day later my hair looks almost fried    i did dye it and use another product loreal elvive smoother  but it seems like for     bucks i would ve thought wow  but i m like mehso far  maybe using it after the salon olaplex treatment  what you re supposed to do instead of a standalone item  i bet it would be much better      
405,3.0,                       i ve used this product and i think it made my hair feel really nice  i left it in for an hour or maybe a little longer  unfortunately the bottle i sent my mom was damaged and she lost a good percentage of the bottle into the shipping envelope  needs to be better packaged when shipped separately     
406,5.0,                       i was hesitant to try this because of the price  and mixed reviews  but is it definitely with it  i ve tried countless products to moisturize my highlighted hair and this is the first that actually works  i apply it   times a week for    minutes before showering  my hair is softer without being weighed down  it is applied to dampened hair so you don t need a lot of product      
407,3.0,                       this product is a bit of bother to use  so you really want it to work   i tried it  x as i always run   experiments   both times it totally straightened my short fine wavy hair   i use curly girl techniques products to enhance my curliness  so straight was not the desirable result   it lasted a week in each case and i had to work to get it curly again   it was softer  smoother    younger  looking hair   i think it would be great on long straight hair   or perhaps tightly curly hair that does not straighten so easily   the first time i only left it on the recommended    minutes   the next time after watching a few videos i applied a more generous amount and left it on    minutes   same result    straight hair   it does remove frizz  that s for sure      
408,1.0,                       i used this as it was directed  the first week for    minutes  skipped a week  and the next week for    minutes  i couldn t do anymore  it was so drying i have a mix of  c   b hair type  but extremely coarse strands  i ve bleached and dyed my hair in the past  most of which is cut off now  but i thought this would add moisture and define my curls  it did the opposite  my hair felt extremely dry and brittle after i normally don t do anything to my hair in regards to heating  styling  coloring  or anything  so if you re natural i wouldn t recommend this i understand for some people it works wonders  for me it did not  with the price point and advertising it s for  all hair  you d think it d have some beneficial affect  i guess it s trial and error  i ll stick to my jojoba and argan oils      
409,5.0,                       this product is one you apply and leave on before shampooing  it has improved my hair s health so much  i m seeing new growth and fewer split ends  highly recommend this product      
410,1.0,                       whenever i go get my hair done  my hairstylist always uses an olaplex treatment for my hair and i always leave the salon with the smoothest and silkiest hair even though i ve been dyeing it for years  i saw that they sold a mini version on amazon and i was so excited to purchase it  after just one use  i noticed my shower drain was completely clogged and the amount of hair i found was alarming  i then proceeded to dry my hair and comb it and i was left with another alarming amount of hair  i m so scared all my hair is going to eventually fall out  i cant even run my fingers through my hair without at least a strand coming out  my hair feels so thin now and it didn t even make a difference  my hair feels softer when i use conditioner  i am so mad        
411,5.0,                       it s a tiny bottle for the price  but worth it  if you spend a ton on getting your hair colored then this makes sense  i only use it once a week and it makes my hair far less brittle and overprocessed  it only takes a little  i just happened to see this in a magazine as one of drew barrymore s favorite items  i ordered on amazon  i had just changed salons and realized my new salon uses it  even though i love when my salon tries different things on me i always request that they use this because the after effect after a coloring is so noticeable      
412,5.0,                       oh my god     this product is a miracle    i have hair down past my waist and i needed something to repair the ends of my hair because it was starting to feel  straw  like  one use of this product and my hair is soooo shiny and soft again  i live in the city and the harsh water also was causing my hair to get a texture on it  and it s gone now  literal life saver      
413,4.0,                       this is legitimate and after buying a few bottles straight from the olaplex website i had a good idea of what to look for  the consistancy  color and scent were all the same as any other bottle i ve bought  as for how well it works  it s definitely a good product but you have to deep condition after using otherwise your hair will be very dry  overall well worth the money because it definitely helps treat damaged hair     
414,1.0,                       i bought this product because my hairdresser swore by it  he said it was amazing to use with every shampoo but being a curly hair girl we only shampoo once a week but we condition every day i think it was overpriced for what it is and it really has not done a thing for my hair but my hairdresser is a diva he makes everybody look gorgeous when they walk out of the salon save you money not worth the purchase     
415,5.0,                    cuando la gente me lo dec a  no lo cre a  pero en el primer uso ya not  cambios  cabello m s hidratado  suave  manejable  excelente inversi n  y eso que no tengo la l nea completa  solo este tratamiento         
416,5.0,                       honestly for the price  it has taken me a while to buy this  i really like this product  it s smells nice  i noticed a difference after   uses  however the amount of product for the price  is underwhelming  i managed to get     uses out of the tiny bottle  because i stretched it  i also do not have long hair  though it is decently thick  if you have long hair you ll be lucky to get probably   uses at the absolute most out of it  for a mother of two  dropping that type of money on a hair product is hard      
417,1.0,                       maybe i had high expectations of it  i tried and honestly i didn t feel my hair any different  sad it didn t work         
418,1.0,                       i don t know whether or not this product is an imitation since i ve never used the  real  thing  but all i know is that my hair is far more brittle and has been breaking off much worse than it was prior to applying the product twice      
419,5.0,                       i use this with the olaplex shampoo and the results have been amazing  the shampoo and conditioner used together have repaired my colored and bleached hair with continued use  leaving it feeling and looking so healthy   it s pretty expensive but what great product isn t      
420,5.0,                       completely worth the money for anyone who chemically treats their hair  i went in the other day after using this once a week for   months and the man told me i had  the healthiest hair he had ever seen      
421,5.0,                       my hair was so damaged from coloring i thought i might have to cut it all off  olaplex is awesome  i left it on for   hour   just applied it like conditioner and wrapped my hair in a towel and waited      
422,5.0,                       this product is amazing   i have damage to my hair from using hair ties as i work out do martial arts on a daily basis so it gets damaged from the hair band and from pulling in ground work and sparring   after   uses my hair which was dry and knotted easily  also have wavy curly hair  was at least     better in texture and i could run my fingers through my hair without tangles   i did leave the product in overnight  with dirty hair  then washed it out the next morning   added bonus is that it seems to help keep my hair from frizzing   highly recommend this product      
423,4.0,                       love this product  will definitely be ordering again  my hair is bleached with blonde highlights and my hair was looking and feeling dry  which i was upset about  i used this product twice and my hair felt amazing  i would definitely recommend this to anyone who colors their hair      
424,5.0,                       long story short   i went to a different beautician than my regular  my hair was broke off to the point of embarrassment  it takes my hair longer than most to grow so i didn t want to cut it all off which is what actually needed to be done  instead olaplex was highly recommended and i have to say in approximately   month and i can already see a huge difference  i would definitely recommend if you are dealing with dry  damaged broken hair      
425,5.0,                       i was a bit skeptical when i seen the price for such a small bottle  but i said to myself treat yourself the reviews keep selling you         i m natural with a million different hair patterns and it seemed like no matter how well i took care of my hair i could never get my hair to be curly enough to wear it fully natural  i would suffer some type of heat damage no matter how much heat protectant or how low of a heat setting i used  even the   pass method  damage would always appear   i consistently used this for a month by washing my hair once weekly and using this as a pre conditioner or a mixed in my deep conditioner   the heat damage is reverting and my hair bonds are thickening and looking stronger   this definitely repairs the bonds and and give your hair life again no matter the texture   i didn t use steps   or   prior but i did also use their leave in conditioner and bonding oil when using this   i definitely would recommend his product and even buying it from here   i ve seen a lot of reviews where they said they feel like they received a different product but i can honestly say i ve never had this treatment done in a salon and the product i received seems to be legit since it s repairing my hair   they have me sold for life  it s definitely worth every penny      
426,2.0,                       i have been using the olaplex salon products in my hair for a couple years now everytime i bleach my hair  the last time i bleached my hair about a month ago  it completely destroyed my hair  so when i head about olaplex at home treatments i was super excited  i used this and i could not tell a difference in my hair  my hair is dry and brittle  with one use i couldn t tell a difference  hopefully  eventually it may help my hair  but for      i expected more results especially with all the good reviews for this product      
427,5.0,                       if you have high porosity  natural  textured hair  i highly recommend this  i m very excited about this treatment  it feels like a conditioner when applied  although it is not   and when i washed it out an hour later  my hair felt obviously in better condition  my strands were clearly smoother  shinier and easier to comb through  i plan to use this especially for the bottom half of my hair because that gets the most breakage  i have about     of afro textured hair and used about half a bottle  maybe i was heavy handed  but i see myself using this continually once a month or every   weeks to make sure my hair is as strong as possible  i also alternate between henna glosses and cassia treatments as my deep conditioners on other weeks  i use rice water  flaxseed gel i m a super diy natural hair advocate  but sometimes you do need to fill in the cracks with the power of chemistry  this just fills in anything missing in my routine for repair  it doesn t mess with anything else i m personally doing  although i have    years experience with my natural hair    big chops  know how to make my hair grow quickly   i m definitely fitting this into my routine  my hair looks and feels amazing  excited to see how this will help my hair over the long term which seems like where you d see the biggest benefit  try it  they have trial kits if you re not sure  but at least n   is worth spending the money on  going to try the conditioner soon too also the price is high  but for what it is  it s worth it  there s plenty of other treatments that cost the same but don t work as well      
428,2.0,                       this little bottle is expensive per oz and i saw no noticeable difference in my hair  i have naturally wavy curl  b  high porosity hair and i use a blow dryer to straighten it everyday  i followed the directions and applied to towel dried hair and i let it sit for    mins before washing and conditioning  i expected my hair to look healthier and feel smoother after using  but my hair feels and looks no different then before i used it      
429,5.0,                       ok   i have been rolling my eyes about this stuff for months  refusing to purchase  opting for cheaper products  during covid i have subjected my hair to bleachings with novice overlapping  over processing  mixing the home kit wrong  box dyes  cheaper home hair cut scissors  you name it  i am now guilty of it  but i also admit to have learned so much  i almost lost hope with my top blondes  which are now fragile  like whispers of the ghost of my previous hair  i got olaplex    and expected nothing  since i have tried coconut oil  sweet almond oil  avocado oil  argan  leave in conditioners  it s a     lamellar water  protein filler  egg yolk and honey masks  etc  then i tried this  i could feel after the very first use that it was different  the pics are before first use and after the second use  wet and dry  no other product in my hair  i could have spent     on this instead of the handful of           that i already tried  also  i ordered another directly  same smell  same consistency  both sealed  i m not a cult member and i expect to still have to keep my blondes in rehab until they grow out   but i now have hair that feels like hair  it really is a covid hair miracle  fwiw  i use no heat and style very sparingly  as damaged hair is damaged hair  be realistic and while it may feel like magic  it doesn t make the damage permanently healed  i apply to freshly washed hair and left on for an hour each time  i may regret it but ordered   to see if it helps and will review when i try that in conjunction with    also am using this on my lightened peekaboos underneath to see if i can help breathe new life into that hair before my bright pinks go on top  there is hope to sport a messy bun again  hahhhaha yes  goals  right now i gingerly wear it back in a cloth hair tie  watch out for home self bleaching jobs   they can get addictive  and i now have a whole world of understanding as to why it is best to see a professional  always      
430,4.0,                       this is a very good product  however i could only stretch it to five applications or about a month and a half  i have fine thin hair so if i had thicker hair it would be even fewer treatments  the price seems too high for just a few applications  i recommend an improvement in that area  also  check out the level of product in the brand new bottle with a seal   it s a rip off this time  almost     is missing        
431,5.0,                       i have fine hair and it gets damaged quickly when i highlight my hair  this product has saved my hair many times and restores it to a healthy  hydrated condition after one use   highly recommend using it weekly if you have dry  damage or over procesed hair      
432,5.0,                       this stuff is amazing  i ve been bleaching my hair for a few years and even with the best conditioners my hair would be dry and brittle and the natural curl i had would be gone  i bleached my hair  days ago and after just one olaplex   treatment my hair is healthier than it has ever been  it feels thicker and softer and has incredible body      
433,5.0,                       i love this product  my hair looks great and a lot of people compliment my hair as well  i have bleached my hair twice in the past four months   this tiny bottle is just a life saver i noticed a huge difference once i left it on my hair for four hours before rinsing  as well as putting one of those disposable plastic hair covers you can buy at sally s beauty  i leave it on while i do things around the house or read      
434,4.0,                       this was not what i was expecting as i thought i was purchasing a shampoo not a treatment  my best response to this was applying it    min to washing my hair  this i think was the ideal time as my hair was soft and shiny when it dried i left it in my hair another time for   hours and actually think it dried out my hair i think this is good and not life changing     
435,5.0,                       i admit  i was initially a bit unsure about spending this much  but i ve loved how it leaves my hair  so for me it s been worth it just follow the instructions on the bottle to make sure that you coat your towel dried hair strands well  there are plenty of how to videos out there if you d like to watch before your first use  when i first started using it  my hair wasn t in a good state and i let it stay in my hair longer than the minimum time  i ve continued to purchase this and love the way it leaves my hair  along with the shampoo and conditioner  which i also started using  there s a reason why it s got a bit of a cult following    it leaves your hair soft and smelling great      
436,5.0,                       awesome product and less expensive on amazon then anywhere else   leaves your hair  very smooth      
437,5.0,                       there are two common reviews that i want to address    st  that the product is damaging their hair   if you need olaplex  your hair is already damaged   you hair is falling out and breaking because you bleached it   olaplex is amazing but it isnt going to glue your hair back together   what it will do is bond your hair that hasnt yet reached the point of breaking and it will help but some hair cannot be helped   nd is that the product is too expensive for what you get    sigh   so here is the deal   you tried to bleach your own hair because you thought it would be soooo much cheaper   your hair is burned and falling apart so now you want to find a cheap way to fix your hair   sigh   insert brand mondo rolling his eyes   good product costs money honey   you are welcome to get something cheaper but remember that you get what you pay for      
438,5.0,                       i tried it more out of despair than belief  now i am believing in this product  there is nothing like it that repairs hair like olaplex  i use now all olaplex hair products and they are all excellent      
439,5.0,                       i recently bleached my hair and trust me my ends were not happy  i decided to give this product a try and it helped  i do feel that the previous reviews on this product gave me an unrealistic idea of what this product would do  it honestly just feels like a deep conditioner  thats all      
440,1.0,                       i should have looked at the other   star reviews  i heard such great things about opalex from working in salons  my hair wasn t even that damaged i just wanted to improve it  now i need to cut off atleast   inches because it has completely fried my long hair  do not buy       
441,5.0,                       i ve only used this once and i feel a huge difference  my hair was breaking a lot from repeated bleaching  i freaked out and researched products  and their patent impressed me  so i decided to pay     for a tiny bottle of stuff  i m not usually the kind of person to splurge on stuff like that  so far it seems like the     dollars was definitely a worthy investment  after one use my hair doesn t feel like straw  it feels like it s returning to normal  while weeks of conditioning did nothing      
442,5.0,                       my hairdresser recommended this  and it doesn t disappoint  don t expect an overnight miracle  this is a treatment that builds the bonds in your hair over time  i color my hair regularly and had been trying to grow it out with little success  over the past year i ve used this as well as numbers   and   when i go to the salon  and my hair has become thick  healthy and long      
443,5.0,                       at the suggestion from my aveda hair colorist i use this at home once per week for    minutes   after few uses  my hair was softer and seemed to not be breaking so much   after a year  i have little breakage and am able to grow my hair to the length i d like while coloring my hair every   to   weeks   before this i tried using silk pillow cases  diy home remedies  salon conditioner treatments  etc   this product is so worth it      
444,5.0,                       typical olaplex quality  i ve only used this twice but i can tel my hair is softer and stronger already  i have naturally thick and course hair but i also use madison reed hair color so it s dry      
445,4.0,                       i have extremely long and thick hair  down to my bottom  and i have had it bleached before  this stuff has made my hair softer and silkier than it has ever been before  it s also much easier to comb and brush  i use foam curlers  and my curls are so much more lush and healthy looking than they used to be  i only wash my hair once every two weeks  so that s how often i use this product the only reason this doesn t get   stars is because of how little product you get in that tiny bottle  i use the entire bottle with only   washes  so i am constantly running out  if the company ever makes a larger bottle available to consumers  i ll amend my review      
446,3.0,                       i ve used it once and it did make the frizz go away  i imagine the real olaplex that isn t watered down probably does a much better job  i ll review again after the second use      
447,5.0,                       use this about twice a month for my color treated hair  doesn t smell nice but it doesn t smell horrible either  i once left it on all night and just kept my hair up in a bun the day after until i washed it out  my hair is super softer the more i use it and it tames breakage in such a major way though it s small  it s mighty and i ve used it about    times now and bottle is still halfway  granted i have short shoulder length hair      
448,5.0,                       this is the same deep conditioning treatment my hair stylist uses  she recommended buying a bottle rather than paying the same amount to come in for one treatment  depending on how much hair you have you can get a few treatments from this little guy  i leave it in my shower and put it in for at least   mins  then rinse it out  use my usual shampoo and conditioner  i can see the difference in the moisture level of my hair and feel like this bonder works well for my thick blonde hair      
449,4.0,                       i loooove this brand  i have been using no    and it s life changing  i have been using no    for about a week now  my hair definitely feels better  i wouldn t say that it has a moisturizing effect but i am finding that it helps clarify the hair and will help prevent breakage as it grows      
450,5.0,                       honestly cannot believe how well this worked for me after just one use  i left it on for    minutes instead of     wow it worked    i did not expect it to work like it did  but i though it was worth a try  i never write reviews but i just felt like everyone who has damaged their hair needs to know about this  it s a total miracle  i have tried everyhting and nothing worked  this has   just look up the science behind it  this product was made by an actual chemist and has shown to be much more effective than any other bonding treatment my hair was so dry  like horse hair  it did not dry on its own  so mushy and gummy  just yuck  now its soft and dry quickly  and feels like it had never been bleached  i m amazed before and after pictures     
451,5.0,                       my hair is super straight and tangles easy and requires a lot of conditioner  my hair is fine and ends seem dryish and can be frizzy after drying   this stuff worked great on my hair  i was worried it would make my hair at roots very greasy looking specially being a blonde but it didn t  seemed smoother and less frizzy after using  i was shocked tho when i opened the box bc i guess i didn t read how small of quantity the bottle was  the pic made me think it was bigger  you can see the actual size in the pic in my hand included      
452,5.0,                       i have some faith in this product  it took sometime for this product to work as i felt my hair was damaged by a trained professional leaving solution on my head while she squeezed another customer in on my time  my hair is fine but have a lot  i lift my roots and highlight every   months  switched to redken color products too       
453,5.0,                       absolutely amazing  my hair is bleached twice then colored purple  it was a mess but after using this  my hair was back to normal   so much better than any other treatment  only negative thing is the price and quantity  you get so little for loads of money    you can only use it about   times    but i m going to keep use it  can t live with out it      
454,3.0,                       i ve heard a lot about olaplex   i am in my    s  have thin  fine hair that is processed by a pro   i used olaplex   x a wk  til the bottle was gone   it didn t stop my hair loss  like some say it does   it made my hair feel slightly better   for the expensive price  i won t buy it again for quite a while  might look into something else   not as great as i had hoped   heard it was          
455,1.0,                       didnt moisturize  didnt feel like it fixed it and if anything it made my dry hair even dryer  i had part   and   done in the salon  will not be using again ever  super disappointing      
456,5.0,                       for the price of this small bottle i had very high expectations  and it truly delivered  this is not a hair conditioner  as it says on the bottle  it is a  hair bonder   i am    years old and i dye my gray asian hair every     weeks  this makes my hair very frizzy and dry looking no matter how much i condition  after using this twice  i washed my hair first  towel dried it  applied olaplex and left it on for      mins each time  then i did a quick rinse and towel dried it again  i blow dried it and the result is just amazing  no more frizz and fly away hair  that was   days ago and still looks good      
457,5.0,                       my hair is curly wavy but after years of flat ironing  it s become dry  brittle and lost a lot of its curl  after just two uses of this  in conjunction with the olaplex shampoo and conditioner  i ve noticed a difference  my hair is more moisturized and the curl has started to come back  i wish you got more product for the price but i recommend and will be purchasing again once i run out      
458,4.0,                       it arrived fast  it was my first time using it so i m honestly not sure how to compare it to olaplex bought from sephora or anything  not sure how you would tell it was a fake or not  but i loved the product  it made my hair extremely soft when i was washing it out and it seems slightly healthier  the first time i used it  i messed up though  apparently when using this  you need to wash it out with a low poo or shampoo and deep condition  i didn t and my hair looked aweful  it was frizzy and flat and wouldn t curl right  i have wavy curly  b to  a thick  fine hair  once i low pooed and deep conditioned  my hair came back to life  and i have liked it since using it right      
459,5.0,                       i don t understand why drying power was one of the categories i was asked to rate  this product is great for over dyed damaged hair  it s a bit expensive but it really works for me      
460,5.0,                       my hair was very weak and constantly falling out  i decided to give this a try and can see great results with only using it twice    it is not a leave in conditioner but rather you put on wet hair before shampoo and conditioner   my hair is stronger  shiny  and i have lost way less      
461,5.0,                       my hair has been damaged from about    years of permanent dye  bleaching and chemical treatments  in just one use  i put this into wet hair  wrapped my hair in a sleeping headwrap and kept it in overnight  my hair  which felt like straw yesterday  feels like silk today  time will tell whether the results last  i will be continuing this twice a week  but i have to say  i ve tried countless hair products trying to make a difference to my damaged hair and this is by far the best      
462,5.0,                       i love using this on my very fragile  dry  damaged hair   i wash and condition my hair and towel dry   then i put this on the ends of my hair   leave it on as long as you can   then i just rinse the ends   it has done wonders      
463,1.0,                       i have bought many hair products on amazon and always was happy with whatever i bought until this  this cannot be the real olaplex  it made my hair look and feel like a pile of straw and i could do nothing with it  i also felt a powdery coating all over my hair after i rinsed it out  awful  i have long wavy colored dark blonde hair and after using this hair perfector i looked like i bleached and then fried my hair with a blow dryer set on high for    hours  and my waves were stick straight and gone  stay away unless you know it is real and not some fake concoction like mine obv  is     
464,5.0,                       this literally works  hairstylists use this to fix damaged hair and they swear by it  i bleached my hair and some parts burnt and were over processed  my hairstylist told my to use this   times a week because of my hair situation and it did wonders  this product works in the bonus of you hair so fro the inside  don t expect that you will feel that is super soft because it repairs your hair inside out  overtime because it will recover your hair you will feel it stronger  i recommend leaving the product over night and when washing condition and use a hair mask  it will leave your hair flawless  also give it a few uses to see more evident results  it is an expensive product but it is worth it  before i use to buy so so many many masks and  conditioners but with this i ll rather invest in one product that works      
465,5.0,                       i ve been using olaplex products for a long time   i believe this to be authentic i ve seen reviews saying it s not real  i don t think that s the case it s a bit more expensive on amazon but that s part of the quick delivery   without running to a beauty store there is no way to get it faster  sometimes you re in a pinch and have to bite the bullet as far as the product  it s reputation speaks for itself  if you re here it s because you have read or heard how well it works somewhere  it holds up to its reputation  especially the no       
466,5.0,                       love  love  love this   my hair was mushy from over bleaching  plus my hair is getting thinner and fine   olaplex has made a tremendous difference   it is not mushy  seems thicker with no fly always   plus it lasts a long time without having to wash my hair so often   you won t regret using this   great shine also   wish i would have used it long ago      
467,1.0,                       my rating is harsh as this is expensive and claims to be a miracle  i m an admitted cosmetic junkie and obsessive about my hair and products  yes it conditioned  it did it s job in that manner   i did not find it any better than nexxem or bed head which are far more affordable  on error i double clicked when purchasing            and ordered the leave in conditioner  i ve used the products for about one month per instructions twice per week  i find more benefit from the leave in   also to be fair i bleach  tone  straighten and curl my wavy damaged hair  i expected far more  it did not damage my hair as i ve seen some claims i just don t think it made a difference  will not buy again but will continue to use until gone     
468,4.0,                       i ve read so many glowing reviews about this conditioner so i tried it pros  concentrated  very light scent  minimal packaging  moisturizingcons  not a holy grail productbottom line  while it s a decent mask  i prefer others like curls blueberry and living proof  my hair is low porosity   c  a a d not chemically processed for reference  if you have chemically damaged hair  it may produce more dramatic resultstips  use on damp hair and shampoo and condition as usual  after  rinsing it out      
469,5.0,                       i have used this product three times so far   i have noticed a significant difference in my hair   i had my hair colored and experienced dryness and breakage   this product was recommended by a youtuber   so  i gave it a try and am pleased   initially  i used it every     days and will now use every   days   i feel this product has made a huge difference with shedding  tangles  dryness  and breakage   i finally found something that worked for my coily   c hair      
470,5.0,                       tried it for the first time today  a little bit seems to go along way  only could leave it on just for the    minutes and not any longer and i didn t get to fully dry my hair because i have two tiny kids who command attention  but even with that my hair feels much better and less damaged  i imagine it would be a lot smoother had i actually been able to dry it     
471,2.0,                       this is the  nd time purchasing this product  i usually like to try hair products at different stages of my hair because they could work differently and yet again i am unimpressed  i ve used it exactly as instructed  i have a full head of very thick wavy hair and this does nothing for frizz  moisturizing  nor softness      
472,5.0,                       not fake   i was skeptical to purchase because of reviews  but i received genuine product  i also purchased shampoo and conditioner those were authentic as well  makes hair feels super soft and healthy  i leave it on   hours or more  i have really damaged hair that has become dry frizzy from all the bad coloring jobs i gave to myself  this has helped it be less unruly  even for my stubborn greys  side notes  i use it three times a weeks and leave on for   or more hours and it has done wonders      
473,5.0,                       olaplex has saved my hair on many occasions  i mix it with my hair dye and apply it straight to my hair and find that it makes the  dye last longer and strengthens  softens and repairs my hair from bleaching      
474,5.0,                       i use this weekly to give my natural curls the moisture they crave      
475,5.0,                       my hair was very damaged and i ve been using it for   years  nothing happens overnight but my hair is in much better condition      
476,5.0,                       this is the first treatment product outside of a salon that makes my hair feel  whole  i color but do not use heat on my hair and it helped with all the damage from coloring over the years  worth the cost      
477,5.0,                       saved my hair and my butt from bleaching   once my hair dries finally it does feel like the straw  type which is the norm for my hair        
478,5.0,                       i can t say enough positive things about this  it literally saved my hair  i tried several other bond repair treatments prior to using this because other reviewers were saying it s not that great  but it is  my hair had been over processed from years passed  two current treatments of color oops and a current bleach wash  even though i have level     ask brown hair   my hair was rough to say the least  touching it would make you cringe  literally straw  in december i had    cut after the recent treatments i did and i vowed to get my hair healthy again for good and grow it back  even deep conditioning and the other bonding treatments didn t help as drastically as olaplex did  i always had these patches  especially on the side  that looked like they were dead ends  except they weren t   you know those frizzy  dead looking things more towards the top of your head    yeah  so  i bought this  i used it once a week for now one month  my hair is now baby soft  no exaggeration  no frizz  no dryness  no dead ends   nothing  my stylist said it is soooo much healthier  i keep asking her to trim it and she keeps saying there is just no need for it especially since i m trying to grow it back  i seriously can t even remember the last time my hair has been this healthy  my bottle isn t even empty yet and i am very liberal with it   my hair is just past my shoulders right now but thinner   i leave in for one hour  after shampooing and conditioning  and follow with a deep conditioner after every use  i will most likely purchase another bottle after this one and continue the process for at least a few months  i should have thought to take a before pic and will add one if i can find one that counts      
479,1.0,                       terrible  horrible no good product do not believe the hype  hair snapping is real  believe the reviews on here saying the hair literally snaps  i started using this product   months after a hair dying mishap  a friend recommended it for strength but oh my god it dis the opposite  same as everyone else here with the brittle hair story  i thought i was using it wrong  tried all the levels in the treatment and then also moisturized with deep conditioners but my hair is completely broken  i am glad i have abundant hair because if i would have had thin hair i would have had to cut it way shorter  don t recommend this product not even to my worse enemy      
480,3.0,                       used this for a month and saw zero difference  in fact  if anything  my hair felt grubby or something where the build up was building up not smooth or evenly  for       i expected more the bottle is so hard to open if your hands are wet  it s annoying and frustrating  again  for       i d expect a little more effort in the designing of this to make it easier to use      
481,1.0,                       didn t work for me didn t see much results     
482,4.0,                       my hair is very damaged from bleach so i thought i d give it a go  i understood that the product was only    oz  but the directions say to apply generously from roots to ends   i have above shoulder length hair and i had to use about     of the bottle to saturate it  the kicker is that for damaged hair it says to apply     times a week  and once a week for normal hair  i might be able to get   weeks out of this bottle  a month if i only apply to my ends  my hair did feel better after one use  but unfortunately for me    oz at        for two weeks is not practical  and i wont be purchasing again  nice product though      
483,5.0,                       well worth the price  i suffer from hashimoto s and rheumatoid arthritis  both of which make your hair dry and fall out  that coupled with hair bleach and dye destroyed my hair  instead of cutting it off  i bought the olaplex set and  my hair is shiny and soft  i will never use anything else  if you are worried about the high price tag don t  with this stuff a little goes a long way and i promise you  it works      
484,1.0,                       after seeing all the great reviews i thought this would at least  help  to repair my bleached and dyed hair and  help  with the split ends  one use and half a surprisingly small and ridiculously expensive bottle later  i ve noticed no improvement  if you have thick hair  coarse hair  long hair  or maybe any hair at all  i d suggest you try something else info    c  natural hair  bleached and dyed  middle back length      
485,5.0,                       i have thick  naturally very dark hair  usually when i colour my hair much lighter  my hair tends to dry out  become brittle and dull  this is magic in a bottle  using this product regular my hair is now manageable  shiny and super healthy   at first i used it once a week and kept it on overnight  now i use it every couple of weeks and keep it on for a couple of hours or so  the longer you leave it on the better the results are  i also use the conditioner once a week  again another amazing product   as far as the bottles i received from amazon  i can say these are the real product  i compared them to the ones i bought from sephora and they re identical      
486,3.0,                       my hair is in relatively good condition  i never blow dry or heat style but it s longer than ever bc i ve avoided salons through the pandemic  i was lured by the hype  i used the product once a week  there s about   use left  i got   applications from the bottle   again  my hair is long and thicker   i haven t seen any changes in my hair whatsoever      
487,1.0,                       i ve ordered this a few times and up until the last order  i received the real product  this last order  however  the consistency was different and my hair did not feel as it usually does after i use this during my shower beware      
488,5.0,                       i m a natural brunette and i balayage my hair into an ice blonde   i use this right before i color my hair and a few times between colorings whenever my hair feels dry   works great   my stylist recommended it to me and it s worth the price for healthy hair in my opinion      
489,4.0,                       i read a lot of reviews and was skeptical of what this could do for my hair   i used the whole bottle in one sitting since i have such long hair and it felt really damaged from bleaching   i kept it in for over an hour and rinsed   i didn t notice anything immediately but the next few washes there was a significant difference  my hair felt stronger and softer   will buy again   deducted one star since the amount of product is so small  someone like me with long hair will go through a bottle in one use so that gets expensive      
490,1.0,                       i have bought olaplex from my hair stylist and absolutely loved it  i saw this on amazon with free shipping and i thought it would be no big deal  i have used it a couple of times and now i have an itchy scalp and dandruff after using this product  such a bummer  now i m not sure what i should do      
491,5.0,                       works wonders on my hair  my hair has been very dry and damaged from too much straightening and curling from hot tools and my ends were starting to look terrible  to be honest  i have thin hair  do not get hair cuts often  and i blow dry and straighten or curl my hair almost every single day so my hair goes through a lot on a daily basis   i heard about this product from a relative who is a hair stylist and she said she uses it often and it is amazing for your hair  i used it for the first time a few days ago but i did not have much time to keep it on for very long so i left it on around       mins and after blow drying my hair it looked much healthier  my hair was silky and soft with less visible damage and that was only after   use  i am very positive it will only get better the more i use it and the longer i keep in on my hair if it worked well after only one    min use      
492,3.0,                       i used this to help my hair after bleaching  my hair is soft  however i left it in for    minutes to try and make sure it completely saturated my hair  the bottle stated    minutes  longer if necessary     and it stripped my pink permanant color out   every review i read said that this wouldn t happen  but i used nothing else new  the back of my head is white  blond and it washed the pink out  super super disappointed  for this cost  now i have mismatched color hair      
493,5.0,                       i bleached my hair from my natural dark brunette to blonde which was cool but fried my hair and completely made it feel like dead damaged straw until i used this product   i have been using it once a month consistently and my hair is amazingly revived  not totally back to my natural strength smoothness   but amazingly improved nonetheless       
494,3.0,                       not sure how to feel about this product  i expected miracles based on reviews  but i didn t notice any change  i even bought this a few times to make sure it wasn t just a  bad batch  maybe my hair is just more damaged than all the other reviewers         
495,5.0,                       a must for people who dye their hair blonde  literally life changing   i dye my hair a lot and a few different colors  this has brought back my length and hair of my hair  thank god for this product     
496,5.0,                       after reading the reviews i was skeptical but after using this product  this is a must have product  my hair was severely damaged  over processed as i was relaxing and coloring my hair  i would just touch my hair and it was breaking off  after the first use my hair felt stronger and soft  no more brittleness  i will continue to use this product twice a week  my hair now has shine and just feels amazing  if i do decide to relax may hair  will definitely use this product      
497,1.0,                       my hair s color treated and it s only slightly damaged and of course super dry  my hair is pretty long and after saturating my hair with it half the bottle was gone and i was ok with that because that s what happens when you have long hair  after leaving it on my hair for       hours i shampooed and conditioned as usual and blow dried my hair but i have not noticed any change  difference whatsoever  a     treatment  since half of the bottle s gone after one use  and no change at all   that s very disappointing  i ll be doing the process one more time next week and update if i see any difference after   times use  bottom line  it s a very expensive treatment and not really worth it  i do not recommend it unless you have money to burn or you re bored      
498,5.0,                       first  if you are saying this did nothing for your hair  your hair was already in excellent shape  period   now on to the facts  i screwed my hair up  haven t we all at some point  yeah  it was like hay  i used a new product and we have all been there when you can t look at it any longer and through your panic  you keep screwing it up   my hair didn t even feel like hair this morning  once upon a time i went to beauty school as well and have destroyed my hair many times but never had i used a product once and it was practically back to normal  yes  one time  because my hair was so compromised  i really had little hope but seriously  after today  i will not go without this stuff  if you re like me  your not buying the whole pack  good god        no thanks       totally worth every dime  all i can say  is i am so glad i got this stuff  i have a trip coming up in a few weeks and i would go looking like helga the witch woman  day freaking saved      
499,3.0,                       i have used a whole bottle of the olaplex now  while i have seen some results  they were not as great as i expected  i have since tried several other products  including redken ph  and pronexa bond repair       hairgenics pronexa hair bond repairing complex                        the pronexa bond repair is superior in just about every way  smells better  has a better consistency  and i got vastly better results in fixing the damage to my hair  and this was after going through an entire bottle of olaplex   redken ph was also decent  but i prefer the pronexa     
500,5.0,                       i m freshly out of the shower after using olaplex no        and    shampoo and conditioner   in       for the first time in my    years  i had crown breakage to the point of seeing my actual scalp  i hit youtube and began to watch i don t even know how many hair tutorials on damaged relaxed hair  crown thinning  crown breakage  alopecia  going natural     now i m not one for just buying products because someone else raves about it  but along with starting to make my own diy hair oils and protein treatments  i did purchase a few products that really did wonders for my hair   a main staple for life is joico moisture recovery shampoo  conditioner  and treatment balm   but i do have some other faves  shea moisture manuka honey and mafura oil  and herbal essence coconut milk shampoo and conditioner    once a month i also use aphogee   step protein shampoo and conditioner  and after a relaxer  which i do my own   i would follow the   step system with the hardcore aphogee protein treatment   november       my hair was longer than it had ever been in my life   i ve never had long hair  so when my hair began resting on my upper back  i was doing cartwheels   however  my crown was still an issue to try something new  i began watching tutorials on ayurvedic hair care   i purchased and mixed together some fantastic ayurvedic powders  which  had i used them as a treatment once in awhile  i m sure my hair would have continued to thrive   but  i made the mistake of adding a nice heaping of the ayurvedic powder to my hair oil that i would put on my hair daily as a moisturizer  after washing  conditioning  and deep conditioning my hair one week after a relaxer  i took the towel off and looked like bozo the clown   my hair was straight but the ends were puff balls all the way around  my hair had never done that   protein overload   i was heartbroken   i gave myself a good trim  but for the next few weeks  hair was everywhere  my bathroom floor looked like a bear skinned rug  pieces of hair on the bathroom walls  sink  it was a mess   unfortunately i had to deep trim my hair to remove all the damage  which meant cutting all of the length that i had grown   i still have decent length in the front  but i cut the back of my hair even with just above the nape of my neck   it s hair   it will grow back i had been hearing about olaplex for a very long time and i figured  if there was a time to try it  now is the time   i let the no    stay on my hair for    minutes   i used a small dollop of the olaplex shampoo and omg the lather   could not believe it    after using the olaplex conditioner  i was hooked   after the conditioner  i loaded my hair with asiam hydration elation conditioner and oils   i m sitting with a plastic cap and steam cap on while i write this review for those saying olaplex made your hair feel rough or didn t work  well maybe that s true  or maybe you didn t follow up with a deep conditioning moisturizing conditioner afterwards   i know olaplex is a bond builder  not a protein treatment  but they both strengthen the hair   you have to replenish the moisture after this treatment or you may think it just left your hair rough   i m now streamlining my wash routine to twice a week   the olaplex system on the weekends  and the joico system midweek   and while i ll continue to make my own incredible hair oil  that will be the extent of my diy concoctions   i already know my hair is capable of growing strong and healthy  and   relaxers later  had i not damaged my hair  i wonder what length it would be right now   but  i m on my way back  and olaplex is now along for the journey       
501,5.0,                       bleached my hair during quarantine and got it to lift to a level    for the white ash blonde  the whole process made my hair felt like straw and super dry  the texture of my hair was really crunchy and hard to comb out  but olaplex brought it back to life again  left no    on over night and it changed my hair back to feeling normal  this stuff is amazing for bleached hair  i should have just went straight to this product in the first place      
502,5.0,                       i heard about this product from a friend  she was having some highlights added to her beautiful long thick hair the hairdresser left the the foil in too long and fried the back of her hair  much of it breaking off  she used this product with incredible results   so  i decided to give it a try  my hair is dry  has highlights and wanted it to look more healthy and more manageable  after using this product  my hair looks healthy and shiny  my hairdresser also now use all   products on my hair         and    when appropriate  it has no silicone or sulfates       
503,5.0,                       my hair was so damaged after i bleached it on accident too long  i usually never have issues with my ends breaking or any hair falling out but this time i did  i had fly aways everywhere  i searched and searched for the best treatment and after just one use so far  this stuff brought life back to my hair  i have naturally curly hair and when i blow dry it it s usually very frizzy but my hair was easy to maintain after this  i definitely recommend this product      
504,5.0,                       i have  c curly hair i am in transition from dark to very light blonde  this has been a life saver i apply a generous amount evenly to damp hair  focusing more on the chemically treated parts  i put my hair up and let it sit for about an hour and then i rinse and follow with a deep conditioner  i have done this    a week and my hair has been able to keep its integrity throughout my transition i have even found that my curls are more defined and feel stronger than they did before i started applying chemicals please keep in mind that this is not a deep conditioner  but it does help reinforce and bridge the gap between broken bonds in your hair s structure  there bonds are broken any time we apply chemicals and or heat and the damage intensifies if you are not caring for your hair by giving it the proper moisture and maintenance  this olaplex will help repair that damage but the stove ingredients do not provide the exact same thing as deep conditioners also  think about this before you buy  as many people have complained about the price being so expensive for what you get  if you understand what  exactly  it does and can use it in a system with other products for your hair type and problems then i think you will find that it is a holy grail      
505,5.0,                       this all of olallex treatment works well  i have the treatment done at the salon  they sell the shampoo and conditioner which is step four and five respectively  however i did not have step three  i use this once a week  i placed it on wet hair and leave it sit for    minutes under a plastic shower cap and wrap my head in the towel  so far so good  i have hair past my shoulders that has highlights and it seems to feel smoother and have less breakage  i would say this is authentic just the same as the ship that conditioner i purchased at the salon  highly recommend it      
506,5.0,                       this product is excellent   it s not a conditioner it actually repairs the hair  i lighten my hair blonde so ofcourse there s damage  and i could tell a huge difference after just one use  i only left it on    minutes the first time and my hair felt so much better      
507,5.0,                       love all the olaplex line   my son in law is a stylist color specialist   he directed me to this line  i have naturally curly white silver hair and this makes it easy to manage and it looks beautiful      
508,3.0,                       i had heard so many people raving on about this product i just had to buy one my hair is fine but i have a lot   its very strong and normally adapts to anything that i apply   not this product it felt heavy and really didnt give me the conditioned look and feel that i wanted   i left it in overnight  no different very overpriced and there are alot more products out there that work much better for me       
509,4.0,                       this product is worth the hype read the instructions  my first use was not so hot as i didn t see that it was to be applied on dry hair before you wash it  i ve left mine in from         minutes  when you rinse it out you can instantaneously feel the difference and i m talking about before you even shampoo  i have chemically straightened hair with colour and bleached highlights  my hair only looks normal today because of this product      
510,5.0,                       if you re hair has been damaged or is breaking off by a bad color job  use this  my hair was literally fried by a hairdresser that put bleach directly on my hair  i had no idea you weren t supposed to do this  she left it on too long and my hair was like cotton candy  this completely transformed my hair     
511,5.0,                       first of all  let me start of by saying if you receive a product without a safety seal  or you are familiar with olaplex and the product just doesn t seem  right   definitely send it back  amazon gets it s products from multiple distributors  so unfortunately there is sometimes a  small  chance of getting a fake product  however  that being said i am pretty familiar with olaplex  and the product i received was     percent authentic i had made the mistake of being super impatient with my hair coloring process and did wayyy too much in a very short amount of time  my poor hair was not happy  it looked frazzled  poofy  and my color looked uneven patchy and dull  i was afraid i would have to do a professional keratin treatment to get it to look healthy and shiny again i had not done an olaplex treatment in a pretty long time  and certainly hadn t done it on hair that had been pretty significantly damaged  i decided to give my hair a few days break and ordered olaplex   off amazon  when it arrived i had put so many products in my hair to keep it tame  that i knew i needed to shampoo it first  i put the olaplex on towel dried hair  thoroughly saturated the strands  and let it sit for    minutes i shampooed my hair again with sulfate free shampoo the second time around  and then deep conditioned my hair for    minutes  while i was rinsing my hair  i could already tell that it fell so much better  after i styled my hair i was amazed  my hair was     better after just one use  i would have been surprised to see it even     better  this stuff is now my holy grail hair product  the more you use it  the more it is supposed to mend the hair  i can t wait to see what it looks like after a couple of more washes my hair is shiny  the color looks even and professionally done since it corrected the dry patchy areas  and it feels so silky  i didn t have to do a   hour keratin treatment and kill my naturally curly hair for several months  my hair looks awesome and i feel like the price of this product is      worth it  you just need to make sure you are using it correctly  it is not a conditioner  it is a treatment that repairs the bonds in your hair  you still have to shampoo the product out and condition after  i highly recommend this product      
512,5.0,                       first off  i just want to say that i have never written a product review in my life  but i had the most incredible experience with olaplex that i had to share i have always had relatively dry hair  it s naturally very light blonde and i spend a lot of time in the sun and salt water so it tends to get even drier and almost bleached like in the summer  it got so bad recently that my hairdresser had to give me bangs to get rid of hair that was essentially irreparably damaged  she suggested olaplex and i thank her non stop for it i bought the full set and used for a little over   weeks and my hair is silk  it feels so strong and healthy and its bright and shiny every day and never looks dull anymore  when i let it air dry it s never frizzy and when i blow dry it  it never feels dry  days after washing  it still feels and looks just as great every day my hair feels like i just left the salon  everyone should be using this set       
513,5.0,                       let it be this   olaplex   does amazing things for your hair   i have tried so many hair products  too many to count but nothing  absolutely nothing compares to olaplex     worth it s weight in gold   you won t be disappointed   wish i could  have a dollar for every person that has asked what i use on my hair because it looks so healthy      
514,5.0,                       i ve used it once  left it on overnight  which i have read over and over that it is okay to do  and the next morning washed it out and let it air dry  i did a quick wash and go but my hair was so   lucious  so soft and bouncy so i am very impressed  that was only the first time trying it and i already know it will be part of my hair care routine for a long time     i have color processed hair the has a lot of damage to the ends   great product       
515,3.0,                       i thought this was just ok  nothing great or amazing  i have only used it as directed one time  i will use it again just to see if i get any results but i ve had better results from other deep moisturizers that have been better      
516,5.0,                       my stylist originally recommended olaplex  since i don t see her anymore  trying to save     when i ran out  i bought olaplex through amazon  i recently colored my hair myself and it went very badly  after yet another attempt at coloring and several uses of silver shampoo to fix the horrible orange outcome  my hair was fried  olaplex saved my hair  i left it on much longer than recommend  but now that my hair is heathier  i just use it as directed  amazing product  i m a user for life      
517,5.0,                       this product is absolutely amazing  i have very long hair and i have been able to use this bottle for four applications  there is no odor to the product and is easily applied  your hair must be towel dried when using  do not use on dry hair or you will need the entire bottle and it will be less affective  it stops working after    minutes so the people who will leave it on overnight are not going to see any different result  i tried leaving it on for six hours to see if there was any difference and there was not  therefore just leave it on for    to    minutes  i have bleached my hair multiple times and this has really rescued my hair      
518,5.0,                       this is not a conditioner  if you still think this product is a conditioner or expect it to perform like one  stop reading  i have been getting my hair done professionally since      and am very conscientious knowledgeable about hair products processes  i hadn t been able to find a hair stylist who is multi talented  past typical hair color balayage knowledge  and have been to   different stylists since may  i went to a different hair stylist for a full set of highlights   week after getting color balayage done that was not done how i asked  the salon does not have olaplex or any conditioning treatments  so my hair was subjected to      bleach  it looked and felt fried  my hair was no where near what i was looking for  so i booked with yet a different stylist for a new full set of highlights  color etc  i knew if i didn t do something to condition my hair before then that it would not tolerate any more chemicals without breaking off  i used the olaplex   for   days straight  i left it on for   hours then washed with amika normacore shampoo followed by marc anthony damage repair mask   my hair looked and felt incredible  my stylist confirmed that whatever i did helped and that it allowed her to spend   hours on my hair  i would recommend olaplex   to anyone with severely damaged hair from lightening chemical treatments  i would not use it more than   times per week as too much protein will cause damage      
519,5.0,                        st   foremost   this olaplex no  is the exact olaplex no  i purchased from a  sephora store on vacation in las vegas  the bottle did have a seal on it     the fragrance   the consistency is the exact same if not actually a bit more potent    i m not sure if that may be the case  because of the vegas heat traveling etc  but this is a   thumbs up  i was worried due to other reviews but personally this was great  also as a hairdresser myself olaplex no  is not a miracle product  it s also not a conditioner is a bond repair  which pretty much puts a so called  coating  on the hair while moisturizing  to keep the hair strong when styling to prevent further breakage   split ends etc     it also adds significant healthier hair luster and shine  but the key to this product working is   read directions   you have to leave this in your hair for about    mins or longer and then shampoo condition your hair  its truly amazing of the significant shine  movement    bounce  if seen after doing this treatment on my hair  as well as human hair extensions human hair wigs  which is of course longer hair     really made the hair after letting it air dry   or blow drying styling look and feel beautiful   pretty much revived  is it permanent  no  but just re treat your hair  no product in this world  gets rid of split ends  besides a scissor trimming them off  your hair will be revived with protein and using a decent shampoo  i personally use schwarzkopf gliss fiber therapy shampoo  and a very nice conditioner  i either use nexxus or schwarzkopf gliss conditioner  and after doing the entire process correctly  it is significant difference    some people may look for a brand new head of hair  no  but it definitely revives and you will not regret it  just use it correctly and once a week  you will not regret it      
520,5.0,                       although it s expensive for the amount you get it is totally worth it  after one use i can see the difference in my hair  i recently lightened a lot of it and     inches of my ends were just dry  fried and hay feeling  this product has made such a big difference already  it made my hair more silky and smooth  i m going to use it once a week for now     
521,1.0,                       label not put on straight and small air bubbles on top of label leaves me feeling like someone printed and put a sticker on this bottle  not sure if this is the real product or not      
522,5.0,                       this was recommended by me by my hair dresser years ago   i have hard water and i highlight my hair     times a year  so damage is there   they way this makes my hair feel and look is great   definitely takes the frizz away and looks and feels healthier      
523,3.0,                       i honestly don t understand what the hype is   my hair didn t look or feel any different   i ve even let it sit overnight  and my hair felt just the same   maybe it s that i have curly hair and this is better for straight   i m not sure  but i m not a believer in this product      
524,1.0,                       makes your hair fall out  not worth the money  plus the bottle is very tiny      
525,1.0,                       this did nothing it stated and is a waste of money  of course you need to use the whole bottle before you can see that it does not work      
526,5.0,                       everyone always told me about this product and reviews were amazing but to be honest  same thing of mix your conditioner with olive oil and love in your heart for       min    same thing  disappointed     
527,4.0,                       i have damaged broken hair due to  way to many bleach sessions  i coated my hair and left it on for     hours  it did help hydrate my hair just not as much as i was hoping it would  i m going to leave it on longer the next time and hope it works even better  it did more good than bad  so it s worth a try       
528,5.0,                       this stuff has literally changed my life  i have really damaged  dry  color treated  curly hair and struggled with breakage and split ends my whole life  if you lighten your hair this is a must  i usually sleep with it in my hair and when i wash it out in the morning my hair is soo soft      
529,5.0,                       if you find your  hair drying and a little frizzy  add this product with water  put on a shower cap and let it do its job   easy to shampoo out and leaves your hair looking more manageable and soft      
530,5.0,                       this is a pre wash bond repairing treatment  applies like a mask to damp hair  but the formula repairs the bonds in your hair follicles that retain moisture  if your hair is extremely dry or damaged  due to bleaching  coloring  or heat damage  this bonding treatment will repair the hair in a way that will allow a deep conditioning treatment to be effective that being said  i wash my hair twice a week maximum  so i use this before my saturday wash and it s amazing  i would love to get my hands on all the olaplex products      
531,5.0,                       this product has made such a big difference in my color treated hair  i ve found it has the greatest impact if i mist my hair with water until damp and combine the olaplex with another beneficial hair oil  comb through gently  and sleep with it  i have long hair so i braid my hair to sleep so less messy  however  you don t have to use a ton to the point that your hair is saturated  the next day i wash out  shampoo and then condition      
532,5.0,                       wow  my hair has not looked this good in years  i m   months postpartum and have had that lovely postpartum hair loss for the past   months and my hair has been fragile  i put this stuff in my hair and left it overnight and wow  it s that  just left the salon  look  my hair is still falling out   nothing will stop that  but the hair that i do have is much stronger  softer and thicker i hesitated for the longest time to buy it  because it is pricey  but it is worth every cent  i probably spent more on using other conditioners and treatments that don t work than if i d bought the product in the first place      
533,5.0,                       nothing works to restore the integrity of bleached or highlighted hair like this product    nothing  i keep a bottle in the shower and use a small amount on just the ends in between weekly treatments  if you re going to keep blonde highlighted hair  make this investment to keep your hair from breaking or becoming rough and brittle from processing  in just one treatment  you ll be a fan      
534,1.0,                       i really really really wanted to love this product but it didn t work for my hair  i applied it   times and did nothing for my hair i was extremely disappointed     
535,5.0,                       love this stuff  it really helps repair super damaged hair if you leave it on for a long time after bleaching my hair  i leave it in for a few hours with a shower cap on to keep the moisture and heat in my hair feels amazing after      
536,5.0,                       this is the best conditioner i have found to date  i use it once a week and leave on for about an hour  it leaves my hair feeling stronger and healthy and shiny  you don t need to use a lot and it is worth the price  great product  a real keeper      
537,5.0,                       i bought this bc the hype about olaplex  and my hair is normally black and lifted to a level    so i do have breakage  damage  split ends etc  so i used this about  x now and my hair is softer  shinier  but still has some breakage  and you know those white ends at the end of my hair shaft from prior breakage at the bottom  so i got paranoid reading some reviews that it s not real blah blah  so i bought   from the olaplex website and they are the same  same consistency  same smell  same bottle  same effect  so unless they manufacture dupes better than professional knockoffs this is legit olaplex and you just have to keep doing the treatment until your hair is at your desired health btw  amazon olaplex on the left  olaplex direct from website on the right     
538,1.0,                       i read reviews on other sites that you should be careful about buying olaplex from amazon because they are not a certified dealer  unfortunately  i ignored the caution and bought this product  i put it on my hair and it doesn t work  it s past the    day return date  so i can t return it  don t buy this  instead  purchase this at sephora or another certified dealer      
539,1.0,                       i did not pay attention while ordering this because it was the same price at the salon but wow no   it is so tiny and not worth the money they are asking  this product itself is great dont get me wrong but this seller is not giving you the best bang for your buck      
540,5.0,                       my hair is treasure to me and as a little girl  momma kept amazing care so my hair was always gorgeous and shiny and soft to the touch  but as the chemicals came in with hair dyes and the burning with the blow dryer and or iron  my hair although still long was very damaged at the tips and just looked dull overall  so i started a search for something to revive my poor locks  and then  i was introduced to my little miracle hair mask  olaplex hair perfector no          i have gotten so many compliments on my hair and have used the product for such a short amount of time  i can t imagine how much healthier and beautiful it s going to get  but i can t wait and am about to purchase more  my hair s condition has improved      i mean  i air dry my hair a lot and it takes the perfect wavy look with bounce and shine  so muuuuuch shineeee    it smells divine       i love hair products that aren t to sweet or minty and this almost smells like chanel shampoo  ha  but seriously  so good i ve recommended to at least    random people  they all want to know what i do to keep my hair looking so fab  and i am happy to share this secret because sheesh what a turn around for my mane   and then let s add the family members i ve told need to hop on the olaplex train  thisisnotanad  but definitely a super happy customer with her hair results  true story  g     
541,5.0,                          is a great product  i use it on dry or wet hair anywhere from   min to overnight  i have very long wavy curly hair so detangling is the most important to me  the bottle is small so i might get   uses out of it  i also use the shampoo conditioner and leave in  i recently got the     but don t know if this is needed   it really transformed my hair and helped with the stress i usually have in wash day      
542,1.0,                       it is not real olaplex  it didn t help my hair at all so i bought a different one from an actual olaplex retailer   they don t smell the same  i called olaplex and they told me that amazon isn t an authorized retailer     
543,4.0,                       this stuff has been a godsend lol  my hair is bleach blonde and has been through the wringer and needed some help  but i haven t found an oil or conditioning mask that did anything  i ve used this twice and my hair feels so healthy and i even got a comment about how it looks like i just walked out of the salon  the only con is that there s not a lot of product  and for someone with thick hair it s kinda a bummer to me that it s a little pricy but i ll probably only get a few uses out of it  i used it once and went through about     of the little bottle  i d say it s worth it though and i ll be buying more    thank youuuu     
544,5.0,                       my hair tends to be dry and this is a quick remedy to moisturize and give back some body  it smells amazing  highly recommend      
545,5.0,                       this stuff saved my hair i went from dark brown  almost black hair to caramel highlights with chocolate lowlights in one day  the first picture shows  my hair literally from one day to the next when i first got it done   weeks ago  the bleaching process was brutal  and i was afraid i would end up with split ends  breakage  and hair that felt like straw  my stylist mentioned adding olaplex to my hair color  so i figured i would look it up and see what it was  that s how i found out about the     hair perfecter   decided to order some and try it out  the results were immediate  my ends felt hydrated and my hair was left soft and with very little shedding  this stuff is expensive  but definitely worth the cost if you are someone who colors or bleaches your hair  i simply wash my hair once  then apply it to my damp hair and let it sit for a few hours  i then wash it again and apply conditioner and allow that to sit for a while or overnight  rinse  blow dry  press and style  and i am good to go  this stuff allows me to achieve salon results at home without going to the salon every week for maintenance  and enables me to rock heavy highlights without worrying about damaging my hair  i would definitely recommend it      
546,3.0,                       for the price and reviews  i thought this stuff would be a miracle  it s not  didn t really do much for my hair  which has been severely abused and is over half way down my back  so it s pretty long  i didn t scrimp either  i used half the bottle at one time and left it on a long time too  i ve gotten better results from cheaper products      
547,4.0,                       this has worked wonders in restoring my hair  i severely damaged my hair with multiple at home bleaching sessions  going from dark brown to platinum blonde  the last bleaching session i did caused ton of breakage  after research  i discovered olaplex   it really does work to restore your hair  one thing i will add is that it s definitely not a leave in conditioner  you absolutely must rinse thoroughly out of your hair or it leaves your hair unmanageable to comb through when drying  in my personal experience and opinion      
548,5.0,                       i put this on damp hair with a plastic cap over it and then a stocking cap to sleep in  i did this twice a week for two weeks and it fixed my bleach and permed damaged hair      
549,5.0,                       i believe this is the real deal  i was skeptical ordering this on amazon  however my hair no longer feels dry like straw  my hair felt silky after i washed it out and the next morning my hair still felt soft instead of slightly crispy  i m very impressed and will be ordering more when this runs out  i will say i only had to use a tiny amount for my whole head and it worked beautifully      
550,5.0,                       i normally healthy hair has suffered from changes in medications in the last   months  my hair was breaking and shedding   i saw olaplex recommended on the nbc today show and decided to give it a try   it is not conditioner per se   you wash your hair  towel dry it  then add a small amount of olaplex   to your palm   apply the white cream to your hair and leave in for       minutes or so   olaplex is described as  bonding your hair    after    minutes  i shampooed and conditioned my hair as usual   the damaged hair lost the dry  split ends look and looked healthier   i dried my hair and styled as usual   very pleased with this product   package suggestions say to apply     times a week   i probably used about a teaspoon when applying      
551,5.0,                       finally     a prewash mask that delivers what is promised    i have medium to thick wavy  dare i say frizzy  color processed hair  i regularly color and highlight lowlight my hair at the salon  spending that kind of money to keep my hair in top shape i have been searching for a hydrating prewash hair mask that would not weigh my hair down and would help keep my ends hydrated  this one delivers     i highly recommend getting the shampoo and conditioner that go along with the hair mask  it s the trifecta for keeping my hair wavy without frizz  i use them once a week as a repair for all the damage i do coloring and styling my hair with heat tools      
552,5.0,                       i don t see how anyone could say this is a bad product  it keeps my bleached blonde hair in good health  my hair is always better after using this treatment try this once and you will see a difference      
553,5.0,                       olaplex   is amazing   since the salons were shut down  i started bleaching my hair myself   my hair was very damaged   i have tried many good products   but not as good as olaplex     my beautiful  healthy hair is back  and i get lots of compliments i m going to start using other olaplex hair products now      
554,1.0,                       this was recommended in one of the  great products on amazon  articles   didn t improve my hair one bit   to the contrary  my hair looked worse after using   garbage      
555,1.0,                       i am almost done with this bottle and i see no difference in my straw hair  i am trying to save what hair i have left due to bleach  thought this would help due to reviews i have seen but very disappointed  just wondering how many bottles i need before i see a difference cause these bottles are not cheap      
556,5.0,                       i started the curly girl method about   years ago after flat ironing my hair my whole life   it turns out my hair is actually very curly    c  a  low porosity  and coarse   i started using this product about a year ago because it was so heavily recommended across multiple curly girls on instagram   it was a gamechanger for me   it helped my curl pattern tighten even more and it really helps undo any damage you may have been doing to your hair   it s almost like a reset button   i usually layer it on dirty hair on a wash day with my deep conditioner and let it sit under a hot cap for       minutes   then  i shampoo  condition  and style as normal    i do dirty deep conditions because it helps with preventing build up on my low po hair    it is pricey  i will say that   but  a little goes a very long way and i usually can go months before i have to buy a new bottle  even using it fairly heavily on a weekly basis  i definitely notice a difference when i stop using it for awhile   again  i can t say enough great things about it  and it smells heavenly      
557,1.0,                       i have platinum curly hair   did nothing good   if anything my hair was dryer and very  stiff     it also changed the color and is more strawberry blond in it      if you can believe that   i can t but it s sadly true      
558,5.0,                    este producto es fant stico  te deja tu cabello s per liso sedoso  limpio y con un olor agradable     es tan bueno que con solo un poco  de secador te queda el cabello super        yo lo uso una vez a la semana y me a ca do muy bien lo seguir   comprando        
559,5.0,                       i have naturally wavy hair and in searching for products to take care of my trusses i found olaplex hair perfector no   repairing treatment  i live in a desert climate and the heat makes my hair a little frizzy so wanted to find something to tame it  i dampened my hair  worked a small amount of the olaplex product through my hair and went to bed  i rinsed my hair thoroughly  no shampooing  the next morning and oh my gosh  my hair is super bouncy and my waves are tighter than usual  i have blonde  very fine strands and this stuff doesn t way my hair down like so many other products  olaplex is a keeper        
560,5.0,                       if you haven t tried this glaze  you must   i color my hair and expose it to high heat with the tools i use   this glaze makes my hair feel moisturized  and adds lots of shine   i use it about once every       days   it s an easy treatment to do at home and most salons charge at least     per application   the small bottle lasts me about   applications      
561,5.0,                       yes  it is worth it  this really works  and has done wonders for my hair  i went to the salon and they overprocessed my hair to the point of frying it  i have used this product twice to fix the damage  i still add my normal products after shampooing   conditioning  and find they penetrate better  my ends still look dry  albeit less so   so i still add oil to them every night  however  when i wake  i cannot help but be satisfied that my hair looks like hair and not hay    i would recommend watching a youtube video on how to use this  it is expensive and you don t want to incorrectly use it or waste the product  stephanie nicole has a good segment on how to use this properly and not waste the product  just google her name and olaplex   i have tons of product left after using this twice  much more than what even olaplex indicates and my hair looks incredible my hair type  super fine      
562,3.0,                       very small bottle     
563,5.0,                       there are so many stories of people talking about how their hair felt like silk after using this  and i can      vouch for that  my hair can get extremely dry and frizzy but after using it it s soft and manageable and doesn t puff up throughout the day  i d recommend leaving it on for as long as possible  i ve put it on right after work at    and left it in until almost midnight   because i ve noticed that the longer you leave it in the better it works  just a side note though  amazon is not an authorized seller of olaplex products and their satisfaction guarantee doesn t apply  it s a few dollars cheaper here but the only authorized sellers are sephora and the olaplex website  i believe      
564,5.0,                       my hairdresser suggested i use this to solve the problem of my hair breaking off  i followed the directions which are different from those for most conditioners and almost immediately my hair stopped breaking and became more manageable  i ve started using their regular shampoo and conditioner  which also work extremely well  they are well worth the price      
565,5.0,                       okay  like the headline says  i was sceptical asf that this would even work  i dyed a few blonde streaks in my hair and it left it really damaged  after one use  about    minutes of processing  it s already that much closer to feeling and being healthy   like a shocking amount actually  i truly wish i had bought this product when i was regularly bleaching my hair  the people that are saying this product is fake or doesn t work have no idea what they re talking about  if you re having doubts  don t  this product does work         
566,5.0,                       i recently got my hair bleached and it left my hair very brittle and dry  i came across this product by searching online for products that will help repair the damage  i have to admit i am in love with it  i can see a big difference in my hair since i started using it  it s a product i cannot live without now      
567,5.0,                       i m mad my hair loves this little bottle of greatness   my  c natural black hair felt amazing after just one use  usually my  go to   conditioners are thick heavy  this is very light  including the scent  but extremely effective    my only issue is the price point compared to the size of the bottle  i used a little more than     of the  little  bottle in one use  as my hair is thick dense  i ll probably purchase one more bottle to balance out the little bit i have left  but i can t see myself paying     for one use      
568,5.0,                       bought this product for my wife and she loves it  happy wife  what a great life   thank you again   definitely been recommending this item and i will be buying my wife more in the future without a doubt   just wish the price was lower for a great amount of it      
569,1.0,                       this product was without a dought fake     it was watered down and very thin  i ve used olaplex many times and it s always much thicker i also did not get the same result  i won t be buying olaplex from amazon again        
570,5.0,                       i am not usually write reviews   after debating if get this product or not   i decided to give it a try   i used   bottle for   month my hair is hydrated and less freeze   my ends are silky bc they used to be like a mop       so happy that i am going to buy a new bottle to used it again    i didn t have any falling hair   and i don t think the product is fake was sealed       
571,5.0,                       i didn t get this because my hair was ruined from bleaching  i m just growing it out  and get relaxers  figured this may be helpful  and i think it aids in protecting hair from further damage  i got a lot of compliments  visible different in texture      
572,5.0,                       i ve had olaplex before in my salon after a lightening treatment  so after my latest bleaching  i decided to purchase an olaplex product  my hair was finally long and healthy and i thought it could handle a lightening for summer  i was really upset to find my hair was suddenly dry and frizzy and felt like straw  i was a little hesitant buying this product from amazon as opposed to the actual website  but after reading mostly good reviews  i figured i would try it out  i was also leaning towards buying it here since  as a prime member  i got free one day shipping  my package came the next day and i was a little skeptical  my package looked as though it had been opened a bit and there was no packing slip  but the bottle looked okay and still had the tamper proof seal so i decided to try it out  i could tell it was the real deal almost instantly  my hair felt soooo much better even before i dried it  really happy i decided to ignore the few reviews on here that claimed the product was fake since it definitly isn t   will absolutely buy again when i run out       
573,5.0,                       i can definitely tell a difference in frizz and shine after using this  i actually really like that it s something i can do before washing my hair because sometimes conditioning treatments weigh down my hair      
574,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i m going to be completely honest  this stuff is no miracle worker but let me tell you  it saved my hair from looking like a solver wire sponge  you all have to be realistic  this isn t going to make your hair feel virgin  my hair was bleached twice in one sitting leaving my hair destroyed  brittle  dry  and horrible  after using this product the first time  i noticed it did something  i smell olaplex   from amazon and i have the real deal from sephora and let me tell you they smell the same and work the same it doesn t leave your hair feeling silky smooth  for that you need some other product  try olaplex   and olaplex   they work wonders  but don t expect it to return your hair to a virgin state  it just wont do that  at least not right away  it took me at least   treatments with all of the olaplex products before my hair looked less like a wire sponge and even still i need some hair oil here is my hair before dying  and then before and after olaplex treatment  not the same as my virgin hair but not a wire sponge either      
575,5.0,                       i ve been getting highlights for     years and recently the bleach had just taken an awful toll on my hair and it just was breaking and in a bad state  i had heard a lot about this so i tried it out and it just transformed my hair from brittle and broke back to healthy and thick  i leave it on overnight before i was my hair and it truly makes it so soft and healthy feeling  i think everyone needs this in their hair are lineup      
576,5.0,                       omg   i wish i would have found this product sooner i have used it  x in   week  as soon as i washed it off i could feel the difference in my hair  i detangle my hair before my shower and after applying conditioner and with this product i didnt have to after conditioning  the results are immediate hair lookspolished minimizes frizzinessends look healthierhair feels and looks healthiershinier     
577,5.0,                       let me start by saying amazing august      my stylist completely fried my hair not just one chemical damaging but   in   days  completly fried i have watched my hair break in my hands  blow dried and the bathroom floor had more broken hair than i want to admit cried my self to sleep  not knowing what to do found olaplex video from malibu on facebook  i had   choices before this video  shave my head or watch my hair break off  because no salon would touch my hair because it was so damaged  i was skeptical  but just from the first treatment of        i had very little breakage  didnt have a shower full of hair  and only   or   strands after blow drying i am very greatful i do not have to shave my head ladies do not hesitate this product saved my hair  thank you olaplex      
578,5.0,                       i am not sure if this is  real  olaplex or some knockoff as some people have posted   regardless it works  i use at night after showering and apply and let my hair dry naturally and in the morning jump in the shower again and as the directions state i wash and condition as usual   i have told everyone that i know with hair issues about this and so far everyone that has ordered it as pleased as i am   it leaves my hair shiny and manageable   initially i thought that it made my hair feel like baby hair and i would not be able to do anything with it  but it actually makes my hair more manageable  soft  silky healthy looking hair      
579,1.0,                       okay so i read the reviews and got mixed answers but ordered anyway cause well i m impatient   but i had heard not to order olaplex from amazon and to order straight from olaplex because of a diluted product being sold in its place  i decided i also wanted to get the no    oil  no    treatment and decided to order a no   just to compare to this version  so i ordered those directly from olaplex because i found out they offered free shipping  the one to the top left on my hand that looks watered down is from amazon the whiter firmer one to the bottom right is from olaplex  so from now own i will be ordering this specific product from olaplex directly  i mean they have free shipping anyways so it s a no brainer  i still love me some amazon but just won t be purchasing this product from y all       
580,3.0,                       you spend a lot of money for a product that you will get     uses out of   it seemed to my hair less tangly but i can t say that it does anything spectacular   if you ve got processed hair  try aphogee   step treatment and then follow with a deep conditioner   you ll actually see a difference for     or less of the price     
581,5.0,                       this was recommended by a friend and i highly recommend it  if you need a product that helps your hair get softer quickly use this  i left it on over night for the first use  my hair was very dry and damaged   it is softer after   use  my hair is long  thick  and old         
582,2.0,                       so disappointed in this  i followed directions exactly  and actually left it on for   hours with a shower cap to add extra absorption  then shampooed and conditioned with high quality products  my hair was worse  much more dry than before the treatment  my hair is color treated  but not severely damaged  just dry and in need of a trim  but i am done with this product  not eligible for return  unfortunately  live and learn i guess      
583,1.0,                       i buy olaplex all the time bought through amazon and it definitely was not olaplex      
584,5.0,                       amazing  only used once so far  i m hooked      
585,1.0,                       i have been using this product for months and it has made no difference in my hair yet people swear by olaplex so i assumed i may have gotten a diluted version  last week  i used my sister s olaplex bottle that came directly from the olaplex website  completely different results  worth having to wait for shipping to get it on the actual website  very disappointed      
586,5.0,                       olaplex fixes damaged hair  i ve used it on my bleached hair and my daughters blonde hair and it makes such a huge difference like no other product out there   you can have your salon person do the same treatment for about     plus tip  or you can purchase this and have at least     treatments   you only need about a quarter size      tablespoons dependent on hair length   ours is short to just past shoulders so long hair needs more    leave on for     minutes  hours is fine if you have the time and do not let it dry up  on unwashed  damp hair and then wash and condition as usual after treatment      
587,5.0,                       important to know that this is not a conditioner and it will not make your hair softer by itself  you would need to use the complete line of products that olaplex has to offer  given that they are a slight bit expensive you might want to try no    first to strengthen your hair  then move on to a softener later  which is olaplex no     thank you      
588,3.0,                       i just received this  i blame myself for not reading the details  i e  the size of the bottle  is only     ounces   i thought it was going to be the same size as the shampoo and conditioner  wrong   very expensive for what you get  i hope i get some results for the amount i paid for this  i haven t tried it yet but i will update so i cannot rate it   i love the shampoo and the conditioner  so there is hope      
589,5.0,                       the best product on the market  but was truly disappointed in the size for the money  was shocked when the bottle came  trial size  not worth what i paid      
590,5.0,                       i have bought this product   times now  i can not express enough how much i appreciate this stuff   i have dry  brittle hair when the temp changes  i need this stuff   i just went the whole summer without it and when the temp dropped my hair got so bad  i cried even messing with it  after three days of straight use  my hair is smooth  not frizzy  the bonding agent is freaking fantastic   please  never discontinue this  i wish i had pics of before and after and i know not every review is trustworthy  but what do u have to lose   i cannot express enough my love for this product        
591,4.0,                       this is a good product for dry hair  only problem is that it looks good for a day afterwards  it says to use once and if necessary twice a week but honestly that is all i can afford with the crazy expensive price  it is not an affordable option for someone who needs more for their hair unless you have a lot of disposable income and want to spend it on your hair products      
592,4.0,                       i decided to try this product because of all the good reviews  after trying this once i felt the difference in my hair   softer and its starting to look like it did before the chemicals  it is expensive  and i do hope they can make bigger bottles but i will continue using i now use in on my hair after i wash it   like a leave in  just randomly tried it like this  and it made my curls stay soflty intact  a little  backround my hair was naturally thin curly dark brown and i went blonde for about   years so it does not curl up the same  i now am back to black  hoping my hair gets its life back  the curls and length   lets see if this product helps the process          
593,5.0,                       first of all  i was nervous about possibly receiving a knock off product  i believe that what i received is genuine  based on the results i have gotten thus far i ordered this after i severely damaged my hair through bleaching  certain sections of my hair literally felt like gum  i knew if i combed through those sections  the hair would literally break right off  and some of it did   i panicked but did some research and ordered this product  i read other reviews instructions and here is how i used it    wash your hair very gently  because it is already presumably damaged  like mine was  to get rid of any product build up and oil  the olaplex needs to be able to penetrate the hair  so your hair should have no product of any kind in it when you apply the olaplex  if your hair is clean  just rinse it so that it is wet  do not use conditioner  leave in conditioner  or any oils  just wash it and rinse out the soap with water   my hair is already so damaged that i don t like the idea of washing before and after  but it is necessary with this product  so when i wash before applying the olaplex  i will wet my hair in the shower  apply a little sulfate free natural type shampoo onto the actual hair  whereas when i usually wash  i concentrate on the scalp and just let the suds fall down the length of the hair  and gentle suds the product  then rinse with water  i do this to just get the build up off because when i rinse out the olaplex  i will wash it properly and i do not apply any olaplex directly on my scalp or roots  this is just another step i take to try to preserve what hair health i have left     towel dry very gently so that it is damp  not soaking    concentrate the product where you have the most damage  once you have saturated those areas of your hair  put a little on the rest  and gently comb through    immediately put on a plastic shower cap to keep the product from drying out  also  this helps use the natural heat from your body to  presumably  assist the olaplex in penetrating your hair    sleep on it  i leave it on for    hours at a time    in the morning  rinse out the olaplex  wash your hair  and then use a good conditioner i did this twice  then did a variation where i did steps     above  but after applying the olaplex and before applying the shower cap  i also applied a hair mask over top  slept on it for about    hours  and finished up the steps as written above  this is my variation on getting the best results  so be sure to adapt this to what works best for you  the directions say to use this     times per week for severely damaged hair  i have used this three times so far and cannot believe the results  my hair is nowhere near      healthy  but the areas that felt gummy now either do not feel gummy at all  or are about     improved  i am pretty sure that if i did not purchase this  i would be sporting a pixie cut right now  i plan to continue using the olaplex     times per week and eventually drop the frequency when i feel my hair is healthy enough to do so i ve read some reviews complaining about the cost of this product  and it is no doubt pricey  for me  it has been      worth it because my hair was literally about to fall off if the wind blew too hard  i am so grateful to have saved it  after   applications  i have barely made a dent in the product  i would estimate that i ve used maybe     of the product  maybe      my hair would be categorized as long  it is past my shoulders by several inches  but not super long  like not down to my waist or anything  other reviewers have pointed out that this is not a hair mask or deep conditioner  and it is not  my hair does appear shinier after using it  and it may be softer  but it is in a way that it feels healthier  your hair will not feel like you just used a hair mask deep conditioner  it will feel stronger  less frizzy  more manageable  and i have also noticed that what breakage i do have from the bleaching is not noticeable because those hairs are more weighed down  does that make sense  overall  i am extremely happy with this purchase  i was skeptical  reading all of these reviews stating that this was the miracle product  but i am sold on it now  i will continue to use the product and update this review if needed  i would say that if your hair is severely damaged  the price is worth it  and the product does exactly what it claims to do      
594,5.0,                       everyone talks about this thing like it s a miracle so i just had to try it  and i was not disappointed  my hair is thin  slightly wavy  and very frizzy  no matter what products i use it s frizzy unless i straighten it  i followed the instructions on the bottle and let my hair air dry with nothing in it but a spritz of sea salt and wow  my hair had the least amount of frizz it has ever had and was so soft  even my husband couldn t stop touching it  my hair is down to my shoulders and i used about     of the bottle  so     for something that will last me about four months  i only plan on using it once a month   isn t too bad  it s definitely worth the try      
595,5.0,                       this product is amazing  i ve been meaning to buy it for a while but the price always threw me off  it s not a conditioner but rather a protein and hair bonding treatment  i put this stuff on when i m coloring my roots  i soak the ends and slap this stuff on generously on the ends of my hair and it instantly erased my split ends and makes the hair stronger  if used wrong it can fry the hair      
596,5.0,                       so i bought this on the recommendation of a friend   she wets her hair and applies and sleeps in it   with a cap   i just wet my hair   hair has to be wet  applied and kept on or an hour making sure my hair stayed damp   the texture was improved but not to the extent i expected   but after using several times  i can now see a noticeable improvement in my hair being softer and less straw like   will keep using    also make sure your hair stylist uses the first   steps in this lineup if you do highlights or color   i told my hair stylist about this line up and she said she had been using it on me   that is why i always say my hair feels better after i leave   there is a whole line up of products in this line   this one is step    step   and   are for your stylist to mix in your hair color   step four and five are the shampoo s and conditioners      
597,5.0,                       i live on an island and i spend every day at the beach  so my hair is of course very dry  i decided to try olaplex  even though honestly i didn t have much hope  however  it really worked  i can t say it did wonders  but it did moisturize my hair  it really does look and feel better now  much softer  whatever  product you buy  don t expect it to change your hair completely  it cannot happen  but you can improve it a bit and prevent breakage by hydrating  so olaplex is definitely good for that  i would buy it again      
598,5.0,                       amazing product  bought it   times by now and will keep on buying it  the best thing for my damaged hair  dont buy other products  the other products may be cheaper but i swear comparing to this product none of the other products work  even those products i thought they work  comparing to this one they really dont       worth it        
599,5.0,                       i believed the bad reviews  but i wanted to believe the good reviews even more  as my hair was dull and brittle after having gotten highlights  this was the first time that ever happened and i was devastated   i am so glad i tried this   i used it this morning and left it on all day  washed it off before dinner and my hair feels sooooo silky again and has some shine back   i will use it   more times this week  and   times next week   i love this product  highly recommended          
600,5.0,                       i used this once so far  my hair was dull dry and i was literally at my wits end of what i was going to do  well i can t say enough about this product  i left it it for    minutes and then rinsed it out  i don t shampoo afterwards  just something i was trying  this product saves my hair  i am going to leave it in for an hour or more today  my hairdresser said you can actually leave it in over night  this is a life saver       
601,5.0,                       used a couple times after numerous failed dye attempts  i took a shower and left it in my hair overnight and my hair feels so much better  i did it again a couple days later and loved how soft and shiny my hair was   i can t say anything about the authenticity as i don t know anything about this product other than this purchase but worked nicely for me and i ll be back for more      
602,5.0,                       yes  yes  yes  if you told your stylist  beach hair  and got goldilocks meets a cat recently electrocuted you need this stuff  leave it on forever  i put on dry and over product and it still improved the condition of my hair   unfortunately not my color      
603,5.0,                       this is no joke   i went from bleached  icy blonde to a deep chocolate cherry red   my hair did not survive   i used olaplex no     left it in for     of a football game  washed it out with olaplex   and     my hair feels so much stronger   running my hands through  i don t hear the pops of breaking strands   i don t have clumps of broken hair in my shower   i m in love   i finished with no    and styled as usual   my hair is smooth  manageable and soft   it looks as healthy as it did before i ever started coloring it     years ago       
604,1.0,                       i was expecting this product to be effective as it said on reviews online that is used at hair salons but i honestly think is nothing but some sort of conditioner diluted with water it even made my hair fell and brake a little more than usual  i also ordered another product for like    and worked better than this one  it could have been just me but i wouldn t order it or use it again      
605,5.0,                       my girlfriend ordered this because she wanted thicker hair that felt fuller after blow drying   this moisturizer is perfect for your hair  tremendous way to build up your hair   we love it     
606,5.0,                       this product works great but leaves the hair feeling dry  after you use it you have to shampoo and condition  thats when you noticed the difference  the hair is less frizzy  has more volume  and is suuuuper soft  just make sure you shampoo and conditioner aftewards cause it does dry your hair out but it repairs it      
607,5.0,                       i have naturally dark brown hair and bleached the bottom do be a cool icy white  which of course  caused a ton of damage   brittle hair that was easy to break  i have used this product only once and can already tell a noticeable difference in my hair s softness  strength  and shine  i am excited to use it more      
608,1.0,                       this product is just basic  you are better off going to a drug store or walmart and purchasing a cheap leave in conditioner  at least then your hair would be conditioned and smell better  this didn t repair anything  kenue is a better brand if you want to go the fancy salon route of products      
609,4.0,                       i was reading about the  is it the real product  or isn t it  debate  i don t know because i have never purchased it from anywhere but amazon  what i do know is that  the last time i had my hair colored at the salon a bunch of it broke off and my hair was ruined  devastating  i have used this olaplex   three times  and i can already see a difference  the broken ends are laying down  rather than sticking out and curling up  my hair feels softer and doesn t get tangled up near the nape of my neck due to the breakage  i was very skeptical because every product says it will fix your hair  i actually think this is helping my hair  i don t take writing comments lightly  and i wouldn t say these things if i didn t feel it was helping my hair  i hope this comment helps people make up their minds about olaplex  when you have fine hair to begin with  having swaths of it break off is saddening  good luck      
610,5.0,                       uh maze ing  this stuff is the real deal  i have very thick hair which became very damaged in the front from bleaching  nothing helped  used this just once for about    mins on and wow  it s     better  makes my hair shiny and soft  it s a tiny bottle which will probably only get me three or four uses with how thick my hair is but it s totally worth it      
611,3.0,                       i read a lot of reviews that said it was an amazing product and it seemed like it would be a good fit for my damaged hair  i followed the instructions and my hair felt like it had a film over it  it was very odd feeling and it took another washing to make the film go away  i thought maybe i just didn t follow the directions right and did another treatment  same thing  save your money and buy  its a          
612,5.0,                       amazing   because of the pandemic i have not been able to go and do my usual japanese straightening   my cousin recommended this to me and i thought it was worth a try   i m really surprised   i don t think this will replace straightening but it s great to have for the time being in between   i uploaded a couple of before and after pictures   i washed my hair  let it air dry over night and then used my brush straightener   a lot less poof and frizz and this is only the first time i ve tried it      
613,1.0,                       i was so excited to try this product  unfortunately this did not help with the softness or health of my hair  i have serious concerns that this is even an authentic product  it actually smelled like mildew in my hair  will not buy again      
614,5.0,                       i was so skeptical because fancy hair products are always so disappointing but i ve used this three times as directed and my hair is completely changed  i noticed a difference after one use but every time i ve used this i feel like my hair looks better and better  i started using this along with the number   leave in treatment so i don t know how this does by itself but i will continue to purchase      
615,5.0,                       i bought no    and no    and i love it  i m    and have been dying my hair every     weeks for    years  and im in menopause so my hair was thinning  it really looks fantastic and feels so healthy now  amazing product      
616,5.0,                       so i have really dark  really fragile  baby fine  curly hair  i have to bleach a minimum of   times to get the lift i want for coloring over it  but of course when you have the world s most fragile hair type  that s really just begging for punishment  for most of my life  i have been unwilling to endure the level of extreme damage that this does to my hair  there s only so much of my life i m willing to spend crying in the bathroom with a comb hanging from my head and half my hair on the floor  now  i can  carefully  indulge don t get me wrong  my hair is still damaged as hell  but this stuff really helps  in the immediate aftermath of a bleach  it can take my hair from feeling like wet hay to normal hair that just happens to be really dry  and that s a difference that has allowed me to reunite with my love of colorful unicorn hair  thanks  olaplex  next time i won t be so cheap and i ll actually spring for the olaplax   that you add to bleach  cause if this is what the low power stuff can do  i m a believer      
617,4.0,                       just received and used this product for the first time ever and i m happy with how my recently bleached and processed hair turned out  can t wait to see what my hair looks like after a month of use      
618,3.0,                       i would say the olaplex system is good but not quite the miracle worker a lot of other people have said it is  i ve heard a lot of great things about olaplex but i didn t quite have the same result  i ve definitely used other hair masks that i thought were more moisturizing   the conditioner didn t leave my hair as slick and hydrated as i would like  smells fine   has a good consistency but wouldn t call it a miracle product      
619,2.0,                       i ve used this twice  once for    minutes and once for    minutes  the first time i just left it on in the shower  the second time i put a shower cap on over it and laid on the couch  i did notice once it was touching my skin  i felt a burning sensation on my forehead  which is rare for me  i really never have skin reactions  so i put a towel in the shower cap  both times i really didn t notice anything amazing  over the other cheaper hair masks i have tried  i have pretty damaged hair  or it was prior to me taking vitamins   using masks   good product  so i do see noticeable results when a product works  my hair felt soft  but it usually does after i shower      
620,5.0,                       i ve been using this product biweekly for the better part of a year now  and i really like it  i would use it weekly  but it takes     to     a bottle to saturate my hair  and the cost of using it twice as often has so far dissuaded me i wash with a clarifying shampoo to make sure i don t have any lingering silicones or product in my hair that might interfere with absorption  then apply this throughout dampish hair  i usually put it up in a bun and cover with a processing cap to keep it from drying out  since it supposedly stops working once it dries    i get the best results if i wait at least  hrs before shampooing  preferably  hrs  i haven t gone  hrs  yet but i suspect it might work even better after a follow up shampoo and condition  my hair feels softer and looks shinier  i don t know if it s actually stronger  but it definitely feels less brittle and more hydrated  i haven t noticed an increase in shedding or breakage despite dying every couple of months  which i started only in the last year  just before i started using no   side note  i ve purchased no   from the manufacturer s website as well  the products appear identical and  on my hair at least  seem to work the same way  i don t have a lab to test the actual chemical makeup or anything  but the products i ve received appear genuine on a cosmetic level      
621,5.0,                       miraculous  this product reversed all the damage my hair had suffered over the years after only   uses  my hair was very frizzy  dull and brittle  i had it dyed three times over the past six months and it was very unhealthy and damaged  this product eliminated the frizz  made my hair so soft and shiny and i noticed much less split ends than before  i use it once a week and leave it on for about   hours and then wash my hair as usual      
622,5.0,                       wonderful product   makes mine and my daughters hair very soft  we use it once a week as we both have colored  heat treated hair  i want to make sure both our hair is healthy and strong and stays this way  we will continue to purchase this product     
623,4.0,                       this did improve the condition of my hair ever so slightly  i got   uses out of it and can tell a small difference in my hair condition  for the price i expected more     
624,3.0,                       i get my hair colored and felt i needed a better conditioner   this works really well  but it s way overpriced in my opinion   that is why i gave it   stars   i know salon products are pricey  but i have used salon products that worked the same way for much less      
625,5.0,                       i love this product  it makes my hair feel sooooo smooth  it s defi worth the price for the     oz  i get about   uses out of it unless i use a little extra then maybe    hair feels so smooth and nothing compared to what a regular conditioner makes your hair like  if you have damaged and bleached hair this is the product to use      
626,5.0,                       i didn t even believe this would work  but it does  if you have bleached your hair  or you use heat every day  color it constantly or perm or chemically straighten your hair  this stuff really does work  i m shocked   and almost speechless right now  oh  and  yes it s a small bottle  but i used it for the third time last night and there is still another application worth left  in fact  i m ordering another bottle right now      
627,5.0,                       this stuff is the best i have had quite the journey this year trying to get rid of the balayage that was left in my hair   i wanted my hair back to it s original ash blonde and trying to do that by myself was highly damaging  i got olaplex to help repair my hair and omg it worked magic  i judt had a consultation with a hair stylist to get my hair back to ash blonde by a professional  during the consultation she kept telling me my hair was beautiful for what it had gone through  she couldnt stop runningher hands through my hair  definitely would purchase this again      
628,5.0,                       just to clarify this product is meant as a weekly maintenance treatment to prolong the benefits of a full olaplex application  olaplex is a   step treatment  hence this product is named no     many reviewers seem disenchanted because they expect amazing results using no   only  this is not a moisturizing or conditioning treatment either  another misconception amongst reviewers   when used as a full line olaplex is a lifesaver for those who chemically treat their hair  ideally use it before damage is caused  adding it into bleach or color prevents breakage  if you re already have existing breakage this will help dramatically  very brittle hair may take a few full applications   but worth the investment as this stuff does what no other hair treatment can do      
629,5.0,                       i can t believe i hadn t heard of this before  a friend recommended it and i ordered immediately   my hair got really dry and freezie after bleach to get rid of black hair color and despite conditioners  coconut oil and anything i could think of  it would continue to not be right   this stuff is extremely effective and has restored the shine and bounce to my hair   i will continue to use it and i expect it will continue to fully handle my hair      
630,5.0,                       after i went blonder my hair has been breaking a lot and i thought about dying it darker but i wanted to see if this would help me  i know my stylist used it on me when i get my hair done but i needed some hair mask i can do once a week  i tried it today and it made my blonde frizzy hair so soft and manageable  i was able to let it air dry and not have to style it  i plan on using it once a week until my hie gets healthier      
631,5.0,                       i bought the hairgenics pronexa previous to the oplex   and    pronexa is     the costs and worked way better to repair my hair  use a heat cap for any of them and results are a heck of a lot better      
632,3.0,                       super small product  less than size of your hand  if you have long hair then you get only   uses out of it maybe  definitely not worth it for this price  noticed a great change in hair feel and texture the first time used  by third or fourth time though not much change than using my regular shampoo and conditioner      
633,5.0,                       if i goto the olaplex site  the bottle says  take home  just like the one here   i have used it twice and in both times  i left it on for over an hour  then washed my hair and conditioned it  once with a hair mask and once with just a daily conditioner and both times  my dyed hair came out exteremely soft   i swim as well so my hair is always severely damaged   i will buy this again     
634,3.0,                       i am not sure exactly how to rate this  i have a natural grey   actually white  streak in my hair  the steak is a different texture than the rest of my hair  it is much dryer and tends to have more split ends  i thought i would try this and see if it could help that  while it did help on the streak  the rest of my hair didn t seem to benefit at all  in fact it was less manageable than before  that might have been due to the olaplex conditioner i used after the treatment and shampooing  i will continue to try the perfector with my usual shampoo and conditioner and update as i observe the results      
635,1.0,                       it was a sad day after using this  olaplex   this product did not work  but further damaged my hair    i actually slept in this product  which could have just dried out my hair  i m not sure    but it made by hair more tangled and brittle  how   i don t know  i have naturally dark brown hair and lightened it with manic panic about   months prior to using this product and had routinely used deep conditioners and coconut oil  but decided to try olaplex before going another shade lighter and that was a sad mistake  literally had to cut off my ends as there were straw like  i ve postponed re bleaching my hair and i ve been using coconut oil treatments once a week to recover from this product  good luck      
636,3.0,                       i do not think this is real olaplex  i ve had olaplex used on my hair in a salon a few times and as a blonde i could tell the difference  using this on my hair and left it in for the amount of time it said to and it did not make my hair soft  conditioned  or add any more moisture than it already had  really disappointed i spent     on this  will not buy again      
637,5.0,                       i love this product it is very moisturizing  restores my hair and makes it feel soft   i use this after i bleach my hair and it brings it back to life  i also use it once a week when i feel my hair texture changing  but i will say this product change my life and my hair forever  yes it s pricey but worth it  granted i have short hair      
638,5.0,                       too bad i can t get it in a bigger bottle  i ve got   applications out of it so far  a little bit goes a long way for me because my hair isn t that long  it s worth the investment for sure      
639,5.0,                       after a botched bleach job  and subsequent color correction  my long formally healthy hair was in bad shape  i could barely run my fingers through my hair  it was so dry  weak and damaged   i was distraught at the thought of cutting inches off my hair that took forever to grow long   olaplex   to the rescue  it really does repair the damage  and leaves my hair soft and manageable   i use it every   to   days to keep my hair feeling good and soft to the touch   i definitely recommend this      
640,5.0,                       heard about this through a friend who s in the industry so i gave it a shot albeit the price tag    after one use i immediately saw and felt the results  after bleaching my hair way too many times i m surprised it hasn t all burned off  but a good couple inches chopped and one hour of this in my hair later   it s achieved a miracle      
641,5.0,                       omg my hair is so shiny and soft after just  two uses i have naturally wavy curly straight wild hair that doesn t know what it wants to do and it s also frizzy now i can wear my hair down without heat products and it s so silky and shiny  game changer and obsessed already  my hair has literally transformed      
642,5.0,                       i have  a   c   a   b curls  i don t have color treaded hair nor do i have heat damage  but i m always trying to get my looser curls to match the  b curls  after   use all my curls are more defined  i left it on for a little over    min  i m excited for my  nd treatment      
643,1.0,                       horrible product  every time someone complains about olaplex not working for them and causing hair loss  there will be a     people saying  it is impossible  as it worked for them  well  it didn t work for me at all  caused insane shedding  i got blood work done to rule out thyroid or iron deficiency  i have no medical conditions that have caused this insane hair loss  i had thick luscious hair and now i have lost half of it  i am scared to run my fingers through my hair as it comes out easily and washing my hair is a nightmare  i stopped using it and now after   months  my hair is still shedding  though not as much as it did while i was using it  i read in other forums that it takes about      months for your hair to stop shedding after stopping usage  i couldn t return the product as i started using it only after the return window at amazon closed  i do not recommend this product      
644,4.0,                       i m a regular user of olaplex that my sister  who is a stylist  purchases for me with her professional license  she was out of town for awhile and i was out  so i ordered from here  first of all  it s a very small bottle  and doesn t last long with long hair  secondly  it s way more watered down than the product she gets me at her professional store  which means i have to use twice as much  it moisturizes well enough  but it s honestly like half water  half product  i won t be ordering this again from amazon      
645,3.0,                       this is an update review  i bought this stuff back in march and it absolutely made my hair soft  but the breakage was still really bad  so i gave it another shot and bought it directly from the oplex website  the stuff i got from the website seems to be working much better and lasts longer before i have to redo it  the product itself is great but i m not convinced that the stuff i got here on amazon was the real product      
646,5.0,                       i m not sure why there are so many bad reviews foe this product  it is a miracle worker  my hair has never been softer and it was extremely damaged from bleaching  you need to follow the instructions very carefully and you ll get the results you want  trust me  this stuff was so worth it      
647,5.0,                       i don t normally do reviews but i felt i needed to on this  this stuff is a miracle  i had accidentally fried my hair to the point that i had huge clumps falling out  it was bad  i needed a way to fix my hair as best as possible so i can put color in it without losing all my hair  i have used this product twice in tandem with the olaplex bonding hair oil  my hair went from completely fried and unable to be brushed to almost completely normal  i m so impressed by this product  it was absolutely worth the money      
648,5.0,                       this stuff is amazing  i purchased this because i burnt my hair with bleach and toner recently  my hair just started falling out and became elastic stretchy  i was hesitant to purchase this because of the size for the cost and i ve never used it before but it s worth every penny  this has truly saved my hair  i noticed a difference after one treatment  i leave this on for about an hour though  one bottle i would say should last me a month using it    x a week  and my hair is past my shoulders  my fine  blonde hair feels stronger  softer  less snarly  shiny  and not greasy  i also follow up with redken anti snap leave in conditioner for extra measure  both smell amazing      
649,5.0,                       my stylist turned me on to theses products at my last visit  i am    and have thinning  menopausal hair   it is a little past my shoulders  whatever this stuff does  it has made my husband actually stop and tell me how gorgeous my hair looks  i have less breakage  more shine  it is fuller and thicker appearing  holds my style which is just loose finger waves to reduce heat damage   i am now using this product     x weekly and i have the shampoo  conditioner  and styling creme  you literally only use a pea size amount of all of them  so the bottle lasts a while  i have not tried the oil as my roots get greasy looking anyway  i am far less self conscious of my thinning hair now  this is a game changer for me      
650,5.0,                       this bottle last me   treatment because i have long thick hair  i recently got my hair retouched and my hair was so fried  it was breaking off so this was the best option for me  i see little difference but its results  didn t stop my hair from breaking but made my hair more tangible  just bought a second bottle  hoping to continue using this       
651,5.0,                       olaplex is a lifesaver for my hair  in the last   months i ve had my hair bleached from almost black boxed hair dye to a blonde bayalage  needless to say that caused a pretty decent amount of damage in my hair  i have used the olaplex system twice and it has done wonders for my hair  it looks so much more healthy and shiny now   it feels stronger  the number   is perfect for upkeep  highly recommend for fellow bleach blondes      
652,3.0,                       not sure if this is real or not   regardless  i would not recommend doing this without a salon stylist   used it once as directed   it did close the cuticle as it stated  hair shafts felt a bit thicker   however  my hair had no where for the oil to go that normally accumulates   so the end result was not thick lush hair as much as greasy hair   natural ability for hair to absorb and utilize your natural hair oil is essentially removed   will not use again      
653,5.0,                       this product is absolutely amazing  after getting my hair dyed blonde and having it toned several times my hair was very dry and weak  i would brush my hair when wet and see tons of breakage to the point that i was almost in tears  i read the reviews on this product and figured it was worth  a shot and i am soooo glad i tried this  it is a life changer for blondes  i leave the product in for about       minutes  x  everytime i was my hair  and the texture has changed  my hair feels softer and i can comb my wet hair out with much less breakage and damage  it really has helped salvage my blonde hair and i will definitely continue using this product religiously if you have blonde or damaged hair order this now        
654,5.0,                       this is a high quality product  but you must use it consistently to see results from it  i used it for   weeks with this exact size bottle  i have very thin medium length hair   i didn t buy another bottle after this one ran out and saw that my hair was suffering a little from it  i have since restarted using it and it has made a world of difference in my hair       would recommend      
655,3.0,                       i m mixed race  half black and half white   and this conditioner was just okay for my hair  my hair is very thick and i needed to use a lot of the conditioner in order to get a level of conditioning that felt decent  i kept having to add my cheaper whole foods store brand conditioner to get enough  slip  to start combing  won t purchase again      
656,1.0,                       it s fake      no way is this authentic do not buy this     
657,5.0,                       i watched too many youtube videos about how to bleach your hair at home and absolutely wrecked my hair   the highlights look good but my hair was brittle  crispy  and tangly after two bleaches   i ve used this product twice now  soaking it on towel dried hair for    minutes before rinsing and then shampoo conditioner as normal  and holy jesus i can t believe my hair is actually better than it was before i bleached   get it gurl  you deserve it   treat yo self      
658,5.0,                       i accidentally over processed my hair a little bit bleaching and my usual products  keratin  amino acids  and hydration masks  were barely touching the incredible frizz and limpness that was my beautiful  long hair  amazon prime had one day delivery on this item so it was a no brainer  i bought it  i lightly shampooed my hair  towel dried my hair  slathered this crap on  and slept in it overnight  next morning lightly shampooed and did a repair conditioning mask for    minutes  joico k pak color therapy luster lock  my holy grail of conditioning if you re interested  my hair type is thick and straight   huge difference between how it looks post olaplex and my frizzy puffball from yesterday pre olaplex  my hair is    inches long and i will get about   applications from one bottle  i should note about   weeks prior i had an olaplex treatment done in a salon with         so maybe that has enhanced my results  although olaplex says you can use    as a stand alone and still get results  my hair still needs time to heal completely but this has helped speed up the process by probably one week      
659,5.0,                       nothing short of a miracle product  i went to a stylist to dye and color my hair  no  not box dye     something i usually do myself but thought i deserved a treat  anyway  many friends go to her  i ve seen her work so trusted her  she knew most of my hair was already bleached under the fading pink  turns out she used a   vol bleach  leaving it on too long as well  i never use anything over     my virgin roots went from near black to a light blonde so quickly   i said  woah  how d that happen so quick   and asked her about the volume she used anyway  now i know what that  straw like hair is i ve heard people refer to  now i know extreme brittle and extreme breakage it s never been so damaged in my life     started treating it with various products that helped some but not much  a friend recommended this  i trusted her and   omg  i ve only used it once  leaving it on for about     hours   and my hair already feels like hair again  still damaged of course  but hair  not straw   can t wait to use it again  my hair is saved     it s legit  a stylist friend of a friend told methat i could buy the real thing  as offered on their website   off amazon   but to be sure amazon was the distributor   worth every penny  is the best product for damaged hair i ve ever used  and i ve used almost all of them  all salon grade  expensive  well known quality brands   i seriously want to write them a thank you letter      
660,5.0,                       i always appreciate getting a product that s actually sealed    i am on my second one now and so far i think it s been a good product but my over all rating goes to the seller because for me it all starts with trusting the product is safe to use        
661,1.0,                       i am experienccing hair loss from this product  i have read some reviews of this product  too late  on the sephora com site and many women have experienced brittle and dry hair  clumps of hair in the sink  unusual shedding and breakage   my hair was in great shape until i tried olaplex     i found out about this product on youtube and it seemed to work on chemically relaxed hair   however  when i used it twice  the second time i used it  my hair snapped off near the front on both sides of my head   i couldn t believe it   there are so many complaints on the sephora com site regarding hair loss   i am trying to restore my hair with a lot of conditioning and oils   i think i will not be relaxing my hair again until        don t use this product without talking to your stylist face to face and not only get recommendations from youtube      
662,1.0,                       this product did absolutely nothing  it actually made my hair dry and flyaways actually were worse after using this  this will be added to my ever growing haircare graveyard  complete waste of money      
663,1.0,                       i invested more money than usual in this conditioner  and my hair ended up knottier and tanglier  very frustrating  had to follow up with other conditioner brands  i did buy their mask  step    and loved that  but will not buy their shampoo or conditioner again      
664,5.0,                       definitely a legit product  i mixed it with some wella t   toner and    vol developer to tone out the brass on my roots  i have asian black hair and i bleach and tone to get to a platinum ice white hair color  so i m no stranger to crazy amounts of damage to my hair  olaplex is a miracle and you need it  even if you don t try to kill your hair like i do      
665,5.0,                       this stuff works  i have dry  coarse  wavy hair and unfortunate breakage throughout from keeping my hair up   work  i was recommended this by a girlfriend and it s increased my hair s manageability  softness  and overall enjoyment of not wanting to shave my head bald lol  my breakage is still present but with the bonding technology of this product  they re much less noticeable        recommend     
666,5.0,                       love olaplex  it helps moisturize my hair that has been damaged from bleach and heat  i highly recommend using this product a couple times a week to see real results     
667,5.0,                       for my friends with long hair who dive    i ve found something new   remember the last big breakthrough was the crave gentle detangling brush  i assume its targeted at parents with little kids who have tough to brush hair now its olaplex no   yeah  i thought this was a joke   two separate  completely unrelated  stylists were like  use this stuff    i was super skeptical because i ve always been told that hair can t be repaired and you are kinda stuck with what you ve done to it  at home i mean  cause i hear there are some crazy amazing salon treatments out there that i can t possibly afford    i didn t buy at salon prices  luckily found it online for less  so currently my hair is x number of years long  mid back  stupidly baby fine  moderately over processed  dyed  bleached  sun drenched  and salt water destroyed   i m using the olaplex   day a week  mostly because i only wash once or twice a week unless i m diving a lot and of course have to remove the salt  but then its just with a conditioner results are kinda nutters   hair in the drain has diminished after week    less breakage for sure  and my hair feels ridiculously silky slippery when dry   you know that feeling that little kids hair sometimes has   the kind of hair that the cuticle isn t rough  at all   so smooth that hair bands just slip out of it   yeah  that   for reals   so yeah  week three  the jar of product is small but i expect it to last for at least another       applications   the reviews say that hair keeps improving with each use historically by the time my hair gets this long its epically trashed and my hairdresser starts mentioning  maybe taking a bit more off the ends so it looks thicker    but this time around its going differently   this time the stylist actually said  wow  you hair is better than it was last time    big change       
668,5.0,                       olaplex no    is one of my hair care staples and i use it before every salon color session  it has absolutely saved  restructured and strengthened my hair  i swear by olaplex  i used to get no s        done in salon but my stylist says i don t need them anymore      
669,5.0,                       i guess it s ok  i m positive it s not fake  and i think overall it s helping some  my hair must ve not been in as bad a shape as i thought it was  i also got the number one and two  and use that once a month and the number three once a month  i could grow out my hair if i wanted to and it would be in good condition  but i decided not to grow it out      
670,5.0,                       for anyone looking to keep their bleached blonde hair looking decent while extending time between hair trims during the stay at home orders i would highly recommend this product  totally corrects split ends and generally bad looking ends that i usually get trimmed off    months now with no trim  was about to get a trim and highlights before covid     and my hair s looking better than ever  i have been using it once every   weeks      
671,5.0,                       i live in florida and i have unusual hair  the strands are normal to fine  but i have a lot of hair   i feel like mine is particularly frizzy   as an aside  i have found that the living proof brand of shampoo conditioner helps me significantly   my hair salon uses olaplex and i always love how great my hair looks after i go there   shiny  silky  smooth  soft   i bought this product to see if i could get similar results at home and it worked wonderfully   i really felt like my hair looks like it just got professionally blown out      
672,5.0,                       i was hesitant to order this product on amazon  but decided to give it a shot  it came packaged with a foil seal  used it twice now and so far so good  i had very dry damaged hair from bleaching  i used this twice a week for an hour and it works  keeps my ends moisturized even after the wash      
673,1.0,                       i m one of the unlucky ones    this damaged my hair  literally did the opposite of what it was supposed to do  so bummed         
674,5.0,                       this product is great for your hair  especially if you color it  my hair stylist even noticed the change      
675,5.0,                    compre este producto como soluci n antes de ir a cortarme el cabello da ado por la decoloraci n  esta es mi primera experiencia y me siento muy contenta de que no tendr  que cortar tanto mi cabello como pens   debe aplicarse con el cabello humedecido y luego enjuagar  lavar y acondicionar  yo me dej  el producto por   hora m s o menos  y si siento el cambio positivo en la primera puesta  espero mejores resultados semana a semana         
676,1.0,                       i have used this product for years with excellent resultsthis bottle did not work as expected  my hair was extremely tangled and brittle   i could not get comb thru hair  i don t think this is the real product      
677,5.0,                       my hair stylist uses olaplex when highlighting my hair and before brazilian blowout and it has made a major difference  after each treatment  my hair stays silkier and appears healthier for longer  i bought this to do at home to help stretch the time between visits and like the results  nothing is a miracle  but it is the best i ve found    especially if you have fine and porous hair because it bonds instead of loading up your hair with residue      
678,3.0,                       not really sure what it is doing to my hair  have been using it regularly for months  my hair still is very dry and damaged at the ends whee it has been colored the most  i hoped this would fix it but it didn t  i use it at home  and i use no   at the salon when i do my highlights      
679,1.0,                       i read all the raves and thought  why not  left it on my towel dried hair for    minutes this morning  washed and conditioned and air dried and my hair has more static  frizz and fly always than it did before  wth  how is it possible that everyone is raving how wonderful this is and my hair feels awful  my hair is dyed  not bleached and hasn t been heat treated in over   months  until i used this olaplex    air drying left it wavy and shiny  what a waste of money      
680,5.0,                       get this immediately if your hair is damaged to the point where you re looking into this product  i wish i would have taken a photo of my very damaged   dry hair   it was rough  dry  brittle   embarrassing  i opted to get this instead of the shampoo   conditioner  very glad  each small bottle is      the repairing treatment lasted about a month  washing my hair once a week for that month  i usually wash my hair only once a week anyway  the directions says to leave it in for    minutes   after i applied a good amount around  pm  i covered my hair with plastic wrap  secured with a head band and washed it out the next morning  around  am  my hair felt amazing  like silk   however     days after the red ring around my head disappeared  i visited the drug store   bought some cheap  disposable  plastic hair covers that i used next time  they did not leave that red ring   i didn t have to hide for   days olaplex is awesome  i wish it was less expensive   but it most definitely delivers  order this asap       
681,5.0,                       i have been bleaching my hair blonde for    years  my hair hasn t felt like hair in    years  it felt like crispy straw  i had so much damage that i would brush it  and ends would break off  it was bad  i mean bad  i knew going into this that this was not a conditioning mask or anything like that  so i knew that my hair wasn t going to feel newly replenished after one use first use  i followed the directions exactly as directed on the bottle  i left this stuff in my hair for several hours  shampooed and conditioned as normal  i noticed that i had less breakage than i usually do  i also noticed that my conditioner did its job better  my hair after one use definitely felt stronger and softer  yet it wasn t fully repaired yet  the bottle does say to use   to   times a week  this is necessary if you have severely overprocessed hair i have used this   times already and i am almost done with the bottle and my hair feels like hair now  it is so much stronger and healthier  and i am not experiencing any breakage  my hair hasn t felt this good in    years  it looks so much better too  i will continue to use this every time i get my hair done to undo the damage  whatever they put in this works      
682,1.0,                       this did norhing to my hair when i got it directly from the mfg years ago it worked perfectly   wondering if they changed the formula or if this seller swapped product      
683,5.0,                       like the product says  it s not a deep conditioner  it s not going to leave your hair silky smooth and soft  it s meant to reform the shattered and broken protein bonds in your hair  i bleached my dark  asian hair twice into a platinum blonde  understandably so my hair was severely damaged and breaking off my head if i even brushed it too hard  so i bought olaplex and i ve only used it for a one hour long session so far  i m not kidding when i say after i finished washing my hair  my hair felt stronger than before  maybe not to its original state but at least my hair wasn t falling out  it did make my hair feel a lot less crunchy but i can t tell if it s the olaplex or the conditioner i love to use  im hopeful that with another or two sessions of olaplex  my hair would be close to its original strength  for now im very happy with the results  my hair isnt falling off my head even when im a little more rough when combing  i dont see a lot of split ends  and im hopeful of how my hair will turn out with more sessions      
684,3.0,                       ok product  good customer service  however  shipping control leaves a lot to be desired  i receive a bottle that was barely     full  the company immediately sent a replacement that i received the very next day  thankfully  this time the bottle was full with a seal  i was disappointed and quite frankly surprised that an obviously used bottle would be shipped to a customer   i ve bought this product a few times trying to give it a chance to convince me it was a great product   while it was ok  i haven t been that impressed      
685,5.0,                       anything from this company has changed the hair industry  i have been licensed for    years   this is the first product that has been developed that actually heals the hair shaft from root to tip no matter how much you change the color of your hair or bleach it repeatedly like my daughter   you should use the entire lineup in order to receive the best results  you won t be sorry  this is an honest review  i don t normally write them  i realize it s expensive but it s worth every dime  for long hair you should purchase   of everything   now also if you have split ends i would suggest that you trim just the ends off  it is difficult to repair split ends without trimming  otherwise the hair shaft splits all the way to the scalp  also if it s been longer than   months without trimming your ends because the product is so expensive you want to ensure you start out with a fresh cut on your ends
