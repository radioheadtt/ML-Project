2,5.0,                       these batteries were such a great deal and work so well  that i have bought them a few times since      
3,5.0,                       batteries are equal to the name brands and for less money      
4,1.0,                       i honestly bought these  x because i thought one batch of batteries were defective but now i know that they re very bad quality  please dont waste your money on these  after  weeks they re dead and its frustrating to constantly replace them  the other amazon white batteries were the best but thsese are garbage      
5,5.0,                       great value for the money     
6,5.0,                       not duracel quality  but good value     
7,5.0,                       accidentally clicked on these because they came up in the c batteries section  but i guess they work  i don t have anything that needs d batteries but maybe one day i will      
8,5.0,                       awesome batteries   i use them for my outside  motion lights       
9,5.0,                       these things last forever    i have luminara candles in my salon that take   d batteries each  it can get expensive   i tried amazon basics and those candles are on about      hours a day  at least   days a week  i change the batteries about every other month or so   don t waste your money on  name brand    save it and get the same  if not better  quality of product      
10,1.0,                       i used these as a replacement for duracell batteries in my newborn s swing   the duracells lasted   months and these batteries barely lasted a week   we did not use the swing anymore than usual and the only thing that changed was the batteries   pay a little extra and get better batteries      
11,5.0,                       great batteries especially for the price   we use these and buy in batches for our toddler swing   that swing is what keeps our house in tact and sane   these batteries are as good as or better than the other brands and for a better price  i use these and rechargeable eneloops      
12,5.0,                    saludos con la experiencia del pasado hurac n maria se escasearon las bater as  es mejor tener y no necesitarlas que necesitarlas  y no tenerlas

15,5.0,                       i recently purchased   sets of the    d cell battery packs for my outdoor motion detector lights   upon receiving the batteries  which were packaged very well  i tested each battery with a volt meter before installing them in the lights   all batteries had a charge of between      and      volts   these batteries are rated at     volts  so all were above the listed voltage   how they hold up is another question that i will answer after some time has passed      
16,5.0,                       i was telling my hubby how my son uses his alexa to order things  like batteries  the next think i knew    doz  d  batteries arrived   be careful what you say around her  lol

22,5.0,                       these batteries last just as long as the name brand batteries and seemingly without suffering any leaks   which i seemed to get quite often with the name brands   some much cheaper  in cost   but seem to be better made

28,3.0,                       i love amazonbasics products but looks like i should step back a little especially for these batteries  last time i ordered and was having same problem when i opened this box  every piece of these batteries were having battery level     or less      
29,5.0,                       great price     
30,3.0,                       dont have anything in the house that uses them

33,5.0,                       convenient     
34,4.0,                       excellent quality batteries  you don t need to purchase the name brands when you have these long use batteries  i have ordered three times and have always been satisfied with these batteries      
35,5.0,                       why would you buy batteries anywhere else   the value is insane and they re great long lasting batteries      
36,4.0,                       seem to work well  just as good as name brands  hasn t leaked  i ve had energizers leak all over the inside of equipment  d size

39,4.0,                       what can you say about a battery  i use them for my lantern when the lights go out and they last long     
40,4.0,                       seems to be good quality  probably made by a major name brand with amazon logos      
41,1.0,                       i tried these on electronic mouse traps  each set of four batteries per trap was dead after three kills  name brand batteries give me anywhere from at least    to as many as    kills per set  these amazon d cells are not good value      
42,5.0,                       good     
43,5.0,                       these batteries have been going for almost   months now after using them every night since i bought them      
44,1.0,                       these batteries seemed like a great buy until i needed them during hurricane irma and they couldn t power the battery operated fan i wanted to lend to my neighbor whose power was out i bought these batteries in may       and while they worked in a flashlight they did not work in the battery operated fan  at first i assumed that the problem was with the fan  then this week i bought other batteries and tried the fan and it worked  i double checked and the amazon batteries still did not work in the fan so  if i could return these i would  don t count on them powering much other than a basic flashlight      
45,5.0,                       just like the headline says     
46,5.0,                       perfect price  exceeded expectations vs name brand batteries

50,1.0,                       i bought these for a vibrating chair for my baby  i thought it was a sweet deal but literally die within a few hours  which is crazy  i d say it s worth spending the extra money on normal brand name batteries      
51,5.0,                       good amount for price     
52,3.0,                       used in a device requiring   batteries  device stopped working shortly after  tested all   batteries    were dead   were fine  i suspect these batteries are garbage  should have paid a little more and gotten the energizer batteries      
53,5.0,                       bought this and did a side by side comparison for named brand batteries  performed the exactly the same as the name brand batteries  i like to have battery operated candles in my house with timers  placed the batteries in the candles and the amazon brand lasted the same   months the higher priced batteries lasted  buying again now      
54,5.0,                       one of the best long lasting batteries  i m  using it  for     month for my daughters bouncer  rocking chair  working great and great price  before amazon barand  batteries i used duracell batteries they finished in   weeks and they are expensive also  highly recommend amazon brand batteries don t buy duracell       
55,5.0,                       i purchased these to use in an automatic pet food dispenser   i m doing a bit of an informal test as one dispenser has these batteries and another has name brand batteries   i will update my review in a few months with the results       
56,5.0,                       great item for hurricane prepping   i was prepared for hurricane florence      
57,5.0,                       great value and quality   no reason ti pay more for other brands

64,5.0,                       fantastic alternative if you don t want to go the electrical route   light up area very well  stay on maybe    seconds or so   i love the three pack  allowed me to illuminate a path down the driveway   very bright  did a lot of research prior      
65,1.0,                       these are low capacity batteries  because they are d cell size  they take up a lot of storage space  best to use the space for a better capacity battery  even at twice the price of these  you get reliable larger capacity      
66,5.0,                       very pleased with these batteries  seem to last just as long  if not longer  as some of the pricier batteries i ve purchased in the past  will definitely continue to purchase

74,5.0,                       these batteries and this brand from amazon have won my trust i have purchased these more than a few times for all of the battery operated candles in other small items that run off d batteries     
75,5.0,                       why buy them anywhere else       
76,5.0,                         amazon basic product always good for money     
77,5.0,                       well worth the money which is cheaper than name brands

79,3.0,                       i m not sure how long batteries are supposed to last in my hlway closet  but i expected to last longer than this  it corroded in the packaging  none of my other batteries in the same area did the same thing      
80,5.0,                       batteries are batteries   but great to have them delivered right to the door

99,5.0,                       love these batteries  and a great price   they are long lasting     
100,5.0,                       these batteries are great to have on hand  i haven t used them enough to test the longevity      
101,1.0,                       i left them in my trailer over the winter and they were all dead  other batteries  including some well known chinese units were still fine  disappointed in these      
102,5.0,                       they seem to hold their own   haven t had an issues   using them automatic cat feeders  no issues     
103,5.0,                       i use flameless candles on a timer so occassionally i need to change the batteries  i like to have them ahead so that when i need them i have them available  i have bought several types of batteries from amazon and have never been disappointed      
104,5.0,                       we bought these for a planned power outage to use in our battery operated fans  the battery lasted on full speed for a good    hours of non stop use  the power came back on before the batteries died      
105,5.0,                       the product was used for my satellite radio for when we are outdoors or camping they last a very long time  very pleased     
106,1.0,                       these batteries leak acid and destroyed our hardwood floors   these batteries were placed in a keyboard   even though the keyboard was still working i noticed large dark brown splatters all over our hardwood floors and acid leaking out of the battery compartment   we have never had this problem in the keyboard with any other batteries   the cost of refinishing the floors make these cheap batteries incredibly expensive   remove these batteries from anything you ve put them in immediately      
107,5.0,                       great packaging  great value     
108,5.0,                       great     
109,5.0,                       as the name implies   it s a basic d cell battery   every one i ve used has worked without an issue   great price and i d buy them again      
110,5.0,                       the amazon basics batteries work just as good as any other brand and they last just as long  you can t beat the price for how many you get in a pack      
111,5.0,                       work great and the price can t be beaten     
112,2.0,                       i put the batteries into the device i was using and it stopped working within less than   weeks      
113,1.0,                       batteries seemed fine when new  but i put   of them in small closet lite fixtures  and   of the fixtures have lost charge   the  rd one still works   could there be something about my lites that is causing this   the return rules say that i can no longer return but replacement is possible through        but i don t see any way to request this replacement      
114,4.0,                       good price good batteries     
115,5.0,                       i never thought to order batteries online  this price is fabulous since i go through d cells quickly  using several battery op fans at work down here in florida      
116,5.0,                       these batteries work just as good and just as long as the more expensive brand      
117,5.0,                         years isn t necessarily a lot in terms of battery shelf life  but i bought these over   years ago now  and they are still coming out of the box fresh and full powered  no need to waste you money on name brands  if you are buying some regular alkaline batteries  these perform just as well for less      
118,1.0,                       batteries were used for christmas small strand lights and different candles   never lasted more than a week and were only turned on at night for maybe   hours   just not worth the aggravation to replace   or   times during christmasseason   will not purchase again      
119,5.0,                       i really think the price is very reasonable for how many you get  i have a lantern i use these for i have a radio i use them for  they are very good compared to others i have used      
120,5.0,                       great value     
121,1.0,                       had to be returned  completely dead        
122,5.0,                       these batteries work great a a fraction of the price of the name brands      
123,3.0,                       cheap but dont last very long     
124,5.0,                       i bought these batteries for my smokeless ashtray and play compared to the more expensive brands     
125,2.0,                       these batteries do not last any longer than dollar store batteries  i have purchased several packages of different sizes because the quality is so great however i will not be purchasing any more of the amazon batteries they just do not last nearly as long     
126,5.0,                       ok     
127,5.0,                       battery     
128,1.0,                       i happened to check the batteries  and found  they burst open under normal temperatures and would have ruined the device  had i not found  it  will go back to battery brand batteries     
129,5.0,                       best way to buy     
130,2.0,                       product is fine  they re batteries  not much else to say  the packaging  however    is so incredibly wasteful  the box comes with   packs of   batteries that have been shrink wrapped together  why  so unnecessary  not only is it wasteful  it can also be hard for the elderly or disabled to open  amazon  please consider changing the packaging of this        
131,5.0,                       these are a great deal  i buy all my batteries in this amazon brand  i like buying in bulk and know i wont run out of batteries for a long time  they last a very long time too      
132,5.0,                       great price and so far  last just as long as name brand batteries  used them in a baby swing and have gotten quite a bit of time out of the first set  very pleased      
133,5.0,                       got this to work with portable motion lights in the backyard  i am pretty impressed on how long they last  also in the harsh cold winters the batteries worked great with not loss of power     
134,5.0,                       love amazons batteries and auto delivery  hate to need a battery and none can be found  this work great and great prices      
135,1.0,                       we replace batteries in a device once a year at most  these did not last a month  when they were removed i noticed they fell over on counter  they are deformed and egg shaped on both the top and bottom  upon further inspection  all the batteries were deformed  terrible quality  not worth the savings      
136,4.0,                       i purchased these batteries to power my baby s toy  these batteries seem to work great  based on the reviews  i was a bit worried about purchasing a bunch of batteries that could be duds  then i looked at the reviews more in detail and realized that most of the bad reviews were from a few years ago  amazon must have fixed their issues since then some things i noted are that    these are not rechargeable  if you want rechargeable batteries  you should purchase the amazon basics rechargeable batteries    there s not much of a price difference between these amazon basics batteries     pack  and the energizer max d     pack   at the time of this writing  there s only a    cent difference  amazon basics           energizer max        if you want a brand name  you may as well go for energizer max    a duracell   pack          is only approximately    cents less than the amazon basics    pack          overall  these batteries work fine  if you don t need a brand name batteries  you should just purchase these      
137,4.0,                       i put these on the voltmeter and got      v reading on each of   i tested   i compared them to two other new unused d cells  the duracell coppertop  assembled in us  and the rayovac fusion  both of which tested at     v   the amazon cell and the other two were all nearly exactly  within      of a mm  the same length and diameter   the expiration dates on the amazon cells were oct       the expiration dates on the duracell and rayovac cells were mar      and nov       respectively  and i ve had those cells for about a year   maybe amazon puts more realistic expiration dates on their cells  or maybe they ship older stock  who knows   the packaging of the amazon cells was very solid   two rows of   cells  each row shrink wrapped  and a cardboard divider between the pos   neg terminals as the two rows lay lengthwise in the box   the packaging makes them great to use for long term emergency storage  especially if the expiration dates are usually further out like the competition   unless those dates are all bs anyway   the voltmeter doesn t lie   i would not trust these to leave in a device long term   i assume they would leak like every other chinese alkaline battery i have ever used   i wish energizer ultimate lithium made d cells   their aa and aaa non rechargables are bulletproof and the gold standard in non rechargeable cells      
138,5.0,                       picked these up as a cheap alternative to name brand batteries when i went on my camping trip  i needed d cell for my lantern  i figured that even if these didn t last the whole weekend in the lantern  i could use more than a few  surprisingly  or unsurprisingly  i never needed to change the batteries the whole weekend  very happy with these batteries  good price point  overall good quality  i would definitely purchase again      
139,5.0,                       we love these batteries  shelf life is incredible and the longevity is incredible for the price      
140,1.0,                         of the    batteries  which i stored inside my closet  were dead within    months of purchase  despite the website stating that there is a   year  leak free warranty   also  amazon had zero sympathy and stated that is not a warranty or claim that can b e resolved   i m having to throw away two thirds of the batteries i purchased   i will be sure to purchase legitimate batteries from a membership warehouse in the future      
141,4.0,                       since i just received these within the last few weeks  it is hard to judge longevity  but they seem fine      
142,4.0,                       works     
143,5.0,                       they re batteries  why do you need a review for batteries  they re all the same  man      
144,5.0,                         haven t used them for long  but it was nice to get a whole bunch so i could trade out all my marginal flashlights  when you just buy a   pack  it s never enough        
145,5.0,                       i like     
146,5.0,                       well priced and seem to do the job well  we have some  sonic mole chasers  buried in the yard  they need replacement batteries every   months  instead of having the critters remind me of when to replace the batteries   i get a pack of these d cells sent automatically via subscribe and save    not only do i appreciate the discount  but it s a built in reminder to change the batteries on time      
147,5.0,                       these work well and last about a week and a half in my led candles  i leave them on round the clock  would purchase these batteries again      
148,5.0,                       batteries work great  i keep a supply on hand so when i need batteries i have them      
149,4.0,                       thank you     
150,5.0,                       great product     
151,2.0,                       some of the batteries arrived with partial charge straight out of the package      
152,1.0,                       they gave up on me in an hour using on a toy for my son do not buy      
153,5.0,                       did the job     
154,5.0,                       great product at a great price       
155,2.0,                       didn t last very long in my nerf blaster  disappointed and won t buy again      
156,5.0,                       back up     
157,5.0,                       good     
158,5.0,                       no different than a duracell     
159,3.0,                       i got them cheaper than i could find in stores  but it still doesn t justify having a few of them dying waaaaay early   use a battery tester on them all before you start using them  in case you have to send them back      
160,5.0,                       i have bought several battery sizes in amazon basics  i am very happy with how long they last      
161,5.0,                       works well      
162,5.0,                       these batteries are as good as some  more expensive brands  i use them a lot in two flashlights  and the batteries have lasted very well  in short  they compare favorably with other brands      
163,5.0,                       been buying amazon batteries for years now  best price for the quality and with   kids  we use a lot of batteries      
164,5.0,                       i was leery even after reading all the reviews on the amazon basics batteries  so far so good  time will tell if these last as long as top name brand batteries  i ll write an update given time for a full review      
165,5.0,                       came quickly     
166,5.0,                       reliable and inexpensive batteries so i have no problem w  them what so ever   i m not sure they last any longer or less than the name brand batteries so i have no problem paying less for something that lasts just as long      
167,4.0,                       batteries         
168,4.0,                       great batteries for price  love you get more for your money on amazon  will order batteries off amazon from now on      
169,2.0,                       they work  for a very short period of time  even when not being used the batteries lost their energy      
170,2.0,                       i bought these to use with a minnow aerator  all other inexpensive batteries last     hours  these less than     will not buy again      
171,5.0,                       great value and works well     
172,5.0,                       based on the prices for the other batteries on amazon  these are a good deal  the packaging is really nice and so far they are doing a great job without any problems      
173,5.0,                       like     
174,1.0,                       unfortunately  i ordered two boxes of these worthless batteries  they do not last more than     weeks  bad investment  tossing them out  very disappointed      
175,5.0,                       these batteries work great  no issues in terms of performance compared to other so called name brand  e g  duracell  batteries  amazon brand products that i have bought have held their own compared to name brand products  so while you can go for duracell i think you will be just find trying amazonbasics and be surprised at what you find      
176,5.0,                       good     
177,1.0,                       thought i would try the amazon brand because they offered more value  instead i got a pack of size d batteries that were all dead on arrival  unfortunately it took me two months to realize the issue was not in my watch winder but in the batteries  finally purchased some energizers and the device works fine   will think twice before buying the amazon batteries again      
178,5.0,                       excellent      
179,1.0,                       i purchased amazon basic batteries in every size i use     and all of them have had a very short battery life and several have corroded which  imo  shouldn t happen at all in fresh batteries  just about ruined my new optical mouse      
180,5.0,                       these alkaline and do last better than others  price is right and i like the packaging      
181,5.0,                       great buy i need it for my baby fisher price bouncer     
182,4.0,                       great price  installed in led lanterns used for power outages  seems to have a good lifespan   still working after    hours of power out in a recent storm      
183,5.0,                       they have power

186,5.0,                       working great for our big flashlights      
187,5.0,                       hands down  least cost battery source with equal quality  no brainier      
188,3.0,                       it s  cheaper but not as afficient as name brands  i bought it for my daughter s swing and   of it won t even last   weeks on  hours per day use unlike name brands that lasts a whole month or more  not worth it  amazon can do better     
189,5.0,                       worked as expected   they seem to last as long as the more expensive batteries     
190,5.0,                       exact

198,4.0,                       these batteries don t last as long as name brands      
199,5.0,                       purchased for lanterns for a camping trip  batteries have along usage and are great for the price and ease

202,5.0,                       good

211,5.0,                       great battery for the price      
212,4.0,                       if you can wait for the day or   to ship   these ds have lasted as long if not longer than the name brands      
213,5.0,                       quality batteries  when the grandchildren need a new battery or device they come to grandpa  so far batteries work as well as the name brand at about half the price  order today and get day after tomorrow      
214,5.0,                       amazonbasics makes really good batteries  these come with a claim for   year shelf life  for the affordable price  it is worth giving these a shot we had a baby recently and a lot of these products use d batteries  i have not noticed these not lasting long at all  if anything at all  these might last longer than the name brands also  the frustration free packaging is awesome  it comes in a cardbord case that helps store these easily on my shelf      
215,5.0,                       these batteries last just as long as name brand  maybe even longer and they are a great price      
216,5.0,                       bought these to have before hurricane irma hit florida   they didn t arrive until after the hurricane   luckily they weren t needed   however  i am going to keep them on hand since we need to have emergency equipment readily available  and these batteries boast of a   year shelf life   i m hoping to never need them but i m happy to know that i have them on hand      
217,5.0,                       i bought a box of these to go with a  hands free  opening trash can and have only needed to change the batteries once in a year       
218,5.0,                       looks good  no issues     
219,5.0,                       typical batteries     
220,5.0,                       all the amazon batteries we ve purchased have worked great  and at low prices   we are still stuck with batteries for some things and while that holds true we will use amazon s

228,5.0,                       for the price they are great  i would compare them to alkaline  we used them for for our spotlights in the backyard  haven t had to change them in over a month     
229,5.0,                       love these batteries  great price  last as long as the usual store bought brands  it is very helpful to have a supply on hand  highly recommend      
230,5.0,                       really can t beat the price of the amazon basics batteries  i have been using their brand for a few years now  both the regular and the rechargeable  these d batteries seem to hold a charge just as long as any other major brands      
231,5.0,                       i buy these for home or work and you can t beat the price they work as well as any other brand battery i haven t noticed that a lose power or  die  faster than more expensive batteries  give them a try

236,5.0,                       works as it should     
237,5.0,                       these worked great   great value for the money   cheaper than other brands and work just as well      
238,5.0,                       better than our energizers and much cheaper        will buy again      
239,3.0,                       dont buy in bulks for one light because by the time you use them the life span is bad     
240,5.0,                       best value for your money     
241,5.0,                       i see no quality difference in these and name brand batteries   great batteries      
242,5.0,                       i love amazon batteries  they last a long time and the price is decent      
243,5.0,                       good everyday battery     
244,3.0,                       batteries for power outages     
245,5.0,                       hurricane season is upon us  this is a great price   with climate change  it is an inexpensive way to stock up      
246,5.0,                       beat price for batteries     
247,5.0,                    me funcionaron perfecto   las volver a q comprar        
248,5.0,                       why pay more for same quality      
249,5.0,                       thankyou      
250,5.0,                       works like a battery should     
251,5.0,                       i have these for a sensor activated light   it has gotten a lot of use and i am still on the first   batteries needed for the light   no more high dollar batteries from the store as these seem to exceed those      
252,5.0,                       got    batteries  hopefully they last for such a good price      
253,4.0,                       batteries seem ok  but they are shrink wrapped in hard plastic film which is very difficult to remove  takes a knife or some other kind of blade  and then one risks cutting oneself  couldn t a different kind of plastic film could be used just as cheaply      
254,1.0,                       i got these batteries  d cell  to use in a maglite flashlight  the first pair lasted about    minutes before it was so dim it was unusual  the second pair dimmed from really bright to that of a battery nearing the end of its life after about    seconds  but has stayed at that brightness for    minutes now  this is not the experience i have had with other name brand batteries  or even something like radio shack badged ones      
255,4.0,                       reasonable quality batteries  shelf life is really good  some of the batteries have not been used for years and perform well once used  the life of the battery is maybe     of some other high performing ones when brand new  good overall value  had some issues with them stopping working when we dropped flashlights  where replacing batteries made flashlights work      
256,5.0,                       excellent battery life   we ve been enjoying amazon basics batteries of all sizes for many years and i love being able to buy them in quantities like this      
257,5.0,                       great price      
258,4.0,                       good value     
259,1.0,                       purchased these the middle of july for wife to use in battery operated name brand candles which have a timer and these burned out in a very short time compared to other brand batteries we have used  expiration date on box is         and with a manufacture date was          very disappointing and can not recommend      
260,3.0,                       these worked fine on arrival  but use them soon because they have only a three year shelf life  which i learned from the website and not from the packaging because i couldn t find an expiration date on the package or the battery itself  so who knows how long these will last   p s  to all potential hurricane sufferers   you probably know this but don t store your hurricane lanterns  portable fans  radios  seasonal big flashlights et cetera with the batteries in them   they ll die  leak  or both      
261,5.0,                       goog value for the coast      
262,5.0,                       used in one of our automatic kitchen trash receptacle   lots of use   still working

264,5.0,                       i only gave   stars on longevity and motion detection because i haven t used them yet     
265,5.0,                       repetive customer  so happy i have a quick and easy way to find dependable batteries at great prices  they last in our kids toys  remotes and other gadgets around the house      
266,5.0,                       great price     nice box  i don t know what you mean by motion detection as i use them for toys and flash lights      
267,5.0,                       great batteries but package for shipping needs some work      
268,5.0,                       great deal        
269,4.0,                       sucked   only went off when they wanted at bizzaro various distances   dont do it

272,5.0,                       works like batteries     
273,5.0,                       they are d batteries  and are lasting a good amount of time in our outdoor motion sensor lights more economical than energizer duracell  and longer lasting than the  value  d cells      
274,5.0,                       they work great and so reasonably priced      
275,5.0,                       my batteries arrived quickly   i put   in my maglite and  bright and good to go      
276,5.0,                       these batteries cost    a piece  now where do you buy batteries that price  i m a fisherman and their the only batteries i use  they run my bait buckets  flashlights  clocks  gas transfer pump and  many other things      
277,5.0,                       perfect quality and best for daily use     
278,5.0,                       you just can t go wrong with this price and quality       
279,5.0,                       this is yet another amazon basics products that i have been very happy with  without doing any sophisticated testing  i think these batteries seem to be as good as any of the well known  much more expensive brand name batteries  i will be buying more      
280,5.0,                       there is a guy on youtube that tested many batteries and for the money  amazon basics give you the best bang for the buck  duracell scored well for a longer charge but for the cost  these won  i use d  aa and aaa over duracell now  excellent battery        
281,5.0,                       i have been using them a little over a year for my touchless trash can       
282,2.0,                       i purchased these specifically for my grand daughter s baby swing  i got   refills out of the    pack    each  refill  only lasted about     hours        
283,5.0,                       we got these for our mega nurf guns and they lasted longer than duracell s batteries      
284,5.0,                       these seem to have as much life as the brand name batteries  and it was a good price  they also come in a neat box that holds them all in place and is not huge and bulky making it hard to store  will definitely keep buying amazon batteries in the future      
285,5.0,                       some of the best batteries delivered quickly to your door     
286,3.0,                       just average   wont buy again     
287,3.0,                       ordered these to replace all my  d  flash lights with new power  yet to see how long they last  for the money however a great buy if they last  will update if and when i find out      
288,5.0,                       we seem to go through batteries so fast with all the toys and electronics that my kids and husband have   i feel like i was always running out and buying more batteries and they seemed so expensive   we decided to try out the aamazonbasics batteries because they are cheaper than purchasing in the store   and because they are delivered to my front door and i don t have to remember to grab them at the grocery store or make a special trip out to get batteries   so far we ve been really impressed with these batteries   i was afraid that they would be like the super cheap ones you can get at the dollar store and not really have much life to them and have to replace them even more frequently   we ve been using them in several well loved  read used all the dang time   toys as well as some electronic devices and we haven t had any issues with them not having a good life span to them   we will definitely purchase these again when our supply gets low   thanks for an affordable  easy option to the seemingly never ending need for batteries      
289,1.0,                        i used all    for my product and one of the motors quit after two hours  it appears that i am unable to replace them which is sad as they are an amazon basics product      
290,5.0,                       lasted longer than i expected   reasonable price      
291,5.0,                       amazon batteries are great   excellent price   excellent power life   all i buy now are amazon batteries      
292,5.0,                       great value     
293,5.0,                       this is a great purchase   they hold up well  not as great as a energizer but the are above average on performance      
294,5.0,                       they work as good as any name brand battery in my led motion sensing lights      
295,5.0,                       not much to say here  good value for the money  not sure how they will compare to brand name batteries longevity wise  but they are exactly what i needed      
296,1.0,                       these batteries are terrible  delivered dead  i got one package a couple of days ago and tested several of them and it didnt work so i contacted amazon to replace them and i got the new package today and still they re all defective  my guess is theyve sat too long on a shelf  do not buy these  they re a straight up disappointment      
297,5.0,                       i use these in my mole chasers and they do the job   i change them every six months as the mole chasers are on continuously      
298,5.0,                       long lasting  i think better than the name brand ones  using them mostly for lanterns during blackouts and camping      
299,5.0,                       price  product and delivery were great      
300,5.0,                       perfect

304,5.0,                       these batteries are a good value they last as long as any batteries on the market  i have tested them  would buy again      
305,1.0,                       i have a rowing machine that uses d batteries  when i use duracell batteries the computer for the rower is fine but each time i have used these i have trouble with bluetooth and get error messages  i won t order again

309,5.0,                       batteries and they work as they should and save a substantial amount over the duracell or energizer  the batteries seem to be long lasting in various items  will purchase again      
310,5.0,                       great    they rere duracell        
311,5.0,                       easy to order and sometimes they are hard to find   using for several things     battery operated fans and led candles   thank you     
312,5.0,                       great batteries   last as long as the name brand ones  cheaper than going to the big box stores with prime      
313,5.0,                       good value for general use  don t use for motion detection      
314,5.0,                       despite the price  these aren t  budget  batteries that loose power quickly  instead  these are very long lasting and just a good value  i also appreciated amazon t no fuss packaging  so there was no struggle opening the box and putting the batteries right to use      
315,5.0,                       seem to be working just fine

320,5.0,                       great product for price  delivery on time      
321,5.0,                       i used the batteries to power   fans on a camping trip  i got about    hours of use out of them on our trip and they re still going strong  i watched a few videos in which their longevity was tested against other name brand batteries and they performed very well against them  well worth the purchase      
322,5.0,                       very good batteries thanks thelma l      
323,4.0,                       good buy     
324,4.0,                       good batteries  ok price  i found that i can buy batteries cheaper at the     cent store  the box they ship it in is nice and i reuse it to hold the batteries i buy from the     cent store  they last about the same  if you don t have a     cent store near you or if they don t carry batteries  then i would recommend these amazonbasics batteries  much cheaper and does the same job as the name brand ones      
325,5.0,                       these batteries are pretty long lasting   i read the light they go with  ate batteries for lunch   not true   ours are still going strong and it s been three week  after we run out i ll get rechargeable ones for sure but these or good      
326,1.0,                       don t waste your money     most of these reviews are      fake because these batteries are horrible just like all other amazon basic products     i bought these batteries and only used them for a week  and then they just stopped working     buy duracell instead        
327,1.0,                       they only lasted   days in my small   inch fans  duracell and energizer batteries last close to    days of continuous use   i would not recommend this to anyone      
328,5.0,                       i bought these for the last hurricane season and still have them for this hurricane season  i am happy with them so far      
329,5.0,                       seem to work like most batteries did not really test side by side to others so cant really say what life is like on them      
330,5.0,                       as expected good batteries     
331,5.0,                       the per unit price is very good for d cells   the batteries are packaged in a cardboard and plastic sleeve to protect them from the elements and to keep them from touching each other   i haven t given it any tests  but i will report how well the batteries hold up  or don t hold up  when that information is available      
332,5.0,                       these amazon basics batteries d style are the very best  they re long lasting performances are the best quality here on amazon com     
333,5.0,                       great buy for the money      
334,5.0,                       love the  longevity      
335,5.0,                       i mean they work   better than the rayovacs   not much else to say   heavy too lol      
336,5.0,                       worked well so far     
337,2.0,                       don t waste your money  they barely power up and dont last long at all  go with name brand     
338,4.0,                       these amazon branded batteries are great and should work well  the only problem would probably be that other batteries could sometimes have better qualities  it really depends on your preference     
339,5.0,                       seem to get as much wear out of these as the name brands   will continue to buy these      
340,4.0,                       good value     
341,1.0,                         batteries where dead i will never purchase batteries from amazon in the future     
342,4.0,                       while the batteries are a good price  they don t last as long as brand name batteries  i m having to replace them more often  also  the packaging is terrible  they are tightly shrink wrapped in hard to open cellophane that i need scissors for  the box comes in   rows of six  and i have to cut each battery out  i don t see what s wrong with just placing them in easier to open packaging      
343,4.0,                       this are as good as the name brand ones and last as long     
344,3.0,                       not so great  i put these batteries in multiple things  all candles but different sizes and shapes etc  the lager candles did not make it very long    weeks tops  the smaller candles are still going for now  i m     weeks in      
345,5.0,                       as good as any and a better price     
346,5.0,                       a great deal compared to namebrands      
347,1.0,                       i replaced the batteries on may   nd they lasted until may    in a motion light  the name batteries i replaced had lasted since nov   don  t waste your money     
348,5.0,                       so handy to order and have around the house   i even look overly organized in the box they come in      
349,5.0,                       fast service great price      
350,5.0,                       value  small fan for hospital patient      
351,4.0,                       batteries lasted as expected      
352,4.0,                       they are improving over time   did not work well until the third charge      
353,5.0,                       they last     
354,3.0,                       used in mr  beams mb    these batteries do not last   lucky to get   weeks out of these on a motion activated light  activated less than    times a day   energizer max d batteries have been working for months now   purchase these if you don t mind changing batteries often   decent value for the price  i suppose      
355,5.0,                       great for an easy install without hardwiring       
356,5.0,                       the amazon batteries work well enough  but do not seem to last quite as long as other name brand batteries   not sure if it is the equipment i am putting them in or the batteries themselves   either way  the cost makes up for that slight difference      
357,1.0,                       we bought these batteries for our air mattress pump and once installed our air pump was still working as slow or possibly even worse then when we had the dying batteries in  we were confused as these were supposed to be new and should be working  i took the batteries out to take a look and compare them to the energizer brand we had previously  the amazon batteries came damaged  the positive side ends were not extended out enough and therefore weren t secured tight enough into the air pump in order to work properly  wouldn t risk my chances buying here again  just spend the extra bucks on better batteries      
358,5.0,                       not everything uses double as or triple as some thing still ask for d cells  and these are durable  and do the job well      
359,5.0,                       always need batteries      
360,5.0,                       they seem to work just as well as the name brand batteries  and for an excellent price  the best thing is the  frustration free  packaging  it s a breeze to remove batteries  and put them back  if you decide you don t need them  goodbye  plastic clamshell packaging      
361,5.0,                       good batteries  i dunno what else one could say about batteries  they work      
362,5.0,                       nothing to dislike     
363,5.0,                       every time i need batteries i purchased these amazon brand batteries  the quality is good  the price is good  no complaints      
364,5.0,                       can you fast and just what i needed     
365,5.0,                       thank you   just as described and fast shipping

367,1.0,                       used   they worked good  when to use a couple more out of the   left  they  are dead      
368,5.0,                       i use these in my battery powered lamp in the barn  they last for quite a while      
369,5.0,                       a great battery  i have replaced brand name batteries with these and found these lasted longer      
370,5.0,                       as described  convenient      
371,5.0,                       great value      
372,5.0,                       bulk buying     
373,4.0,                       listed as   years  but the actual date on the batteries is        so closer to   years for this batch   good price  and should be ok for my use  but compared to the    year shelf life of major brands  not so good      
374,5.0,                       great price for a lot of batteries      
375,5.0,                       worked a lot longer than i thought  put them into a    day lantern and it ran    days  very pleased      
376,5.0,                       amazon batteries are the longest lasting and best value out there      
377,1.0,                       i have had nothing but problems with these batteries from day one  i don t know if it is the batteries or the charger but they have never held a full charge  i complained about the charger and the seller was kind enough to send me a new charger but the same   error  keeps appearing to the point that i never know if my batteries are charged or not  they are also very hot to the touch when i take them out of the charger   i thought i was doing the right thing for the environment by using rechargeable batteries but it looks like i will have to go back to using regular batteries  i am very disappointed and would never recommend these batteries to anyone      
378,5.0,                       works good     
379,1.0,                       spent   hours changing out batteries just to find out all these batteries are  low or dead  straight out of the package  want my money back      
380,4.0,                       these batteries work fine but don t seem to last as long as the other name brand batteries      
381,5.0,                       great value for the price  i needed lots of these to take to the bahamas after hurricane dorian to run all of the fans that i also bought on amazon     
382,5.0,                       cant beat the price      
383,5.0,                       good product     
384,5.0,                       i ve purchased   other sizes of same brand  they work well and last long  would buy again      
385,5.0,                       amazon is killing it with its battery business  they last as long as the big boy s batteries at a much cheaper price  i ve switched to amazon batteries a long time ago and don t see myself buying anything else  great job amazon      
386,5.0,                       these batteries are priced great and last as long as the big boys batteries  highly recommended      
387,5.0,                       good value  performs perfectly     
388,2.0,                       batteries i recieved had an exparation date of       this order was fufilled by amazon so there batteries have been in their warehouse for years aparently  i tend to use them up quickly so i dont care about the exparatioin date and they always provide the power and value i expect for the price but i am continualy dissapointed when i recieve amazon betteries because the exparation dates are nowhere near    years out  must are set to expire within   or   years of purchase in my experience   when i purchase a box of duracells with the    year shelf life claim they are always reasonably new manufectured with exparation dates far off in the future  maybe ive just had bad luck but amazon continues to ship me batteries that are acouple years from exparation every time i order them  like i said i use them up quickly so its not to much of an issue to me but if your purchasing to keep on the shelf for a long time amazon batteries def arent for you      
389,5.0,                       great value     
390,5.0,                       not much to say without properly testing equipment   these work and last about as long as other batteries for a lower price     
391,5.0,                       good value     
392,2.0,                       i really wanted to like the amazon version for batteries  they are so much more affordable than the other name brands in the market  but there is definitely a reason for that  they don t last anywhere near as long as their competitors  so in this case you are really getting what you pay for  they are so much lower in price because you will go through them so much more quickly than the other brands      
393,5.0,                       for the price  they are very good quality  came nicely packaged  i expect to last longer than the cheapy brand ones out there and they were better priced than the high end brand name batteries     
394,1.0,                       we had a bad batch  they were brand new and didn t work at all  this was the first time i have been disappointed with an amazon basic product      
395,2.0,                       i m handicapped with only one working hand   getting into the hard plastic shrink wrap was next to impossible   if i had known  i never would have purchased     
396,4.0,                       i m going to say to hit or miss with these batteries and sometimes they may be cheaper then the home depot brand but sometimes they do run more then the home depot brand  overall they seem to last about the same amount of time if you frequently      
397,5.0,                         i love amazon batteries and the price you get for your money is great      
398,5.0,                       they power stuff      
399,3.0,                       did not last long     
400,5.0,                       great product     
401,3.0,                       really hoping that these were going to be close to as good as name brands   was on a hunting trip and running sets of   d cells in streamlight lanterns   all three lanterns were running low and swapped out batteries for all three at the same time   one lantern got a set of energizers that had been laying around for about   years  one got a set of duracells that had been around for about the same length of time  and the third lantern got a set of the amazon basics that were less than a year old within two days the lantern with the amazon basics was already showing the first level of depletion  green light    orange light    red light    blinking red light    within another evening of use it was to the red light   both of the other sets were still on green the whole time      
402,3.0,                       they don t last but a month in an auto opening trash can lid with   c cells in it      
403,1.0,                       i don t know how people got lucky with these  i m joining the many who received their d batteries dead on arrival  none of them will power a cat feed machine  let alone a flashlight  very disappointed      
404,5.0,                       great as always price is great shipping is   days and i don t have to dill with the people at the stores     
405,5.0,                       great price and very convenient to add when you know you re going to need them      
406,5.0,                       during storms our electricity tends to cut off so  i make sure i m stocked up on batteries for my lanterns and flashlights  my lanterns take   d batteries and i only buy amazon s brand cause the are just as good  if not better than energizer and duracell  etc   they are the most cost effective as well  everytime  i ve ordered they have been delivered the next day      
407,5.0,                       i buy the mult pack batteries to put in our outdoor motion lights  they work great for months      
408,1.0,                       pictures tell the story  and now i can t return  seems that a battery that has an expiration date of        should not leak acid only after two months   what a waste of money     
409,5.0,                       basic alkaline batteries that work well  they last as long as the more expensive alkaline batteries     
410,4.0,                       pretty good value  they didn t last the full amount of hours they said that they would in my fan while camping but they got the job done      
411,5.0,                       great     
412,5.0,                       very good life     
413,5.0,                       i don t think i will ever buy duracell or engergizer again  i find these batteries just as good and they are much cheaper      
414,5.0,                       the price on these is awesome compared to what you pay at the actual store    we use these mainly in fans we take camping   each fan takes   batteries so the cost can add up  these have worked great so far and we have yet to need to replace them      
415,5.0,                       do you have a kid  do you know of friends that have kids  then you know you need a ton of d size batteries for all of their toys   thank goodness amazon has them in bulk   this is a great set and they work like a charm      
416,5.0,                       as described     
417,5.0,                       good price for the money     
418,5.0,                       why would anyone go anywhere else to buy batteries  than amazon      
419,5.0,                       productexcellent     
420,5.0,                       can t beat the price and they last a long time      
421,5.0,                       i needed batteries quickly and safely delivered   amazon delivered the next day      
422,5.0,                       great     
423,5.0,                       good price   used them through the holiday season for battery operated outdoor wreaths    hours a day for about    days  and there were no signs that the batteries were wearing out   packed them away for next year but i think i already got my money s worth      
424,5.0,                       like     
425,4.0,                       my first impression is that they are good batteries   i purchased several sizes  aa  aaa  d etc  and have used them in kids toys and flashlights  battery life seems good  nothing has failed so far   based upon other reviews i checked them over and all seem to be manufactured correctly   these look different from older reviews so i m thinking they are  new and improved  the area for improvement is the packaging  i know  minor detail   while i like the cardboard sleeve that they come in  the batteries themselves are shrink wrapped in plastic into groups of     depends on size    the sleeve is fragile and now i just have a pile of loose batteries  a mix of shrink wrapped and loose ones    it would be nice if the cardboard sleeve served as something to store   organize   dispense them  like pez candy   the bottom edge of the box needs to open   not the side   duck tape to the rescue so far  yes i d buy them again  although i still use name branded  v in the fire alarms      
426,5.0,                       works well  and lasts a long time      
427,5.0,                       wonderful power packed investment  using these outdoor inside motion sensing lights  survived southwest heat  winter tests to follow  ohh rains are beaten as well by these batteries      
428,4.0,                       good productfair price     
429,5.0,                       these batteries are great for the price and capacity      
430,2.0,                       energizer batteries lasted   months in my baby s swing  these lasted two weeks even at one quarter of these price per battery it still costs   times as much to use these cheap batteries      
431,5.0,                       great value  great batteries  super fast shipping     
432,5.0,                       i love the bulks option and they work great for good price      
433,5.0,                       yep  we got batteries      
434,3.0,                       these batteries are fine  the issue i have is that they in the  frequently bought together  with a motion sensing garbage can  so i assumed they must be the correct size for the garbage can  nope  the garage can takes c  not the d s  i will make sure i look better before purchasing the recommendations      
435,4.0,                       but also not energizer prices      
436,5.0,                       like having a good supply      good price     
437,5.0,                       works great     
438,2.0,                       ummm   sorry these batteries did not perform as well as those   brand name batteries   around the holidays i usually have to buy the number of batteries this package offers   the batteries died out a couple of weeks before xmas   very disappointing since i purchased them right after thanksgiving  which is when we always put everything up    will not buy again      
439,5.0,                       gets the job done at an affordable price      
440,5.0,                       works just as well as duracell or energizer batteries  cheaper than buying in the stores     
441,1.0,                       batteries were definitely weak   loaded some in a flashlight  and loaded some in a battery operated vac   both units were sluggish   i threw out the box and didn t bother to return them   i don t believe they were fresh will order a name brand in the future      
442,5.0,                       i have been using amazon batteries for the last few months   so far   so good        
443,2.0,                       bought a box of     must of got a bad batch  the first   didn t last long at all  on my second set of   hoping these are good i love amazon and it hurts to say something negative about them  however we have to let them know what s good and what s not      
444,1.0,                       these do not last long at all  very disappointed  i ll go back to name brand batteries even though more expensive  it will be a much greater value      
445,5.0,                       great value     
446,1.0,                       this was supposed to be a pack of    d cells  instead i got c cells  which i don t even need  now i m stuck with the wrong batteries because i m guessing its not worth the trouble and or money to return them for a refund or exchange  shameful quality control      
447,5.0,                       really kept me going     
448,5.0,                       great battery for the price     
449,5.0,                       great for xmas     
450,5.0,                       a pack o  batteries for a great price  put em in stuff and battery magic happens  amazing       
451,1.0,                       i don t know how these were stored or how old they were   these are really poor maybe     of a charge  i would never buy these again      
452,5.0,                       i love amazonbasics batteries   they are way less expensive than energizer  duracell  etc  and as far as i can tell last just as long   the packaging is so much nicer than the blister packs most other brands come in      
453,5.0,                       great price for d batteries     
454,5.0,                       gets the job done at a highly affordable price  i use these for toys and am quite please with the quality so far  i will update on if there are any duration issues but i highly doubt that will be a problem  many batteries that are not going to last typically die out extremely fast and this does not seem to be the case for these      
455,1.0,                         of amazonbasics d cell     volt everyday alkaline batteries   pack of     appearance may vary please take this item off auto deliver  i sent this and other items to bobby morrison       westover rd as a one time purchase   he does not want the batteries and i do not want to continue to paying for them      
456,5.0,                       i ll always buy nothing but amazon batts   they come in an easy access box rather than those hard  plastic shell packs that are so difficult to open that all other manufacturers use      
457,5.0,                       great price      
458,5.0,                       excelente     
459,5.0,                       skip the brand names and pick these  just as good and priced to sell     
460,5.0,                       battery lasts long  perfect for what i was looking for      
461,4.0,                       good price for a regular battery      
462,1.0,                       these do not have the life of abrand name product      
463,4.0,                       the price is right  we ll see just how long they actually last  going into motion sensing security lights    year life expectancy in the motion lights      
464,1.0,                       like others have said  garbage  immediately lost power  stick with kirkland or other name brands they actually work      
465,5.0,                       i don t use many things that require d cell batteries  but i needed them for an automatic pet feeder i bought  they do what they re made to do and have been supplying the feeder with the power it needs when the building s power goes out  so i don t have to worry about my cats starving to death     thanks      
466,5.0,                       great for money     
467,5.0,                       great product and works just as good as name brand      
468,5.0,                       i bought these batteries to use in my cats food dispenser  it dispenses food three times a day and the batteries have lasted so far for about a month  good quality  i will be buying these again      
469,5.0,                       far less expensive batteries than anywhere else and they don t deplete quickly      
470,1.0,                       i bought     for driveway motion lights  lights run for    seconds at a time based on motion  batteries didn t last    days  spend the money and get the name brand batteries  lesson learned      
471,5.0,                       good     
472,5.0,                       batteries     
473,5.0,                       as advertised     
474,5.0,                       great for the auto on off lights i bought      
475,5.0,                       havent used yet  good value     
476,5.0,                       great deal for d cell batteries they work as expected in the camping lights we have and portable radios      
477,4.0,                       you get more batteries for the money     
478,3.0,                       i m not an engineer  i haven t conducted details comparisons using a variety of gauges and meters  but my impression is that duracell batteries last longer in a variety devices that amazon basics do      
479,3.0,                       i ve bought other sizes of amazon batteries in the past and have been very pleased with the quality and value   the d cells  however  didn t seem to last any longer than cheap dollar store batteries i ve bought in a pinch   maybe i received a bad batch or maybe my gut feeling about their longevity is mistaken  but other size amazon batteries have significantly outlasted cheap ones and it was very evident      
480,5.0,                       worth the money spent  would buy again  amazon batteries are just as good as the name brands if not better       
481,5.0,                       batteries for my ring devices have lasted for some time now   amazon basics batteries are my go too batteries for purchase      
482,5.0,                       great value      
483,4.0,                       can save lots of money by using a rechargeable batteries     
484,5.0,                       bought for replacement convience for me blow up air bed mattress     
485,5.0,                       bought these for holiday candles in my windows which are on timers  i thought the batteries would last a few weeks  installed in nov  and   months later  still going      i guess they are now easter candles        
486,5.0,                       amazon batteries are where it s at  they re affordable and they last for a really long time      
487,1.0,                       do not buy these batteries  they are cheap for a reason  i bought these for a friend who then installed them in multiple items  including her sons turtle nightlight which he d had since birth and he cherished  also  i bought that nightlight for him so i m rather attached to it myself  well these pos batteries promptly deteriorated and corroded to the extent that the night light ceased to function  these batteries are garbage  don t buy them  if you ve already bought them  return them  if you can t return them  throw them in the garbage so they don t destroy things you do care about      
488,1.0,                       i always thought amazon carry quality product  but this is not the case with those d batteries  only last about half of the alkaline personally i think alkaline is the best battery  i ve also tried energizer  but alkaline just last longer    amazon basics is about     comparing to energizer     comparing to alkalinei am not trying to recommend any brand  just a fishermen who uses those battery constantly on a air pump  so  usage is also constantly  i know how many fishing trips they last      
489,4.0,                       i like that i don t have to go to the store and get batteries that are going to last the same amount of time     
490,5.0,                       good deal

497,5.0,                       worth it to order  much better then name brand batteries

500,3.0,                       got these for use in devices that need aa batteries  unfortunately they re not as good as energizer brand  the price is a bit lower  but not as long lastingthis review was meant for the aa batteries  haven t had the  d  cells long enough to evaluate     
501,5.0,                       fast shipping  works great  cheap price      
502,5.0,                       usually i get my batteries at the grocery store or a big box place  but with the pandemic i m ordering online more  i always try to get the best deal regardless  i thought i was saving money with another brand  but those batteries  only lasted less than a week  i decided to try the amazon basics brand and these are seriously long lasting  i m using the size d for an air purifier and they just keep going  i decided  to splurge and buy a big box so i don t have to worry about buying them for a year or more  buying in bulk makes them about the same price as the other brand  very happy with these      
503,5.0,                       this was a gift for hurricane season to my grandchildren   thank you      
504,1.0,                       we mainly use these in outside motion activated lights  other brands last through the whole winter  these have already had to be changed multiple times this winter and it s still january this is really difficult since we have to get up on a ladder  in the snow  i ll pay more and get better battery life in the future      
505,3.0,                       amazon batteries are just fine  cheap and they last long enough  i have a house full of flameless candles  so when i change all the batteries it s a project  their claim of  frustration free packaging  however  is a horrible joke  open the box and you ll find every two batteries separately sealed  that s   more packages to open  in a hard plastic which both scissors and teeth find challenging  just when you get a piece of the plastic ripped free  thinking this will finally help unravel the batteries     nope  the hard plastic breaks off and you ve only released one battery  ugh         do better amazon      
506,5.0,                       my ring motion lights is still work even after a month and its pretty bright considering heavy traffic in my area     
507,5.0,                       for the price of these batteries  i cant find a complaint  we buy all our batteries from amazon  with a newborn and a toddler  we go through a lot of batteries  but these work just as good as any battery we ve tried      
508,5.0,                       all were good

512,5.0,                       i need more

522,5.0,                       we used these to power a small claw machine for a carnival and they worked very well      
523,5.0,                       came in time with what i wanted to use it for     
524,5.0,                       great product long lasting and great value  recommend      
525,3.0,                       these batteries don t last as long as the better brands  but they do the trick  the price was right so i loaded up a little  its your base level battery      
526,5.0,                       good quality     
527,5.0,                       great value     
528,5.0,                       good quality     
529,5.0,                       i bought these batteries for a fan  i leaned the hard way that everything i have in my house is operated by electricity  i lost power a month ago and boy oh boy it got so hot in my house  i had nothing to cool me off  so i bought a fan that is operated by batteries and electric in case i ever lose power again  i have only used the fan a couple of times but each time i used it to see if the batteries work  the fan works great which means the batteries are not going dead  the price is was sold me  i tried the amazon basics and so far i m happy      
530,3.0,                       average battery do not last as long as energizer or duracell     
531,3.0,                       they came in a timely manner and as advertised  not sure how long they ll last  i put them in my bug out bag  the price is right      
532,3.0,                       i have bought many types of amazonbasics batteries because they are significantly cheaper than others   in  most of my experiences the batteries have held up well and i m satisfied with them what i m not sure of is whether or not these batteries are cheaper because they have less capacity  measured in mah  which is kind of important to know   you can t compare apples to apples unless you know how much you re going to get out of a battery   so these batteries may look like a better deal than the name brand batteries because they are so cheap  but if they have   x less mah  then you re not getting a deal   do these batteries have   x less capacity than energizer or other brands    i don t know     because amazon doesn t put that information in the description   i mean  mah capacity and the price are really the only two primary metrics people need to know to compare most batteries   it s like buying a light bulb and not knowing if it s supposed to last    hours or        hours   for such basic information as that i know it s not an oversight  amazon has decided not to be forthcoming about it so it s certainly perceived as something they want to hide with that concern in mind  my personal uses for batteries don t require a lot of power   for tv remotes  air pumps  etc the amazonbasics batteries seem to last long enough to be worth it   i did notice that these batteries didn t seem to last long in a simple strand of led lights we used for christmas decorations   i think it lasted for about   weeks even though we only turned the lights on during nighttime hours   i would assume those little led lights use almost no energy but that s the only example i have where the battery life seemed shorter than expected conclusion  for heavier activity i would probably buy batteries that i knew had longer life   for simple around the house usage these work just fine      
533,3.0,                       these batteries were priced like other batteries i ve used  but did not perform as well   i only purchased them because there was a note that by spending a certain amount there would be no charge for shipping   the notice was completely deceiving because i really had to buy amazon prime to get the  free  shipping which was not free at all at     per month   i don t buy that often and felt deceived by the notice      
534,5.0,                       these last forever  i don t plan to ever buy another brand  using in flameless candles and they just don t stop      
535,5.0,                       great seller  quality product     
536,3.0,                       package was open and only had   batteries had to return     
537,5.0,                       my go to battery  performance is what i expected  easy to order and a good value  i would recommend to a family member or friend      
538,5.0,                       when you live in hurricane country  having a reliable source of power for lanterns and fans is a must   these batteries have proved their worth many times over      
539,5.0,                       we needed a bunch of d batteries to run a fan in our cabin all week   every night we ran the fan for hours   i expected the batteries to die out midweek  but that never happened   in fact  there s juice left this morning  as i took the batteries out to pack up   impressive      
540,5.0,                       great batteries  long lasting and inexpensive      
541,5.0,                       long lasting great value

547,1.0,                       did not last long     
548,5.0,                       i switched to the amazon brand batteries years ago because i was sick and tired of paying crazy prices for name brand  alkaline batteries   the amazon brand batteries work just as well and last just as long as the popular name brands but are less expensive   why anyone would continue to buy the popular name brands and pay more when they can get a high quality  long lasting battery amazon is beyond me   i highly recommend the amazon brand alkaline batteries in aaa  aa  c and d cell sizes   excellent quality      
549,5.0,                       great product great price very happy     
550,5.0,                       bought these to power my mr beam led lights and they work well even during a cold northern winter  six months into the lights being installed powered by these batteries they are going strong      
551,4.0,                       i searched for and was comparing rechargeable batteries  amazon had this listed as the first non ad slot and i did not pay enough attention when i bought them    but i needed batteries so i did not send them back  they worked about as well as can be expected  but they should never have been in that search when i was specifically searching for rechargeable batteries  might be my fault  but i am still annoyed      
552,5.0,                       i love these batteries  they work just as good as name brand batteries  but the price is much better      
553,1.0,                       batteries are old dead     
554,2.0,                       i received the box of d batteries in what appeared to be a sealed box from the factory  when i opened the box there were only    batteries    sleeve of   and   sleeve cut open with   battery missing  seems it was shipped that way  you should replace it but i won t hold my breath      
555,5.0,                       cheap and quick delivery  for daily use     
556,5.0,                       just what i needed

558,4.0,                       worth for the price  some of the batteries died way sooner than others but they are cheaper than name brands      
559,5.0,                       ordered these by mistake  thought i was ordering rechargeable batteries   i have had them in the flashlights for awhile and they seem to be doing fine      
560,5.0,                       great product  love it      
561,5.0,                       good batteries for the money      
562,4.0,                       paid very little for these  they don t last nearly as long as other batteries like energizer  but i guess you get what you paid for      
563,5.0,                       i ve bought a few of these packs  they are all great  well packaged and so far no discernible difference between these and the name brands      
564,3.0,                       inexpensive  they work         
565,5.0,                       very good batteries and the price is outstanding      
566,1.0,                       replaced my battery powered motion detector light with these  cheap  d cell batteries it only lasted about   weeks   in comparison  the duracell batteries i had in there prior  lasted about     months      
567,5.0,                       good value     
568,5.0,                       this line of amazon batteries is excellent   i have used various sizes  and they seem just as good as the name brand      
569,5.0,                       the price makes these batteries a great deal and they last every bit as long as expensive very happy with them      
570,1.0,                       approximately half of the batteries were found to have recessed positive terminals  button top was depressed   causing the batteries to not fit into the appropriate receptacles and therefore useless      
571,5.0,                       i bought these for my two grandsons and their new nerf guns with the battery operated magazine  batteries lasted through several nerf wars and still going      
572,5.0,                       great value for the buy      
573,5.0,                       they re batteries    like  they make my candles work so i can t complain      
574,1.0,                       d batteries that don t expire until       they where not dead  the flashlight still worked fine but when i went to check the date on the battery s i found they leaked and made a big mess of my trusty old maglite  i have a few left from the    pack and at least one of those leaked also still in the package  i am going back to locally sourced us made procell s  the date on those is more realistic and i never had one leak before the expire date      
575,5.0,                       excellent value      
576,4.0,                       i put the batteries in a flashlight and the beam was not as bright as   duracell batteries  if they don t last as long as duracell batteries the money value is not there      
577,5.0,                       i have purchased nearly every size of ab batteries  they are great for everyday uses and from what i have used them for have lasted just as long as name brand  i use these d batteries primarily in flameless candles  i see no point in spending extra when these batteries last just as long      
578,4.0,                       using for window candles less expensive than name brands hope they last longer than harbor freight     
579,5.0,                       why buy the name brands when these work just as good   and for the price i got these  worth every penny      
580,5.0,                       can t beat that price and they last just as long as the brand name competition      
581,1.0,                       the batteries lasted two weeks in a trail camera  i usually get     months with duracell procells  i thought i would see if i could skimp a little   nope  the rayovacs were just as bad      
582,2.0,                       typical  store brand  product  batteries were dying in less than six months      
583,5.0,                       looks as expected  works as expected     
584,5.0,                       seems ok

587,5.0,                       hard to mess up batteries  they worked great  used in an electric air pump to inflate mattress s for camping  we ve filled up    mattresses and the batteries are still going  highly recommend      
588,1.0,                       great price  but they dont last long      
589,5.0,                       work just like duracell     
590,4.0,                       batteries hold up to name brand ones      
591,1.0,                       these did not seem to last long in a portable fan for my camper  my recommendation is to buy a more trusted brand then the amazon brand      
592,5.0,                       i go through batteries often having lots of flameless candles in my home  i believe that amazon batteries  i ve purchased aa  aaa    d  are just as good as duracell or energizer  can t beat the price per battery      
593,5.0,                       good quality packaging and product looks solid and best price for the same product     
594,5.0,                       put these in my baby swing and very powerful      
595,1.0,                       not worth the couple    you savefrom buying store brand  shelf life was maybe a year  had to throw them all away because none of them worked anymore  i will not be buying amazon brand again      
596,5.0,                       you can t miss by buying these batteries  they are great  i ve had them in a battery operated garland for the entire holiday and they re still running strong  the price you can t beat  worth every penny      
597,1.0,                       i had previously ordered batteries after hurricane maria and they worked so well  the leftover ones did not work anymore so i ordered these ones as replacements for me and my sisters  not one of them works  no juice   the process to return them from pr us not user friendly and costly  will not but again  more than    dollars wasted      
598,1.0,                       i used these in my baby swing  it was very easy to tell the quality in something we use so much i first used duracell  and the batteries lasted about a month  maybe a little over   i tried these  and i was lucky to get a weeks use out of them  usually about   days  very disappointing  after the pack was gone  i told my husband to pick up more duracell batteries on his way home from work      weeks ago    and they are still going strong if you re using a lot of juice  don t bother with the amazon ones      
599,5.0,                       seams to work for a long time on the fuel transfer pump     
600,4.0,                       value for the money and it s wonderful for the flashlights     
601,5.0,                       amazon batteries  no idea how these stack up against duracell or energizer  someone should do an experiment  i suspect they are not a great but i will keep on buying these   very happy      
602,1.0,                       these started going bad in a hurry  the most popular brand lasts us    times longer in our office building paper towel dispensers  never again

605,5.0,                       great price for a quality product   haven t had the batteries that long  but after reading the reviews i knew i would be happy with my purchase   nice to know when you see the name amazonbasics you can count on the quality plus a great price   bought amazon led light bulbs  again  quality you can trust      
606,5.0,                       these seem great  i use them in my sons chair that he plays in daily  haven t had to change one     
607,5.0,                       you can t go wrong  these things work just as good as the others for way less     
608,1.0,                       they don t last  the battery life is very short  not reliable

620,4.0,                       can t beat the price for these size batteries for this cheap  they work and get the job done  i can t speak to the longevity because they ve only been in for about a week  but again  can t beat the price

624,5.0,                       great value  great product   highly recommend      
625,2.0,                       purchased for electronic rodent trap but not enough power to kill rodents   maybe good for an old style flashlight      
626,4.0,                       based on my completely unscientific analysis they seemed to last slightly less longer than eveready i was using for the exact same equipment  based on the cost difference it worked out to be roughly the same  so my conclusion is they work  but no real savings     
627,5.0,                       i bought these batteries for the outside net lights i put on the bushes for christmas   i saw they were cheaper than duracell or energizer and had good ratings  so i gave them a try   i installed them in the lights and put the lights out on my bushes a week after thanksgiving   winters in the upper midwest get cold  but these batteries kept the lights going brightly every night for   hours  for a month and still have juice in them   i removed them from the lights and packed them away until next christmas   i did not check them with a meter  so i don t know how much juice is in them  but i m impressed they were able to power on in the extra cold weather we had this year      
628,5.0,                       best value for your money     
629,2.0,                       liked the price but lacks longevity   used in a high lumen led light and only lasted perhaps     as the  high price  ones      
630,5.0,                       good price

635,5.0,                       affordable     
636,4.0,                       the quality of this batteries is pretty good specially for the price  they have a nice weight to them and have not leaked on any of my devices  their only weakness is that they don t seem to hold for a while as i noticed that the longer i have them the more they are loosing their strength  if you use them right away you will have the best results      
637,5.0,                       their batteries that work oh  so far so good     
638,5.0,                       does what it should      
639,3.0,                       as batteries go  these are okay  they work well in everything that i use them in  but they don t have the long shelf life of the more mainstream batteries  after about a year on the shelf  i ve found the amazonbasics batteries are typically worthless many knock off brand batteries are    v instead of the typical    v  these aren t like that  these are    v i will keep buying these as i need them      
640,5.0,                       everlasting batteries     
641,1.0,                       batteries die very quickly  just pay the extra for energizer  i ll go thru these   before i d go thru   energizer      
642,3.0,                       duracells last    year or a complete season in my  d maglite used in my rv occasionally those only   month  just put in a second set and will see my confidence level for these batteries is now very low they behave more like zinc coal instead alkaline may be amazon got tricked by chinese suppliers

659,5.0,                       so far so good    d power  but a  rating     
660,5.0,                       i needed multiple batteries to run mole sound deterents in the garden   they seem to be working fine grateful for the battery pack i was able to purchase from you      
661,5.0,                       we used these in our babies swing every day  they lasted for over   months  great batteries      
662,1.0,                       junk   i bought these for a canada fishing trip to use for the minnow aerators   normal copper top batteries will run for about    hours and i will not have to worry about the minnows dying from lack of oxygen   these pos s did not even last    hours and i had lots of dead minnows   do not use  purchase these if you need the batteries to last for any extended period of time      
663,5.0,                       lots of batteries for a great price     
664,5.0,                       these batteries have been a good option for us   i have not done a side by side comparison test where i d leave a flashlight on until batteries run out   however  i can say i have not noticed any reduction in the frequency of needing to change the batteries over name brand   they have saved me money  seem of excellent quality and i am pleased with them   they work and amazon batteries get the job done for less money   very pleased      
665,2.0,                       i purchased these for work   i was told by our staff that all of the amazon batteries that i have purchased have been bad   they don t last long at all   i tried to save the company money by buying the generic brand  but it totally backfired on me this time   i wish i had known about the issue before it was too late to return      
666,1.0,                       these were the worst   i always buy my batteries from amazon but these lasted less than two weeks  i think i got a bad batch      
667,5.0,                       as pictured and described     
668,5.0,                       i buy a lot of the amazon basic batteries and they seem to be good value for the money      
669,5.0,                       amazon got these to me so quickly   i was concerned that i hadn t been able to find batteries for my flashlights in advance of an approaching hurricane   fortunately  i didn t need them after all   it is so easy to get things from amazon   i thanks to everyone there who makes it work so well      
670,1.0,                       you get what you pay for and these have a very short lifespan compared to duracell or even other brands  their aas are the same way  avoid this brand unless you like changing batteries often      
671,5.0,                       while i prefer rayovac  these work surprisingly well   arrived in cardboard box  no fancy packaging which is fine as far as my family is concerned   batteries tested out and all work   this is the first time i ve tried them   so far  so good      
672,5.0,                       we go through batteries quickly at my house  remotes  kids toys  adult toys  smoke detectors  etc  i have tried the expensive batteries  but we seem to use them up just as fast  using these batteries seem to be the best value for my money  never had a problem with them      
673,5.0,                       priced right     
674,5.0,                       great price compared to the store bought      
675,5.0,                       good     
676,4.0,                       i have used these batteries in a mag lite flashlight   they re still working   i m currently using them in my motion detecting trashcan  i ve had to replace them before   months passed but the   that are in it now are still going  however the motion sensor stopped working about a week ago   the only thing i can attribute it to is the batteries  when i first installed a set the trashcan wouldn t open on it s own  after rearranging the batteries it started working this was day one mind you  now here we are months later   the can will not open via sensing any motion  it will only work if i use the open   close buttons  until i try another brand to see if it will work these batteries are the only constant in prior sensor issues as well as the current issues i will continue to believe it could be the batteries  i will change this review if another set of batteries made by another company doesn t change the current status of my trashcan lid      
677,5.0,                       i love amazons batteries  i have them in monthly subscriptions so i am never forgetting which battery needs picked up and thats if i remember to add them to shopping list      
678,5.0,                       i don t even bother shopping locally for batteries any more since these are so economical and convenient      
679,5.0,                       welp  never thought i would say this because i have always been a durracel battery girl but amazon batteries are the best batteries i have ever bought   no leaking  they last so much longer than other batteries  like weeks longer   im honestly shocked at how good these are   buy them  try them and you will see the battery life is much longer   my luminara candles that go   hours a day automatically still have the original amazon batteries in them now for the past   months   i have some other candles that go   hours on    off and they just quit after   months   i never seen batteries last like this since the      s before crap was being made in china   you will love these batteries  i promise      
680,5.0,                       must have on hand     
681,5.0,                       these batteries appear to last as well as my past use of duracell   they may be a bit different in duration  but not that noticeable to me      
682,5.0,                       great value     
683,5.0,                       great product and reasonably priced     
684,5.0,                                                                                                        i     
685,4.0,                       good value batteries   i usually grab my batteries from costco  but even though costco is just about a mile away from my house  i hate the crowd in the parking lot and the crowds and lines inside   so  i opted to just buy these with my prime membership and had it on my porch the next day or so   they look  feel  and work like regular d batteries   i haven t noticed the difference in this brand compared to any other brand   i really like the packaging   it was a lot easier to open   the box holds the batteries well and can be used to keep the batteries in it until they are all gone   not like the plastic  sharp  hard to open plastic that many batteries come in and that you have to throw away i can t attest to the amount of power or how long it lasts for   i don t have anything to compare it to nor do i feel like wasting time and money trying to figure it out   if it is noticeably less or more  then i ll say so   other than that  i would buy these again because of the convenience of receiving it as well as the nice box the batteries can stay stored in      
686,3.0,                       i use them for my   cell led flashlight i use for outdoors working at night  doesn t last very long     
687,5.0,                       works great for me       
688,5.0,                       works as expected and great price

691,5.0,                       great product      
692,4.0,                       they re batteries  they got my maglite working      
693,5.0,                       great batteries  i used a set of   for my automatic garbage can and the batteries last for a little over a year      
694,5.0,                       both of my boat live wells hold   d cells  both wells are identical  i put copper tops in one and these amazon batteries in the other  the wells always turned on and off at the same time  normally my copper tops last     trips  this amazon batteries lasted about    minutes longer than the cooper tops  i then rotated the batteries in the wells  and the same with amazon batteries last about    minutes longer in the other live well  considering the price of copper tops will be using amazon batteries in the future  i use other types of batteries in my home remotes etc   and i had always thought they lasted longer  this was the real test      
695,1.0,                       i put these batteries in the core lantern i bought  i used the lantern two times and the batteries leaked and ruined the lantern  not i good product      
696,5.0,                       i always purchase amazon batteries  love the price and longevity      
697,5.0,                       best price i have found      
698,5.0,                       great value for the amount      
699,5.0,                       excellent product for lower price     
700,5.0,                       you can never have enough batteries  because in an emergency they could make the difference between safety and a seriously bad stubbed toe      
701,2.0,                       these batteries are inexpensive for a reason  they don t last  i have battery powered flameless candles that usually stay lit at least a couple of months when using name brand batteries  these didn t even last two weeks  you get what you pay for  buy a name brand      
702,1.0,                       these batteries have no life in them  we normally use duracell in our christmas decorations and they last the whole season  we ve had to replace the amazon basics d cells we used this year   times   definitely not a good value when you use   times as many to do the same job      
703,1.0,                       i don t know if the manufacturer making these was switched  but these amazon basic d cell batteries lasted only one day on a nation sensor  previous purchases lasted over   weeks  very disappointing to be sure   spend more on better batteries     
704,5.0,                       who isn t always looking for batteries    we bought this big pack and have just about all of them in use already this is a great price and i do recommend getting them   now before you need them      
705,5.0,                       they re batteries  they work and they re priced well  what else can be said      
706,4.0,                       they work so far   put these in some mr beams outside wireless     lumen lights   we ll see how they last   i put another brand in the other lights   we ll see which last longest since they come on and go off at the same time      
707,2.0,                       after the first six i tested barely made the flashlight emit a dull orange glow and go out completely i threw them all in the trash  my batch was worthless      
708,4.0,                       battery s fine     
709,5.0,                       low output good for remotes but not so good for rx cars and higher output devices     
710,5.0,                       great value     
711,3.0,                       update   nd box on last of the  nd box           our lanterns are appearing to die more quickly with this last box purchased these get my vote  these are just as good as the  rabbit  or  copper  batteries  we are using these in our lanterns      
712,2.0,                       the hold up fine  but they ate slightly larger than brand name batteries  the positive side is a bit longer than on other batteries  this is not as problem for man devices  but at least on one device i have  it is  the batteries go on fine  but are very difficult to remove  i need a screwdriver to pry the first one out      
713,5.0,                       these stay on the shelf for long periods of time and have never had an issue with a dead battery right away  great for parents with kids      
714,3.0,                       won t last as long as name brand      
715,5.0,                       ordered these batteries for our family in puerto rico  got there in good condition just took some time to get there

719,2.0,                       left in hawaii so i have no idea how they held up     
720,5.0,                       who knew amazon made batteries  placed them in an outdoor motion detector through rain and snow and they still doing the job      
721,5.0,                       still the best value there is  and we ve had good success with the longevity of the batteries      
722,5.0,                       great value

725,1.0,                       bought five different types of batteries and the d  c  and  volt did not have the full five year shelf life remaining   that s the problem   paid for five years and didn t get it   also the comparison of batteries compared your batteries with all the ten year shelf life batteries    not a true comparison at all    in fact misleading    like comparing a five year old car to a ten year old car    bad product comparison and not what was paid for   wasn t worth it to have to pay shipping to return batteries in order to get an exchange  unhappy      
726,1.0,                       battery life was subpar i used them for my ring pathlights with moderate settings lasted   weeks

729,5.0,                       i use these  to me they are economical  expensive ones may last longer but i do not see much difference as you have make sure batteries do not just set in the unit and go bad  for a number of reason i am comfortable buying this brand

734,4.0,                       good value     
735,4.0,                       several of the batteries  the positive pin is slightly longer  this made it difficult to get in battery boxes where it is very tight  all batteries have lasted as long as other brands in a high drain portable fan

752,2.0,                       they work  but they don t last long at all   it is surprising how fast these burn out no matter where i used them

763,5.0,                       good quality batteries   the power output and longevity of these batteries in my equipment seem comparable to the rayovac and duracell alkaline cells i use  and i haven t had a single rupture or leak   out all the cells i ve used so far  every one performed well  without a single dud   for the money  i think these are the best d cells out there   and i ve tried a lot   here s my results of real world usage  most favorite  to least favorite  amazonbasics   good power output  average longevity  consistently low price rayovac   good power output  great longevity  varied price  i find good deals every few weeks    never seem to leak ikea   average power output  flickers a little   fair longevity  usually the lowest price maxell   good power output  great longevity  good price  but one in every few dozen eventually leaks duracell   good power output  great longevity  varied price  but one in every few dozen eventually leaks sunbeam   average power output  fair longevity  consistently low price  but prone to leakage energizer   inconsistent power output  some flicker a lot  some don t   average longevity  can be expensive  and seem very prone to leakage as such  i now use the amazonbasics in all of my everyday use d cell flashlights  lanterns  and motion sensors   i save the rayovacs for stuff i keep in storage  and in my emergency kits   i m currently storing a few amazonbasics to test them for leakage  and   thus far   i haven t had a single one leak   i ll update my review  as i use them further      
764,3.0,                       this was super easy to put up and will be easy to change the batteries   i wish the light covered more space   i might have just chosen the wrong model   still happy i bought it      
765,5.0,                       was delivered as promised  no problems      
766,5.0,                       performance equal to or exceeding the performance of the more expensive batteries      
767,5.0,                       i buy dozens a year  use them all the time they are as good as duracell or better  cheaper i use them in artificial candles   they last for months a good purchase

769,2.0,                       these batteries do not last long cheap batteries     
770,5.0,                       i wanted to try these out bc they had such good reviews  will have to check back and tell you how the longevity is bc i just bought them the first of the month      
771,4.0,                       it looks like it s about a battery case too and filled it up     
772,3.0,                       formfactor slightly off  batteries are slightly larger than standard cause an issue if you stack more than two in series     
773,5.0,                       after reading reviews i decided to try these  been using duracell energizer but they don t seem to last as long as they used too i am    so i know how long batteries used to last in the good old days   how they have changed  i use the removal panels instead of flashlite everyday and it takes   size d   all i can say right now is that all   panels have nice bright lights w amazon d s  if these work out well   i will be back to purchase more   i have   other lanterns  and in different sizes

780,5.0,                       great pricing on quality bulk consumable item and very fast shipping as expected from amazon      
781,5.0,                       amazonbasics batteries are great performing and at great price compared to the other major brands   i highly recommend switching to amazonbasics for all battery needs      
782,5.0,                       back up box of batteries are great to have when needed  affordable unlike some places

786,4.0,                       this is a great value for batteries  i haven t had any problems with these at all      
787,1.0,                       i was super excited when i saw the price for    batteries so i ordered more than i needed it s disappointing to say these batteries does not last long  it also rust easily i bought it for my portable lamp  which i used as a night light sometimes  the battery only lasted for   week waste of money in my opinion to sum it up      
788,1.0,                       do not last  honestly almost every other brand of battery has outlasted these  even eveready    every size battery i ve used from amazon has been a huge disappointment  do not buy      
789,5.0,                       don t know how long this amazon batteries last  i just purchase them for the first time  hopefully they last and sorry i forgot to add our building    but the mailman found me   yay

797,5.0,                       everything     
798,1.0,                       i thought that since these batteries had the amazon logo  they would be of excellent quality or at worst  regular  but no  they are very  very bad  they did not last a week in the best scenario that was in a led flashlight  i do not recommend them     
799,5.0,                       i have   motion lights in my house that use these batteries price   quality are good      
800,4.0,                       good  don t last as long as regular brand name batteries  but they do the job     
801,4.0,                       great value compared to competition  just don t know how long they will last  but emergency light has plenty of shine with these batteries in place and i like cardboard box making it easy to access and not mess around with cheap plastic blister pack that lets batteries fall out after being opened      
802,5.0,                       first time i ve purchased this brand and purchased for my new motion light from amazon  will have to see what the longevity is with a motion light turn off and on  the price was good      
803,1.0,                       used these in a battery powered trash can  did not last as long as with conventional batteries  very disappointing

810,5.0,                       got to have them for the flashlight to work      
811,1.0,                       was buying because they are cheap   but since they are made in china i will never buy again   back to duracell or a battery made in any other country but china      
812,1.0,                       haven t got to use them yet  good for emergency stock

820,5.0,                       no motion detection     
821,5.0,                       these last longer than name brand      
822,5.0,                       just like the name brand but a little cheaper      
823,5.0,                       there batteries that work      
824,4.0,                       work well  not quite the longevity of some of its competitors  but a great value none the less      
825,1.0,                       amazon has decided to not publish the capacity of these batteries and there is no indication anywhere on the packaging  without any information on the mah i can t calculate the battery lifetime for my project  ended up using these as test batteries but i would never trust anything to a battery whose manufacturer was hiding the true capacity  weird      
826,5.0,                       we only but amazon batteries  i ve told my husband as they work as well as other brands but you get more bang for the buck      
827,5.0,                       seem to work well in the application we are using them     
828,5.0,                       not bad and very affordable   have it on my subscribe and save     have batt operated fan that my family of   uses during pkwer outages   these batt really come in handy     
829,5.0,                       i ll stick to duracell     
830,5.0,                       amazon batteries work just as if not better than any other batteries i ve ever bought but at a much cheaper price      
831,4.0,                       work well and seem to last as long as name brands in my lanterns     
832,5.0,                       just as expected     
833,2.0,                       bought these for our baby swing but they did not last even close to as long as the duracell batteries did  worked fine  just for a shorter amount of time  you definitely get what you pay for when it comes to batteries  so i recommend sticking with the name brands like duracell or energizer as opposed to these batteries      
834,1.0,                       since my power went out yesterday  i figured it would be good to buy a battery powered fan just in case it happens again  none of the batteries worked the fan  plugging it in  works fine      
835,4.0,                       i hate the packaging on the amazon batteries so much that i have decided to go with another brand until the packaging changes  there is no need to package the batteries up in plastic wrap that is difficult to remove and then put them inside a tightly fit box  just do away with the plastic already      
836,1.0,                       i am not at all impressed with these   i have battery oporated candle that come on every day for   hours on a timer   when i use duracell i change them every   to   months   these lasted not even   months      
837,5.0,                       batteries work great and are lasting  i love that when you order a product  you re given the option to have the correct size batteries that actually last added on to your order just like that      
838,5.0,                       i used these primarily for a couple of maglite flashlights i use for nightly dog walks   these seem to last as long as big name batteries and for the price is a terrific deal   amazon basic batteries of any size are a good deal  and i m a repeated purchaser      
839,5.0,                       with kids  we go through batteries like crazy  these last just as long as any  name brand  batteries i have used and they re cheaper  i m a huge fan and recommend them to friends and family often      
840,5.0,                       good product  not a knock off or cheap battery      
841,5.0,                       my wife goes through quite a few of these with her back massaging pillow   good value      
842,5.0,                       can t beat the price     
843,5.0,                       very good to have     
844,2.0,                       i am slightly disappointed in the fact that i was using these batteries for a circuit lab for my classroom science activity and the batteries were very weak as if they were old  i had to go to wal mart and by some durcell batteries to continue with the lesson  i m not sure how long these batteries were sitting in a wearhouse but they were pretty useless      
845,5.0,                       great quality and value switched to buying this brand      
846,5.0,                       thanks amazon for saving us money on batteries  nice substitution for energizer     
847,5.0,                       seems like really good value batteries  i m going to update how long this actually last and if they are really alkaline batteries update  battery do lasts really long and i would put it in the same category as name brand alkaline batteries like energizer and etc       
848,5.0,                       good batteries  as good as any of the popular brands espec  since it must be one of the major battery manuf  are making these too  price is right      
849,5.0,                       good price  seem to hold a charge and deliver on performance  ive tried all battery sizes   v  aaa  aa  c  and d  used for flashlights and radios for power outages  our last power outage was   days  price is right to buy in bulk      
850,5.0,                       i use this in my babys rock and play and it is set in vibrate all day long for days and still works very well     
851,5.0,                       no issues with these batteries  seem to last a long time  and they arrive in pristine condition      
852,1.0,                       amazon brand batteries are bad   they don t last  i don t understand why other people give them good reviews   do not buy   it is a waste of money      
853,5.0,                       love the price of these   they work as well as name brand   would highly recommend      
854,5.0,                       great batteries at a great price     
855,5.0,                       nice quality     
856,5.0,                       we have countless battery operated devices around the house  so we go through batteries like they re going out of style  i ve always used the big name brands and obviously they are never cheap  even on sale  i d never tried these  but i buy basically everything on amazon  so figured why not batteries   considering they re at least     cheaper than the lowest known brand  even if they didn t last quite as long it s worth it   after using them in half a dozen different devices  it turns out they last as long as popular brand batteries  they way they re packaged makes them so easy to organize and store   now i have them in aaa  aa and d   it s the only brand i ll buy      
857,5.0,                       there still somewhat new but seem to be doing good so far     
858,5.0,                       showed up  and i m sure ama zonian borg is doing his best to put the battery sector out of business regarding branding      
859,5.0,                       great value      
860,1.0,                       i never wrote a review before  these batteries are so bad i felt i needed to warn others  they do not last  i put them in a flamelss candle that duracell powered on a timer for more than six months  on the same sceheulde i get about a week from these batteries  bad      
861,5.0,                       batteries were great last a long time     
862,5.0,                       nice product     
863,3.0,                       batteries appeared to die a bit faster than competitor brands  probably would just pay the extra couple bucks and buy the name brands from somewhere else      
864,5.0,                       amazon s batteries have always been wonderful for me  and the price can t be beat   they are always my go to choice now      
865,5.0,                       these batteries have lasted longer in my babies various toys than the duracell ones i bought at wal mart  i also love the box the batteries come in  it makes for easy storage      
866,2.0,                       i bought   packs of these     total batteries  which are packed in groups of        of the batteries one box were leaking inside the shrink wrap when received and needed to be thrown away the ones that were good seemed to be operating with decent longevity   i don t trust the shelf life of these at all      
867,5.0,                       work great  great value      
868,5.0,                       not quite as long lasting as the top two brands  but a much lower price  they are a good  price to value combination      
869,5.0,                       they dont sell d batteries at department stores anymore i guess  had to order them here so i could carry around my boombox without it being plugged in catch me in the streets  blasting power to the peeps     
870,5.0,                       a      
871,5.0,                       i used these batteries to power a motion activated light at the corner of my house and over my garage  i installed the light and the first set of batteries in april       i live in a climate with intense summer heat  in the hundreds  and cold winters  freezing temperatures during   months   the lamps and their batteries worked a lot  cats  squirrels  mailman  guests and us  the lasted until december        they still work but they are at the end of their lifespan   they are great value for the money      
872,5.0,                       emergency flashlight     
873,5.0,                       came fast last long  thanks     
874,5.0,                       have had good luck with the amazon batteries     
875,5.0,                       i just love amazon basics line      this line has great priced  durable items   i now will only buy these batteries as they work perfect and are so affordable   my family of five with three kids go through batteries fast and i needed a solution and amazon saved me   i now have a batteries box for the family whenever they needed batteries there are plenty   the packaging was perfect too  just the right size and easy to open   no more difficult plastic packages u would have to have a box cutter for anymore        
876,5.0,                       does the same job only with a lower price      
877,5.0,                       good price     
878,5.0,                       i purchased these batteries for my outdoor motion sensor lights because they were an excellent price and so far they have held up very well  will definitely be repurchasing them again when necessary      
879,5.0,                       didn t last very long      
880,5.0,                       great buy thinking that buying in bulk is a better deal      
881,5.0,                       i like that my  battery fan is faster than when i bought it  so they must be real good     
882,5.0,                       i like them as well as the top brand n hell of a lot less expensive     
883,1.0,                       any parent of a toddler goes through an insane amount of batteries   we thought amazon batteries would be a great alternative to more expensive name brands   unfortunately  amazon batteries die twice as fast as name brand batteries  if not faster   not only making them more expensive but producing twice the waste and recycling   hope amazon gets its act together   until then  we will stick with duracell or energizer        
884,1.0,                       cheap batteries have no life   i used these for three window lights   two batteries for each candle  one failure in a week       
885,5.0,                       great value comparing to supermarket     
886,5.0,                       works fine     
887,5.0,                       i bought a bunch of battery operated  timed lights for christmas   many of them required d batteries  so i purchased these batteries   i had the lights set to turn on for    hours at night  then off for    hours during the day   these batteries lasted almost exactly one month   from thanksgiving until just after christmas   i definitely think i got my money s worth      
888,2.0,                       i assumed they were made in the usa   i assumed wrong they are manufactured in china       
889,5.0,                       great quality     
890,5.0,                       great batteries for the price      
891,5.0,                       great value     
892,5.0,                       excelente     
893,4.0,                       what can i say  they are batteries       
894,5.0,                       great product     
895,2.0,                       suitable for demonstration only   these batteries don t perform well in high drain situations  like running a fan  when comparing to higher quality batteries  like duracell  energizer  or rayovac   it actually costs less and lasts longer to buy an   pack of better batteries than the     pack of basics      
896,5.0,                       they work      
897,5.0,                       the price is great at about    per battery for d alkaline batteries  they r delivered to u which is so convenient  i used them w my nordic trac screen  and they work really well  i highly recommend      
898,2.0,                       poor instruction book  difficult to assemble  does not work like the tv commercial  considering return as always  amazon ordering  shipping  delivery  experience was great      
899,5.0,                       best bang for your buck      
900,5.0,                       these things are amazing  i installed them in december of      and they re still working perfectly  i haven t even had to change the batteries  i d recommend them in a heartbeat      
901,5.0,                       premium product at a fair price         
902,3.0,                       they do not hold a charge long enough in cold weather  i m told this is a function of an alkaline battery in general but that s not my fault  amazon or someone needs to come up with solution to that problem      
903,5.0,                       great value   don t know how long they last yet  but they work great so far     
904,1.0,                       put inside lighted christmas garland on my fireplace mantle  a week later the garland didn t light up  opened the battery box and a liquid poured out  i immediately washed my hands but i got a battery acid burn on my arm from it splashing  attached picture shows the moisture on the bottom of the battery wrapping  ruined a     garland and gave me a chemical burn  i will never buy amazon branded batteries again      
905,1.0,                       very short lived  only lasted   days      
906,4.0,                       i can t give them   stars only for the fact i just received them   time will tell if they deserve   starts or not  yet price alone is more than worth the   star rating      
907,5.0,                       they are d cell batteries that arrived in a nice box that you can use to store them  unlike those weird molded plastic packages that takes an act of god to get into and then is impossible to stack or store anywhere  i have bought quite a few amazonbasics products so far and i have to say i m loving amazon basics so far      
908,5.0,                       as a new mom with lots of battery operated toys i was looking for a quality battery at an affordable cost  the quality on the amazon batteries is great while being cost effective  that combined with   day shipping i only buy my batteries online now      
909,5.0,                       convenient     
910,5.0,                       just as good as any               
911,4.0,                       good to have enough batteries a round the house when necessary      
912,5.0,                       work just as well as name brand      
913,5.0,                       need these for  camping lamps works good very good batteries may order more later thank you     
914,5.0,                       good     
915,5.0,                       competitively priced  timely delivery  packaged well  excellent quality and a great fit      
916,1.0,                       i tried these a second time thinking the first pair was a bad batch  these are terrible  amazon should really stop selling these  period  they last for maybe about     of the time of the industrial duracells      
917,5.0,                       cheaper than the top name brands but same effectiveness      
918,5.0,                       use them daily     
919,5.0,                       nice     
920,5.0,                       these batteries work well  even as  basic  they hold up well      
921,1.0,                       i did not need to use these batteries right away   about six weeks later i needed one only to discover all  were dead   right out of the box and never used   to add insult to injury   when i looked into returning them for a refund i found that  the return window was closed   great  i would say the few bucks you save on amazon brand batteries is a bad decision      
922,1.0,                       these batteries were awful  i bought these to take camping to blow up two very small air mattresses twin to be exact and had to use all twelve just to fill them  i could have used dollar store batteries and spent way less than almost         these are junk don t buy them save your money         
923,5.0,                       i decided to get amazon batteries and give them a try because of how many you get for the price almost every toy my grandsons got for the holidays needed batteries  i got every size and they work great  they last for an extremely long time      
924,5.0,                       batteries do battery things     
925,5.0,                       aok     
926,5.0,                       just installed      
927,1.0,                       not the correct ones     
928,5.0,                       i hate the price of good batteries and these work just as good      
929,5.0,                       this is the way to purchase batteries      
930,5.0,                       i got these batteries for my baby s rocker  they work just as well as duracell but for a better price      
931,5.0,                       i m sure they work well enough gave them as part of a gift so again im not sure yet

934,5.0,                       nothing to dislike   these batteries are used on a regular basis in my household with greg results  thank you      
935,4.0,                       when i first got them they didn t work  then i realized it s because it was so cold outside  after they warmed up they have worked just like batteries should

939,5.0,                       used to buy  dollar store  as i thought i was saving money  but they don t last and tend to leak  bought a bundle price and saved money and know i can trust amazon batteries to last
