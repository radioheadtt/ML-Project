0,2.0,                       bought these shirts for my husband and son   on initial try on they were a little shorter than they like but could handle it for the price   after first washing the shirts exposed belly buttons   they are also not the greatest cotton and are a bit scratchy   will not be purcshasing again         
1,5.0,                       arrived on time  nice t shirt material  washed well  fits the way i like  not slim fit  i like that the bands at the wrist don t stretch out   get loose when i pull them up my arm  bottom of shirt falls below my butt   that s what i wanted  also  bought these in gray  i ll be buying more  definitely recommend      
2,3.0,                       the red shirt as pictured was a nice  soothing  deep red  what arrived was this electric  horribly bright  safety red  luckily i plan on wearing it under another tshirt and only to the gym  you could never wear this by itself anywhere without blinding people      
3,4.0,                       the quality of the material is very good and thicker than most thin t shirts   it s sized correctly   i m        lbs with a     chest and a     waist   the shoulder seams are appropriate  the chest area fits well  and the waist isn t too baggy or tight   we ll see how that remains after the first and second washing   the color is a nice blue  as well   overall i m very pleased with a quality  good deal      
4,4.0,                       it should have been made without     tags that could stick up past the collar dressing in a hurry  who wants the fashion police tucking in a tag  let alone that it s so uncomfy  a simple loop to serve the end user rather than a useless tag  in order to be made to hang on a clothesline without leaving those brown dimples from the clothespins  add your logo to the loop  i cut off all your tags about    seconds after opening the package anyways  all that s left are black remnants of where your tag once was so why not rethink this waste time on everyone part and be the trend setter  i m giving you the most innovative solution for the   rst century  free of charge   why look like a nutty professor if you don t need to  that s my job sincerely the nutty professor     
5,2.0,                       this is one of those  you get what you pay for situations it seems  the material and thickness of the shirt feels stiff and cheap  the sewing at the cuff is very rough looking and uneven  i will keep them  but it will be more of an around the house type shirt instead of a long sleeve t shirt to throw on to go run errands or hang out with people      
6,5.0,                       i ordered xl ad it fits a little lose  but with cotton  i am sure it will fit nice after washing  i love to wear with just a cardigan sweater  i like this so much i ordered   in black also  excellent quality for the price      
7,3.0,                       the shirts are very good  but i caution anyone who is not  model slim  to buy at least one size larger than usual  they shrink after washing  which is fine  perhaps i missed it in the description  but  if you read reviews slower closer than descriptions  hopefully this helps      
8,5.0,                       this product is extremely well made and long lasting so don t let the great price fool you  i have purchased other gildan products before such as underwear and socks with great results  i plan to purchase more of these for the men in my household  as always  these shirts are      cotton so follow the washing instructions to avoid shrinkage      
9,4.0,                       we ve bought several of these  they re as thick thin as a regular cotton shirt so it s good for layering  one out of   did tear at the armpit after only one use but they were very cheap when we bought them and my husband still loves them     
10,5.0,                       bought these for grandpa  he s a creature of habit and always goes to the same place and buys his thermal shirts for     each  out of convince i ordered them and sugested he just try them  he ended up liking them so much i ordered   more in different colors      
11,1.0,                       i have always liked gildan t shirts  so i purchased these long sleeved tshirts to enjoy during the winter  i bought   two piece sets  only to find out they were extremely harsh  so i washed them and added fabric softener hoping this would make them feel better  i repeated the process twice  but the t shirts never turned soft  they are as harsh and rough as cardboard  returning them is not an option at this point  after multiple washes  so all i can write a review to let others know what they can expect  i definitely do not recommend these t shirts at all      
12,5.0,                       these shirts are a nice fabric weight and well made   i was going to order more but didn t find them in any other color   getting   shirts for the price we did was amazing   these are worn for work and around the house   he particularly likes having a tag      
13,1.0,                       bought as undershirts to wear at work  didn t want to spend a ton on thermals because i live in a desert where it gets cold but nothing unbearable  i ve been wearing these for a few weeks and it seems no matter how much fabric softener i soak these in  they come out unbearably scratchy  i got an armpit rash from one of these this week so finally bit the bullet and went to target to buy regular long sleeves for  x the price  also for some reason the stiching around the cuffs of the sleeves are super tight and need to be stretched every time you wear them      
14,5.0,                       when i ordered these  it only came with one shirt  i acknowledge i am partially to blame for my predicament because i could have complained when i received it  but procrastinated until i forgot i have no complaints about the quality of the shirt  as many of the other reviewers have noted  it is good quality  it is thicker  with cuffed sleeves and a loose waist  i honestly think i like this long sleeve more than my others  and am gonna buy again and hopefully get both shirts this time  edit  i am increasing my rating to   starts  because i received the proper amount of shirts this time      
15,4.0,                       always a bit heavier in fabric weight compared to other brands  bottom hem does roll up once out of the dryer  so  straighten it out right away and hang up on a clothes hanger  no pillling as of yet but will update review if i run into issues normally found in short staple cotton      
16,1.0,                       not so good quality     
17,5.0,                       i love these turtle neck shirts  fabric is soft and cozy  wear then beneath sweaters  sweat shirts or just wear them  you can t go wrong buying these  i bought black  red  royal blue and powder blue  i will give each one a   star rating and a title but i don t know what else to say about them  buy yours today  winter is coming soon and you don t want to miss out      
18,5.0,                       so i m a chick but i love these shirts  i m     so finding shirts that fit my torso can be difficult  well that s why i turn to these types of shirts  i love them they fit my chest perfectly  torso  and arm length is perfect  i ve already ordered more  so i m pleased      
19,5.0,                       i bought two of these shirts and washed them in hot water and put them into the clothes dryer and they both came out almost exactly as they were before with no shrinkage  that s rare and i really appreciate it  i ordered two more today  they shirts are not light weight  they are between a normal teeshirt and a very light sweatshirt and that s perfect for me  the collar remained in shape after washing and drying and the sleeves didn t shrink up  i m not a big fan of gildan because many shirts are not      cotton but these are very good quality and well made      
20,5.0,                       i purchased the athletic grey to sleep in  good quality shirt for the money   the grey has     polyester in it with     cotton  that     polyester makes the shirt some what itchy to sleep in   the grey is ok for yard work   i purchased some more shirts of      cotton to sleep in  hope that they will be more comfortable      
21,1.0,                       the product description says these have a  roomy  fit  so i ordered my usual size of xl    they were so small and tight on me  it was like trying to fit into a medium    instead of exchanging them for an xxl  i decided to get my money back  as the cotton was the most coarse  scratchy  sandpaper like material    i couldn t imagine wearing these  even if they did fit perfectly    the material is so harsh   seriously  it s like sandpaper    don t order these       
22,3.0,                       i bought the black   pack for sleeping lounging based on      cotton   i washed these and used a little f s and gosh soo stiff      i bought some george ones at wal mart for      that are wayyy softer   and      cotton as well      
23,1.0,                       i bought   short sleeve and   long sleeve gildan t shirts  short sleeve are perfect and the long sleeve of the same size are    to    shorter  i would not recommend them      
24,5.0,                       i ordered some for my son and liked them so much i ordered two red and two royal for myself   not disappointed but thrilled they fit me and are warm enough to wear in the house without having to resort to a sweater on top in the cold house   nice material   so far i ve washed them at leas   times and they are holding up just fine   highly recommend for women or men         
25,5.0,                       this is a good product at a good price  the fabric is heavier than a refular t shirt and exceeded my expectation  the feel is very slightly on the stiff side more than soft  but not uncomfortably so  good cotton feel rather than unpleasant synthetic  sleeves are a good length and not too short  great color for safety      
26,4.0,                       shrinks an entire size  i m a medium  shrinks to a small after wash   dry  after first use just fyi  i buy these regularly as i m a welder and have to wear long sleeve shirts year round  they withstand a good amount of sparks before needing replaced  good shirts for the        
27,5.0,                       a perfect t shirtnot too thin  not too thick  great material  great fit  has extra length on bottom  really nice collar  cuffs  and sleeves  perfect  i will be buying them as long as they are available   great price too  extremely satisfied customer     
28,4.0,                       gildan makes a long sleeve shirt that is middle of the road in terms of quality  the material is a little bit thin and the sleeve cuffs are a bit too loose and mismatched in tightness on the left and right  the tag is extremely annoying but it comes off easily  i ordered an xl and it arrived too large in the waist  but it actually shrunk after washing and the overall fit is good  i was surprised to find that the color doesn t fade too bad after going through the washer and dryer  very impressive for a    shirt while the shirt quality could be better  its not bad  so i have to give the shirt   stars because a plain  solid color shirt is impossible to find anywhere but online  i will buy more in the future      
29,4.0,                       i like wearing long sleeves here in san francisco and i needed to switch sizes down to a medium from large due to weight loss   i am    lbs        so i ordered a medium and it they fit me well   i was not really sure what size to get but medium works  now i know      
30,1.0,                       i bought these because i needed some cheap long sleeve shirts  well it was wasted money   i am   foot      lbs and the xl barely fit over my head  the sleeves were about half an inch too short  and the bottom of the shirt sit at belt line   i am not sure where they get their sizing but i am going to guess its from       year olds     
31,5.0,                       of these shirts in different colors  they fit well and offer a great variety of good colors  we order them for school events for the different ribbon days and awareness and prevention days  and this is the perfect orange for unity day  it s a nice bright light orange and the shirt is very comfortable  it s lighter than my camera shows it s exactly as pictured on amazon      
32,5.0,                       got this for my boyfriend so i could make a donald shirt for my sons birthday  i only used one and he wears the other one regularly and loves it  seems like a nice basic shirt  he is about      and     lbs     
33,5.0,                       well made and washes with no apparent loss of color in warm water  true royal blue color  i ordered   more in navy and they are just as nice with cuffs ribbed around the wrist  can be worn alone  with a t shirt under or under a dress shirt for winter      
34,5.0,                       exactly what i wanted yet the color is different than what i expected  unless they sent me the wrong one  the  heather grey  looks more like a  navy blue   even my friend said the same thing  all in all  it fits good and will work since i bought them as an under shirt anyway      
35,1.0,                       the fabric is very coarse  ultra cotton    what a joke   i bought mens medium  i m      weigh     lbs and it s snug  washing didn t improve the emery board texture   i will never purchase a gildan product again   so  there        
36,1.0,                       these shirts are poorly made  especially for the brand  i always buy gildan tees and these suck  these are probably knockoffs        
37,5.0,                       i ordered   different colors of this shirt and have worn them all winter   they ve been washed many times and still look and fit great   they are not a heavy weight shirt but are perfect for layering   they will also be perfect for those spring days when it is not quite warm enough for a short sleeve tee      
38,5.0,                       i m using these for a tye dye craft  and i really like the quality of these shirts  their thicker then most which will hold the color better  i m super excited to use them  i washed them and not to much shrinkage at all which will make me buy these again  i really like them alot      
39,1.0,                       hole in one  not a golf shirt  literally had a small hole that looked like it would expand  sent it back      
40,1.0,                       scratchy  coarse material  ultra cotton    i definitely do not recommend these for sensitive skin  i hope a second wash with softeners will help soften these shirts a little  good soft cotton shirts are hard to find  the description of these shirts is not as advertised      
41,5.0,                       true to size and not thin at all  very good weight to the material and nice and soft and no major shrinkage after washing   the cuffs are perfect      
42,1.0,                       ordered a medium sized shirt  it fit like a small  the shirt is made of cotton  and a good buy  so  i ll keep the shirt and  give it to my brother  the shirt fit him well  thank you      
43,5.0,                       love the fit  and the nice weight of the cotton  and the cuffs on the sleeves   they don t shrink when you wash dry them   the neck doesn t stretch out either   very nice buy    i also bought the  women s fro gildan  and they don t compare well to the mens   no cuffs  too short  and the neck stretches out  i would like these  mens  in other feminine colors i bought the pink and the white ones  and would buy others if they came in feminine colors light blue  lavender  green pale yellow  etc       
44,4.0,                       unfortunately i assumed that ultra cotton meant ultra soft  it may have been that i just got shirts that were odd out of the bunch  but i ordered   and all were extremely uncomfortable to wear   super scratchy and rough on my skin in total  i ordered   set of red    set of royal    set of dark grey gray all in  xl all are too big  i m normally a  xl and i was swimming in these  my description       pounds ish  big hips  small waist  small chest  the portion of the shirt that sat on my hips   the largest part of my upper body   was too big      
45,5.0,                       my husband had a stroke two years ago so i ordered these shirts a size larger than needed so they are easier to get on and off  the fabric is sturdy and the sleeves have lots of room in the underarm area  they arrived before the expected date and in good shape  the only problem is the cuffs are a bit tight  but hopefully they will stretch over time      
46,4.0,                       these shirts are okay  xxl was big enough before washing  but even washing warm cold and drying for less than   minutes on low heat  shrinkage was noticeable  fabric is lighter weight than other reviews led me to believe  will be serviceable weekend work shirt or gym wear  and for the price i guess that s fair      
47,5.0,                       usually large is a little tight and extra large is a little loose for me  i purchase the extra large and after a wash and dry they sit on my broad shoulders perfectly  i usually have to buy extra large because of wide shoulders  the sleeves and belly length are perfect and i like how the end of the sleeve is tapered slightly      
48,2.0,                       i noticed one of the white medium shirts was already worn after i threw away the packaging  it smelled like cigarettes  it is a little disappointing that they do not inspect their returns before restocking them  i hate i can t return it anymore  you get what you pay for i guess  i threw it away  the thought of washing it and wearing it grossed me out      
49,4.0,                       i bought these shirts for my husband to use at work  the price is fair for the product  they are not ultra cotton  but they work perfect for working in outdoors  the only thing i don t like is the width of the sleeves in the armpit area  a little bigger than usual  looks a little irregular  the length of the sleeves and the shirt is suitable for the size  i washed them and put them in the dryer  there were no changes in size  but i must wash them multiple times to see the change other buyers have mentioned      
50,5.0,                       lol i really thought that i had purchased a short sleeve gray t shirt  whrn i open it and saw a long sleeve  i was surprise but very happy  i love them  they fits perfectly  the material and the color is as expected and amazing      
51,5.0,                         stars is maybe a exaggerated for a pretty basic cotton shirt  but i m just so shocked to try it on and have it actually fit well and look good   i ve become pretty much resigned to being disappointed every time i order a shirt from amazon   i don t know why it s so hard to make a shirt with reasonable proportions for someone of more or less average height  i would assume  for a medium size shirt and who is in good physical condition and doesn t have a gigantic gut   but apparently it is  but i usually get shirts that are way  way too long and wear more like a dress than a shirt and or have sleeves that are way too long and or have a gigantic gut that makes the shirt wear like a blouse   this shirt has a reasonable body length for me at       has almost exactly the right sleeve length for me  and it fits nicely and doesn t blouse up in the gut   it s a nice thickness to add a little extra warmth  the color looks good  and the price was very reasonable      
52,4.0,                       the feel and fit of the shirt is really good and leaves some room so it is not tight and gives some space to grow  my only grip is that the sleeve cuffs are a bit wide for my tastes  i would prefer a tighter fit around the wrist and better elasticity for the sleeve cuffs so that when i rolled up my sleeves and then rolled them back down it did not feel stretched out      
53,5.0,                       i am about     and      i ordered the medium and its fits me perfect  material thickness is medium and for the price you cannot beat these      
54,5.0,                       i own lots of gildan shirts  all of them with some sort of screen printing on them  since i spend so much time on video conferences while working at home  i wanted to some long sleeve shirts that were comfortable and don t broadcast some unrelated message while on camera these shirts hit the mark  they fit well and won t shrink much due to their       cotton polyester material  will see how they hold up after a few months      
55,5.0,                       i had never really heard of this brand before  but i m a believer now  i m a pretty big guy   these shirts fit me perfectly  not too long  but not too short either  and very comfortable to wear  there s not very much shrinkage from washing either  i ve already put mine thru the wash a couple times   they still fit great  would definitely recommend to anyone      
56,5.0,                       i like this brand   i buy the men s long sleeve tee shirt because it s a heavier weight of cotton and  it s a comfortable loose fit   i wear them under my work shirt   for me  it saves me from wearing a sweater or sweatshirt in the cooler months and it is not as warm as a thermal would be when you would normally need one later in the winter   i purchased the two pack in a few colors   the shirts wash very well and they do not bleed or shrink      
57,1.0,                       fabric is super stiff and feels fragile  almost like you re wearing some sort of sad paper  not comfortable at all  tried washing them with fabric softer to no effect  pretty sure i trashed these instead of trying to send them back or donating them      
58,5.0,                       i bought these oversized knowing that they would shrink like cotton shirts do after a couple of washes  for me it was a way of getting some longevity out of the shirt  and it works  these are not thin but robust enough to give me a shirt that will last a reasonable amount of time  the price is excellent      
59,3.0,                       i really like the fit of the shirts but after the first wash the navy shirt faded quite a bit   i purchased the two pack of the navy and there is a big difference in the color of the  one that was washed once and the one that wasn t washed   i don t know if the same would be true for other colors      
60,5.0,                       i bought these shirts so that i could protect my arms from getting fried by the sun during the summertime  the shirts are exactly walkathons i wanted  they re not too thick so i don t melt like a crayon on the sidewalk when i wear the shirts  they fit perfectly and they protect me from the sun  a vampire can go out during daytime wearing one of these long sleeve shirts  the price is also great  i recommend these shirts to all the cheapskates out there trying to protect themselves from the sun  i also recommend these shirts to all the vampires too  especially  the vampires in santa clara      
61,1.0,                       the fabric used is very  very rough    washed them three times  and they are just ok      
62,3.0,                       i m an old woman and bought these shirts as winter sleep shirts   the material is really heavy cotton but kind of rough  even after a few washes  so i wind up wearing a softer camisole under them   the cuffs are also snug at the wrist  which for everyday wear is probably great for a guy  but it feels constricting for sleeping   so for my purposes  not what i wanted   but they are well made  well sewn  of good heavy fabric that will last a long time and are longer than most men s t shirts i ve purchased   shrinkage was minimal in the dryer too      
63,5.0,                       i ordered an xl shirt because that is what i used to wear and i figured if i washed it  the shirt would shrink to my current large size  wrong  but in a good way  if you buy xl it will continue to fit xl  apparently regardless of the number of times it s washed  i ve washed it twice and it is still xl  which is a bit baggy for me currently  i ll certainly try the large to see if that fits my current size better      
64,5.0,                       these were great shirts   my son needed some long sleeved tee s for work and these fit the bill   i especially liked that three different colors were offered in one package   my son liked the fit especially the neck opening extra room without looking too big or sloppy   he is keeping the white one back from wearing to work as it would be ruined the first time he wore it   heavy dirt  from moving and unloading semi trailers   he need the long sleeves for added warmth and the comfort of  a cotton shirt   this shirt has performed quite well   it even washed up very well  overall a great shirt that met all the requirements we put forth for it      
65,1.0,                       horrible shirts  it s only so high up in sales and ratings because it s amazon s own brand so they artificially pump it  these are the worst longsleeve shirts i ve ever tried on  it feels like wearing a burlap sack covered in thistles  stiff plastic straight jacket style      
66,1.0,                       very disappointed  it looked great in the picture but the material was poor   it could of been a bit thicker  don t think i would be buying this again  my husband was not happy at all  the sizes were bigger than expected        
67,3.0,                       nice material shirts i got these for work in construction they fit me good but i don t like the sleeves they are way too baggy and somewhat long so i find myself constantly rolling them up all day also they seem to shrink somewhat i had originally ordered a pair in xl and they now fit me like a l so i then ordered  xl and they shrunk a bit but i fit good still other than that the material is pretty soft and stretchy and somewhat cool     
68,5.0,                       i bought this t shirt for my father   i bought it as a thermal for my dad  but it is just a long sleeve t shirt   it is      cotton and it love that about it   my only complaint about it is that the hole for the head is too small  and snug  we have a hard time taking it off my dad   he is injured from one of his shoulders so lifting this arms is a problem and the hole is just too tight      
69,4.0,                       i purchased the medium size  i m      tall and slim   taking heed of the various reviews that mentioned shrinkage and color fading  i washed the item in cold water and removed it from the dryer while still damp  the shirt did not shrink and so far the color looks fine after a second laundering  the fabric is heavier than a fruit of the loom or hanes tee shirt  as i bought the tee shirt for cooler weather  it s just what i wanted      
70,5.0,                       i bought these in white for hubby and me to wear over our clothes for tending to our beehives   he would normally take a l men s and me a m  but i got these in xl and wow   we can both put one over what we re wearing   on me  it s almost like a smock but i love it   i also found some oversized white draw string pants   way cheaper to go this route instead of buying us two beekeepers jumpsuits   these are very nice t shirts that wash up great and will last us for a long time      
71,2.0,                       these shirts fit well  but when taking a closer look the shirts have pilling on them already on the chest  i just opened these from the shipping packaging and noticed it  i assume when we wash them it may create more pilling  i guess you get what you pay for  overall fits ok but quality is lacking      
72,1.0,                       unfortunately  the two white shirts were quite inconsistent with the reliable quality of this brand  the shirts were incredibly scratchy and itchy  the cotton was already pilling  and there was no tag or anything to indicate it was new unworn  worst of all  there was a beard hair on the front of one of the two shirts  the area where the wrist is stitched to the rest of the arm is also super tight  as if it were a compression exercise shirt  very concerning purchase      
73,5.0,                       for me the necklace too small it would be nice if his shirt was available in a v neck and a nice deep pocket for my iphone    would be the cats meow i work in a trench lane sewer pipe and water pipe it would be nice to be able to put my       iphone in a pocket and not have to worry about it falling into the water or mud ps i ve bought    pairs of these shirts for different people in my family i am the only one that s making the statement everybody else is happy they don t do the work that i do there mush hand office workers     
74,5.0,                       i normally fit into xlarge  but now they are tight on me  went with next larger size and i m happy with the fit now   i don t know if this will work for anybody else  but i have a large waist and chest muscles and do not like tight fitting shirts      
75,5.0,                       i really like the gildan tee s i buy the men s  because i use them as a night shirt i m not a very large person under    so they are longer and loser perfect to sleep in they are        cotton  great product and the price is pretty darn good as well      
76,1.0,                       i thought this would be fine to buy because of the reviews and because of the material but i guess not  i don t recommend buying but you re probably going to buy anyways cause of all the other  good  reviewsthough the fit was ok  but still  it shrank   inches      
77,5.0,                       a great t shirt to sleep in   the material is a bit heavier than most t shirts  the length is perfect for me at          below belt line   and the sleeves come to the base of my thumb   i ve washed these about half dozen times so far and have noticed no shrinking or fading   i need to save this order so when i need more  i definitely want these again      
78,1.0,                       only wore   times and shirt is falling apart at the seam by sleeve cuff      
79,5.0,                       i purchased this for work shirt and i might have washed it at least    times and the color still held up somewhat  i m getting a little shrinkage and i know it come from the dryer  so if you want to keep the true color and stop the shrinkage wash it separate and no dryer  shirts taken beating and i m still wearing to this day      
80,3.0,                       i was surprised at how welll these fit me considering they re supposed to be men size  but with that being said  they shrink   i washed them twice and now based off of the size i know the next time i wouldn t be able to put them in the dryer  so that s extremely disappointing considering these are for work so i always have to have a clean shirt ready to throw on      
81,3.0,                       love the color choices  love the price  love the size choices  i m a big guy so i appreciate the  x   that being said i don t appreciate when a product shrinks so much after   washing that it leaves the bottom of my belly exposed unless i constantly tug down on it  yes  i followed the washing instructions      
82,5.0,                       i m a fan of gildan shirts  so these were perfectly  what i was looking for  i m short but have long limbs  i bought a small to wear these under a med sized shirt  the sleeves reach my wrists  i don t feel constricted when pairing these with a top  can freely move material is soft and tangible  great value for the price      
83,5.0,                       i brought the long sleeve  heavy material  under shirts for my    year old father  because he falls down frequently and the skin on his arms is tissue thin  so far  the damage to his arms  after a fall  has been greatly reduced  i bought the white color  because it s easy to bleach out the blood stains  this probably isn t what the manufacturer had in mind for this product s use  but as people live longer  you re suddenly in uncharted waters  and you have to get creative      
84,3.0,                       these are value shirts meaning you get what you pay for   they run a bit small  particularly in body and sleeve lengths   the material is a bit thin and a little scratchy but that may improve after more washes   these are good enough for wearing around the house which is what i wanted   when i need more  i may go up a size  or will cross shop with similar items from other suppliers      
85,3.0,                       it fits great when you try it on before washing it  both shirts shrunk at least a full size during the very first wash dry  too small for comfort now  so i gave them to my wife for night shirts  she likes them for that purpose i haven t given up on gildan yet  though  i bought two in a different color   one of the colors that has both cotton and polyester  i m hopeful the polyester will help prevent shrink before these white ones shrunk  they were a perfect fit      
86,4.0,                       not much to say but these are inexpensive shirts that are a good value   perhaps not the softest material but they do appear to be durable   they have been thru the wash at least a dozen time and after the initial minor shrinking of the length they haven t had any issues   i expect to get good life out of them      
87,5.0,                       in the winter  i prefer long sleeved shirts with my long pajamas  these are perfect for that and a great value as well  they seem a little more snug at the neck than others  but it seems they loosen after a few wear wash cycles  otherwise  they fit as expected      
88,5.0,                       bought these gif my husband  he loves the shirt length and a perfect chest fit  i ve purchased these comfy shirts several times  i actually bought a size large for myself  fits the way i wanted it to  loose and comfy  i wear it with flannel bottoms and i m cozy and warm  not just a men s shirt        
89,5.0,                       hi these gildan long sleeved tee shirts are excellent quality  the      cotton is a heavy  thightly knit fabric that feels smooth on the skin  it  is just the right weight for when the weather starts to cool down  they are a men s shirt  so if you re a lady your hip size will matter  i thought that givien my figure a medium would do  but my hips  at      are better suited to a large size  the medium is comfortable but doesn t have quite the loose fit i like at the hips  i ll continue to wear the medium ones i bought  but am ordering the large  too  so i can enjoy a more loose and easy fit below the waise  highly recommended for the quality and price      
90,5.0,                       these are definitely true to size i always buy everything gildan brand because i know the size is going to fit  every time always affordable  great quality  no fading  washes easily  lasts long i will always buy these   stars  vote my review helpful if you thought it was awesome        
91,1.0,                       not     cotton     poly   very rough fabric   washed   times and did not soften strange fit   would not recommend      
92,5.0,                       i bought a pair of these in charcoal grey at the end of september  i bought a white pair last week  today  a pair of these in sports grey arrived i need warm long sleeved t shirts for my      am bike rides and southern california s brutal winters are coming soon  i bought large  and after the first wash  they shrunk down to a perfect fit if i iron them  they ll probably look quite nice with jeans      
93,4.0,                       after a couple of washes the black one had multiple small holes        in front bottom they are not a soft cotton   medium weight to heavy  seams line up nicely on cuffs  i was pleased overall  some shrinking but i wash in hot and dry on cotton  all in all good value      
94,4.0,                       didn t shrink or fade after   times in washer dryer  followed instructions for first   washings  medium fit me perfectly although some might consider it tight if you want loose feel  works well under another shirt excellent value       
95,3.0,                       scratchy if not washed before wearing  unraveling at the collar at the first wash  i took the advice of reviews and purchased one size larger so that it would shrink perfectly after the first wash  and it did  it faded at first wash  the shirt is not high quality but it s not terrible either  a small price for   lounge shirts is acceptable  don t expect a lot from this product      
96,5.0,                       i bought four of these long sleeve t shirts  two light gray and two heather gray  the color was exactly as represented and the xl size was spot on  unlike some long sleeve t shirts  these are a little heavier and the sleeves don t feel saggy like pajamas  for me  a sweatshirt is too heavy most of the time because if you re dressing for moving between inside and outside in the cool to cold weather when you get inside where the heat s on  it gets too hot  so i like something that s a mid weight and this definitely serves that purpose  most long sleeve t shirts are too light weight  they lose their shape and look sloppy after wearing them just a short time  these shirts hold their shape and are just the right weight  i wear the shirts untucked  but they re not to heavy to tuck in  i m fairly simple in the way i dress  so these are perfect for me      
97,5.0,                       everything i described perfect perfect for my husband hasn t been on the roof exactly he needs to work can t beat the price and he says they fit great they re comfortable they re warm and he wears them every day to work on that roof so excellent fit excellent quality happy customers definitely recommend and we ll buy again     
98,5.0,                       for the price  it s hard to complain   even so  this is really more of a light weight sweat shirt than it is a tee   the fabric is thicker than than that of a tee  and it s definitely coarser   i had been wanting a tee with ribbed cuffs and had not found one until i saw this advertised   i dislike the cuffs of most tees because they dangle into whatever   so in that respect  this is a great shirt   but i had hoped for something i could throw on after work and even sleep in if i felt so inclined   this shirt does not fit that bill   it would be a perfect under shirt for a camping trip   the size seemed just a bit small  especially after laundering  oddly enough  the     poly  grey shirt shrank the most  i would order a size up   i purchased two sets  one of which was red   it turned out to be an orange red  not my favorite shade of red      
99,4.0,                       these shirts are perfect for what i was looking for  my husband likes to wear a long sleeved shirt in the summer and i believe these shirts will not be overly warm in the heat   they washed up fairly well but did not get them out of the dryer in time so were quite wrinkled  did not notice any shrinking as yet  but they are cotton   they are not oversized so if you like them bulky  take this into consideration      
100,4.0,                       i had to get a refund as this shirt neck opening is much smaller tighter than all my other shirts  i do not like a tight closed neck  the rest of the shirt is ok  but i cant wear something that constrictive on my neck  the company promptly refunded my money and told me to just keep the shirts  i gave them to someone who would wear them      
101,3.0,                       i was very pleased by the material of these long sleeved t s  it is a good weight cotton that will keep you warm   also i could not believe the low price until the seams fell apart  i checked the sewing  they have excellent stitching  but  the person cutting the material must have slipped in areas   the stitch only caught one piece of material instead of two   thus  the seams failed   even so  i just grabbed a needle and thread and went to work   the cotton really is that good i would compare this product to factory seconds of a name brand      
102,5.0,                       for the price  and the perfect  for me  fit  i love this  i need to wear long sleeves when i go outdoors  to avoid sun exposure  and these fit and feel very comfortable  i m      weigh     lbs  athletic build  and i bought the xl size expecting it would shrink nicely to a good size fit for me  and so it fits great after having been washed and the hot dryer if you are bigger around the waist than the chest shoulders  this shirt might work but at the price  i don t expect the neck to hold its snugness for a long time  fortunately for me the chest waist are not billowy  but it is the typical  american  fit but not so awfully billowy but    as i ll only wear this around the house and yard  or for running errands  i would re order  be sure to order a size larger      
103,2.0,                       these are scratchy  even after multiple washings  they are not soft cotton to begin with  and multiple washings do not make them any softer  i ve actually gotten scratch rashes in the armpits from these  if you want a soft  comfortable cotton  i strongly suggest that you go with hanes or some other brand that is actually comfortable  these gildans    the sizing is good  they don t shrink too much  arm length vs torso dimensions    all good  so  yes  these are sturdy and seem to be well made  but i would never buy again  they re a nasty scratchy fabric      
104,4.0,                       like the shirt for quality and color stable   i ordered one   pack  size large to test wash and dry   after laundering  it is slightly smaller than wanted   have now ordered several x large    this is a reasonable quality shirt at a very good price   if on the edge for size  order the bigger one      
105,4.0,                       this t shirt is a medium weight in fabric  i washed them after they arrived in cold water and then put them in the dryer on delicate for about      minutes just to get the wrinkles out and then hung them to finish drying   i don t think i would trust them in the dryer until they were entirely dry because they are     percent cotton and look like they would shrink   the fabric is a little scratchy on the skin after washing them   not sure if it was due to not drying them completely in the dryer or if it is the material itself   my chest size is    inches and it fits ok  but anyone bigger i suggest going up a size      
106,3.0,                       one of the shirts had a small defect  a tiny hole and a pulled thread thi might eventually have to repair i was pleased with the quality and fit but one of the shirts got passed quality control i will keep it but wanted to inform young the defect      
107,5.0,                       these were perfect for field wear  got them in the largest possible size so they could be worn over multiple layers if need be  no need  wore them over a tank top and they kept out mosquitoes  horseflies and all manner of dirt  i spent      hours a day in these  pushing through devil s club  stinging nettle  fallen trees and thick shrubs  not a single snag or tear  soaked up a ton of sweat  washed out nicely and kept me from being eaten alive by bugs  now that field season is over  they re great for yard work      
108,5.0,                       purchased for my son   he loves it  he works at the front desk of a hotel where the door is opening and closing all the time in all weathers  he wears these shirts under his regular shirt  says it makes him much more comfortable   keeping him warm enough  but cool enough too  as the fabric wicks  looking for black ones now      
109,1.0,                       these shirts only lasted less than   months  until the stitching started to become undone leaving a hole under the arm  the hole is too big and noticeable to be able to wear the shirt again   unfortunately  it happened right after the return window closed   yet another unusable and non refundable amazon product i purchased  oh well      
110,5.0,                       this pair of white cotton t shirts with long sleeves turned out to be exactly what i thought i was ordering  it s made of good quality cotton  the stitch work is good  just in case anyone is interested in knowing  each medium size t shirt weighs exactly      oz or     grams update  purchased another two pairs of the same  which turned out to be equally excellent  the first ones have been washed and rewashed several times by now and the fabric is holding up beautifully  its color is still brilliant white  there is no sign of shrinkage  everything is good and well      
111,5.0,                       i read a lot of review s my wife even said it was thicker than a lot of tee shirts i am going to wear it on my motorcycle along with my leather jacket it really fits perfect i did want it to be a little loose i did not want it to be tight at all will maybe buy a few more since i like them i read a few review s about shipping i had mine within   days super fast got here faster than it was suppose to good buy      
112,4.0,                       top line says       cotton    but  it changes by color   so the two  heather gray  i ordered are only     cotton   if not for covid confinement  i would have returned these   you can do better gilden   i am a woman who has broad shoulders and prefer the men s fit  but i hate     poly stuff   i only ordered from hated amazon because of covid and only kept it to avoid contagion at ups to return it      
113,5.0,                       these are nice shirts  i am a nurse and generally use these for under my scrubs  they are of a good quality and material  the material does seem a little rough still  not very soft  i m hoping after a few washes this will get better  not a deal breaker  maybe half a star        
114,1.0,                       one came with a hole in it and the other got a hole in the armpit the first time i wore it  i bought these when they were two for    so i guess i can t be that mad but i ve had gildan shirts before and had no issues  it makes me wonder if they were factory seconds or something  i ve noticed the price has been raised since     
115,5.0,                       i know these are men shirts  but i much rather when shirts are loose on me  i m wearing a medium  very comfy     
116,3.0,                       first  the product will shrink   it is      cotton so you should expect it   second  you will want to remove the label   it is stiff and annoying   be careful when you buy it  the first time i bought the shirts it was   for       on amazon   the second time    days later  i must have gone to a different site on amazon expecting to buy similar shirts in     cotton       poly  i missed the fine print  paid        for the two and received the same shirts i bought for        when i tried to return them  i had to pay       for shipping       
117,4.0,                       i bought a two pack for undershirts at work because i work the drive through window the shirt is a little rough just putting it on straight out of the package  overall fit it s a little bit longer than a regular t shirt but shoulders and chest fit really well  i am         ish pounds the sleeves are a little long but that could be just me having short arms      
118,4.0,                       good fitting t shirt   sleeve length is a bit long for me but my wingspan is the root cause  luckily the cuffs around the wrists are tight and the shirt doesnt swallow my arm   for the price you can t be upset with the quality  however  if you are looking for a soft shirt this fabric is not it   i purchased   shirts and will be keeping all   great undershirt for layering up in the winter      
119,5.0,                       i ordered these because the walmart doesn t have long sleeve construction shirts  first thing i noticed was how nice and good the fabric is  much thicker than any construction shirts i ve brought from the stores  i work outside in site development  deal with mud rain and sweat all day  these are perfect  washed them soon as they came and no fading or real shrinkage to speak of  fits just perfect  i ordered large  i m      about          they fit great  made of good quality stuff for the price i can t complain  i m not looking for anything fancy     
120,5.0,                       i did order a size up and after wash they were perfect for me   shrinking was not all that much   they have ample long sleeves which i like and a knit cuff which seems to make them warmer and holds the sleeve in place at any position on my arms   these are great for everyday and most any other event i choose to attend   put under a jacket and you are ready to go most anyplace      
121,5.0,                       great price and good quality  true to size and color is perfect  after washing and drying  the t shirt did need to be ironed  i have purchased other colors in the past   i am expecting another color tomorrow      
122,4.0,                       i have the dry blend version of these long sleeves and are more true to size than these ultra cotton ones  the advantage of these is they are thicker and a bit softer than the dry blend  they down side is they shrink too much and are already a hair to small when new  i am     and they rested just below the waistline when new but after washing they sit above the waistline  i use these for work and when reaching above my head the shirts expose the lower back and the whole belly      
123,5.0,                       these shirts really have a nice fitting and cut  i ve bought a few of them already and bought them as gifts to a family member who asked me for the link in order to buy some more  my only issue is with the fabric i guess that it tends to pick up lint from the washing machine and it still doing it after i ve washed and cleaned the machine  while other clothing isn t doing it      
124,5.0,                       my husband is      and weighs about     pounds  he has a long torso  i went by the reviews and bought a xl size  a size larger than what he normally wears  he wears them while walking or riding his bike to protect him from the sun  the sleeves are too long but the cuff keeps them in place  they are perfect for hawaii weather  not too thick and not too thin  they are very soft and comfy  they are well made with double stitching in the shoulders  he loves them  we will order these again      
125,4.0,                       when i first received these i was going to send them right back  this was based on how they felt  i double checked to see if they were made of wool  they are not they fit nicely so i decided to wash them a couple of times to see if the scratchiness would go away  it did not these appear to be well made  the length in the arms are just right as well is the back length is long enough so they do not pull out when i bend over while working i may order another set even though these are only offered in black perhaps more washings will soften the fabric or maybe these were intended for work wear      
126,5.0,                       these are my favorite shirts to  reverse  tie dye  i get them a little larger so i can wear them a little baggy  but they bleach so well  and they re so comfortable  the shirts are warm but not too hot  and they fit me well  even though i m female and these are men s shirts  like i said  i like baggier shirts   honestly  these are my favorites to practice my reverse tie dying skills on      
127,5.0,                       they aren t pre shrunk or mine still shrunk if they were  i like my shirts loose so i bought a larger size  they re nice and comfortable and slow you to move freely  they re also thick enough to not rip from catching on everything but thin enough to not be hot      
128,5.0,                       i have owned a lot of gildan shirts in the past and these long sleeve shirts are great for the price  bought them to wear while sleeping during the cold months and the weight of the shirt is just right  these are not the thin material like a lot of the new t shirts  the material is mid weight and comfortable  i ordered xl and i am      and     lbs and these fit well  not tight and not baggy      
129,1.0,                       shirts arrived with black mark on one   about an inch long and    th inch wide   almost like it was hit with a sharpie   the other had a small hole in the torso   i paid    ish for both  so not too upset  but these will be immediate  work  shirts as i won t be wearing them by themselves if it weren t for those blemishes  they would be   star as the material felt good while wearing         
130,4.0,                       what i wanted to express about this product is that it is a good fit for me with the exception of the length of the arms  i have long arms and therefore the sleeves were too short for me  what surprised me was then i turned around and put an order in for the extra large  but there was not much difference in the sleeve length  i thought gildan had a longer sleeve length of a prior product and i now know that they have changed      
131,5.0,                       fits well  sleeves are long enough for lanky me            room in the shoulders for active labor  i ve already worn both now  first worn went straight to laundry  i washed it cold with a load and dried medium to hot  no shrinkage  cuffs grippy  i wear them while landscaping and doing lawn care   no complaints  ordering two more      
132,4.0,                       these shirts came in a two pack  not tagless  the fit is as expected not too big and not too small  the quality is alright  i mean at around    each shirt   i guess i cannot complain and expect amazing quality  i wish the shirt was a little softer as the material is a stiffer material and thick  because of this  i would give it      the color is also fading a little faster than some of the other long sleeve shirts from other brands  for the price   this can t be beaten  but i wish the quality was a bit better      
133,4.0,                       i m a big guy  i m     lbs at        the clothes that i want in the sizes i want don t fit me well  i bought this shirt in a  x  i knew i was taking a chance of it not fitting as i would like i should explain how i wanted it to fit  i like a long sleeve t shirt that fits tight in the chest but doesn t fit snug around the stomach  that would be perfect if i was still a fit man in my    s  i m not in my    s and i m sure as hell not as fit as i could be this being said  this shirt is comfortable  i wear it as an under shirt with a t shirt over top  i would buy it again as a  regular shirt in the  x size      
134,3.0,                       from the product description   soft premium cotton for added comfort  double needle stitching in bottom hem for extra durability  classic cut for roomier fitin short  they run small and cotton quality is poor the shirts are basic cotton  a but  rough   so the description of  ultra  and  premium  is inaccurate  after a few washes they have also faded a bit  regarding size  they are not  roomier   the shirts i received are about   size smaller  i can live with shorter sleeves  i kind of pull them up half arm anyway  but they are short for an xl  the shirt tail length is short for an xl  won t stay tucked in   fyi i m      tall     lbs      waist and the xl is too small  i wear xl in most every generic shirt  if you choose to purchase  i d recommend ordering one size larger      
135,1.0,                       i loved the shirts when i first got them  they fit perfectly  after one wash  they are so tight that they are uncomfortable  mine were grey ultra cotton  made in nicaragua with tags  i ve always purchased gildan long sleeve tees and this is the first time this has happened      
136,5.0,                       i was looking for sweatshirt  this one popped up when i was looking for a sweatshirt  did i get a sweatshirt  no   but i thought that was what i ordered the shirt is really nice but it a little loose in places  but it s nice      
137,5.0,                       been a fan for years of the brand  i wear these for work  great fit   large    colors have held up well  i always wash them in   cold water    i ll continue to buy these as long as the quality stays in check      
138,4.0,                       this shirt was what i expected  the cotton texture is a little rough  not as soft as my old eddie bauer ones  but still ok i ordered xl since other reviews said it shrinks  which it does  arm length is now perfect though it s still a loose fit  which i like funny that when i ordered it i thought it was a decent price for a shirt but didn t realize it was for   until the package arrived  pleasant surprise  as long as you re not expecting a super soft cotton i definitely recommend these and i ll reorder again  i d give them a     stars if i could      
139,5.0,                       these shirts were a great deal and a great quality fabric my husband works construction so i needed to put him in some long sleeve shirts that weren t going to break the bank but also weren t going to shrink after the first use these are holding up well he says they are very comfortable      
140,1.0,                       i can t believe all of the good reviews  i just got my shirts and wore one for a full day  the fabric is very rough and i won t even try washing them  i have other products from gildan any while they are not real high quality  they were at least acceptable  these are so rough on the skin that i got rubbed raw under my arms from the shirt gildan may be a canadian company  but where is the fabric from  where are they made  really  solids       cotton  sport grey      cotton      polyester  safety colors and dark heather      cotton      polyester  they feel like poor quality polyester      
141,5.0,                       i purchased this style by gildan and champion  out of the bag they both fit well  but after the first wash the champion shirt became stretched out in the neck and chest while the gildan s  was not affected by the wash  i returned the champion shirts  after   washes the gildan product is holding up well      
142,5.0,                       nice plain black shirts  i was expecting just same old everyone has them they work  do the job  shirt  i like the brand because they are a cut above average  these shirts i can wear going out  amazing fit and feel  definitely going to buy more today  big surprise  and i never write reviews      
143,1.0,                       i buy the  xl for the length because i am      but these shirts shrunk to a balloon body a mile wide and looks like a half shirt  cheap material  i am using them for rags since i washed them  a shame because ive been wearing gildan my whole life  but times have changed and are made all over  its hit   miss now at our expense     
144,2.0,                       i love this product great quality for the price  but when i received the two shirts one of them had tape stuff to it that would not come off  i got it for a friend for christmas  they did not want me to return it they said they could use one for a work shirt      
145,4.0,                       i wear long sleeve ts a lot  so  i decided to try these because the ftl ones have gone to a cheap blend  these are easily worth the tiny price tag  i wear them with an undershirt and it s comfortable over the layer  if there s a drawback  the people who mentioned the length of the sleeves aren t fibbing  the big size arms are also measured tall and they bunch  so don t buy over your size  or you ll look like a pirate  lol      
146,3.0,                       i like this tee   i read the reviews and thought i would try   i have included a before washing and after washing and drying picture so you can see it does shrink a couple of inches in the sleeve and body length  for reference i m      and weight     lbs   this is an xl   the main reason i gave it only   stars is one of the shirts had a section on the shoulder seam that was not sewn   not a big deal for me as i can fix it   i would return it but have washed it   otherwise  this is nice weight material and shirt is well made      
147,3.0,                       the gildan shirts i ve bought have been inconsistent   some are great  and some really suck   i wear them daily and really like them when they re  right    to be honest  my luck has been          i have purchased several times as they re almost a daily wear for the last   years   three stars for these inexpensive shirts     for the good ones when i get them       
148,4.0,                       i love this shirt  it is exactly as advertised and i absolutely would buy again  you are getting exactly what you expect  a clean white long sleeve shirt that has a standard fit  the only reason it s not getting a   star rating is that it shrinks about   inches when you wash it  i would recommend ordering a size up from what you normally wear because this shirt will shrink  no doubt about it  for reference  i am          lbs and wear a large  the shirt that i washed now no longer reaches my wrists and hardly passes the belt line  while the other that is unwashed fits exactly as you d expect  i should have ordered an xl in this product  hopefully you all can learn from my mistake      
149,1.0,                       was very upset to see when i went to decorate this it had an enormous whole right from me taking out of the bag  will not be purchasing from again rated only one star bc i had to in order to post     
150,5.0,                       i bought my husband both the royal blue and the dark blue long sleeved tshirts   they all fit the same and wash up beautifully with no obvious shrinkage   be careful when choosing the color though  because not all of the colors are made from      cotton      
151,5.0,                       typically  i have to wear a t shirt  long or short  for a month or so to make it feel right around my shoulders and chest  these long sleeve t shirts fit the first time and felt so comfortable  within a week of the first purchase  i ordered another pair  you can t go wrong ordering these t shirts    they re simply awesome  a must buy      
152,5.0,                       the item runs a little small but the seller stands behind their products  i appreciate that when i purchase from amazon  just make sure you order one size up from what you need  these are very nice shirts and i am sad i won t get to enjoy them      
153,3.0,                       i really hoped that these would be soft but they are not  there is a grain to the material that you can feel when you stroke the material with your hand  i have washed them over and over at least   times but there is no difference in the feel of it  i purchased the blue and the gray color and neither is comfortable which is sad because they fit well and seem to be high quality      
154,3.0,                       the shirt feels like it s itching the back of my neck due to the material made from it  also  when you reach for anything  the shirt arms cuffs raises up  making the shirt feel small  but i m  ft tall  which might be why the shirt feels that way to me in my opinion  i wish the shirt came in  tall large  size  then i would review the product again the print i got on the shirt looks amazing  and i got alot of compliments on it  so  if you want to go the cheap routine for shirts  i would pick this product and the other colors that it has to offer   i don t recommend buying these shirts for people who are tall or long in height  it will not fit them right even in x large size because that s the size i got overall i would rate this shirt     out of     on the scale  which includes the comfort of the shirt  the print  and how it fits      
155,2.0,                       the sleeves were too short  they came just above the wrist if you raise your hand it would come up  after a single wear they ripped right along the wrist opening   normally good quality not sure if it was the batch i recieved but it didn t even last a week     
156,5.0,                       great fit  medium is medium  sleeves are not way too long  chest is medium waist is right  not supper long  sleeves are nice and snug  neck good close fit great material  i m a gildan fan anyway  i m a bit picky with long sleeve shirtsusually buy this brand  the price is fantastic  i bought the two pack this time i would like to see pockets as an option at additional cost i bought the dark grey   it appears to have a slight bit of blue hint in it  whichis fine  could just  be my eyes too i will buy again for sure      
157,3.0,                       i did not really know what to expect material wise  i just knew that i wanted some long sleeved black shirts and the price seemed decent  after trying the shirts on  they felt a little too tight around the chest for me and tight on the shoulders  personally  i have a slightly bigger chest size and built arms so the shirt felt like a bit of a strange fit  material wise it was not soft but not rough either  i think it is the quality i paid for so i am not disappointed about that  all in all i don t think i would wear this when i am out  unless i maybe owned a size bigger  but i would probably us these shirts when doing yard work in cooler weather or when i am out camping in somewhat cold temperatures      
158,3.0,                       pros  only just got them  but seem well made  i got the gray heather  color is what you d expect  decent price  cons  it s a very coarse material  more like a rough linen than combed cotton  not really comfortable to wear as a t shirt but ok to wear over a t shirt  when i first open the package it gave off a really intense  chemica l smell  didn t go away after one wash  washed it a couple more times also hoping to soften up the material  the smell is still faintly there and the material is still very coarse  the styling is basic  potato sack   which is appropriate since that s what the material feels like  wasn t really sure how to rate these  so i ll just knock one start off for the intense chemical smell  and one for the not very t shirt like material      
159,3.0,                       i own several gildan shirts and was really expecting more from these  they fit well but the fabric is too rough and scratchy for a long sleeved t shirt which makes these less comfortable than they have a right to be      
160,4.0,                       i am a  woman  and i bought these shirts for myself to go under sweatshirts for the winter   i own an older house  and during the day i don t usually put the heat up  especially if the sun s out   i knew they would be longer and that was one of the things i was looking for   the price was great and i m pleased with my purchase   if they were softer  i d give them a ten because they re fine for my purpose   that being said  i have a feeling they will soften up after a few washes      
161,5.0,                       great quality  durability  and fit  shrunk less than a quarter of original size after first wash and dry  if at all  i have longer arms       so i like when the sleeves are past my wrists  i bought these as a beach sun protection shirt  lightweight and comfortable      
162,5.0,                       the shirts are good quality and comfortable  i m on the stocky side                    chest  i ordered an xl and it fits just right  a little loose in the right areas  if i had to pick something to complain about  the wrist cuffs aren t very stretchy so a bit tight at first if i try to pull up the sleeves a bit      
163,5.0,                         note there s an update at  the end of this review the material is a bit heavier than expected  which is a good thing  considering that i bought it for winter use   as an elderly retired person and living in a rest home  it s heavy enough to keep me warm on the chilly mornings i liked these so much that i immediately ordered another pair of the shirts  only this time in black  they arrived right on schedule and we re also made in the honduras       cotton and the same quality stitching as was in the blue ones  one of the male nurses saw the shirts and when he found out how inexpensive they were and what good qualities they were he also ordered himself some  if you are considering buying it these t shirts  do yourself a favor and get to it  i am fairly certain that i will be ordering some more of these  note  short update   i went ahead and bought   more  this time in black  arrived on time  these were made in nicaragua rather than in the honduras like my other ones were  however the same quality of material and care of the stitching is present  so i m sure these will be as good as the blue ones    yet another update here it is most      and all thes e shirts still look brand new  the colors are locked in fast   no fading  and they do keep me warm      
164,3.0,                       gildon is always a great product  i am disappointed that the  xl shirts are very short  as in they barely extend to meet the top of my belt  i am        in height with a     waist  the fit is nice and loose  the way i like   but the length of this shirt is way too short  make sure you purchase  xlt if you are tall like me      
165,1.0,                       the description for the charcoal gray shirts stated that the shirt is     cotton and     polyester  i received shirts that were       cotton  after returning them for new ones i received the same shirt       cotton  after going to all the trouble to return the first shipment i thought someone would make sure i got the right shirt      
166,5.0,                       great shirts  i ordered large and got large  the fit is perfect for me  not too tight  not too loose  just great  the material is as good as any i own and the workmanship and quality is fantastic   not scratchy   comfortable  the price for   shirts is as good as you will find and beats all others  i love these shirts and highly recommend to anyone looking      
167,4.0,                       these long under shirts or thermal under shirts  slightly thin material  are nice and soft and fit slightly bigger than other brands   i like this as in under shirt covered by a over shirt    only thing is i ordered   large shirts    were large the other   were small size in a open package  crazy it was  i sent the   small shirts back of course    small shirts don t fit a person who is a large with a     chest    it does seem like i send back about one quarter of the products i order from amazon   the order package pickers in the warehouse house just throw in what ever they want without looking what they are doing   this is not good  but amazon has good return policy  if you have the time that is      
168,4.0,                       i bought this to fit me after gaining weight following surgery  as i lose weight it is pretty loose around the waist and not quite as long as i would have liked  granted not everyone has the same body   i love that amazon finally realized people never mentioned their height and weight so they re adding it to the review section finally                 
169,1.0,                       remember that you get what you pay for  first time in the washer out of the package and they shrunk by about a size and a half  not worth the money  at least i have rags now to clean around the house      
170,4.0,                       ordered these to wear around the house to cover severe  raw  weeping skin leisons of eczema and the medicated ointments used to treat the condition  the material is soft and non irritating to my raw  painful skin to the extent that i can sleep in these shirts  the sleeves are long enough to cover the tops backs of my hands  perfect      
171,3.0,                       i am a    lb woman who was looking for some long sleeve shirts to wear as pajamas  generally speaking  men s shirts are cheaper than women s shirts  which is stupid  but whatever i got these in a small  which fit tighter than i prefer  but i feel like medium would have been too big  my main issue with these shirts is how itchy they are  i washed and dried them and it did not help at all  they are still so stiff and itchy  pair that with them being a little too tight and they are unfortunately unwearable for me  i guess i ll give them to my daughter to use for pajamas off to find another  softer brand      
172,3.0,                       order a size up  watch out for the wash and dry  i bought these for my    year old  first wash and dry and now they re way too small  other than that we really dig the gildan brand because the necks and sleeve cuffs don t stretch out  good thick cotton as well  i reordered but a size medium this time  we ll see how that goes      
173,5.0,                       my normal shirt size is medium     year old female   but i love buying the xl size of these long sleeve gildan shirts because they are so comfortable for keeping me warm down to my hands and not constricted while working at my desk all day  but also as pajama shirts  the larger size gives me the extra shirt and sleeve length i need  i love the gildan quality and simplicity      
174,5.0,                       some of my favorite brands of underwear and tee shirts have really disappointed me lately  they have gaps in the seams  the neck sags  one side rides lower than the other  and they fall apart even more after a few washes  on the other hand  these shirts from gildan are perfectly made and fit great  and the price for this particular   pack is hard to beat      
175,4.0,                       i ordered a two pack in large  white   the overall quality is ok for the price  the material is medium weight and slightly rough   it s good for outdoor work and i would buy again for fun i did a shrinkage test   verifying that each shirt measured the same initially  one was kept as received and the other was laundered twice first cycle    warm wash   low temp dry measuredworn for   hours second cycle   hot wash   medium high dry remeasuredinterestingly  about     of the shrinkage occurred during the first  low temp laundering measurements  initial   finallength  back of neck to hem               width     from bottom             sleeve  from shoulder             when shrunk it s within the range of a typical men s size large  although not particularly roomy   if fit is critical i would measure a favorite t shirt for comparison      
176,5.0,                       great product and great customer service  i m yes of the green  grey  black three pack i ordered i got green  great  and navy blue  i reached out to the seller asking if i could just return the blue for black but they told me to just keep it and they d send out the replacement right away  great customer service  i ll definitely be ordering through them again and the shirts are exactly as expected  bought them a size up so they d be good lounge around the house shirts     
177,5.0,                       it s a shirt  there is no rocket science to it the material is reasonably thick and a bit coarse  perfect for regular use  do note this would not be a good choice to use as an undershirt because of this the fit is true to size  with the notable exception of there being a slight bagginess on the underarm all things said  it s a surprisingly good purchase for the price      
178,5.0,                       these actually exceeded my expectations  i purchased these as a supplement to my work uniform to provide extra protection when i go into biohazardous areas such as hospitals and jails  they were thicker than i thought and  being gray  they should not be over affected by chlorine bleach  i m about to order again      
179,5.0,                       i bought these for my husband to wear around the house  i bought an xl so they wouldn t be tight around his stomach and they fit him perfectly  they seem to be made well  thus far  and i haven t noticed much shrinkage  i like these better than hanes      
180,5.0,                       i bought a bunch of these shirts  i bought my husband some in xl and i bought myself some in  xl  i was originally looking for myself some long sleeve  lightweight shirts that would actually fit me and be long enough around and in the sleeves being as i am a plus size woman and      also if you found this same exact shirt in a women s plus size shop  even on amazon it would probably cost about     for one  so this shirt was perfect for myself and my husband   they are lightweight in a good way   they do shrink a little in the dryer but not a ton  i personally ordered my shirts one size up from what i normally wear according to the size chart to allow shrinkage in the dryer  they were long enough to go over my chest and stomach and still hit about mid thigh  the sleeves were long enough that they weren t annoyingly short  over all i love them  in fact after ordering my husband and myself each   packs  i went back and ordered myself an extra pack  i recommend      
181,3.0,                       when i first purchased these  shirts  i was please with the fit and material  the price was reasonable so i order several more of different colors  only after one wash  i found the seam at the bottom of one had  started to unravel badly  at this time i did not feel it was worth the trouble to return them and would only be wearing around the house now that i m concerned about the quality   it looks like i ll now be searching elsewhere for other shirts to purchase      
182,5.0,                       i hope i remember to continue buying gildan ultra cotton   turned out exactly what i wanted in a long sleeve t shirt   comfortable fit and feel   and a good buy for what i think is a quality product   i already ordered two more in another color   t shirts in general seem to vary regardless of brand and descriptions provided from time to time but this time  all good      
183,1.0,                       these itch like crazy and are cheap      
184,1.0,                       i like the thickness of the shirt  but the seam quality is poor   the bottom seam thread came out after wearing it once   if you do order  go with a larger size due to shrinkage   size chart said medium for me and i went with large and it fits perfectly   too bad about the quality      
185,3.0,                       looks nice  good for the price  material is not too thick  dislikes  the fabric is not very soft and feels kind of stiff  hoping it softens after a wash  i m usually a m in t shirts  bought a small but i would get a medium if you want to be more comfortable      
186,5.0,                       shirt is a little longer than expected  i am          lbs average build and i ordered a large  fits great at the chest  but loose at the waist  it is      cotton  so i ll update my review after the first wash  the shirt feels like good quality  it s heavier than i expected especially for the price      
187,5.0,                       t shirt quality and sizing is better than most   sizing  including shirt and sleeve length  is what i would have expected a generation ago before this current age of just making something to technically fit the product description   thickness is what a good t shirt should always be   thick enough to be considered a layer that can be used in most any weather  not sure about durability only time will tell  but the feel of the material and   pack option makes me think that will also be much  better than average      
188,5.0,                       the long sleeve t shirts are great fitting and warm  i got them for wear outside with layered clothing and they really help keep me warm  i also use them for sleeping in the cold nights and the soft cotton materiel stands up nicely      
189,5.0,                       this shirt was everything i expected   and more   no shrinking  no rolling up of collar or waist seem  after numerous washings        i live in phx  az and needed a white work shirt for the outside  temps in the    s  and this worked excellent    priced right and works great   what more can we ask    lol     
190,4.0,                       these were a bit too stiff and thin for me  overall comfortable though  i would say they fit a bit on the small side  definitely decent shirts especially for the price      
191,5.0,                       maybe too soon to rate since i haven t yet seen how the long sleeve t shirt makes it through the wash  but so far it seems like a nice quality product   i got the x large as i usually do to avoid too small a large and it is on the large side of x large always a bit of a gamble ordering t s from amazon  but i m pleased so far      
192,1.0,                       these shirts feel like fine grit sand paper  this legitimately feels like the cheap  coarse aprons you use when volunteering at a food drive or something  i guess i ll try washing them a few times before wearing them  no way i d wear them like this      
193,5.0,                       my husband is a construction worker  carpenter  and needs these for work  the color is perfect  the safety green is the proper color for being on the job  he wears an xl and that s what i ordered  it fits just as it should  i ve washed and dried a few times already  and no shrinkage or fading has occurred  they aren t paper thin and they aren t flannel thick  a hearty material  but not too heavy  shipped super quick and the price was very reasonable  i know i will be ordering a couple more for the season      
194,1.0,                       not sure how these shirts garnered all the great reviews  but that has not been my experience with these shirts  i purchased   if them based solely on the reviews  but all   are already fading and coming apart at the seams  literally  after only   wash wear cycles  i like the comfort of the material itself  but the workmanship is pretty deplorable  i cannot recommend these shirts to anyone      
195,1.0,                       my teenage son hated these saying they were scratchy and itchy   now he refuses to wear them      
196,5.0,                       well made  material is strong yet not too thick like some premium long sleeves are  it s a big deal to me that it has cuffs on the sleeves and that it s not too warm inside in winter  i would love to have some quality shirts like these with a breast pocket  but that s hard to find      
197,1.0,                       dislike  rough fabric  scratchy  might as well be wearing burkap      
198,5.0,                       as a woman buying a men s shirt  i had no expectations that it would fit me perfectly  but i just need a couple long sleeve tees for wearing under my scrubs at work and these were ideal  especially price wise  i have owned gildan brand t shirts before and know them to be a quality product  i am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely buy again      
199,5.0,                       i have started wearing long sleeve shirt to protect my arms from the sun  i ve had to have a number of pre cancer lesions treated on my forearms  and  i had actual skin cancer on my neck  so  protecting my skin on my arms is a goal these shirts are fantastic for the price  well made  they fit great  they hold up after many washings  and  they are heavy fabric for a t shirt  really quite heavy  and not light weight  so  if you want a thin shirt  don t buy these i ve purchased these several times  no disappointment      
200,5.0,                       i was looking for a long sleeve t shirt that is      cotton and that i could wear when working in the garden   and these t shirts hit the spot   i m a female and would normally take a small  but wanted the t shirts to be a little roomie   women t shirts just don t work when your working in the garden      
201,1.0,                       we have been buying these for years   my husband is a painter  and he always getsxl  just ordered another set of   xl white shirts and the arms are about     inches too short  big difference  we unfortunately cannot buy these anymore      
202,5.0,                       i ve bought these before  and they don t disappoint   my husband loves these for work  the quality is excellent  and the fit is perfect for him  i recommended this to all my friends  family and social media   the price is right too       
203,5.0,                       i have purchased gildan shirts before they are excellent bang for the buck for comparison i weighed several long sleeve t shirts i own on a digital scale research price and you will realize these shirts are best bang quality for the buck carhartt xl long sleeve pocket t shirt weighs      oz   xl for carhartt is really xxl in other brands hanes xxl beefy long sleeve t shirt weighs      ozgildan xxl long sleeve t shirt weighs      oz     
204,5.0,                       gilman ultra cotton   large  men s shirt was ordered to sleep in and they were washed along with gilman women s   xl  the charcoal cotton feels warm and comfy and are perfect to wear around house and sleep ini m a size       so ordered both larger to sleep ingreat a price too     
205,5.0,                       i am a lady and generally wear a large  i wanted a nice long sleeve shirt to wear around the house so bought the xl  it fits like an extra large as i wanted it larger  i washed and hung dry because i was afraid of shrinkage  overall i am happy with my purchase  i was they had more bright colors or jewel tones though      
206,1.0,                       i didn t realize that the wrong size came until after i had washed them  i remember clicking on medium twice due to i double check sizes when i check my cart  for some reason it didn t list the size and everytime i went back to click on medium it was on large  medium showed in stock and i clicked again  i needed these shirts last minute for school so i will be dealing with a rather large shirts for the next   months  if i wouldve seen the size before i washed them i would ve returned them      
207,1.0,                       this shirt is about     to a full size smaller than normal  got the  x  but fit like a  x  material was soft before washing   like burlap after washing  do not buy     
208,5.0,                       where i live in the summer it s very hot during the day  but at night it can get quite chilly  it s not cold enough to need a sweatshirt udually  so i picked up the shirts  they re perfect for when you need a bit of warmth  but you don t want to be hot  they launder well      
209,1.0,                       i bought several shirts from different places so i m too late in returning this  it s stiff to the point of being scratchy  the fabric after washing is wrinkled even with fabric softener dryer square  the neck and the cuffs are already  pilling   i would not recommend      
210,3.0,                       the quality of these gildan men s long sleeve t shirts has gone down drastically in the past two years  i would estimate the shrinkage at     or more and they come out of the dryer extremely wrinkled  they have added new colors which look nice but i m not at all happy with the shrinkage and wrinkles  if you ve ordered the gildan t shirts in the past  be prepared for the difference in quality      
211,1.0,                       fake cotton algongun recycled ocean plastic and yarn or something not right  sweat in it like a plastic bag  can t be cotton  to cheap to return and probably a poor shop rag      
212,4.0,                       the sleeves were somewhat long and large  other wise okay      
213,5.0,                       the heavy material is well crafted for an excellent fit  the heavy shirts have a tight neck and really hold out the chill  yet roomy enough to wear an undershirt  i always wear a shirt underneath in case the weather warms up and i ll still be wearing a t shirt these gildan long sleeve shirts use heavy material and they wash well and don t shrink and retain their shape  i like them best with a chest pocket but i must have overlooked that when i ordered mine  otherwise  they are great      
214,4.0,                       these are decent mediumweight shirts  generously sized a bit on the larger size  they ll shrink anyway  and say      cotton  wow for the price i m happy   gave   stars not   for a strange vinegar like odor in the product  i m thinking that ll wash out fine but could turn some other buyers off from keeping them      
215,5.0,                       my husband needed some plain undershirts for the winter  he s tall with long arms and ya know  fabric shrinks up on him with a couple  cold  washes it seems his sleeves and hem arent working their way up  after a couple washes and wears  so far  the sweing is a little wonky in spots  but again  under shirts      
216,5.0,                       extremely comfortable and durable shirt  it runs slightly big  but it s crazy comfy     
217,4.0,                       these are nice shirts  very comfortable  correctly sized  and appear to hold their shape and size  though we haven t run them through the drier yet  they were a gift to my son and he really likes the softness of the material   if i have one concern it s that they are very light weight  i thought they might be thicker  but overall we re satisfied with the purchase      
218,5.0,                       these are great shirts  order a size larger though if you like them loose  i usually get a  xlarge because i like them a little loose after first shrinkage from washing drying  and these are fine  just slightly tighter than my hanes  but they cost half of the hanes  and i like the material better  it s a little heavier  excellent shirts      
219,2.0,                       this review is for the gray shirts  i also ordered the yellow and they fit ok  but the gray    ugh    read on i ordered a size large  i am           lbs and a     waist the good   the shirt material quality is better than expected    i like that the shirt extends past my belt the bad   fits too loose around the waste  but once washed i bet it will be better    the sleeves are too short  i can t reach up without the sleeve pulling down my forearm  once i wash this i imagine it will be unwearable so unless you have short arms and a large waste  i d pass on these  i will get one use out of them  then they will be cut into shop rags  i will not buy again      
220,2.0,                       i have had good luck with gildan t shirts before  and this one bears the premium price that would seem reasonable for the quality i ve previously experienced   but these t shirts don t justify the price  and maybe don t even justify buying    the shirts are thin enough that you can see through them if you hold them up to the light  and are scratchy   they are just serviceable enough that i m not going to go through the hassle of returning  but i definitely would not purchase again      
221,5.0,                       at        the xl seems just right  the fabric is lighter and just right for my use  while i have bought many of these over the years and been satisfied with the quality  things are changing  the collar is beginning to separate and the body is  pilling  more than usual  i m watching this batch closely      
222,4.0,                       i purchased these shirts strictly to wear as a first layer for cool weather hiking  and they re fine for that  and well made   nice neckline with no wrinkling  as an outer shirt i would say the shirt  medium  is a bit on the small side  so i would try a large if i intended to use it that way  and hope the sleeves wouldn t be too long      
223,5.0,                       husband wears these  beautifully  perfectly plain jane  long sleeve shirts under his or scrubs  comfortable  stand up to frequent laundering without shrink  and reasonably priced  he s not allowed to wear any  undershirts t shirts  of color or logos  etc  so these plain vanilla shirts are spot on perfect  he s a shorter man         so the sleeves are a bit long  but otherwise  we re very pleased with this product      
224,1.0,                       the shirts they sent me have pockets and nowhere did it say it had pockets  these were for a project that could not have pockets  really disappointed      
225,4.0,                       nice simple medium lightweight and saturated color royal blue for me the large is slightly small in the chest     and the arms near the wrist are a bit snug for me many  large  shirts are more like  tall  sized    longer and skinnier than fuller in the chest and shorter length  wish they would offer  full  large    vs   tall large      
226,5.0,                       great shirts fr the money  i one several colors  i order xxl and they shrink to the perfect xl size for me  the cloth is very comfortable and warm  the thickness of the material seems to vary by color and when you purchase the shirts  some of my white long sleeves are thinner than other ones i own  i would suggest this as a good shirt to purchase  buy one size larger and after a warm wash and drying it will shrink perfectly      
227,2.0,                       i purchased   of the large black long sleeve t shirts for working outdoors pros   quick delivery  good price  and decent fit  maybe a little snug cons   quality of material   very rough   hard to believe it s cotton   can t fathom what the  ultra  must mean wore one for   hours   will replace with something more closer to the norm in softness      
228,1.0,                       i m confused with the good ratings  i ordered white which are      cotton  i washed them  by themselves  to shrink them a little  when i dried them they were a wrinkled mess hot out of the dryer and not soft  i decided to put some wet towels in with them for a retry   still a stiff wrinkled mess  i attempted to iron them   each shirt took like    minutes to iron  i just wanted these for comfy shirts  they aren t comfy and look feel terrible after a wash  returning   i won t be wearing these      
229,1.0,                       both shirts got a tear in them in less than a month  i use them for school lineman pole climbing  and they tore way to easy  did not hold up  they also shrunk a lot  and i wash in cold water and low heat  sleeves go up to high now  pretty disappointed      
230,1.0,                       description said       cotton and polyester but i got      cotton i waited too long for this and i cant return it because i have to wear something i needed the polyester for working in the hot sun     
231,4.0,                       the fit of these shirts was just a bit more snug than i expected   if you wear a medium size and want some roominess in the fit  then a large might be a better option   the shirts appear to be well made of medium weight cotton   one caution  these shirts are not colorfast   for their first cleaning i washed them by hand in the sink with woolite   cold water   i was right  lots of colored water while washing them   they will bleed in the washing machine and tint other clothing      
232,5.0,                       excellent product for the price  my style is pretty plain and more focused on being comfy so these are perfect for me  i m female and order a mens medium so if they shrink i have some room to work with  they re soft and exactly what i needed      
233,5.0,                       i went on amazon looking for a very casual long sleeved t shirt  another brand  but ended up buying the gildan i received two shirts for the low price and both were well made and fit nicely  i ordered xlarge  they shrink a bit as they are made mostly from cotton but still fit fine after washing i can t beat the price  the fit  nor the quality for my particular purpose      
234,1.0,                       i bought these shirts for work and decided to wash them and get the new fabric chemical smell out before i wore them for a full day in the shop  the bottom hem completely came out of both shirts in the dryer and turned all my clothes into a giant  wet  balled up knot  i had to cut away all the thread in order to get everything apart so i could actually dry my clothes  both shirts are ruined and i never got the chance to wear them now  before anyone goes to user error  i followed the washing directions printed on the tag and even erred on the gentler settings for both wash and dry  i also have also owned a textiles business in the past and have done plenty of industrial sewing  this was simply shoddy craftsmanship on the part of whomever sewed these shirts save your money and buy something with a little better quality      
235,1.0,                       the t shirt  nightwear  is of poor quality  the fabric was thin and rough  the elastic on the wrist is unusually tight and the overall fit was small  i am about     and the recommended size was small  guess could have gone with medium   disappointed  i am returning this      
236,1.0,                         of the   i purchased had holes in the armpit area within a couple weeks  i won t ever buy from this company or brand again      
237,1.0,                       did anyone at gildan actually try on these shirts  if so  they would have discovered the  cotton  in these things are of horrible quality  the material is very abrasive  sure it says  cotton   but it s far from being soft  ou will not be satisfied  better to pay a bit more and get something nicer      
238,4.0,                       i ordered   sets of these long sleeve t shirts  different colors    they have heavy fabric   bright colors   the only problem was one set  orange one  came with socks in the package instead of the shirts   ha    however  the t shirts are so nice i have ordered a replacement orange pair   the price is great too     t shirts for about     after tax   i am not going to return the socks  they  look  nice and are probably about the same price      
239,5.0,                       bought these to use with a tie dye kit and cricut machine  it s so hard to find these plain type shirts in stores now a days  everything fit perfectly and is priced so reasonable  great find i m very happy with how the shirts worked out for the project      
240,5.0,                       i like to material and construction of the product  the wrist are just right and have good elasticity  the material is comfortable against the skin  i will be washing these items sometime soon and will dry them on low heat  i am expecting this product to hold up to laundering  any issues will be posted here at this time  i would recommend this product      
241,5.0,                       the shirts are      cotton and are a nice weight  i bought a bunch more with different colors  but you have to double check because it s different colors are different contents such as       or            
242,5.0,                       i ve  bought these tee s  in a different color before  they hold up great  i got a stain on my t shirt it came out easy  they don t wrinkle easy  look good all day  these are as good as the ones you pay        each for  not thin at all      
243,5.0,                       if you don t like plumbers crack this is the shrt for you  good quality shirt and a great value as it s a two pack  i m very pleased      
244,1.0,                       too small   material is rough   will not buy again      
245,4.0,                       ordered this for my son  it fit well in all areas except around neck where it was ever so slightly snug in that area snug enough to notice but not enough to return item and not uncomfortable to wear  just enough to mention if that is problematic for anyone considering this product      
246,5.0,                       gildan is one of the best brand t shirts  i bought then to wear around with tights and jeans  they are good and comfortable when running erand especially if you don t feel like dressing up  i ordered xl for me and my husband  i thought the price was a very good deal for two shirts  i really like them  would recommed gildan brand to anyone considering t shirts for casual dress  wearing with jean  working ou and  ladies wearing tights  every bit of five stars         
247,5.0,                       time to shift from short sleeve summer tees to long sleeves  ordered these in white  two in a pack    such a deal    great fit  great weight  they come out of the dryer nearly wrinkle free  i ordered   gray shirts and   black shirts  couldn t be happier with this purchase      
248,1.0,                       originally  big and comfortable  thanks now  threads coming undone   not certain i would recommend them any longer      
249,1.0,                       fell apart after    washings  disappointing  it s as if it was a  second  or something  came apart at the sleeves seam      
250,5.0,                       i m glad that i purchased several of these shirts at once  they are good quality long sleeve t shirts  they would have been perfect if they had pockets  but they are still great  nice and cool even on a hot day  and no more sunburned arms  minimal shrinkage after laundering and the dryer  well recommended      
251,1.0,                       ordered two large shirts   shirts were indeed marked large but were at least two sizes to small   a previous order i ordered a large champion sweatshirt and a large champion long sleeved t shirt   the sweatshirt fit perfectly but the t shirt was at least two sizes small   it s tough to buy clothes from amazon   the sizes are all over the place      
252,3.0,                       a large size should easily be appropriate for me for any shirt but this shrunk down to a medium at best  sleeves are to short  shirt is to tight  also i had read on line mixed reviews about comfort     soft  not soft  the not soft was clearly correct  i had to wash it literally  x to make it tolerable  i would not recommend this product and i would return it if it were not for having to go out to return it      
253,3.0,                       i brought this for my    year old nephew  he usually wears a small in mens  small in mens is a bit loose on him  but when i brought this shirt it was a little tight  i recommend going a size up  the shirt is not really stretchy or soft  it is pretty thick  it s not something i would buy again  only brought this for a halloween costume  the shirt is ok  i think you can find a better one though      
254,5.0,                       not the long sleeve  t  i expected  just want wanted something extra for the colder days to wear under the button down shirts so i wouldn t need a jacket  it s quality is superior  it s the quality in what you d expect in a mock neck shirts for more money  it can certainly be worn by itself with dress pants and look great  i have  it s a great value as well  i got the  x for the extra tucking and they delivered update just bought another    this time black  awesome shirts  will be buying      
255,1.0,                       i ve worn  xl in shirts and tees for the last       yrs  these shirts shrunk like raisins  i only wore one out of the four purchased and donated to a  smaller friend   they are      cotton good quality shirts  i ordered       xl hopefully they will be on the money      
256,4.0,                       fit is great  just a little bit longer than a  normal  t shirt  so it covers your belt and plumbers crack well shirts are thick and seem to be great material my only problem  is i don t like the  cuffs  on the end of the sleeve  but i feel like that s more a personal preference than a problem with this shirt overall great shirts      
257,5.0,                       i take a xx l because i am shall we say round   often when i buy xx l products the sleeves are too long   if i get something xl it is too tight around my abdomen   i returned one long sleeve t because the sleeves were crazy long   these are a cut little tighter at the cuff and fit great   plus the price can t be beat   i immediately ordered     more two packs as soon as i tried on the fist one   it is funny that some colors are      cotton and another color is       poly cotton blend   i got the color that s a       blend and although i generally prefer      cotton  this is a nice fabric too      
258,5.0,                       i like these shirts but i did want to comment on shrinking  i got these to have a nice casual long sleeve shirt for the not very cold winters in ca  despite knowing a l fits perfectly i m unisex items  i went with the xl  i ve now dried these shirts twice and the shrinkage was not very dramatic  i m a size    women s and the l would have fit fine and probably more flattering  if i reorder will get that size      
259,4.0,                       pros   these are good quality t shirts   the blended fabric feels very good and the shirt is well constructed   i literally live in pocket t shirts and i recommend these cons   the size is not quite accurate   i have lost weight and now my current  x pocket t shirts have become a bit loose   so i ordered these one size smaller in  x  xl   but they were the same size as my current  x   so i have re ordered l  large   rather than xl  i will have to update my review when the new smaller size arrives      
260,1.0,                       this was easily the worst thing i ever wore in my life  i initially thought the material was rough because the shirts have not been washed or needed fabric softener but even after all that it was like wearing a shirt made of human hair or wool  shirt was extremely rough and inflexible    i wore it under a worth work shirt  and had to take it off   hours into my shift      
261,5.0,                       this is a great long sleeve t shirt   i often where it as a layer like long underwear in the winter   but also looks great by itself without layers   very soft and washes up great   and didn t shrink noticeably   i like the stretchy wrist bands   great for a night shirt too   the fit was perfect with enough room for my middle aged body parts   the navy color is deep and rich looking   and the white    is very bright   i really like the length that comes down below the hips   making for a neater look tucked in too      
262,5.0,                       i purchased these for myself  a women  i am a petite sized  size    women and purchased a men s large as i like things large to wear comfortably around the house  these men s size large shirts were horribly tight and small on me  so i can not image they would properly fit a man  the cuffs around the wrist area   i have very small hands and wrists are extremely tight  so again  i can not fathom them fitting a man comfortably at all      
263,1.0,                       this isn t cotton  i may have known that if i read down two pages into the description  some colors are all cotton  some are not  now i have to send it back  thanks for wasting my time      
264,3.0,                       i m            lbs  i bought the medium  the body is ok  an average cut  making it a little loose on me  and the sleeves an inch or so too short  the material is not soft and starting to fray pile after a couple of washings i ll stick with  hanes tagless long sleeve t shirt with a pocket  in the future  the hanes is about twice as much but has better fabric and a pocket  the hanes is noticeably tighter however  in case you try them  many color options      
265,5.0,                       i like these shirts   i do not dry them in the dryer avoiding any shrinkage    they are the perfect size now   i dry them by hanging then i soften them in the dryer after they are already dry   they are nicely constructed and fit my extremely muscular    lb body      
266,5.0,                       this is a very nice long sleeve shirt   the fabric is softer than i expected which is nice   it fits well and did not shrink when washing   it is not too bulky but is warm enough for a cool day   i loved the variety of colors it came in
