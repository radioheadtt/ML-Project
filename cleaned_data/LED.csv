0,3.0,                       i ended up returning these because they wouldn t connect to amazon alexapros the lights are easy to setup and feel high quality unlike some of the other led lights  this feels on par with philips hue quality and other high end light light strips  these bend somewhat easy as long as you don t need it to be near a     angle but will move over a gradual turn and have pretty good color replication the negative it would never connect to my internet through the app and the app is also quite a bit janky  it had a very noticeable amount of lag between optioning the app and being able to connect to the lights to change the color  then the on off master switches to turn all the lights off on in a room rarely worked however the timer function did alright  these lights aren t the brightest led lights ever and it would take a decent amount of them       to light up a whole room which is getting into the realm of just buying philips hue bulbs  which i ultimately did would i recommend  if you just want to set your lights on a color and forget it as accent lighting around one or two things then sure however if you want to change the colors semi frequently  connect to alexa  google home or siri or have an app that actually works and connects quickly or lighting up your whole room then i would suggest you invest in philips hue as they are quantifiably better      
1,5.0,                       works great  very easy to setup  took about    minutes to stick strips to my daugters window  connect it to the app and have it in sync with alexa  would buy it again     
2,5.0,                       so far so good  put the lights on daughter s loft bed and she loves them  easy to set up  app gives you a great deal of control  allows us to turn them off without going in her room  already ordered a  nd set for younger daughter who is very jealous of how cool they look on big sister s bed
