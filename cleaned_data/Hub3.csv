0,4.0,                       reviews were correct that it not always connects devices at once  but just have to turn off and back on and usually resets signal  i bought a power supply to use and works good so far      
1,5.0,                       no complaints   it does it s job perfectly      
2,5.0,                       great little gizmo for all the extra usb devices that i have      
3,5.0,                       i went bought and return several other usb powered hubs  all had power or stability issues       
4,5.0,                       this usb hub is great has more than enough ports     
5,5.0,                       works great for its intended purpose  expansion of the number of usb connections      
6,5.0,                       usb     speeds to all ports  but not at the same time  which should be expected    i like the fact i can switch unused ports off when not in use  and make it so usb     connections to my pc are easy to reach and plug into   would buy this again if i needed another one      
7,5.0,                       like many i have several thumb drives  in the past when i needed one i would root through  root my collection   now my most used thumb drives are easy to access  i have used other hubs for years  they were all or nothing  i e   all the thumb drives would show up on my screen  contributing to the mess  i currently have five thumb drives in the hub  none show up until i punch the  on off  button  no fuss  no mess  just access at the push of a button      
8,3.0,                       did not come with a power adapter  so you can t really use it for charging  i work at an electronics manufacturer  so i got an adapter that should have been compatible  but the device cuts out when it s powered  i use it to power external drives in their own powered bays  so it doesn t really matter  but it would have been nice to have been able to charge other devices off of it      
9,5.0,                       it s great and does the job completely      
10,5.0,                       works as advertised     
11,5.0,                       arrived on time  simple to use  filled all seven slots and it works as advertised      
12,5.0,                       practical  easy to use and well designed      
13,5.0,                       works exactly how it s intended to  haven t had any issues      
14,5.0,                       good size with plenty of spacing for big fingers  blue lights are bright  so we had to figure a way to set it up out of line of sight  seems to work well with everything  it works      
15,5.0,                       this was a replacement for a very old hub  this has more useful sockets  i like that you can turn each on or off as you need      
16,5.0,                       the best thing about this hub is the cord length   i bought it because i needed a hub to get from my computer under my desk and be able to plug in thumbdrives and usb drives without having to climb under the desk   most other hubs are    cord tops  but this one is long enough that the hub sits nicely under my monitor     
17,5.0,                       i love this because i had so many extra ports and did not have to have them  hot  i could leave the usb in and just turn the switch off great product    recommend to anyone who is interested     
18,5.0,                       very happy     
19,5.0,                       working from home and works great for all i have to use     
20,5.0,                       the appearance is exquisite  i like it very much  and the price is also very satisfactory  after i received this hub  i really felt that the quality was very good and it was very convenient to use  i highly recommend this hub      
21,1.0,                       this thing doesn t work  it keeps shorting out  and all i have plugged in are two cords   one for an android phone and the other an apple phone   i keep losing power when i use this thing verses receiving a charge      
22,5.0,                       i didn t want a hub that needed an ac plug   with this unit  you just plug into a usb port and you re ready i ve had it a week and it works great   i can take seven usb connections   you can turn any of these on or off   indicated by bright blue light when on i  would recommend this affordable unit      
23,5.0,                       i needed a usb hub  this is one  i purchased it  it works i really was impressed at how well it handles power from a regular usb port good e nuff      
24,3.0,                       returned   cord too short     
25,1.0,                       this hardly ever works   worst charge my iphone or watch     
26,5.0,                       i had a      memory sticks to program at work  i bought   of these and   usb     from another company these worked great  i didn t have connection problems at all  the usb     on the other hand  had multiple connection problems  the     connectors were not tight  thus making poor connections these     connectors were nice and tight and made solid connections      
27,1.0,                       multiple port failures in less than   months  won t recognize my portable hd drive anymore   threw it in the trash where it belongs  maybe you ll get lucky and won t get a lemon  like i did  money wasted on this  unfortunate  since the reviews were good      
28,5.0,                       i love this product it s small enough to hide on the bottom of my desk without it being seen  also love the on and off switches on the product makes it easier for me to turn stuff off that i don t want to be on  very well put together product and would highly recommend if you are looking for a usb extender  was a little nervous about mouse and keyboard lagging with   different things plugged into the same usb port on the computer but it works really well and it hasn t given me any problem       recommend again if you are looking for a well put together usb extender      
29,5.0,                       excellent quality hub very well built and durable  i have gone through hubs but this is by far the best hub i have ever used   highly recommend this vendor s products     
30,4.0,                       it works  the buttons are a little cheap and kinda feel like they might fall out  if i m being picky  but it s a pretty cheap product  it works well and doesn t heat up  i have all usb outlets used for my wfh setup  i don t use it for data transfer  just my mouse  keyboard  led light strips  web cam and a few monitors      
31,5.0,                       i had no idea i needed this many connections until i had it  now i wish i had another  excellent fit and finish  feel solid and functions perfectly      
32,5.0,                       it works  the buttons provide good amount of safety if you use usb keys and or drives      
33,1.0,                       this product worked well for the first two weeks  then it stopped charging  i tested multiple sources and devices  ended up returning it  based on positive reviews  the once i received could have been a rare occurrence      
34,5.0,                       this     hub can use a variety of usb devices  plug and play  convenient and practical  i chose it because of its reasonable price  small size  and stylish appearance  while providing multiple ports at the same time  i am very satisfied      
35,5.0,                       great        
36,4.0,                       put this in my classroom  the only issue i have currently is the usb port going to my laptop  it seems a little loose which had me constantly checking to make sure it was secure   other then that  i have   usb plugged in and everything has enough power   i d buy another one      
37,1.0,                       bought this for the longer cord       replaced existing hub with this vemont and after connecting all the exact same external usb devices my laptop wouldn t shut down or reboot properly  reconnected my old hub and laptop worked fine  tried the vemont a second time and laptop wouldn t shut down or reboot  junk   don t buy it      
38,5.0,                       nice  doesn t feel flimsy like other inexpensive ones  wish i could have afforded one with more spots  but i am happy with what i have  much better than the last pos i got  worth what i spent  would consider going back back to them in the future      
39,1.0,                       i never saw a usb hub without a power included      
40,5.0,                       i really like the built in cable   it is the perfect length for my needs   it is nice to be able to disconnect a device via the on off switch without having to have to unplug it      
41,4.0,                       i great usb hub     
42,2.0,                       like   the amount of plug ins do not like   once a thumb drive is plugged in and off switch for that drive is turned off   and you later turn switch on  flash drive won t function  until you take it back out of hub and re plug it back in  so  what is the purpose of on off switches      
43,5.0,                       good deal      
44,2.0,                       this thing only works when it wants too  most of the outlets only work once in awhile  i do not recommend  at all      
45,5.0,                       as a person with many different usb peripherals  this device has become an important part of me  it makes switching between devices simple and fast  its charging efficiency is high  all ports work well  and the button click is firm  which seems insignificant  but i m not worried about them getting stuck or the spring wearing  this is a good product      
46,5.0,                       would purchase again      
47,1.0,                       some of the usb ports stopped working     
48,5.0,                        i need an active hub to keep up with the many devices that need to be charged every day  and this device works well  i want to be able to keep all power cords plugged in and open and close ports  especially external drives  each device i own uses a different kind of usb cable than the next one  and has   different connections  which saves me the trouble of plugging in the power adapter these buttons are easy to press and the port lights up when opened  my charging of devices has been simplified  and they charge faster than standard plug in power adapters  under load  i didn t feel the heat from the hub or any wires       
49,5.0,                    cumple su funci n        
50,5.0,                    acorde a mis espectativas         
51,5.0,                       this product is easy to install and use  my self built computer does not have many usb slots so this makes it much easier to use multiple usb devices at once without having to constantly switch everything around  works consistently and the length of the cord makes it easy to store out of the way when needed      
52,5.0,                       it has done everything so far as advertised  plenty of plugs and the transfer speed has worked for me so far       
53,1.0,                       i don t know how this product got such good reviews i installed it plugged in three portable hard drives switch them on by switching the buttons on opened one on my computer and then all three portable hard drives became corrupt i lost thousands of videos and music files and documents that i needed very badly thanks to my smart thinking i back up my drives otherwise they would have been permanently lost and i would have never been able to get them back again unless i spent hundreds of dollars for someone to fix these drives if they could be fixed i will never buy this product again and recommend everyone stay away from it this product is awful      
54,5.0,                       i m very pleased with my purchase  it s working well      
55,5.0,                       i haven t had any problems with this hub and it supplies enough power to charge my phone  the lead is long enough to reach the front of most pcs  no complaints at all      
56,1.0,                       absolute junk  hub drops connection to hard drive moments after connecting  and that s with only one or two small drives out of a total of seven ports      
57,4.0,                       nice size  on and off swithces allow to turn on or tuen off devices to save energy     
58,5.0,                       it was exactly what i needed to connect my mouse and hard drive to my laptop     
59,1.0,                       i havent had this very long but i immediately noticed constant issues with this no matter the bandwidth needed  i hooked up a usb audio interface and audio was no longer being recognized with it  occasionally itd register it and work for a few secons and then it would disconnect until i fiddle with the usb s and kept repeating  so i plug this into another usn hub and wallah it works perfectly again  okay fine so i take the loss there assuming it was just too much bandwith for the lenth of the cable  so the next day i plugged in a ps  controller into it to play some games and what a surprise it works     or does it  it holds connection much longer than the other device but this too eventually disconnects after about   or so minutes keep in mind only one usb is being used on the hub at a time  basically this device is useless to me now and i clearly should have paid the extra    to     for a better branded hub avoid this at all costs      
60,5.0,                       the   port usb data hub is great   i like the individual on off switches   i recommend this product  to anyone who has multiple flash drives      
61,5.0,                       i received this hub today and immediately test all the ports   everything works just fine   the cord is longer than most which is a plus   i m very happy with this hub      
62,1.0,                       it was very disappointing  especially after reading many good reviews  when i had   and   hard drives connected to it  it worked well  as soon as i connected three others  it would simply not power them up  i sent it back  i really wanted this to work  but it likely needs an external power source for it to work      
63,3.0,                       i like the switches and lights for each individual usb port but it seems to be very slow to charge items  very useful tho  if u have many items to charge  quite small and seems durable      
64,5.0,                       i love the charging speed and the on off switch making it easy to switch between the devices plugged in  unlike most others it can detect the differences between devices plugged in and works great      
65,5.0,                       i like that this product has a long cord that reaches to the back of my computer that s not easy to reach   being able to turn off ports not in use is an added bonus   i also like that it s small and inconspicuous on my desk      
66,1.0,                       it worked okay at first  i plugged in an external hard drive and it read it  but wouldn t write to it  then an error popped up saying i had a power surge  and now my  tb drive is useless and unrecoverable  if you buy this  stick to usb flash drives or small usb accessories      
67,5.0,                       this works great   we ickes this up to help with my son s recordings for his yt gaming channel   between the ipad  elgato  remote  webcam  mic  and etc  the usb ports on his macbook are taken up very quickly and this allows the perfect expansion so he can plug everything in   we have noticed no lag with it and everything seems to work great   we have not used it for power though   we have no need for charging via usb and the unit doesn t come with the cord so we are not using it for that purpose   as a usb expansion though it s spot on and for the money you can t beat it      
68,5.0,                       this usb hub is really great for pc transfers or just to add a few additional usb s to your pc   i chose it because of its reasonable price  small size  and stylish appearance  while providing multiple ports at the same time  also the cord is longer than most which is a plus  i m very happy with this hub  i would highly recommend this product      
69,1.0,                       i bought this in august     installed it about   weeks ago   october  it worked great for a bit  then randomly stopped working      
70,5.0,                       i have a camera plugged in and turn it off when not in use rather than having it always on when the laptop is on      
71,4.0,                       i had a few occurrences where it would not let me use all of the ports at once  after awhile i messed around with it for a bit and got it to work      
72,5.0,                       straight out of the box and working like a dream  plenty of power for all ports to be utilized at once      
73,5.0,                       perfect size to meet my needs  i like every switch      
74,5.0,                       i like the option of turning each usb connection on and off  everything charges well      
75,5.0,                       usb charging ports make keeping your phone  tablet and anything else full of juice all the time  no waiting for it either it s done in no time
