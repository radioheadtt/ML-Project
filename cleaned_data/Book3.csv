1,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is one of our favorite books   we have printed out pictures of each of the animals in the book  laminated them  and then hide them in my   year old s bedroom with a removable tacky putty   i move them around as she remembers where they are  but as we read the book  i ask her to find the animals   i also made her binoculars by putting colored paper around two toilet paper rolls that i hot glued together and attached a string at one end to go around her neck  when monitored   she loves it and it makes the book and story that much more enjoyable   the hard board book is very durable and great

3,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this book has been almost a daily read for my baby  from infant until now at    months my baby has loved this book and already able to say most of the words  this book is interactive theres a slide and read version as well   rhythmic  it expresses shapes  colors  you can introduce the names of the animals    the sounds the animals make  my baby sings  brown bear brown bear  whenever he sees the book on the shelf or around the house      
4,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i have always been a fan of anything eric carle  and this was no exception  i haven t read as much of bill martin jr  s writings  but what i have read i enjoyed  i can remember reading this book to my younger brother when he was little  and now i get to do the same with my son  the illustrations are so unique and eye catching  i really like this book because it also helps teaching the names of many types of animals  it is a good length for a quick story  but long enough that you may not have to read more than one  the phrases is this book flow nicely  and always make my son smile  if you are just starting to find books for you little one  this is a good choice  as well as      chicka chicka boom boom  board book                         by bill martin jr and      the very hungry caterpillar                        by eric carle      
5,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this wonderful book with colorful pictures will make a reader out of most children   you read the book with the child a couple of times   next thing you know the child is reading the book   in the back are some basic comprehension exercises  these tasks assure you that your child can read and does not have the book memorized   instead the child knows the names of the individual words      
6,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       its hard to find books newborns and infants    they wont really pay attention to many books  and i have plenty that i have tried  i started reading this to my son starting at     months and he has loved it  he is now   months and loves it too  its short  sweet  and has a cute rhythm to it  does not rhyme   the pictures are vibrant enough to catch his attention and not overly cluttered  there is just one animal on each page and babies love that    clear outline of an animal  i have other books with seemingly pretty illustrations that are bright and colorful but my son could care less about those i highly recommend this book and even buy it as gifts for new moms  it is a classic for every nursery also  i want to note that i dont get sick of reading it over and over        
7,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       despite this book being a classic  i wasn t sure my toddler would actually like this because of its illustrations  but i was wrong   he loves this book  great book for teaching basic animals and practicing animal sounds together      
8,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       so the story is a classic  that s not debatable and that is not what my   star rating is about  my issue is the make of the book  this is obviously a book for toddlers and it is described as a board book  however  board books have thicker  cardboard  hence the board in board book  pages that are easier for little hands to turn  this anniversary edition has durable pages that are laminated and thicker that standard children s books  but they are much thinner than typical board book pages and thus more difficult for toddlers to manipulate  i don t like it  i have noticed other publishers going this way with their board books as well and i don t understand it      
9,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       nicely sized board book for very small hands  just to be clear  since there seem to be rather a lot of variations of this book  isbn                is a board book with no sliding panels  that s probably just as well since those things tend to jam when handled by toddlers  but it s nice to be sure exactly what you re getting with each version
