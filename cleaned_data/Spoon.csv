68,5.0,                       very good product      
69,4.0,                       these are sturdy  well shaped  smooth  and well formed  the only thing i found is that i ordered the tea spoons and dinner spoons  which i assumed from the description were different sizes  the two products indicate different lengths  and the boxes have different names  but they are the exact same products in side the boxes  i would call each of them a tablespoon or soup spoon      
70,5.0,                       our   year old likes to help clean and throw things away  we found ourselves with   spoons left       i really didn t want to spend     for   new sets when he only threw spoons away  i have these a try and very happy with them

95,5.0,                       a little bigger than the average teaspoon   but i don t really mind   very well made and looks good   so very satisfied      
96,3.0,                       the spoon quality is ok  but the dinner spoon and the teaspoon size is virtually identical  see picture  now i have    spoons of the same size  not worth the hassle of returning

99,5.0,                       not much to write about spoons but i like them and price is good  they are a decent size  i thought they would be a little smaller but still like the size of them      
100,1.0,                       far too thin and lightweight also way too small for a dinner spoon this is more like a large teaspoon  i was expecting more girth and weight  don t get me wrong they re pretty and polished immaculately  but they are too thin and small for everyday use      
101,5.0,                       i was quite pleased with these spoons  the size was perfect   not to small and not a huge serving spoon  the design was plain so they blended nicely with my other silverware and they were polished and free of scratches      
102,4.0,                       spoons are bigger than teaspoon but not as big as soup soups      
103,5.0,                       there are amazing  so smooth and shiny and they look expensive  great if you want a simple spoon that will last      
104,4.0,                       very good deal for the price but you get what you pay for   these spoons are just fine our family and you can t beat the price   if anyone else has a kid who throws there spoons in the trash can like mine  then these are the spoons for you  pretty thin but i love the shape and size      
105,5.0,                       perfect replacement      
106,3.0,                       they re shaped a little odd  but get the job done      
107,5.0,                       the feel in your hand is much nicer than you d expect for spoons in this price range   they have a pleasing heft to them      
108,5.0,                       was looking for soup spoons just the right size  these were perfect      
109,5.0,                       look nice and are very sturdy for a family who is typically unnecessarily rough on utensils    would definitely purchase again

111,4.0,                       quality great   a tad larger then expected for a teaspoon   but size was exact from description

136,5.0,                       they were a little bigger than i expected  kind of in between a teaspoon and soup spoon but perfect for what we need them for      
137,4.0,                       bulk production spoons are nice for the price but i did notice variations in manufacturing      
138,3.0,                       these are not heavyweight spoons  bend easily   maybe for the price it should be expected  but they don t hold a candle to some of the brand name flatware   finish is okay though      
139,5.0,                       what can i say its a spoon     
140,5.0,                       obsessed with these  very pretty and hold their shape well  would highly recommend     
141,3.0,                       good in a pinch but not very sturdy     
142,5.0,                       we ordered a few sets of knives  forks  and spoons and are extremely impressed with how great and durable the product is  ordered at     pm on a wednesday and they arrived by thursday morning  thank you for the great service      
143,4.0,                       i love the spoons and i plan on ordering the teaspoons next  i have teenage grandsons and i keep on having to replace silverware  these are a good value for the money      
144,5.0,                       great product for price     
145,4.0,                       i would buy these again  you can t beat the price for the amount you get  we were always running out of spoons and these do the job      
146,5.0,                       with teenagers in the house  we never seem to have enough spoons   i bought these on a whim and was pleasantly surprised   they are the first spoons everyone grabs in the drawer   nice shape and weight      
147,5.0,                       a little too large but no big deal  they look great and are very strong     
148,5.0,                       i had very few tablespoons left so after looking at the different ones available i choose these   they are a great set of spoons   my old ones are more oblong but i like these much better because they are round and make a great spoon for eating soup or cereal   all the spoons were in excellent shape with no flaws   they are a solid good quality spoon that i would recommend buying if you need tablespoons      
149,5.0,                       they ve made it through the dishwasher so i m happy      
150,5.0,                       great product     
151,5.0,                       found what i ve been looking for   similar to what i previously have    light  not heavy to handle    just the right size for a dinner spoon    i m happy to my purchase        
152,5.0,                       exactly what i was looking for and at a great price   the delivery was on time   i am very pleased with my purchase

154,5.0,                       very nice just like the rest that i purchased from here  also  just like the forks i purchased from here they are the nicest utensils ive ever owned   they look classy and very sturdy   only thing i cant comment on yet is rust factor  i dont think these will have a problem  they are really nice   i really like them      
155,5.0,                       pretty good size   that s all that matters to me  gets the food in my mouth lol idk what to say   if you need a decent sized spoon  these are good  good price too     
156,5.0,                       these are a great product     
157,5.0,                       they get the job done      
158,5.0,                       best teaspoons i ve purchased   i love the weight   smoothness of these spoons   i have sensitive hands   these spoons don t dig into them when i use them to stir      
159,1.0,                       trying to figure out how to return  left black marks on my food after first use  we washed first      
160,5.0,                       great shine and good weight      
161,5.0,                       perfect     
162,5.0,                       bought these as the last set i bought  different brand  is slowly disappearing thanks to roommates taking them to work for lunch and not bringing it back home when done  the other set was ok   these actually are better looking and have a much nicer feel to them than i was expecting   it was a pleasant surprise considering the cost wasn t very high  once these have all disappeared  i ll be looking to buy this brand again i did buy these when they were on sale on prime day   but after seeing them  i would buy again even at normal price      
163,5.0,                       simply elegant and good value for money    nice seller too      
164,5.0,                       great value for special event setups in corporate account  cheaper than renting and have in house for continued cost savings      
165,5.0,                       i found myself needing spoons but didn t want to buy all new dishes  these are nice and shiny and don t look like they ll chip  they re a little bigger than i expected but they work great      
166,5.0,                       i use these spoons every day  very pleased withe them     
167,5.0,                       we like the light  simple  smooth design      
168,5.0,                       great for the price     
169,5.0,                       needed to order something to match my current set as apparently kids think they are like plastic ware      
170,5.0,                       i bought some other spoons through amazon which were described as sturdy   nope   so i was relieved when i received these and they are great   no bending   perfect slightly larger size   just right      
171,5.0,                       i read the reviews before buying and i knew it would be larger than tea spoons  and that what i wanted  good quality  not bad      
172,5.0,                       very good value and sturdy spoons  went through the dishwasher just fine  the thank you card was a thoughtful touch      
173,5.0,                       beautiful     
174,3.0,                       i got the wrong size     
175,5.0,                       thus far these have had up to a family of five and running the dishwasher if not hand washing at least twice a day      
176,5.0,                       the spoons are good looking  durable  wash easily  no spotting  and are a good length  easy for kids and adults      
177,5.0,                       very good size      
178,5.0,                       love these  nice and simple design  yet sturdy  i was worried they d feel and look and cheap  because of how cheap they were  but i read the reviews before purchasing and they did not disappoint      
179,5.0,                       not flimsy  made to last decent price      
180,4.0,                       these are good stainless steel spoons that were bought for school and work lunches  i also bought the hiware teaspoons in the same pattern  my plan was for us to use them with thermos  including my daughter s    oz zorijushi food jar  the dinner spoon can reach the bottom of the    oz jar  but not comfortably  another problem is that the difference between the teaspoon and dinner spoon is very small  in length and the size of the bowl  which makes it difficult to sort and stack in my flatware drawer      
181,5.0,                       nice product     
182,5.0,                       larger than expected  site said teaspoon  dinner spoon was larger than expected   like what i call a soup spoon  seems sturdy enough   should last a long time      
183,1.0,                       these are not teaspoons but tablespoons suitable for soup  not recommened for desssert  coffee or cereal      
184,5.0,                       very nice teaspoon  large enough to use for a soup spoon      
185,5.0,                       i was looking quality spoons since forever because i have a knack of losing them  so glad i found these amazon  efficient  durable  high quality  affordable      
186,5.0,                       perfect for indian food     
187,5.0,                       i liked that what i ordered was what i received  love the long handle  thank you          
188,4.0,                       could have been   start if matches the size fork of the fork that i also ordered      
189,5.0,                       very nice  heavy  smooth edges     
190,5.0,                       these look great  i bought spoons and forks since mine seem to disappear  i like the weight and look of these spoons      
191,5.0,                       love these spoons      
192,4.0,                       the mouth on these is wider than expected     
193,4.0,                       product is as expected     
194,5.0,                       these spoons are nice looking and sturdy  great quality at a good price  i would purchase again      
195,5.0,                       as me about durability in ten years      
196,5.0,                       everything was fine        
197,5.0,                       so hard to find decent flatware at a good price  these are good quality     
198,5.0,                       about two weeks prior to ordering these  i had ordered the matching set of forks   so i needed to match the new quantity of silverware   these were perfect   although the cosmetic design may not be so ornate  imo there is a draw to its simplistic appearance      
199,4.0,                       nice looking decent flatware at a decent price  not much else to say  recommended      
200,5.0,                       we use this set of silverware in our office  so far they ve held up against a few cycles in the dish washer and the staff seems to like them  they seem to be well made with no physical defects      
201,3.0,                       very flimsy     
202,1.0,                       very disappointed in the description of theses spoons  i was wanting a real teaspoon for the stirring   eating purposes  these are more than tablespoon sizes  the description is absolutely wrong  i placed the ordered  teaspoon  next to a tablespoon measuring spoon and you can vividly see that the ordered spoons are even larger than the tablespoon measuring spoon  i ordered one set only to see that they are not what i ordered and had another set on its way  i ll be returning both sets      
203,5.0,                       like i m out to dinner in a fine restaurant  love them     
204,5.0,                       excellent     
205,4.0,                       these arrived on time and were individually wrapped in plastic   they were just a little thinner than expected  but i do not know enough about flatware to comment on the accuracy of the description   they might be exactly as described  but they are thinner than the department store boxed sets      
206,5.0,                       inexpensive and durable     
207,5.0,                       great size  quality  and durability  very happy      
208,5.0,                       ordered these spoons as a replacement to the numerous ones that have disappeared over the years  like matching socks around here   and am pleased with my purchase  solid  good quality and nice size spoons      
209,4.0,                       i have all hiware flatware  the dinner spoons are as good as the other spoons and forks  my only complaint is the spoon handle length and bowl size  i have the hiware teaspoons in the same pattern  there s no real distinction in bowl size  they are not a true tablespoon  they re not that much longer than the teaspoon either  still  a sturdy  and strong spoon      
210,5.0,                       exactly as described  i am very happy with my purchase     
211,5.0,                       they seems sturdy and pretty good quality for the price     
212,5.0,                       will do the job    grandkids     
213,5.0,                       call me particular  but i really like quality silverware  imho  these are quality spoons      
214,5.0,                       these spoons are a good size and appear to be very sturdy      
215,3.0,                       they are fine      
216,5.0,                       very good spoons nice n thick very sturdy and not junk     
217,5.0,                       as expected for inexpensive extra forks  knives and spoons that i needed to fill in for all the ones my grandkids keep throwing in the garbage     
218,3.0,                       i am so unhappy  i thought i was getting teaspoons and instead the bowls of the spoons are soup spoon size  very sad      
219,4.0,                       the spoons were sturdy  looked very nice  had a good weight to it not too heavy not to light and they are durable  love it      
220,5.0,                       good spoons     
221,3.0,                       these spoons are very shallow  which is fine if that s what you re going for  but i was hoping that it would hold a little more liquid      
222,5.0,                       using it as an everyday spoon  good design  size and easy to use     
223,2.0,                       bigger than i thought     
224,5.0,                       good     
225,5.0,                       works great and looks beautiful   very reasonably priced  good quality      
226,4.0,                       the design is simple but the size of spoon is quite standard  i like using that spoon     
227,5.0,                       great spoons     
228,5.0,                       love these spoons  just the right size   not too big   standard teaspoon size      
229,5.0,                       i was skeptical because of the price and my other more expensive silverware began to rust in the dishwasher  these spoons are holding up rather well  i ve had them for several months and no rusting      
230,5.0,                       we like them     
231,3.0,                       good value for the price     
232,5.0,                       nice spoons at a good price  good quality      
233,3.0,                       the spoons are larger than i expected  they are not the small teaspoon size that comes in flatware sets  they are the larger size  more like a tablespoon  serving spoon size  they are thin and don t expect them to last long      
234,5.0,                       we love these because they are durable but not super expensive     
235,5.0,                       they feel very sturdy  but not heavy  very good quality      
236,5.0,                       they all came individually wrapped so they wouldn t get damaged and are such great quality   i recommend this for those of us who have too many forks and not enough spoons      
237,5.0,                       the spool were really good and cheaper than i could buy them anywhere else      
238,5.0,                       so far so good   large spoons  more of a soup spoon     
239,5.0,                       nice wide spoons  weird to say  but they fit comfortably in my mouth  a lot of spoons are narrow and sharp  these are great value for the price  nice and shiny  good handle length  couldn t be more pleased      
240,5.0,                       i was looking for replacement serving spoons  after   yrs of displaced misplaced pieces  when i found the hiware brand style on amazon   i really liked their simple yet graceful lines  but wondered how they would feel   i ordered a set of spoons  and i was not disappointed   the weight was perfect  the edges were smooth to the touch  important to a tactile sensitive person like me   and they were very smart looking with all of my dishware   next up   dinner forks      
241,5.0,                       great product     
242,3.0,                       these are much wider at the spooned section than i expected  more of a large soup spoon  i am still looking for something a little smaller that will be better for yogurt  cereal  and ice cream  these are definitely too large for kids to use  the handle length is good though      
243,5.0,                       good     
244,1.0,                       there was only one spoon delivered   i was expecting    based on the description        
245,4.0,                       this    piece steel set is just as advertised  the value for this set is on point  definitely can recommend

247,5.0,                       these are sturdy  shiny  nice longer handle  when all our forks seemed to disappear i bought the forks in the past  and then our spoons started disappearing so i got the spoons  might have to get the butter knives next if they start walking off too      
248,5.0,                       i have ordered several sets of silverware from the seller and have been impressed with the quality sturdiness and how nice they feel when using them  i have not had any issues with them pending scratching or rusting  if you re looking for a simple looking utensil these are perfect

294,5.0,                       my family loses spoons a lot  where do they all go  do they slip into an alternate spoon dimension  are there aliens that have a special affinity for beaming up spoons  are we infested with spoon trolls   until i solve the mystery  hiware is there for me  selling me sturdy  attractive  perfectly weighted spoons for an affordable price  they look nice but are generic enough to not clash with the remnants of the set i have  they are heavy enough to feel nice in your hand  but not so heavy that they flip backwards out of my yogurt cup  don t you hate it when they flip backwards out of your yogurt cup  i have ordered this    set of spoons three times over the past couple years  i am not joking  someday we will find all the spoons in a glorious  magical rainbow cascade of spoons  we will laugh  we will cry  we will see turtles from the sky  until then  i will faithfully keep buying hiware spoons
