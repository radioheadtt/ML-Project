0,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the tv is excellent and weighs about    lbs   you have to register it using a code   i tried doing so with my phone but it didn t work   so i called a number on the registering app    turns out i must have entered the website wrong and then dialed a scam number   this guy told me i needed to pay     to register the tv   i said not a chance bozo i ll read the manual and send it back if i have to pay anything else with the tv   i called the number in the manual and the woman said there is no cost to register the tv and that the first number must have been a scam      
1,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       do not buy this tv its not worth it   it doesn t connect to wifi and if it does everytime it is turned on you ll have to re connect it yourself or wait an hour for it to auto connect  now remember this is if you can get it to connect at all  when you call the makers of the tv on their support line their   and only solution was to unplug the tv and plug it back in  awful customer service  awful product  awful everything  don t waste your money buy from a better brand  even at      it s not worth it because for them to call it a smart tv is false   i m sending it back in getting my money back      
2,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this tv had no picture  i think it was from the screen having a huge crack in it  yes  i am sure that s it  i think one feature that it lacks is some sort of protection before i opened it  but i can t talk about that  per amazon s rules  yet  having an adequate cushion is very important  very disappointed  i love my other roku tvs from tcl but this one was doomed  tcl should rework this feature      
3,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i got   of these     tv s for the bedrooms at      plus tax and i am very pleased with them  great picture  easy set up and an over all great value  they do have roku built in so you do have to go thru some steps at roku com link to set up your roku account  if you already have an account it s even easier  there was no problem connecting to my wifi and navigating with the remote is pretty simple      
4,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,              your browser does not support html  video                          i replaced this tv   times with amazon  returns were seamless as usual and customer service really stepped up to the plate  but all three sets had the same exact issue  i finally gave up and bought a different brand  it works well for a few days  maybe up to two weeks and then all it does is recycle on and off  during the recycle you cannot turn on or off the tv either from the remote or on the tv itself   see video      
5,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i love my tv   the sound is just right and the quality over all is on point   i m very satisfied  the pic above is from youtube  i was streaming an old segment on cnn on the youtube channel  very clear  no complaints here      
6,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       after successfully setting up the tv  less than five minutes later the screen went completely black  white light at the bottom of the screen is a dim white  and the tv is unresponsive to both the remote and the actual power button on the tv  after communicating with tcl support  i was told that the tv had to be sent in for repair or be returned  this was on the first day of use  extremely disappointed in this product      
7,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i previously left a very negative review for this product   first i do stand by my statement about the panel   it is cheap and can be damaged with very little effort   tcl needs to stop using tape with what amounts to super glue to secure the panel i resolved networking issues by performing multiple updates  packet captures indicate loss and drop of less then     so not too bad on wifi   i was able to find advanced settings  navigation is confusing in that video and audio settings have to be done in a channel   not logical to the consumer but if you think about it you want to set your picture settings when your looking at something besides a grey screen the supplied media player only supports h     and mkv files for video   if your media is avi or mpeg your not going to be able to use that using the media player   you can however use plex as long as you set up a pc or something else as a plex server   most will prefer that anyway  i complained about brightness   by default the system comes on low  power settings   the panel is a bright led  but it will use more power   it has multiple options for picture quality and sound   the roku app is outstanding  not issues there   the software is actually very good   the hardware is a little lax but good for the price   again the panel will break with almost no effort   usb port is a little hard to get to tcl should reconsider the width of the port access panel  the remote is simple and easy to use   navigation is fast   sound quality is actually better than my samsung    inch that i paid over a grand for   i have yet to test antenna quality video last  the tv does have bluetooth however do not expect to use it without paying roku      for a set of speakers   roku decided to block any bluetooth use unless you connect their speakers   once you connect the speakers you can connect bluetooth devices  the speakers have mixed reviews and i do not agree with this type of  product functionality ransom  that so may companies are moving towards while you could actually hack this by setting up a device with the mac address of the speakers there is a simple way to work around it   there are many cheap bluetooth transmitters here on amazon you can purchase that plug into the audio out   this will get you around the issue for about       just be sure to get one that is not just battery powered but can be plugged in overall the functionally of the menu  the apps and the stability of the software is outstanding   given the price  this is an exceptional buy   just be warned it comes with some caveats i will update my review if i find any new exceptions   i stand by my rating      
8,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       amazing tv for the price  it reads hard drives and thumb drives from the usb port the harddrives have to be the proper format first   it plays most formats of pictures  music    video the smart tv channels have a lot of media to choose from if you have wifi  there are lots of cable channel apps like hgtv  tbs  etc  that offer both paid media and free media  it looks like the first season of a lot of the shows are available free  then you need a subscription to the channel to see current media  my wifi is limited  so i won t be watching much of these channels for a while the app for the tv is great  it doubles as a remote  but also can play media straight from your device wireless  i only tried the android app  i was able to write a program for my tablet that turns on the tv and plays music videos from the hhd as an alarm  now i get to wake up to taylor swift singing me awake the only bad thing i have found is that the tv doesn t have bluetooth  which is very disappointing  the speakers on the tv seem to be on the back  so they are only so good  i paid full price for this item       
9,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       tcl advertises this tv for affordable us in college dorms and other places that provide channels over clear qam  i hooked this tv up to replace an old tv in this type of facility  while the new tv had a much better picture  the qam tuner failed to detect several channels the old tv received  i could find no way to manually enter a channel  frustrated tv s       year older have better tuner remote batteries were dead as well
