1,5.0,                       i have been searching for the perfect duvet for awhile now   i found it here   i love that there is a zipper  my husband always manages to get his feet stuck between the buttons        the zipper is a good quality  opens and closes smoothly  overall  the fabric is pleasingly soft   there is no extra weight to this  and it is breathable      
2,5.0,                       i absolutely love this cover  we re in the process of moving into our first home so we are lacking in furniture and everything that makes a house a home but this cover lets me fall asleep so peacefully  it truly is super soft and the color is so soft  highly recommend this cover for any one looking

5,5.0,                       not as white as my white sheets but pretty  close  soft and cozy      
6,5.0,                       i don t write reviews unless i am extremely disappointed or extremely impressed  i love this duvet so much  i was worried it wouldn t be soft or it wouldn t be as pictured but it s perfect      
7,5.0,                       it s very soft  easy to use and the zipper is so convenient  i love that it has ties in the corners to hold my duvet in place      
8,5.0,                       beautiful duvet cover  incredibly soft  nice and heavy  we bought this for our guest room and i can t wait to have company over so they can enjoy it  i love that it came with pillow shams too to give it a complete  clean look  very happy      
9,5.0,                       this duvet cover is super soft and comfortable  my husband is quite the diva when it comes to softness and he even agreed this cover is amazing  would recommend           
10,1.0,                       i like the color the cover was  but after placing it onto the comforter  it looked nice as well  i move a lot during my sleep  and the blank kept curling up on the inside and was so hard to unravel  i ve used duvet covers before  and this is my only bad experience      
11,5.0,                       i ve had this cover for   nights now  it was easy to put my comforter in  the microfiber isn t as soft as my microfiber sheets  but its pretty close and i sleep great at night with it  feels luxurious for sure   overall so far i m in love with this duvet cover  and would deff recommend  i will post pics and an update soon  maybe after its first wash      
12,5.0,                       my king size down comforter went in the duvet easily   the duvet was large enough for my sleep number king size bed   it is very soft and a great value   there are two king size pillow covers also      
13,5.0,                       very soft and good quality  have been using them for about   months and washed the duvet cover and pillow cases many times  i recommend this      
14,5.0,                       purchased the pink duvet set  color is perfect  more of a blush pink with bit of a peach undertone  it s very soft and looks great  only negative is i got very hot the first night we used it  i don t use a top sheet and maybe that would help  the microfiber doesn t breathe well      
15,5.0,                       i have been struggling to find a duvet cover that has a good price point and is actually worth the money  i continuously had the issue of finding a duvet cover that my blanket would slip and slide around so half of it was empty   not with this one  the blanket stays in place and the material of the duvet is so so soft giving it a luxurious feel for a fifth of the price  would definitely order again if need be      
16,5.0,                       i love this piece  soft  pretty color  true to picture   and affordable  i d definitely order again      
17,5.0,                       i searched everywhere for the perfect duvet cover and i am so glad i came across this one  it is so so soft  like hotel quality soft  i bought a duvet from here as well and the duvet had   loops and the cover only has   ties so i just sewed   more ties on the cover itself and it is perfect  will buy again when the time comes  thank you       
18,5.0,                       this duvet cover did come wrinkled but i threw it in the wash and dryer and took it out of the dryer immediately so it didin t have a chance to wrinkle and it was perfectly smooth on the bed  same with the pillow cases  it was so soft immediately taking it out of the box and was still so incredibly soft after washing it  fits my queen perfectly and i love the zipper on the bottom  just easier     the only thing i was a little caught off guard by was that i ordered white and next to my bright white sheets  it definitely looks more eggshell or ivory  i didn t need it to be a bright white because my color scheme is neutrals but if you re looking for bright white  it s not  it s so soft  though  whoa  i got rid of my top sheet so i could sleep right next to it  incredibly soft      
19,5.0,                       it is the perfect look for my room   the color was true to the color online   i love the soft feel of the fabric      
20,5.0,                       i wanted one  but i was hesitant to buy a white duvet cover because   kids  it s been a few months now and it has been washed many times  but it is just as beautiful as when it got to me  the white is not quite as bright as my sheets and the fabric is not quite as breathable as cotton  but i couldn t beat the fact that my kids  dirty smudges was out and i couldn t beat the price  it never looks wrinkly and is still perfectly smooth  so happy i purchased      
21,5.0,                       this duvet cover isn t the most stylish cover i have seen but it is so comfortable and soft  its not too heavy and it fits my duvet just right  i also really appreciate the ties on the inside to keep the duvet in place  i bought these for two bed and highly recommend them to anyone who wants the ultimate sleeping comfort      
22,5.0,                       just used my new duvet cover for the first time and it is amazing  it s extremely soft  lightweight  and feels very warm  would definitely recommend to a friend      
23,5.0,                       i love this set  it is perfect for the look i was going for and super soft to sleep with  it also fits perfectly around my comforter and i love the zip on the side that can be hidden easily  definitely recommend      
24,1.0,                       sent back because it was ripped in the shipped box and thin material      
25,5.0,                       absolutely love this duvet  so soft and cozy  the fact that it has ties that allow you to secure your duvet inside so it doesn t all ball up is a game changer     
26,5.0,                       beyond gorgeous and comfy     
27,5.0,                       this duvet is so soft and with the right comforter you ll feel like you re sleeping in clouds  the color is a sophisticated muted blush that can be used for adults that love pink but do not want a childish look      
28,4.0,                       first  i d like to say i was offered a     amazon gift card  if i like the cover  to write a   star review and take a picture   but i m giving that up for a   star review  mostly because the white is not white   i had to hide the white pillow cases from my sheets so it wouldn t make the cover look old and worn out   it is wrinkle free though  but it has no style at all   very plain      
29,5.0,                       got the duvet to have as a backup  wasn t expecting too much but when i took the cover out of the package it was the softest thing i ve felt in all the bedding items i ve had so far   it is definitely something to brag about  i think i just might use this one mainly  very happy      
30,5.0,                       i ve been sleeping in my new duvet for a week and i m in love  this duvet is super super soft  i love the zipper closure with no annoying buttons that sometimes get undone  this item just feels so expensive for the price      
31,5.0,                       i love the quality  the price  the look   everything about this duvet set  an amazing look      
32,5.0,                       i researched duvet covers for days before deciding on this one  really glad i did  the cover is so unbelievably soft  i really like that each corner had a tie and that it had a zipper  some similarly priced options only had a tie on the opposite corners of the duvet and button closures  i really appreciate the pillow covers having an envelope flap as well overall  great buy for the price      
33,5.0,                       absolutely love the softness      
34,5.0,                       love this product    definitely recommend it  i just bought my second one  we have   dogs that sleep in bed with us and so this is great and easy to get our stains  i love the look and feel of it  highly recommend      
35,5.0,                       so comfortable  i love the texture and it s very breathable  will be buying more sets      
36,5.0,                       not a single complaint  didn t have to fight to get it on  string ties on the inside are strong  very soft  and the color was perfect  has a white zipper that is easily hidden away under a cover and you don t even know it s there       would recommend     
37,4.0,                       the company had a card with the product stating to leave a review to revive a     amazon giftcard  so  here s my honest review  arrived quickly and on time  overall i m happy  but i knocked a star because slightly see through and there was a slight blue ink stain on one of the pillow cases  which were too big for my normal sized pillows  other than that  i am satisfied with the product  it looks good on my bed  pictures included  and the price is fair for what i ordered      
38,5.0,                       i wish i had taken a picture before i packed everything up for a move  i love this duvet cover  it s the perfect shade of blush pink  not too pink   it very soft and hasn t pilled after several  several washing s like one i had purchased before  i recommend this brand even if you re looking for a different color      
39,5.0,                       the reviews were great but i m always a bit selfish  especially because it was so cheap but the pink duvet is gorgeous   sooo soft  it goes perfect with my white sheets and gray silver accent pillows     
40,5.0,                       this duvet cover is amazingly soft  it stays on my comforter well and makes for the coziest sleep ever  i washed it following the instructions and it came out just as soft as it was when i opened it  you can t beat this for the price   would absolutely recommend      
41,5.0,                       i like the corner straps  it makes it easier to arrange my comforter into the duvet  definitely enjoy how soft it is  would buy another one      
42,5.0,                       love this duvet cover  it s as soft as everyone claims and the color is as pictured  i bought the haze blue   the zipper works great and is definitely superior to buttons  i bought a king and it fit my king duvet cover perfectly as well   tip  size up your bedding by one size to prevent the hogging of blankets and to achieve the  pinterest  look      
43,5.0,                       the product has been amazing  used for the past few months and have washed several times      
44,5.0,                       i got these for our guest bedroom in the queen size and they re such good quality  they wash nicely and are so soft      
45,5.0,                       love this duvet    i thought that i wouldn t find a super soft one to put my goose down comforter in but after buying a few others this one won it s soft and the color is great        
46,4.0,                       great product  it s just the duvet cover not the inserts inside  cover is very soft and wrinkle free      
47,5.0,                       this duvet cover is one of the best i have found  it is like being wrapped in a cloud  my   dogs love it just as much as i do  it is so comfortable and soft  if you are thinking about this please get it  you will not regret     
48,5.0,                       i love these sheets  only down side is that the fabric pulls easily so i now have little pills of fabric  but it washes well and stays soft      
49,5.0,                       what a beautiful and soft duver cover i am so happy that i read the reviews and ordered it i got the pink color and it s gorgeous and soft      
50,5.0,                       super soft and luxurious  the shams also were great for my king size pillows  i want this in many colors if possible     
51,5.0,                       very soft and easy to put on      
52,5.0,                       luxurious quality at a reasonable price  extremely soft and comfortable  delivered in a lovely package      
53,2.0,                       the duvet was soft and comfortable  but the color was not what i expected  when the color was called mocha pink i expected it to be  what i received was more of a bright bubble gum color  needless to say  i wasn t pleased and returned the product      
54,5.0,                       the softness aside from the price is unbeatable  the color is what i was hoping for and the zipper seems sturdy enough  the material is on the thinner side but has weight to it  so it s very comfy to snuggle into  also  it comes with neat ties in each corner to hold the comforter in place inside the duvet  so far i ve not found a cover i like as much as this one  it s just so soft  y all  for the size  king  and quality  the price is exceptional  i want one in pink and i will highly recommend to family and friends      
55,5.0,                       i love this comforter and i have bought it in both pink and white  it is a great product and well designed  it has ties in all   corners for your duvet insert and it zips at the bottom so the insert will not fall out my only issue with it is it came with a hole along the seam on one side  but i can sew that      
56,5.0,                       this is a great set at an affordable price  very soft  love the pink color     
57,5.0,                       softest duvet cover i ve ever had  it s definitely a lot brighter pink in person  not as  mocha   but i m okay with that  so comfortable and soft      
58,5.0,                       soft and lightweightlove it     
59,5.0,                       like most people  i m weary of buying clothes and bedding online before i can feel them for myself  this duvet cover s excellent reviews hooked me and i gave it a shot  super comfy  not cold when you first get into bed and not too heavy while you re sleeping  happy that i found a good cover for every season      
60,5.0,                       one of the top   amazon purchases i have ever made  don t think twice  just buy it  had a few runs in the pillow cases but amazing for the price      
61,4.0,                       super soft      ordered the darker grey and it looks much lighter  no complaints though      
62,5.0,                       this duvet cover is really soft  breathable and comfortable  i love that it has corner ties to hold the duvet in place  i also love the zipper closure  i haven t washed it yet  so i can t speak to how it holds up in the washing machine  but so far it seems like a great product for an affordable price      
63,5.0,                       love the cover  first one i ever bought  it was hand wash cycle in the washing machine  air dry fluff in the dryer  comfortable was very easy to put in  very easy to care for and use  very soft also      
64,5.0,                       i ordered this duvet cover mainly because the price was super reasonable for a broke college student  i was honestly baffled with how amazing the quality was when i opened the package  it s the softest duvet cover i ve ever had  and i was raised in a house with a mom who has unreasonably high standard for bedding comfort   i got the white  and it s pristine  i also love that it has a zipper because every other duvet cover i ve had in the past has had buttons  and they ve always fallen off        recommend      
65,5.0,                       i love these duvet covers   they hold their shape and stay soft      
66,5.0,                       i love this duvet  it s the perfect dusty rose color i was looking for  my   year old approves and says it s beautiful and soft   i agree  happy customer        
67,1.0,                       it s not at all what i expectedit s not at all what is shown on that picture   i was so disappointed when it came is such a small box the texture the look it was all bad        
68,5.0,                       i love this duvet cover so much  it s so soft  so warm  so easy to clean  it has the ties  its wonderful    i just wish they had more colors so i could change it out  like a soft yellow  please       
69,5.0,                       love  love  love  love  love  love color is exactly as described  fabric is soft  it s         just buy it already      
70,3.0,                       first off they sent me the wrong grey  i ordered the dark grey and they sent the light  which i don t mind so much  but my bigger complaint is that the comforter doesn t stay to the ends of the duvet cover  leaving you and your partner slowly moving towards the middle of the bed all night to avoid the parts of the blanket that are just two thin pieces of cloth  till you wake up smushed together  and not in the good way       
71,5.0,                       i can not explain how much i love this  this purchase drastically changed my whole room      
72,5.0,                       just what my bed needed  my only problem is that my duvet doesn t stay in place eventhough i tie the corners  it always bends up bunched up a little  i don t mind it much  that s my only issue  otherwise it s super soft   cozy     
73,5.0,                       this is my first duvet and i m thrilled with it  the pink mocha is a perfect neutral  blush color    i was specifically concerned about buying a blush cover that might appear too pink or fussy   the microfiber material is soft and inviting  i washed and dried it using cool temps and it came out beautifully   i love it so much that i m considering buying another one in a different color just so i have two on hand       recommend      
74,5.0,                       my comforter stays inside of it well without bunching up or falling into awkward spots   the inside ribbon works really well to tie to your comforter and the zipper mouth is wide enough to fit everything in easily  it s really soft and comfortable but i have noticed a few wrinkles  as with most cloth items you use  you should definitely wash this before you use it      
75,5.0,                       nice thicker material  washed a few times now  color has kept along with the quality of material  i have   pits with short hair and the little they do shed isn t hard to remove  i do keep a quilt on top but only because i live in the country with a bunch of dirt  my dogs know they re only allowed on bed when quilt is on  but some always manages to get on cover and it s not hard to remove      
76,4.0,                       i love how soft and cool this is  the color had to grow on me a little but i love it now with grey or white sheets  it s a little small for my king size bed but it works  it washes amazingly which is what i was hoping for  my little dog leaves hair all over and i needed something that would be easy to toss in the wash weekly  no shrinkage or wrinkles      
77,5.0,                       it s extremely comfort  soft and very easy to wash  feels better than the traditional normal cotton  great product      
78,5.0,                       great addition for our bed and enjoy the softness of the duvet  easy to slip duvet in and out  make sure to zip duvet before washing it  would definitely order again      
79,5.0,                       super soft and comfortable duvet cover  it s very breathable  the color is very soft pink and helps brighten up the room  dog hair doesn t stick too it as bad as my other ones so that s always a plus      
80,5.0,                       i love the feel of this fabric  it is so soft and comfortable   but also looks great in my room  i love the color  because it s so versatile  it seems like it will wash up nicely too  i will be getting another one for my spare bedroom      
81,5.0,                       easy to get duvet in it and soft to the touch     
82,5.0,                       ohhh this is so soft  i put it over an ugly cheap comforter i have and it looks really expensive and nice  got the light gray       
83,3.0,                       overall the material feels soft  but it s too small  the blanket barely hangs over my king mattress  also  there were a tremendous amount of wrinkles after i washed it      
84,5.0,                       love the softness of this duet cover bought two   my only complaint the zipper broke on one of them  they sent me a replacement right away  would definitely buy again      
85,5.0,                       soft and great for a teen room      
86,4.0,                       it was exactly the color i expected  the only issue i had was it was a little difficult for me to put on by myself      
87,5.0,                       it s great  exactly as it seems i would say it leans to the tad warmer side  other that  it s lived up to the expectations     
88,2.0,                       i read the reviews and was hesitant to make the purchase because on one of the reviews it said  it fitted big  and it does  i ordered a king size and it fits weird on my bed so i ended up using it as a sheet  wrinkle wise it doesn t get wrinkle as much but it s definitely not wrinkle free  it is soft but not what i expected  such a bummer      
89,5.0,                       honestly this is the most comfortable and soft item i ve ever slept with   i was worried because price usually means quality but this is honestly so nice   i ordered the white and while it s just a tad thin it sill doesn t show my quilt underneath and so far it has stayed in place  i ve also washed it and it held up perfectly         love this duvet      
90,5.0,                       love  the pink is actually a muted pink color  it is not overbearing  very soft color and fabric  we have dogs and it is durable after multiple washes and has retained the color  very pleased      
91,5.0,                       this duvet is way softer than expected and super easy to put over any comforter  it is a little heavyweight at night if you sweat in your sleep but other than that  i love it      
92,5.0,                       i just received the duvet cover today and washed it so that i could put it on my duvet  i have not slept in it yet  so i won t know exactly how much i ll love it til tonight  but i have to say that it feels incredibly soft and i really appreciate the fact that it comes with corner ties to keep the duvet in place  i dreaded buying a new duvet cover when my old one ripped  simply because i dreaded sewing on my own ties  it makes me wonder why all other duvet covers don t come with it  i love that it s so much cheaper than other brands  and that it doesn t come with a fitted or flat sheet  because i don t need them       
93,4.0,                       it s amazing  super soft and fluffy with my duvet insert  mine didn t have the ribbons on the side which i was completely fine with because i think it looks better without them  i saw a review of someone saying it looked like a sheet  that s true if you don t have a duvet insert  don t let the negative reviews keep you from buying this  it s amazing     
94,4.0,                       absolutely beautiful   it s the perfect rose color  the fabric is so soft and cozy and  i love the fact that it has corner ties to keep your insert in place and an easy zip closure the one down fall for my bed is that it isn t quite long enough to cover sides of our     mattress      
95,5.0,                       this is beyond awesome  i have been buying beddings online for a while and i always go over reviews to try to find the best beddings with best price  this item is the most awesome one i have come across with other products with similar pricing  it s so soft and feels sooooooo comfortable  i even recommended my roommate to get a set too  i can t go back to my previous bedding anymore  this is by far the best purchase duvet cover i d ever have  would definitely get another set      
96,2.0,                       i ended up returning this because it was very thin and u thought it was a comforter     
97,5.0,                       product came in great condition  the softness and comfort on this is amazing  i slept like a baby with this on my bed  the price for this is great too  i would recommend this to anyone

99,5.0,                       the best cover i have ever had  i was so impressed with how soft product is  keeps me warm on those chilly buffalo nights  wrinkle free feature is great      will buy in every color       
100,5.0,                       seriously the softest sheets i have ever owned and such a great price too  these bedsheets are becoming a problem because i never want to leave my bed now   been sleeping so well  coming from someone who has sleeping issues       
101,5.0,                       soft and light weight  easy to wash and dry     
102,5.0,                       i have been looking for a duvet cover for so long  i ve purchased some as much as      and they were too thin and not very comfortable   i was so amazed when i opened this duvet cover  it is soo sooo soft and easy to put on  i already ordered   more  i am shocked at how cheap it is priced for because it is made so well      
103,5.0,                       i used to have my bedroom gray black and white and i wanted to add a pop color but i was afraid to make it bright  and i don t like so many so many stuff in my bedroom  so i don t know i found this soft pink and neat texture  and it looks neat on my room  im keeping because it is a relaxing effect      
104,5.0,                       i ve been using duvet covers for years and all the frustrations that come along with it  from undone corners to uneven distribution of the fabric  the duvet cover has been my nemesis  until now    this is the first one that actually fits my comforter perfectly  it s almost as though they came as a pair  i ll never buy a different cover again      
105,4.0,                       i love this duvet cover but after one wash  an entire side of it pilled like crazy  not sure if it s my washing machine or what  but i don t know how to fix it and it looks bad      
106,5.0,                       i am huge on reviews when it comes to purchasing on amazon and the reviews on this duvet cover did not disappoint  i wanted something simple and white for our new bed that would not wrinkle  i immediately washed it to test this out and it came out of the dryer perfect  if you are looking for a soft  simple duvet  this is it  love my purchase      
107,5.0,                       visited my brother in california and had to ask him where he bought his duvet and cover cuz i slept like a baby  so soft that i ordered it as soon as i got back home  absolutely love it       
108,5.0,                       i ordered this bed set the beginning of june  had a minor issues with one pillow shame  had a stain  however  i emailed my concerns and they were quick to fix the issue  i was so amazed by such amazing customer service they provide  this company really values their customers and strive to make sure you re completely satisfied  i love this bed set  the color is so nice and the  material is so soft  i am very pleased with my purchase of this bed set  i definitely recommend buying      
109,5.0,                       love this duvet especially the zipper closure  i ve used several different closure options to in the past  envelope  ties  buttons  and none work as well as the zipper  will purchase more for our other bedrooms      
110,4.0,                       this duvet cover is very comfortable and soft  it has been washed for two times  and it still works the same  the only complaint is that it is a little too pricey      
111,1.0,                       terrible pilling  rough and uncomfortable  under the email tab to contact manufacturer about their one year satisfaction guarantee it does not have an email address  facebook link doesn t work or message tab  the pink version was great  this gray version is terrible and customer service is a joke      
112,5.0,                       truly  i don t leave reviews  but after reading reviews that this duvet cover was comfortable  i decided to give it a try because the price was so great  i m very particular about bedding linens   materials  and this duvet cover is amazingly soft and comfortable  i m probably going to buy it in grey in the future      
113,5.0,                       super great  would purchase again    however  it does snag somewhat easily if you have cats who like to jump around on the bed      
114,4.0,                       got the king sized duvet in pink mocha  loved the fabric texture and blush color  zipper closure is great for those restless sleepers who somehow get their feet caught in the duvet covers that have button closures  would have liked more color options since everything else about the product is great      
115,5.0,                       very affordable compared to the ones sold at other stores  comes with two pillowcases of the size you order  best of all it zips rather than the traditional button up   very soft as well love it      
116,5.0,                       i was reluctant to buy a white duvet cover  however it really brought light to the room   it is so soft and comfy over the comforter  i have slept like a baby for the past two nights i ve had this on my bed    it could be the fact that we are just moving in and totally exhausted  regardless  it is so comfy    it is easier to put on than my last duvet cover and the zipper makes it so much easier than the buttons  the shams also fit my king pillows nicely  a definite win      
117,5.0,                       i love the color and the material  it s super soft and lightweight  it s pretty easy to put in the comforter because of the corner ties  the zipper is great too  the pillow cases are shams and not just regular pillow cases  overall great duvet cover and i really would recommend it       
118,5.0,                       i was skeptical on buying this because i wasn t sure it would be comfortable because it was pretty cheap but i loved the color in the picture  i m so glad i ended up taking the chance because it is very soft and comfortable and the color is so pretty just like in the picture the only thing i didn t like about it was that it doesn t come with sheets in the same color  this is only the duvet cover and pillow cases  if you re thinking about buying this  go for it   i was not disappointed     
119,5.0,                       love this duvet cover  i wanted a plain white cover with no pattern  i recently purchased one from a different brand and it was super starchy and showed dirt super easily  this duvet cover is so soft and light  it really makes our room look bright and clean  i would definitely recommend this cover      
120,5.0,                       love the softness  pretty shade of grey   love the inside tie straps   one of my biggest pet peeves is when the comforter bunches to one side or another  and these will prevent that from happening      
121,5.0,                       love  great for the price  good color and easy to decorate  washes easy  great all around      
122,3.0,                       soft and comfortable but snags easily  my cat has already put runs snags in it after one night of use  i did like the corner ties  fit is perfect      
123,5.0,                       softest bedding i ve ever owned  i m really glad i took the risk and bought this duvet without feeling it first  it s totally got the hygge vibe  coziness and comfortable  i don t know if i ll ever be able to get out of bed         
124,4.0,                       when we first got this duvet cover it definitely served its purpose  it s thin  breathable  wrinkle free and comfortable  but i have seen over time after various washes  it is starting to pill  lasted less than a year  hope this was helpful      
125,5.0,                       this duvet is the easiest one i have ever used  i love the zipper enclosure because it makes life easier compard to buttoned enclosures  the tie downs inside are great because the comforter doesnt get all bunched up within thank you      
126,5.0,                       love it   very soft   the color is great   great price      
127,5.0,                       this product is beautiful  easy to put on and is the perfect shade   best buy for my money      
128,5.0,                       i ordered this duvet for my new house  and it is perfect  the size is      accurate and i can t get over how soft the material is to the touch  there is a zipper on the bottom that looks like it was very well made  i can t wait to order the pink one for another room  love it        
129,5.0,                       the color is super nice it is exactly as in the picture which does not happen every time you buy something online  the quality is really good and the duvet it self feels super soft  i am really happy with my purchase      
130,5.0,                       love how soft it is      
131,5.0,                       i ve washed it multiple times and it still feels great      
132,5.0,                       worth the money  high quality cotton stopped my cheeks from breaking out  cheap fabric makes my cheek go crazy   feels amazing and looks chic  i highly recommend for college students looking for simple  quality bedding      
133,5.0,                       this is soooo soft  my mouth dropped when i pulled it out of the package and felt it  color is true to the picture  possibly even prettier  i m not even a huge pink lover  but this is a super beautiful muted pink  love love it      
134,5.0,                       i was very surprised by the quality and softness of the cover  definitely priced very well      
135,5.0,                       i love how light weight it is and how comfortable it is when it hot in my room      
136,5.0,                       i have to say i am so pleasantly surprised  you don t have to spend a fortune on good sheets  these are super soft and the color pink mocha is perfection  it s feminine without being girly      
137,1.0,                       i had this exact one for my queen bed   loved it  purchased a king size bed   ordered one   it s huge  like    inches on the side too big  so it doesn t lay right  gets bunched up  and drives me nuts      
138,5.0,                       cannot recommend this duvet enough  so easy to put on your comforter and it stays in place  it is so soft and comfortable and really exceeded my expectations      
139,5.0,                       the package came within    hour and i immediately put it over my down comforter  it is so soft and comfortable  i haven t gotten that good of sleep in a long time  every person that sits on my bed raves about how soft and comfortable it is as well  overall  great purchase  i would recommend this to anyone      
140,5.0,                       i purchased the pink mocha  i got king size to drape over a queen platform bed  it fits perfectly for how i want it to look  i washed it before use with a delicate dry  nothing came apart   no lost color  this is a microfiber and very soft  i absolutely love it  i would add a photo but the lighting in my room don t do this duvet justice  i found it easy to install and i love that it has a zipper   so does the pillow cases  i love the color  it s not wrinkle proof  but my steamer fixed that  if you like duvet s this one is good for price      
141,5.0,                       wow  this arrived way sooner than i expected  it s definately a blush pink color more than pink mocha  but i love it  super soft  great price  has little ribbon pieces at each corner to tie to your comforter  i am very pleased with my purchase  the photo shows the true color      
142,5.0,                       not only do i love the muted pink  peach tone  but it is so soft and light  the duvet went on easily  and the zipper closure is genius   now my bedroom matches what i envisioned      
143,5.0,                       this cover is far better than i thought it would be  super soft  zipper works perfectly without any snags  i am extremely happy with this purchase and i highly recommend this cover      
144,4.0,                       so this is very nice  soft  and a good quality for the price  i was able to machine wash and dry perfectly fine with no problems  one thing that i will say  if you have animals especially cats or dogs    the material pulls easily from claws being on the bed  i have only had it a day and already have parts where it has pulled bad    so that kinda sucks     
145,4.0,                       i like this duvet it comes in the color shown and was very easy to put on over my comforter  and it s very good quality  i haven t had any issues      
146,5.0,                       i absolutely love this duvet cover   i got it for my daughters room and the color is absolutely gorgeous  a perfect pale pink  i was shocked at how incredibly soft it was  i immediately looked for more colors for one for my room but sadly none match  you wont be disappointed in this cover    its worth every penny  it does wrinkle but i kind of like the look of it     
147,5.0,                       wrinkles a little but looks fluffy and like a cloud  the pillow cases are a little see through  got the white  but would buy again for softness and quality     
148,5.0,                       the gray color matches perfectly  exactly what i ordered  it has ties at all corners and super nice zipper enclosure comes with two pillow cases and they fit my standard pillows perfectly  great buy  will probably order one for master next      
149,5.0,                       gorgeous shade of soft blush  and soooo soft       
150,5.0,                       this duvet is really nice  i have a full size bed so i got the queen size which was a couple inches wider than my duvet  but it tucks into the bed nicely so it isn t noticeable  it s  super soft and comfortable and breathable enough so it doesn t get too hot under the covers  i recommend      
151,5.0,                       looks good and fits nice      
152,5.0,                       i wanted a soft duvet cover and that s what i got   it s a very nice gray that matches everything   it has a zipper and ties to keep the comforter in place  and those are a must   i m happy with my purchase and would buy again      
153,5.0,                       i am absolutely in love with this duvet cover  the color is a gorgeous muted pastel rose pink  it is so soft and looks so full and fluffy with my duvet in it  buy it  you won t be sorry and there are ties in the corners so your duvet insert will not move around inside      
154,5.0,                       so soft and comfortable exactly what i was looking for  way better than the one i bought from target for over       the best part is the instruction sheet that comes with it  the mistakes on it were so hilarious that we hung it on our fridge      
155,5.0,                       love it     just what i wanted to add cozy factor to my bedroom  it s soft and fluffy and goes perfect over my duvet insert  i haven t had to clean it yet but according to other reviews it washes well  i will update on that  it appears to be well madevshd good quality  i m thrilled i got it on sale for           
156,5.0,                       what can i say   i love my duvet cover  this  pc set is fill with softness and makes you want to stay in bed so watch out if you have to go to work   lol  it fits my queen size down comforter perfectly   like an envelope type pillowcase as described  the zipper is hidden and includes ties to keep the comforter in place  even though is a solid color  it matches my room decor and all you have to do is add some decorative pillows to make your bed pop which is an advantage now that i think about it as you can add any style  the pillow cases are also soft and includes a wraps around your pillow so it does not comes off   if you know what i mean   this is certainly a great buy and i am going to purchase more      
157,5.0,                       best amazon buy  i recently got a puppy and allow my dogs in my bed  as result  i am washing my bedding once a week and this duvet has taken multiple washes and puppy wrestling  the color looks great  comes out of the dryer wrinkle free  and it is still so soft  i would definitely recommend this product and i should probably buy a backup      
158,5.0,                       i love this duvet  it is sooo soft and fits my down comforter perfectly  i get compliments on it all the time  i love the ties too the company is very responsive if you have any questions      
159,2.0,                       this is literally a big sheet it is super thin and not duvet cover like at all also doesn t look anything like the picture just looks like a microfiber sheet   so heads up   agreed it s very soft but not what you expect for a duvet cover       
160,5.0,                       i ve never had a duvet or a duvet cover until this purchase  i was nervous at first but it came very next day and i love it  it s so soft and not a hot fabric  it fits perfectly and changed my room up a little bit  i m definitely happy with this      
161,5.0,                       the color was super cute and my boyfriend always brags how his comforter is better but he likes my mattress more  we argued over who s bed were going to take when we graduate and i think this comforter sealed my position of winner  he loves pink and this shade in particular  it feels like heaven    like baby angels are wrapping you in their soft ethereal skin  no weird smells  packaging was adorable  big fan      
162,5.0,                       i absolutely love these bed sheets  they are so soft and comfortable   duvet cover holds the blanket very well  the only improvement i d suggest is selling it with a matching fitted sheet  but otherwise it s perfect      
163,5.0,                       this cover is very soft   i love it   i like the fact that it had a zip closure rather than button   i ve had several duvet covers that had button closures and the buttons always seemed to pop off fairly quickly      
164,5.0,                       i ve always been one for using a cheap comforter from target or a quilt from walmart so i was apprehensive when it came to finding a good deal on amazon  this past week i vacationed in yellowstone and stayed in many motels and hotels and found that i loved duvets  while staying in jackson hole i found a duvet insert but needed to find a cover that matched my bedroom decor and did i ever  it matched perfectly and is softer than what i had recently tried  will be ordering more colors if i ever change up my room  which is often       
165,5.0,                       i wanted a duvet duvet cover so i could wash my bedding more often without having to fit a large comforter into the washer  it s soft and comfortable and has served it s purpose so   stars  would purchase again  i got pink mocha because it was my first choice after white  didn t choose white due to dogs   the color is subtle enough for an adult woman  not over the top pink or babyish      
166,5.0,                       absolutely love these duvet s got one for my daughter she also loves it      
167,5.0,                       perfect     
168,5.0,                       its so soft  it looks amazing  the color is true to the picture  i ordered a king duvet and cover for my queen bed and i just love this set      
169,5.0,                       i washed it once it was delivered  and immediately noticed how soft it was  i didn t change my duvet cover until a few hours later  so it sat in a pile on my chair and was still wrinkle free which is a plus  the color is really pretty  and looks like what is pictured  really love it already      
170,5.0,                       i love this so much  so comfortable with my goose down      
171,5.0,                       first time ordering a duvet cover and using it with an insert  really like it so far  it s very nice and extremely soft  the zipper works nicely  can t wait to sleep with this      
172,5.0,                       this duvet is perfect for my room  the white is true white  the material is so soft and the added zipper feature makes it easy to put the comforter in  the trimming on the pillowcases makes them look so elegant  i love them      
173,5.0,                       ordered king size for this queen sized bed to allow for more overhang  very soft  did steam once in place  nice zipper closure and fit is perfect  washed prior to putting on and no shrinkage noted      
174,5.0,                       i love this duvet cover  it s so soft and warm  i sleep hot  but i still don t have to throw it off in the middle of the night      
175,5.0,                       this was my first time buying a duvet cover  i have a comforter that s my favorite ever and it was perfect to use as a filler the string to attach the corners was perfect  the zipper instead of buttons  perfect  i all around love this duvet  quality is great      
176,4.0,                       only thing i have to complain about is this color is more of a bubble gum pink and not as dusty as it looks in the picture  other than that cute     
177,5.0,                       love the duvet cover  especially at this price  i really love that it already had corner ties sewn into it  although it s not hard to sew in your own  i specifically looked for one that already had them i do wish the ties were a little longer  but they work  when the duvet is on the bed  it s wrinkle free  even after washing      
178,5.0,                       this is the best duvet cover i ve ever had   not only do i love how soft it is  it is the easiest duvet cover i have ever had  the zipper is hidden so well i never feel it when i m sleeping  i also like having the zipper  all of my other divers had buttons and i hated that  this also has he ties at the corners and my duvet never shifts   i don t have the little loops at the end of my duvet so i just tie the ties around the corners and it stays together  you won t regret this purchase   i m most likely going to be another one so when i wash this one and hang it to dry  i have another one ready to put on my bed      
179,3.0,                       when i got this product my daughter thought it was a bead  spread  how do i use this product

181,5.0,                       this duvet cover is perfect  it is extremely soft and was wrinkle free the minute it was taken out of the package  the ties on the inside corners made for a hassle free process when putting over the duvet  i highly recommend this product      
182,5.0,                       i bought a queen size duvet in the color pink mocha and it is love   super soft  easy to put insert in and the color is just like the photos  definitely getting this duvet in all the colors     
183,5.0,                       this is a girly girls dream  seriously sooooo soft and pretty  i bought the duvet set  sheets and extra pillow cases  this was a quick way to update my room from the stark white duvet i used during the summer  i have not washed it yet and do not iron  but will purchase again      
184,4.0,                       everything about this is great  it is super soft and looks really nice  however    the  grey  color isn t as dark as it is in the picture  it looks more of a teal blue grey but hella light if that make sense  i kept it anyways because exchanging it would take too long as i am in need of one right now      it was almost perfect      
185,5.0,                       last time  i purchased the queen size cover from here  i enjoyed my first duvet cover very much  so i bought another size duvet cover for my guest room bed from here again  great quality  and reasonable price      
186,5.0,                       love it  especially for the price  got a insert for it from tuesday morning for          
187,4.0,                       my husband and i love our duvet cover  it is exactly what we wanted   light  airy and cozy  makes going to bed amazing and waking up refreshing  washed great and i love the zipper feature  makes putting it on nice and easy  thank you      
188,5.0,                       it was great right out of the package  i did not expect the quality for the price of this duvet cover  and it is sooooo soft  i could lay in bed for hours wrapped in it  the color is beautiful as well and exactly what i was hoping for      
189,5.0,                       absolutely beautiful  after years of searching  i finally found the perfect duvet  the quality of the fabric and how well it s made add the clean  elegant look i was looking for finding the right shade of a very soft pink was also key as it  gently brings out the distinctive design and colors of my great grandmother s silk wall tapestry   it s about as neutral as pink can be for a romantic couple s room i also added thin  soft velvet sheets that couldn t have matched more perfectly  i m so thankful  highly recommend      
190,5.0,                       the product is very soft and comforting and i just absolutely love the color  take caution when using the zipper  if too much force is used it may cause it to catch within the fabric or even mess up the tracking  overall great product just be gentle with the zipper      
191,4.0,                       i m a little disappointed there isn t more options to keep the duvet centered in the cover  rolls at the ends and bunches ups has been easy to clean     
192,5.0,                       these are the best covers we have tried yet  so sturdy but soft  my kids love to make their beds now      
193,5.0,                       so happy with my purchase  the cover is so soft  i didn t tell my husband i changed the cover  but he noticed as soon as he got in bed   ooooh it s like sleeping on   nothing  that s his way of saying a cloud lol      
194,5.0,                       so happy with this duvet cover  very soft  comfortable and lightweight  perfect for summer months and the ties on the inside hold down the comforter  color is great too      
195,5.0,                       the color is perfect a soft pink  make sure you read the sizing the king fits perfectly on my full bed  i will also have to get bigger pillows to go with the pillowcases but overall the fit is great and the material is very comfortable      
196,5.0,                       honestly  i love this duvet cover  it s the kind of soft that comes when you ve washed something a thousand times  it doesn t wrinkle and there s none of those weird air bubbles that i sometimes find in duvet covers  it s wonderful      
197,5.0,                       this worked perfect for an unused old queen comforter   so easy to insert and tie corners   would definitely buy again      
198,5.0,                       the reviews were so good that i took a chance and bought two  so happy i did  there so soft and exactly what i was looking for in my guest bedrooms  would definitely buy more in the future     
199,5.0,                       this duvet is so soft  the pillowcases feel so good on my face  i like that it s on the thin side because where i live get s so hot and this doesn t make me sweat  overall i love it      
200,5.0,                       got this for my daughter s room   she loves it  it was difficult for her to put the duvet cover over her comforter  but once on it looks great         
201,5.0,                       i am in love with this duvet   i bought a king size to fit over my queen size comforter and it fits perfect  it is the softest duvet i ve ever felt making it so comfortable it feels like i m wrapped up in a cloud  i washed and dried it on low heat and it came out completely wrinkle free  i purchase the white duvet  i wish it came in other colors like taupe or tan but i love it so much i will purchase another color  it feels like an expensive luxury duvet but very affordable  my husband got into bed the night i put it on and his eyes lit up when he felt how soft it was  we have been sleeping better from how comfortable it is and we re extremely happy      
202,5.0,                       incredibly soft  amazing feeling on the skin  only   hooks  one in each corner  and a white zipper at the bottom  my color ended up slightly blue tinted  pillow cases fit pillow   no unpleasant odor      
203,5.0,                       this is a wonderful duvet cover  very soft and the color  antique rose  is lovely  i have one minor gripe  the corner ties are on the short side  an extra two inches of ribbon would make a huge difference  it will take more than one washing to lose the packaging creases but no additional wrinkles from washing and drying      
204,5.0,                       i needed a new duvet cover and found this on amazon  comfy duvet set and the color  blush  was just perfect for my bedroom  not to girly and added some pop of color   i definitely would recommend it      
205,5.0,                       this duvet cover is like sleeping in a cloud  so soft  looks very elegant and is light yet keeps you warm and comfortable  perfect size for the king bed and was easy to put the comforter inside  very happy      
206,5.0,                       i didn t know what a duvet cover was and i had searched sheet sets  so i just thought it was a french word that meant sheets  so i was expecting sheets for my bed  when it came i didn t take it out of the zippered pouch it came in  i just opened it and felt them and they were extremely soft  i wanted to put them on right then but i had just changed my sheets the day before so i put them on the shelf in the laundry room  i had also ordered a new comforter that hadn t came in  a month later i had everything i had ordered to make up my bed  imagine my surprise when i pulled what i thought was sheets out and started seeing a zipper like something would have to go in and no fitted sheet was with it  just   nice extra soft pillow cases  i was so bumfuzzled  i called my daughter and asked her what is duvet cover  she laughed and said you zip up one that you don t use in it or that you got and didn t like and  vio la  your  duvet  is now all new i wish i hadn t waited to open it up and take it out of the package because truthfully i would have returned it  it wasn t the item i needed but like i said very soft and warm to sleep with  good buy      
207,2.0,                       this was a lot thinner than expected and i felt like a static feeling like it would kling to my legs  ended up going to target to get a better comforter   would not buy this again     
208,5.0,                       vet soft duvet  muted color  a tad tough to  stuff  to attach but so worth     
209,5.0,                       love it so much  i bought   colors for various seasons      
210,4.0,                       absolutely amazingly soft  i m in love and so glad i chose this duvet  i will say though that it is quite frustrating that they do not have a full size and queen size  but rather full queen  it s a bit big so i m regularly having to fix the blanket inside of he duvet   anyone who has to do this knows it sucks especially having to fix it every other day but overall  i don t mind becaus it s so soft   comfortable        
211,2.0,                       i ve had this for about a month  i washed it when i first bought it and put in on my comforter  at first i really liked it  it was super soft and comfortable  then i washed it a second time and the softness was gone  the material started pilling and snagging  i also don t like how the ties are only in the corners  so the comforter slips all over inside this thing i know this wasn t the most expensive duvet cover i could have bought  but it wasn t exactly cheap either  for the amount i paid  i expected better quality  i don t think i d purchase this again with so many better options out there      
212,5.0,                       i love this duvet cover  the ties in the corner and the zipper are a game changer from my last one  it only took me about   minuets to get my comforter in and to get it on the bed  it keeps the comforter in place evenly and hides the comforter  it is so soft and looks beautiful  would highly recommend      
213,5.0,                       very good quality  it s really soft and just what i wanted many times when i have bought duvet covers  i ve been disappointed  because it has not been soft  but this product fulfilled my expectations      
214,4.0,                       i was hesitant to buy because of the material  but  it s so soft and nothing like the microfiber you would expect  light enough to keep you cool and heavy enough to keep you warm  mine didn t come stained or anything like that  it s very pretty and color is identical to the picture  got the blush color  i highly recommend      
215,2.0,                       the material snags very easy and rips  it is comfortable though  just didn t last very long     
216,5.0,                       very soft  really easy  as far as duvet covers go  to place my comforter inside  i like the ties to connect the corners and the zipper has a extra piece of fabric to hide it  overall decent value for the money      
217,5.0,                       perfect  i did a lot of research before finding this duvet cover  so soft and light weight  the color was exactly as i pictured  it took a long time to arrive but that was due to the pandemic i m assuming  worth the wait      
218,5.0,                       i loved it so much i bought a second one  great value  soft  beautiful color  washes great  the price also can t be beat      
219,5.0,                       great duvet cover for the price  i covered up a blue orange comforter with a grey duvet cover and i am unable to see the color beneath  would purchase again in another color  so soft      
220,5.0,                       my fiance and me got this duvet for our bedroom cause our old one was just old and torn  when we got it in we not only felt how light weight it was but the minute we took it out of the bag we knew we got a product for us  it was soft and easy to put on  and now at night i don t find myself fighting to cover up cause of the weight difference from our old one to this one    out of           
221,5.0,                       i was super surprised when i opened the package and felt how soft the cover was  i wasn t expecting it to be that soft  i like that it has a zipper instead of buttons to keep it in      
222,5.0,                       this is a very soft duvet cover and it looks awesome on my bed  i wish i had thrown it in the dryer for a few mins to get the wrinkles out  but those are to be expected right out of the package  it looks great and feels great  definitely would recommend      
223,5.0,                       what a great purchase this was   it is so soft  easy to put on with the corner ties  i am very pleased      
224,5.0,                       don t think about it  just buy it  it is soft and cozy and absolutely amazing    the ties on the corners make it so the comforter doesn t slip around i got the pink on and i have been obsessed ever since i put it on my bed       recommend      
225,5.0,                       lovely  it is a beautiful shade of pink  and so soft   i will be ordering another for the other room  very pleased      
226,5.0,                       normally for a purchase like this  i m placing my trust in the wirecutter and that s that  i found myself in a position where i couldn t afford to throw down       for one of their picks and badly needed a new duvet cover  so i went with this one in the pink mocha variety  i have been thoroughly impressed  the texture is silky smooth  crawling underneath this is soft and soothing and i look forward to it every night  hard not to love this at      stains here and there have come out with relative ease  going to purchase this again in white and tie dye it      
227,5.0,                       i ordered the pink duvet cover and was pleasantly surprised by the high quality and comfort of the materials  there is a zipper closure which is easy to use and overall it is easy to clean  the duvet stays soft after being washed and dried and the color stays true  really pleased with this purchase      
228,5.0,                       very easy to get into my comforter  has ties on the inside corners to attach to the comforter and zips closed  have had for a couple months and really love the feel and weight of it  soft and not too heavy of a fabric      
229,5.0,                       this product is amazing   it fits perfectly for my duvet and provides ties to ensure it stays in place  the cover doesn t have any wrinkles and the pillow cases are designed so the pillows fit snuggly and securely      
230,5.0,                       i m so impressed with the feel of this duvet cover  it s soo soft and the color is perfect  it was also very easy to put my duvet inside and the zipper works as it should  the quality for the price is outstanding     
231,5.0,                       i actually accidentally bought this item  but it came in a little bag and was nicely folded  taking them out they were very soft and i could tell they would ve been really comfortable  sorry i can t be much help but they seem like they d be amazing  unfortunately i don t have a queen mattress otherwise i would use them      
232,1.0,                       it said it was purple  this is far from purple  its more like grey  i put a purple shirt next to it so nobody else gets scammed i would never of bought it  false advertisement      
233,5.0,                       i wanted a light pink duvet but was nervous it was going to look too princess y  it took me awhile to find the right one because of this and also because none of them were soft enough  or they were way too expensive    this one feels so soft and is a very lovely shade  my husband was so jealous we ordered one for him in grey  we both love our duvets        
234,5.0,                       i actually purchased this cover as a spare back up for my current one to rotate them in and out  however  this one is so soft and comfortable we have now just been using this as our main duvet cover  excellent value for the quality of product you receive      
235,5.0,                       this duvet cover is a wonderful quality cover  i ve purchased several over the years and this one is by far the softest  the color  is exactly what i wanted  i got the blush pink color  think it was called mocha pink   the cover is thicker than i have bought in the past which left me pleasantly surprised  this cover is very comfortable and looks beautiful  i will definitely be ordering this again      
236,5.0,                       extremely light and soft   absolutely love our duvet cover  we have washed it a handful of times since we just bought it and it s still in perfect condition  we also have two dogs that play very rough and have not had any issues      
237,5.0,                       this duvet cover is so soft  it washed well and looks amazing on our bed  would definitely recommend      
238,2.0,                       updated review           i initially loved this duvet cover because it was the softest to snuggle with  it was great  but i started noticing myself waking up in pools of sweat in the morning  i have always been a hot sleeper but the damp sheets in the morning were excessive   never experienced it in my life  i am a    year old  average weight petite woman and i have not had any changes in my diet or exercise routine  so i found the damp sheets odd  after almost a year with this duvet cover  i decided to change up my style in bedroom and ordered a duvet cover  different brand  that was      natural cotton  the fabric on the new duvet is not as soft as this one  but after several nights  i noticed that the pools of sweat were gone and i slept cooler in the night  unfortunately  that means that the culprit in the situation was this duvet cover which was causing me to overheat in my sleep  it retains a lot of body heat and moisture  if you are a hot sleeper  you may want to buy other sheets original review            i know that it sounds dramatic  but i have been waiting my entire adult life for this duvet  i am    years old to put that in context for you  but i travel frequently for work and have always been a little disappointed to come home to my bed and not the luxury sheets that i have grown used to during my stay in hotels  this duvet  however  completely changes that for me  it is the softest  most comfortable thing to snuggle up in bed with after a long day  it has simply made me look forward to coming home and getting a good night s rest      
239,5.0,                       love the feel  easy to take on and off to clean and looks great and feels so soft       
240,5.0,                       recently moved into a new apartment and was on the search for new bedding  i wanted something stark white and easy to care for when i came across this one  i love how soft it feels as well as how it has ties to hold the duvet in place  after having duvet covers in the past with button closure and hating how it would always  peak out  the zipper closure in this one is a major plus    i highly recommend this product      
241,5.0,                       it is very soft  pretty warm too  but my room is cold in the winter so it ll work well  my   x   duvet fits nicely inside  looked clean out of the package  washed it regardless and no wrinkles  didn t realize that was a feature   i ve only ever owned one other comforter set before so by no means an expert on duvets  still i am pleased with the purchase      
242,5.0,                       wow  this duvet cover is the softest duvet cover i ve ever had  glides perfectly onto a duvet and i haven t had the best sleep in years  bonus  it totally fits a hippie bohemian style if that is what you are going for      
243,5.0,                       this set arrived quickly and is so beautiful  i got the pink mocha color and am so happy i did  the duvet cover and pillows are super soft and comfy  you ll want to stay in bed all day  love love love this set      
244,5.0,                       loved it  easy to put on with the zipper and the corner ties  super soft  we love the way it looks on our bed  super elegant  we have an expensive down comforter so we don t want to keep it pristine but still feel the quality of it and this was the perfect cover      
245,5.0,                       this is my first duvet for my king bed   i love it  it s so lightweight   soft  i waited to do this review after my first wash and it is still amazing  i recommend washing on the delicate cycle in cold water and low heat tumble dry      
246,5.0,                       i absolutely love this duvet cover  the first one i ordered was muted pink and it was absolutely gorgeous second the dark gray  will continue to buy these duvet covers i love how they zip very easy to use an absolutely comfortable and beautiful worth every penny

253,5.0,                       was skeptical about purchasing bedding online without feeling the fabric however we found this to be a super soft  simple  great duvet cover  great value too

264,5.0,                       i ve had this duvet cover almost a year and i love it   it has held up softness and color throughout a bunch of washes  the ties in corner stay in place too which is nice if you move a lot in your sleep      
265,5.0,                       i just got the pink mocha today  and i can t wait to snuggle up under this soft duvet  i was pleasantly surprised at how nice the packaging  which goes along with thia nice product  i d definitely recommend      
266,5.0,                       love this duvet cover  the softest i ve ever owned  my husband hates the pink  but i love it  such a great price i wish it came with patterns  i d consider ordering several      
267,5.0,                       super comfy  love it     
268,3.0,                       i have had this cover about a month  it is soft and easy to set up with my king size   lb weighted blanket  i wanted to like it more but the constant pilling  shown in picture  is super annoying especially with white sheets  i was under the understanding this material would not leave little pieces of material like this  it s been washed several times and still does it  i doubt i would buy this again for that reason      
269,5.0,                       i bought this for my queen size bed  i was looking for a more weighted duvet and this one was perfect  it s soft and i paired it with a quilt for fall months  definitely cozy and inexpensive  i also have washed it since purchasing and i ve found it keeps its softness  some duvets get weird after washes  highly recommend      
270,5.0,                       omg super soft and easy to use  could it be easier  of course but duvet aren t meant to be  unless i m doing it totally wrong  love the gray color      
271,5.0,                       i lovvveeee this duvet cover  it is super soft   lightweight  i m a pretty hot sleeper but this duvet cover is light enough to where i don t get uncomfortably hot at night  the ties made it easy to insert my duvet   it did well in the wash on a delicate cycle  i highly recommend this product        
272,5.0,                       great product  very soft and made well  the first one we received had a slit in it    looked like from a box knife  we returned for a replacement  quick and easy process  would recommend to anyone      
273,5.0,                       very soft     
274,1.0,                       don t feel it s worth the price      
275,5.0,                       wow  this duvet is absolutely perfect  very soft   cozy  it has ties  which is a plus  it s very easy to put in the comforter  there is a zipper at the bottom to close it off once the comforter is in  i love it  for those who are complaining about it being thin   it s not a comforter  you need to put your comforter in there  it s a duvet   sorry  i had to clear that up            
276,5.0,                       don t ask questions  just buy it   i bout this along with a new duvet and sheet set and my bed is a dream      
277,5.0,                       i tried to tie the ties to my duvet but it didn t really work because its just two stings and without a hole in my duvet the sting don t stay attached but it still works really well and i found it easy to put on      
278,5.0,                       ohhh boy   ok  so  this was my first duvet purchase  ever  i have alternative down comforters  that are white  with a toddler    so in my attempt to save them from anymore ruin  i stumbled across the dreaming wapiti  i read the reviews  like i always do prior to purchasing anything online  it definitely had great reviews  i dont usually write reviews  but since they have helped me so much lately  i figured mine might help someone else  especially with social distancing and a lot of shopping is mainly online now   back to the duvet cover    talk about soft and comfy    i ordered the mocha pink  it goes perfectly with my dark grey headboard and deep purple decor in my room  i will admit i had a hard time getting my cover inside  remember this is my first experience with a duvet cover  i laid it out on my floor  inside out  laid my comforter on top  corner to corner  pulled corners of my comforter  almost like making a pony tail  then used to corner ties from duvet to tie around corners  keeping comforter in place  then i carefully tucked comforter into the duvet cover  right side in  through the small area that zips open  zipped it up and viola   my toddler  kitty cat and i all slept very snug and have been ever since   i did wash prior to using  make sure you keep the duvet zipped up or else it could break  per the instructions although i have no other duvet cover to compare this one to  i can tell you that i am a  snob  when it comes to what i sleep on  pillows  sheets  blankets   i wanna feel like i m sleeping on a cloud and my duvet cover is exactly what i wanted  i ve had it for a week now and no problems thus far  except i look forward to bedtime even soon than before  hope this helps       
279,5.0,                       super soft      
280,5.0,                       this product is very soft and feels nice to lay on  there are a few wrinkles  but nothing a wash won t fix  it seems to be well made and high quality  good price  would purchase again      
281,5.0,                       i love this  it s perfect for a winter time blanket  i purchased during summer and it gets really hot with a duvet inside  but i can t wait to use it in the winter time to keep me warm and snuggly      
282,5.0,                             would recommend  it s true to description  high quality  super soft  really pretty  i did a lot of research and comparisons of other duvet covers and i m very pleased i went with this one      
283,3.0,                       not as  soft as i thought  defininetly much less comfortable than my other      cotton covers  winkle free sure  but who cares      
284,5.0,                       it s perfect for our little beach house  we had a white duvet but with a dog that got dirty quickly  this one is perfect and so soft  and    how do you beat that price      
285,3.0,                       the duvet cover is more like a bed sheet  it s not as fluffy as the wet shown in the product picture  if you re going to buy this i think you should get the white one because the color hides the flatness of the duvet cover      
286,5.0,                       very soft and nice covers  we love it  will buy another one      
287,5.0,                       pretty  easy to use  and easy to clean  it was a little small for the comforter i already had but i knew that before buying      
288,5.0,                       amazing quality for the price  ibwas skeptic but am so happy i ordered  fit perfectly      
289,5.0,                       all the reviews that mention how soft this thing is are not an exaggeration  this is my first duvet cover and it reminds me of a nice hotel s comfort which is exactly what i was going for   i was worried about getting white but it looks great and if it ever gets messed up  i d definitely buy another because of how affordable it is      
290,5.0,                       super soft fabric  lots of color choices and the zipper at the bottom helps the duvet inside stayit would look best with a thick comforter  so that it doesn t look flat     
291,5.0,                       i love this duvet cover   so soft and beautiful  i was a bit skeptical about ordering the duvet cover because of the hard to believe price and wort that it might not be soft  i was wrong  i m so happy with my purchase   thank you     
292,5.0,                       this is the softest  best purchase i ve made on amazon  i bought one for every room in my house  must have      
293,5.0,                       this is so soft and comes with ties to secure your comforter and a zipper that gives it a very sleek clean look  i got this in white and i m thinking of getting it in the pink mocha as well because at this price i can afford to change things up      
294,5.0,                       buttery soft and our very heavy king comforter doesn t move around  honestly does not wrinkle either  i ve washed it once and still the same      
295,5.0,                       omg  this duvet is so soft and unbelievably comfortable that i wish i would have bought this sooner  no regrets  so worth it  my roommate is buying a set for herself and she likes them more than      duvet set she recently bought      
296,5.0,                       i have had this duvet for   weeks now and i haven t been out of the bed since    omg they are so soft  the color pink mocha is beautiful and it s easy to wash  i bought a second one in gray  it s was a great buy      
297,5.0,                       amazing   so comfy  slightly wrinkly but after the dryer just put in on your comforter     
298,5.0,                       this is my  nd time ordering this duvet cover  i loved it so much in my guest room that i purchased a king size for my bedroom   i m replacing a very similar pottery barn duvet cover that i purchased for      for this amazon steal  honestly  i could not be happier with this purchase  well made  super soft  ties in the corners and fits my comforter perfectly  no odor when opening and went directly on the bed after a quick steam in the dryer      
299,5.0,                       this duvet cover fits my comforter perfectly  it s super soft and wrinkle free  the ties inside the duvet help my comforter to stay in place inside the cover  the color is beautiful with my gray sheet set and looks beautiful with my white sheet set  so worth it   ur not making a mistake buying this duvet  color is just beautiful     love love love        
300,5.0,                       i wash duvet covers every two weeks for the whole family  we used to buy egyptian cotton with at least     thread count  but it is not easy to iron  with the microfiber duvet  i can just throw into the washer  and dryer and it comes up fluffy and not wrinkled  do not get me wrong  it is not as crisp as the ironed sheet but it is good enough  it saves me so much time to not iron  the feel of this microfiber is soft and gentle and honestly i cannot feel a difference between this and the egyptian i used to have      
301,5.0,                       i bought this cover because it looked light and soft and it did not disappoint   the corner ties to keep the comforter in place sewn inside makes it so much easier to straighten up   the fabric is not super thick but that is why i bought it   it feels so soft to the skin   it is wrinkle free when taken out of the dryer      
302,5.0,                       this is so comfy   the color is beautiful   easy to cover my quilt   softness is awesome   highly recommend      
303,5.0,                       okay    this may sound a bit provocative  but this duvet cover is so soft and the pink mocha color is so gentle that i have become very possessive of my secondary bedroom area   although i have never been a  pink  person  the entire vibe created by this duvet cover is one of calm  i am thrilled with this purchase      
304,5.0,                       so soft and sleek looking  perfect to cover my dry clean only comforter  it goes on pretty easily and seems to be very wrinkle resistant  exactly what i wanted      
305,4.0,                       love the color and softness of this duvet  great price for the quality      
306,5.0,                       i have been looking for new bedding for the longest time  but couldn t commit to anything  i m so glad i did with this set  it s gorgeous  soft  and makes me excited to climb into bed every night  and of course the color is perfect  highly recommend      
307,5.0,                       i purchased the gray king size duvet cover  i like how it washes without ruining the quality or softness  it comes with the inside ties to keep the duvet in place  the zipper ensures that the duvet stays clean and fully inside the cover  the only thing that i didn t love is how difficult it was to fully put the duvet in but i think that s just because the king size is so large  i still was able to do it on my own though      
308,4.0,                       i purchased this about a month ago and i love itin pictures the color look a little on the grey side but it is blue in person it is very soft and will keep you warm  also it isn t wrinkle free as it states it gets wrinkles after cleaning but they come out after being stretched over bed i purchased an insert from amazon as well i wish it was thicker but is good for the price enitya white comforter duvet    https   www amazon com dp b  yfrc nn ref ppx pop mob ap shareeverything but the white sheets and my dog lol  in the picture is from amazon as well      
309,5.0,                       fluffiest duvet i have ever used  like cuddling a marshmallow  really warm so maybe not great for hot sleepers  but super cozy      
310,5.0,                       i love this duvet cover   i was so tired seeing the same cover in my bed  then this arrives and it s incredibly soft  definitely will buy in another color      
311,5.0,                       weve had this duvet cover for a while and i was waiting to leave a review after we used it through a warm cold night  and its extremely breathable and warm  we bought a more expensive duvet cover and every night we would break out into sweats  with this cover we barely need a fan  it also very soft and light  buy it      
312,5.0,                       amazing duvet cover for the price  i love how soft and lightweight it is and the zipper closure is a huge bonus  i ll never go back to ties or buttons again  it looks and feels a lot more expensive than it is  it s thin but in the summer  so light and airy  i ll definitely be purchasing one for every bed      
313,5.0,                       love it  easy to remove and wash  fits duvet well      
314,5.0,                       very soft and comfy  love it      
315,3.0,                       i wish there were more duvet ties loops  it is only the   corners  i find that having a couple along the side help the duvet stay in place  overall happy      
316,5.0,                       duvet covers are a joke    why would i pay more for the cover than i did on the duvet  that s why i got this guy and boy is it awesome  zipper  duvet anchors  and it is freaking soft  we love it      
317,5.0,                       live in this duvet set  my spouse and i love it  it s extremely soft and priced fairly low for good quality        
318,4.0,                       love this  only reason for   stars is because it came with a small stain but overall i m happy with my purchase      
319,4.0,                       super soft and attractive color  looks exactly like the picture i ordered from      
320,5.0,                       softest duvet comforter i ve ever had  i am so in love with it  highly recommend  and it s an awesome price and great quality      
321,3.0,                       super comfy and soft  the color is pretty too update  oh noooooo this is the softest duvet cover i ve ever owned  but after about couple weeks of use and one wash     and add a puppy  i saw her dig at it a couple times it started falling apart  i m so sad  wish it was a little more scratch resistant     
322,5.0,                       love it  super soft and comfy  quick delivery with prime      
323,4.0,                       the color was perfect and so was the fit  i don t like that it doesn t come with enough tie strings inside to keep the comforter from moving  the material is soft but since it s not completely secured it becomes loose and you get easily tangled     
324,5.0,                       best duvet cover ever  this is my first experience with using a duvet duvet cover   i am impressed  super soft and lightweight  i definitely recommend this brand   will be purchasing more of their products in the future      
325,5.0,                       this is such a great duvet cover  we started using this in our short term rental but decided to get this for our house as well  duvet covers are notoriously hard to put on and take off but we just tie up all   ends  push the duvet in  and then shake it out hard and the ties don t come loose and it all comes together quickly      
326,5.0,                       as a guy that has been sleeping alone on a twin mattress for his whole life  the concept of bedding existing beyond my limited world of a single pillow and blanket completely baffled me  when i had to fill out my registry for my upcoming wedding  it was completely mind boggling to find out that there are things on this planet such as quilts  duvets  comforters  throws  flat sheets  bed skirts  and an extensive collection of different species of pillows   i still don t understand what purpose a  sham  serves   despite my own discomfort in learning about these things  let alone shopping for them  buying and using this duvet cover was incredibly simple  we got the king size gray cover  and although my fiancee guided me through the installation process  it was really simple and easy  flip it inside out  tie the duvet corners  turn right side out   the fabric is soft and comfortable  and it will obviously be used all the time  so we ll definitely get our money s worth out of it  despite the tight packaging  the cover was relatively wrinkle free which really surprised me  overall  great product  happy  and less confused  customer      
327,5.0,                       i love this duvet cover   it s so soft and looks absolutely beautiful   the color is what i expected   the ties inside the duvet cover are extremely helpful with keeping the duvet in place   the initial color has not fading after a couple washings   i would highly recommend you purchase one in the color of your choosing      
328,3.0,                       honestly  i really like this duvet cover for the most part  super comfy and fit my insert really well  however  the color of the blue looks a lot darker in the picture than what you receive  unfortunately  my duvet cover also ripped the second time i washed it  also  it did not do my hair any favors  i have fine hair and i woke up every morning with i can only describe as greasy hair  i  ended up taking it off and putting my old duvet cover back on      
329,5.0,                       i had never heard of these before but needed this to cover my all white comforter to keep it from getting dirty  it was hard to throw a huge comforter into the washing machine and drier so this saves so much time and makes the process a whole lot easier  already recommended this to a few friends      
330,5.0,                       i bought this for my spare bedroom  the color is so soft and pretty  the material is too   it was also a great price      
331,1.0,                       very annoying  i can t even use it because my comforter gets bundled inside and looks like a big clump     
332,5.0,                       i love the color and the size  it also isnt too hot or too cold      
333,5.0,                       i m really picky about sheets and bedding overall  this duvet cover is flawless  amazing quality  super super soft and made so well        recommend      
334,3.0,                       i love that it is soft   i have sheets made out of the same material   it is thin like a sheet   i purchased the grey it is a light grey which i wanted  i have a black lab and a light colored dog   yes it is covered in hair just like anything you would buy for your bed if you sleep with your babies  so if you want super softness and have a dark animal get a dark color and vice versa       
335,5.0,                       this is an amazing duvet cover  i just used it for the first time last night so have no idea about the quality long term  but it is very well made  soft  such a great color  and i will buy another      
336,5.0,                       i love this cover  this is a gift for our teen daughter and she is very picky when it comes to color  softness  and comfort on anything that has to do with sleeping  thank you for meeting her standards  awesome product       
337,5.0,                       such a smooth comforter cover  definitely keeps the bed warm  even has the inner ties to keep the comforter from shifting too much  which i love      
338,5.0,                       this is so soft and so easy to spot clean  i will be buying more in different colors     
339,5.0,                       love this duvet cover  so soft and comfy  and a great price  washed it before we used it  and have washed it since and it s still perfectly soft  definitely reccomend     
340,5.0,                       had been searching for a new duvet cover that wouldn t break the bank and this is it   the color is a soft mauve pink i e  a very neutral tone   its very soft  basically wrinkle free and zips shut   also has the four corner tie string to ensure that the duvet itself doesn t just bunch up in the middle which is very nice   love it      
341,5.0,                       was looking around for a soft  lightweight  and inexpensive duvet cover  after reading through many reviews  i decided to purchase this one  i am very pleased with this purchase  the duvet cover is very soft and lightweight  it feels cotton like  but the microfiber makes it more cozy      
342,5.0,                       super soft  love this cover  at that price  i can buy a different color to have as a back up cover when washing one      
343,5.0,                       i love this duvet  i have recommended it to my roommate who has told me she wants to steal mine  it is so soft and comfortable  the colors is a perfect dust blush pink  it was perfect right out of the bag  i highly recommend it  i purchased a king for my queen bed because i like it to hang down the sides      
344,5.0,                       perfect cover to protect the down comforter  the subtle stripe adds to the look  it is soft but durable      
345,5.0,                       i love this duvet  i got the pink one   i was worried that the look would reflect the price  so wrong  its even better in person  just enough color to keep a neutral look  soft enough that i have to tell my husband to stop using it without the sheets  i have had no issues with wrinkles  getting a second one for my daughters room  only issue might be the tie strings at each corner of the duvet to keep the comforter from sliding  make sure you tie them tight  probably just me though      
346,5.0,                       i loved this so much  the packaging was helpful and visually appealing  i took it out and fell in love with the softness  it was so nice  it did come with some wrinkles but once i wash it  it will holefully be better but its not thats bad  i live the color and matches my room perfectly        purchase  especially for the price       
347,5.0,                       this is a very lightweight duvet   much like a sheet  i washed the duvet before use and it showed no signs of immediate wear  the duvet is very soft  so far i am very happy with this purchase  we are only on week one      
348,5.0,                       so happy with purchase  took a lot of time reading reviews and so glad i went with this duvet cover  it is so soft and so easy to insert down comforter  love the hidden zipper closure  love that i can machine wash it  which is huge for this momma  definitely recommend      
349,5.0,                       my husband and i recently converted to being duvet users  this is the only cover set i ve bought and we re in love  it s so soft and there s no wrinkles  my sleep has also improved so much  i m usually a light sleeper  but for the past two days i have been waking up feeling like i was in a deep sleep  the only bad thing about this set is i can t stop enjoying how good it feels      
350,5.0,                       easily put the duvet in  cozy  not super hot tho  i bought a king but should ve gotten a california king so that the blanket would drape over the bed      
351,5.0,                       really soft and beautiful   love it     
352,5.0,                       excellent bed sheet     
353,5.0,                       great price     
354,5.0,                       i was a bit skeptical ordering a duvet cover off amazon  but i m happy i did  the cover is very soft with a hidden zipper closure  it s also a nice true white vs a lot of covers that are more of an off white soft white color  i returned the      duvet i got from macy s since this is much nicer  thank you      
355,5.0,                       love this duvet cover  soft  comfortable   and not too hot  i would buy again in a second      
356,5.0,                       surprisingly comfortable  lightweight  and doesn t trap too much heat in  i washed with cold water on light and hung to dry  haven t seen any frays in the stitching after a few days of use      
357,4.0,                       it is super soft and totally happy i am regretting the duvet though because the comforter that i got is a down comforter and it moves around a lie inside so i am consistently having to fix it      
358,4.0,                       i bought this hoping that my dogs hair wouldnt stick to it as much as our previous covers but i was wrong  nevertheless i put this on my king size down comforter and it is swimming in it  i almost feel like the cover is for a california king comforter  the ties on the corners help it stay in place enough to adjust properly  i wil lsay it is very soft and with our down comforter its like sleeping in a cloud  it also came with a flat sheet but i dont believe in those so i dont use it  it is the same softness as the pillow covers and duvet cover itself  so if you have animals it wont help with the hair but youll sleep in a cloud so it evens out      
359,5.0,                       i love everything about this comforter set  in fact it s the  rd one i ve purchased   different sizes   colors  it s super soft  easy to take care of  comfy  and just the right weight so you don t get all sweaty while sleeping      
360,5.0,                       this duvet cover was the perfect color for what i was looking for  it is super soft and feels comfy  i was worried it would be the type of material that isn t breathable but it feels great  great purchase      
361,5.0,                       i am so particular about my duvet sets and just linen in general that i barely purchase it on line  this set is absolutely beautiful and soft  it arrived as if you could just throw on and make your bed  i have to wash mine though  it came out of the washer  gentle cycle on cold  right into the dryer on to my goose down perfect  i would definitely recommend this      
362,5.0,                       so pretty and feminine but without being too pink  i was nervous that it would be more of a pepto bismol pink since it s hard to tell when ordering online  but it s a soft dusty pink and exactly what i wanted  great quality  perfect thickness and super soft  machine washed and dried a handful of times with no issue at all  one of my favorite duvet cover sets      
363,5.0,                       i really liked the duvet and it arrived quickly  but i needed a darker shade of blue  i will be purchasing the color i need from the same company      
364,5.0,                       good quality  soft  fits great  love that it zips closed      
365,5.0,                       exceeded my expectations  the material is so soft and comfortable  true color  have recommended to several friends      
366,5.0,                       washes well  looks beautiful  amazingly soft  fits twin duvet with room to spare  love how the pink is very soft and muted so that it has a very slight cool grey undertone  perfect in daughter s room      
367,5.0,                       i have only had this duvet cover for about a week but so far it is perfect and i will update my review if there are any negative things people should know most new things aren t the same after that first wash but this duvet is still so soft and comfortable  i d say its a little on the warm side but that is also because of the down comforter inside of it it is not some beautiful duvet  very plain and looks like an oversized pillow cover but thats ok with me i bought a king and fits my king comforter perfectly  the ties inside make it super easy to attach and the zipper is perfectly placed so it is not noticeable      
368,5.0,                       i ve only been using this duvet set for a few days but i love it so far  i was a bit surprised by the quality when i opened the package  i wasn t expecting it to look and feel so nice  the zipper works and is hidden as promised in the description  it really is a nice update for it bedroom  i like the casual and comfy look and it is softer than i expected  the fabric is sturdy  not thin like some cheaper versions   i would definitely purchase again      
369,5.0,                       i ordered this when i finally decided to go back to using a comforter for winter after trying to keep warm under summer coverlet with tons of blankets  i veered away from comforters as i like a neater look  however  this cover  not being      cotton  looks nice and smooth once i steamed out a few wrinkles and is very soft to the touch  i haven t washed yet as we still use sheets  so don t know how much it will wrinkle after  the pillow shams are very basic  but i have decorative pillows anyway      
370,5.0,                       i was very hesitate to purchase site unseen  but was very surprised at the quality of product i received  so pleasantly surprised  i m purchasing another for back up the material is a soft  almost linen feel to it  perfect fit  and with the inside ties my duvet did not slide or move at all  and to me that is a huge selling factor  i would suggest this to anyone needing a good soft duvet cover  it definitely fits in with the new linen phase that seems to be in fashion right now  i got the pink  which is a really pretty blush color  thank goodness    just give it a try  i promise you will not be disappointed      
371,5.0,                       didn t expect to like this as much as i do  was really driven to purchase by the price point which is excellent  very high quality duvet cover the white looks great on my king bed with colorful pillows      
372,5.0,                       very nice material  really like how it has corner ties  helps a lot with keeping duvet in place  been looking for this particular blush color and it came exactly as i hoped      
373,5.0,                       very very soft  pleasantly surprised  was nervous to order without feeling the material first because i m very picky when it comes to fabric  but this is perfect  the color is gorgeous too     
374,5.0,                       looooooove it     sooooo soft  soooo comfy    in that blush pink color too it s absolutely amazing  in the past i ve just gone to tj max and gotten bed sets but those are so cheap and get torn up i finally broke down and bought a comforter and duvet cover and i will never go back       
375,5.0,                       i ve only had the cover for   days but i am so happy with it  it s extremely soft and comfortable  it was so easy to put the duvet inside and the corner ties help to keep the duvet in place  the zipper close is good quality and it feels like this duvet cover will last quite awhile is it wrong that i daydream about doing nothing but coming home and climbing in my bed      
376,4.0,                       the color and material were great however it could use more ties on the inside  it doesn t hold the duvet insert very well  i ll have to sew on additional ties on the sides to help  other than that i was happy with this purchase      
377,5.0,                       i love this duvet cover  it s extremely soft  i washed it before using and i love the color  it was so easy to put on my duvet with the help of the ties and the zipper is exactly what i like to make sure the duvet is secure  it makes my covers feel plush and is great for the price point  i will be purchasing another set      
378,5.0,                       i love this comforter cover  it fits perfectly and is very well made  the color works superbly with my bedroom decor  it is so soft  even my husband commented on its cozy texture  nice and comfy  the perfect compliment to my down comforter  thank you for such a quality product      
379,5.0,                       obsessed with this super soft duvet cover      
380,5.0,                       great duvet for the price  it is also very soft and light which is nice  my original set came with a stain on one of the pillow shams  i contacted amazon and they sent me a replacement the next day  great customer service  and i can t wait to use my new duvet      
381,5.0,                       i looked at a lot of duvet covers before settling on this one   i love that this one is soft  it was soft right out of the package and washing it only made it better i have washed it several times already and  there s no need for ironing      
382,5.0,                       surprisingly soft and comfortable   bought it for the spring and it stayed cool all night which was great but i m now going to use it this fall because ican t part with this comfortable material   going to order i m grey      
383,5.0,                       this cover is sooo soft  it also held up nicely after i washed it on cold and gently tumble dried it  for reference  i have a full size bed with a white queen size duvet  the duvet i have inside is the linenspa all season white down alternative quilted comforter  also amazing   the cover fits perfectly over my duvet and i find that the  white  color is a pretty crisp white despite some reviews saying it was more of an off white color  it s not completely wrinkle free but that doesn t bother me  i absolutely love it      
384,1.0,                       this is not a comforter its just like sheets this is not a joke if you want a fluffy comforter absolutely do not buy this please         
385,5.0,                       i first purchased an expensive duvet cover from a department store   i washed it per the care instructions   it was a disaster     the lint  the wrinkles   i returned it and immediately purchased this duvet cover   it was washed and used the day it arrived   i love it   i will be purchasing a couple of different colors        
386,5.0,                       i was impressed by this duvet cover  it is soft  and very comfortable  i just bought a second for my daughter s bed  it s not wrinkle free but that doesn t make a difference  i m not sure why that even matters to people  i would recommend this to those looking to purchase      
387,5.0,                       love it     
388,5.0,                       i love my duvet cover  it s super soft and seems to almost never get wrinkled  the only problem i seem to have is it can appear to get dirty quickly with hair and other fuzz because it s white  i think you run into this problem with most covers that are white but i still love it and if it gets dirty i use a lint roller to get whatever s on it off      
389,5.0,                       when i told my mom i wanted this for christmas  i didn t realize it was a duvet cover     but i have no regrets  i had a comforter that i hated and was taking up space in my closet  but now it s covered by this beautiful mocha pink fabric  the material is soft and great in quality  you can tell by it s weight  the color is perfect and not overwhelmingly pink  i m so happy with the product  will recommend to friends and family      
390,5.0,                       so soft and comfortable  love that they have a tie string to tie the corners up  our bed looks and feels like a fluffy cloud or marshmallow       
391,4.0,                       i really really like this duvet set  i gave it   stars because my comforter inside doesn t like to stay put  it has the ties inside but doesn t want to stay tied  i just shake it out every morning to get things back into place so it s not a huge deal  i love how soft it is and the color so much  i will definitely be ordering again when i need a color change      
392,5.0,                       i like how soft the material is  and it seems like it would be something that would last for awhile      
393,5.0,                       love this duvet cover  very soft and cuddly  it adds a small amount of weight  which is exactly what i wanted  so far  my cats hair has not stuck to it badly either    worth the buy  for sure      
394,5.0,                       oh my gosh  slipping into bed now feels like an orgasm on my skin  this is the softest most perfect thing to ever touch my body  i ve had this in my shopping cart for a year  but was scared to buy it because of its low price point  man  oh man  was i wrong   sometimes in life cheap ain t a trick      
395,5.0,                       i love the feeling of this duvet  light  soft  breathable  the pink is nice a subtle  i was happy when it arrived that it wasn t really pepto pink  this duvet uses ties to secure it  those can be a little bit of a pain but it was worth it for the right color  fit and comfort      
396,5.0,                       the softest duvet ever made   do yourself a favor and buy this you wont regret it  the quality is fantastic  i love the zipper rather than buttons  buy this one      
397,5.0,                       we absolutely love this comforter  very soft and light without feeling cheaply made  we were worried about buying something fancy with two dogs that might destroy it but would buy this even without that reason  definitely would recommend      
398,5.0,                       soft and comfy and easy to put on our duvet  the blush pink is a lovely pop of color  will probably buy more in other colors      
399,5.0,                       this is the best duvet cover i ve ever had  extremely soft and comfortable  doesn t show pet hair  hasn t gotten and pulls and to top it off doesn t wrinkle    my only complaint is that there isn t more colors i would buy them all   great job guys      
400,5.0,                       pros  super soft washes up great zipper close great colorcons  everything stick to it have to wash it ofteni still think it s great   i definitely would recommend and buy again      
401,1.0,                       doesn t do great in the wash and is so wrinkly after  takes a long time to iron it out  also don t care for the pink  looked different in the photos than it does in my house      
402,2.0,                       if you run hot don t get it  it is soft  but it makes us so hot at night  it is a true white and having a zipper at the bottom is nice      
403,5.0,                       it arrived very quickly  it was soft and wrinkle free right out of the package  i love that it has ties to prevent the duvet from slipping and a zipper rather than buttons  my husband said this is best duvet cover i have bought  its a great material that doesnt make you too hot or too cold  definitely would recommend      
404,5.0,                       i am pleased with this duvet cover  i was looking for a lightweight  washable  and durable duvet cover since we have two small kids and they dirty our bed often during story time or nursing  this fits the bill  i appreciate the zipper closure and the softness of the fabric  as well as the price point      
405,4.0,                       soft  definitely a value for the price   alternative to expensive high tread count cotton when i just wanted a color change   worth it to have an extra duvet cover   worth it to not deal with buttons falling off  will just buy a new one if the zipper wears out   for this price i have no complaints      
406,5.0,                       so soft   so comfy  beautiful color  looks gorgeous in my daughter s room      
407,5.0,                       very soft and comfortable  its a steal for the price  it fit my down comforter perfectly  i was skeptical to but since my down comforter doesn t have loops for the ties  but haven t had any issues with it moving around or bunching up      
408,5.0,                       very comfortable  keeps me warm all night  has a nice weight to it as well   highly recommend      
409,5.0,                       amazing product  feels better than my      sheets      
410,5.0,                       this duvet cover is amazing for the price  extremely soft and comfy my cats love it  color is definitely more blue pink instead of the mocha it looks like in the photos so be aware     
411,5.0,                       honestly  i was skeptical of all of the good reviews but this is a great duvet cover  super soft but not too hot  i ve washed it a few times so far and it seems to be holding up well  i d definitely recommend it      
412,3.0,                       the cover was very soft and seemed like it would be comfortable  but i will be returning it because the color is not at all what was shown in the pictures and is not what i wanted  i ordered the grey and was sent what looks like the  light grey  from their photos  it seems as though whoever packaged it just grabbed the closest  grey  one they could find and threw it in the bag  the best word to describe the one i received is drab  it almost looks dirty  i will just order from a different company to avoid the inevitable  colors vary by batch  and photos were taken by a professional photographer  spiel that i ll get if i complain about the color  photos taken by a professional photographer should mean that the color is almost exactly what you actually receive  not drastically different      
413,5.0,                       this duvet cover is soft  doesn t wrink e  and is easy to take off and on with its zippered bottom      
414,5.0,                    muy suave        
415,5.0,                       we just received this last night and i hurried to put it on before bedtime  it is so soft and i am really impressed with it  i was so comfortable all night and can t wait to use it again tonight  definitely a  review      
416,4.0,                       nice sheets  the quality will probably not allow it to last more than a year in good condition  but they are very soft and silky  i didnt regret buying     
417,5.0,                       with my down comforter  it s like sleeping in a cloud      
418,5.0,                       it s beautiful and very comfortable  also it has a good zipper      
419,5.0,                       since our pup likes to jump up on the bed  i was looking for something easy to clean  the fabric is very nice quality and feels nice to sleep under  the weight is also a plus  we just put our old comforter inside of the duvet cover and those two combined makes it have a light weighted blanket feel to it  though the color wasn t what i necessarily was going for  the gray is more cool colored than the warm color i was looking for  i could not be more happy with it  the comforter inside also stays in place instead of falling down inside the duvet cover like our previous one did      
420,5.0,                       i searched a lot for duvet covers  reviews and was convinced to purchase the following  but i did not expect it to be this good  it is very soft and warm  even though my duvet is a bit short  meaning the cover itself is actually not too thin   i would recommend it and am satisfied with it      
421,4.0,                       this super soft duvet would be absolutely perfect if you could tell  top  from  bottom  love the zipper closure      
422,5.0,                       these duvet covers are super soft and good quality  the color was as shown in the photos  if you take them out of the dryer right away  you don t have to iron them  the zipper and inside ties are nice touches  i bought two and would buy them again      
423,5.0,                       this duvet cover is excellent  it s extremely soft and feels like you re sleeping in a cloud  it does get pretty warm so sometimes i have to take it off but i love it and may get another in a different color      
424,5.0,                       recommend buying this product  the price is great  i went to a bunch of discount stores and could not find the same price and quality  so i gave this a try  and ended up highly satisfied  will purchase again from this company      
425,3.0,                       i was so excited to find a duvet in this color  blush pink is waaay harder than i thought to find  but when i got it i noticed the color was completely different than whats pictured  it s more of a cute lighter pink rather than a tone of pink  wasn t super soft either  i returned the product      
426,4.0,                       i love this duvet cover  very soft and comfortable  one big con is that i washed it before i put it on my bed and there s already loose threads  so i guess it won t last that long but it s very pretty and the exact color i was looking for i wash my bedding once a week so i know the threads will keep coming undone and it will begin to fall apart sadly    otherwise love it      
427,5.0,                       love it  i went to bed bath and beyond first and the duvets were like      so i came here but was worried about the quality  this one was super white  like made my other pillowcases look yellow  and very soft  it s a smooth jersey material  fits perfect  easy to put on feels and looks great  very happy with this product      
428,5.0,                       just received this and i am very happy that this product is better than imagined  great deal      
429,5.0,                       i had to share how happy i am with this    don t like to buy online and this inexpensive but i have a dog who likes to sleep on the bed    i took a risk and thought i can return it if it looks cheap  i am thrilled  it is really gorgeous and i highly recommend  i was going to order from rh but thought i d try this first      happy  happy      
430,5.0,                       this is a great duvet cover  the grey is either masculine or just classy  depending on your room  the fabric is comfortable  cozy and soft  it s not too thin  has ties to keep the comforter in place  and washes and dries nicely  great buy  and the seller offers a   year warranty  you can t beat that      
431,5.0,                       if your hesitant to buy  don t be  just note  this is a duvet cover  not a comforter  bought this for my daughter s bed  my daughter loves it    the pink color is a really settle pink  just what she wanted  there were no harsh smells out of the box  which is nice  the duvet didn t come with any ties inside  but that was no problem  the comforter doesn t shift around a lot in the duvet  anyway  it s perfect      
432,3.0,                       not great quality  gets very hot while sleeping  feels very soft but cheaply made  it would be good for a guest bedroom or a room you don t use much an extra duvet to have on hand while doing laundry etc     
433,3.0,                       this product is a great product  the only reason it didn t work for us is because of our kitten  she would stick her little nails in it and it made it feel like you were laying in a bed of cookie crumbs but that s not the covers fault  we will just have to get something thicker for now  it was very comfortable  it was my husbands first time trying out a duvet and he slept very comfortable for the time we had it  it is very thin and i know some people like that but i like that thicker feel to blankets  it s priced perfectly  it s a very good product unless you have a little kitten     
434,5.0,                       i got the pink mocha and it is absolutely beautiful with my gray bed   the fabric is incredibly soft and looks extremely rich   i would definitely recommend this purchase      
435,5.0,                       love this duvet cover it has corner ties which make it so much easier to keep your duvet in place  it s soft and light weight      
436,5.0,                       wasn t really sure about buying a duvet cover but this one surprised me it s super soft  comfortable  and it was easy to put on my comforter  if you like something with more weight to it this is a good buy and it doesn t make me sweat in my sleep doesn t make me to hot or anything i honestly love it and the color is cute  it does get a little wrinkly but that doesn t bother me much  would highly recommend buying      
437,5.0,                       i love it  super soft comfortable and reasonably priced  i have brooklinen duvet covers and wanted something a bit lower in price because my cat tears up all my sheets and these are by far the best i have found in the price range  holds my sheex down comforter perfectly      
438,5.0,                       bought for my grandson and he loves the color and softness   perfect     
439,5.0,                       i can t recommend this product enough  the color is beautiful and the duvet is so so soft  my husband and i both love it  it s super comfortable and it looks so nice on our bed  we will definitely order another one in the future for our guestroom      
440,3.0,                       i just got this today and i am already in love   it is so soft and the perfect pink color  i can t wait to sleep on it tonight  going to get more pillows as we speak     i still love the the feel of this blanket and the color  but it had these very dainty strings to attach to my duvet  the strings already snapped so my duvet gets bunched up everyday with nothing to hold onto it  this aspect is really annoying since it adds extra time to me making my bed as i have to open it and lay the duvet flat again just to have it bunch up as i sleep      
441,5.0,                       okay  i spent weeks searching for a cover  this one is amazing  don t hesitate  buy

446,5.0,                       i have been searching for a muave colored bedding set and have had a hard time finding one  i found this duvet cover and decided to give it a try  i am so happy i did  the color ia beautiful and the material is super soft  i am going to purchase the gray version next      
447,5.0,                       i love this so much that i got   for the master bed and one for each of my   guest beds  soft  easy to put insert in  nice colors  i ve owned a few expensive duvets in my lifetime and this beats all of them      
448,5.0,                       if you are looking for soft   stop right here  i was debating between several duvet covers  but kept going back to the fact that this one looked so soft and cozy  it does not disappoint  it washed well and left no wrinkles and was easy to attach to the duvet  i wish this company made sheets in this exact material  i highly recommend this product       
449,5.0,                       this comfort cover is not just for the ladies  but dressed with masculine faux fur throw pillows and and a faux animal skin at the foot of the bed  makes it classy and wraps around you for an amazing night s sleep      
450,5.0,                       soft like a baby s bottom  did the trick for me    helps keep my comforter clean now since all i have to do is wash the duvet cover  loops on corners are welcome too  so you can tie your comforter to them so the duvet doesn t lose its position as frequently      
451,5.0,                       much softer than i was expecting  i love the material and the color  fits my queen duvet perfectly        
452,5.0,                       ordered in the grayish blue color  came super fast  very soft  washed well and the color is just amazing  would buy again    adds weight but still keeps me cool      
453,5.0,                       i ve had it for a month and it held up well in the washing machine  it did wrinkle a bit  but easy enough to iron and still feels soft   the trick with buying inexpensive  thin duvet covers is to size down  i have a king size down comforter and purchased a queen duvet cover      
454,3.0,                       started to pill within   months     
455,5.0,                       as other reviewers have mentioned  this duvet  and shams  is incredibly soft  the zipper closure is great especially when compared to a dozen buttons  the ties on the inside corners are helpful too  i ve washed it twice thus far and have no complaints      
456,5.0,                       i was reading reviews before purchasing this  and many had said that it was really soft    and let me tell you  it lives up to the reviews  love how cozy it feels  would definitely recommend it      
457,3.0,                       disappointed  very thin and poor quality     
458,5.0,                       this duvet cover is everything i was looking for     i was struggling to find a duvet cover that would fit my needs and this was just what i wanted   the color is exactly how it looks in the pictures   it s also super soft and comfy   would definitely recommend     
459,4.0,                       i would recommend this duvet cover to anyone looking for a super soft and hotel comfortable nights sleep  i purchased the queen size and it fits perfectly on my duvet and comes with a zipper which i love  it also comes with two pillowcases that are also super soft  overall  a great purchase      
460,5.0,                       i love this duvet covers  it keeps you cool and it s super soft  very comfy     
461,5.0,                       this is immensely soft  unbelievable for the price  don t be fooled by people giving bad reviews  i read some and they literally didn t know what a duvet was  this is meant to have a comforter put inside it  if you don t know  it isn t just a fancy word for comforter  the zipper functions fine  it has ties in the corners  and the pillow shams are also so soft and have the little flaps to keep your pillows inside  i m buying again in another color for my son s new bed and will replace mine here for sure      
462,3.0,                       loved this duvet cover at first  but less than two months after buying it  the zipper fell off so now i can t zip it up  good product but clearly quality isn t great      
463,5.0,                       this duvet cover is well made and i ve been satisfied with the sleep so far  the zipper is subtle and makes it easy to remove tie in the duvet  the material is nice and soft but also seems durable enough to take some wear and tear  i didn t think i d use the pillow covers but they are better than the ones i already had with my sheets      
464,5.0,                       such a soft  delicate cover for your duvet  i love it and the color  very easy to put on and comes with ties do that the duvet doesn t slip off  overall very happy with this purchase and will probably buy another color in the future      
465,5.0,                       i loved the color of this duvet  i though it was not going to be the shade of pink i wanted  but it turned out to be just like the picture  i also love the softness of it      
466,5.0,                       this duvet is worth every penny   it s extremely soft and kept me cool all night  and it was so easy to put on my comforter  i highly recommend this product to anyone  one of my best amazon purchases to date   mark koenig     
467,5.0,                       i love this duvet cover  it s exactly what i was looking for  the perfect color  i purchased the shade pink mocha which is really more of a purple gray color  it s beautiful  it s so soft and smooth  looks very comfy and polished on my bed  i wanted something plain and simple and this fits the bill      
468,3.0,                       i wish that there were more ties to keep the duvet insert spread out so it doesn t bunch in places  it s really soft  and i e loved it so far  but there are these weird blue green specks and splotches i found  i haven t done anything that make that appear there  so idk what caused this  not worth returning for small splotches  but still frustrating     
469,4.0,                       read before buy  i thought this was a comforter because i didn t read it correctly  it turned out to be a cover for comforters  it s really comfy and really nice but hard to maintain un wrinkled  the comforter bunches up every time and every morning it s a work out to straighten  but it s still nice and if your willing to spend    min to make your bed every morning i would recommend it       
470,5.0,                       i was actually blown away by the quality of this duvet cover  i shopped around for something durable  machine washable  soft and comfortable  and this fits all those needs  it was so easy to attach my duvet especially with the zip closure  couldn t be happier with this purchase   i ll definitely be buying a couple different colors      
471,5.0,                       super soft  there are little ties in the corners of the duvet      
472,5.0,                       i love this duvet     i wasn t sure about it because i ve never had on before but it looks so nice and clean on my bed and it is so so so soft   it s a must have       
473,5.0,                       the best duvet cover for cozy blanket people  i always struggle to find one i actually want to curl up in  i don t get the point of beautiful but scratchy duvets that you can t actually use  i will be buying another one for my guest room as well      
474,5.0,                       i have it tried a lot of duvets  definitely best ever      
475,5.0,                       i love this duvet   super soft and lightweight   i will definitely be buying another one      
476,2.0,                       i m pretty disappointed in this duvet cover  it is extremely wrinkle prone  for example  i washed it after receiving it and put it directly onto my bed  it s been on my bed for over a month now  and there are still creases from when it was folded in transit  it is decently soft  but not soft enough to deserve all the hype it has received for being soft in other comments      
477,5.0,                       i got the pink mocha  the duvet feels very luxurious for the price  it is extremely soft and the color is exactly as shown in the pictures  highly recommended      
478,5.0,                       i recently upgraded to a king size mattress so of course i needed to get the works  sheets  comforter and duvet cover  this was a a great price and is incredibly soft  it does come with ties in the corners to secure to your insert  no complaints      
479,5.0,                       this was my first duvet cover and it is amazing   a friend recommended it and it is wonderful  my husband loves it too      
480,5.0,                       this is extremely soft  we bought it for our daughters bed and it s so comfortable      
481,5.0,                       so cozy and love the color  pink      
482,5.0,                       i recently redid my bedding and spent a lot on my quilt and shams so i wanted to get a simple duvet  cover that wouldn t break the bank   this more than did the job   was impressed how soft it was and that it had ties on the inside   exceeded expectations      
483,5.0,                       this is the third one of these i have bought  i love them  really great for the price  i have white  pink and light grey  all of the colors are nice  they re super soft  easy to put on the comforter and they don t come super wrinkly  definitely recommend      
484,5.0,                       really comfortable and soft to touch  the color is wonderful  highly recommended      
485,3.0,                       the description is not very detailed please note you are only buying the cover you will still need to purchase the insert for the comforter which comes to about the same price as purchasing a comforter set  i thoughti was saving money by buying this one   it is a gorgeous color and material seems to soft  just got it today   not bad  i guess      
486,5.0,                       i m obsessed with this duvet  the zipper makes this really easy to come on and off in order to wash  and obviously keeps everything in place  it s super soft  and i like the color a lot as well  i chose the navy for more of a gender neutral option      
487,5.0,                       i have put off buying a duvet cover for months because i could never find one i liked  this one is a dream  it s so cozy and soft and i ve gotten a lot of compliments on it  it was easy to get on and has stayed in place since i put it on  the color is exactly as shown in the photos  i have not washed it yet but so far it has held up great      
488,4.0,                       has a nice zipper  light weight  good price and value  material is a little thin  sheet like      
489,5.0,                       brighter pink  not blush  but i still love it      
490,5.0,                       this is the most comfortable duvet cover i ve ever owned  super soft and stays wrinkle free  i also love that it has a zipper to close instead of the usual buttons that tend to come off easily  i definitely recommend this      
491,5.0,                       super soft  and pink mocha is an amazing color      
492,5.0,                       its so soft and color is exactly my favorite grey  love this cover so much     
493,5.0,                       i was looking for a duvet cover for my down comforter and i chose this one because it was relatively cheap  had good reviews  and looked like high quality material  i love this duvet cover  it fits my comforter really well  its soft and super warm  the only thing i somewhat dislike is how it gets wrinkly  but once you make the bed it smoothes right out  i am very satisfied with this company  if you re looking for a sign to choose a duvet cover  this is it      
494,5.0,                       cozy and soft     
495,3.0,                       beautiful color  soft  and warm   but after just a couple of weeks on our bed  there are already a couple of pulls in the material  as well as what appear to be stains   we haven t experienced this with our other  more expensive  duvet   next time  i ll probably fork up the extra money for something that will look good longer      
496,5.0,                       sweet baby jesus i love this duvet  washed before throwing on my new duvet insert after purchasing a brand new mattress  i feel like i m in a hotel bed  pure bliss  the duvet is very soft to the touch  thick enough that i cant see the insert underneath and came out of the dryer with very few minor wrinkles  i may order another to have on hand      
497,4.0,                       for the price  this item is good  i ve only washed once but so far so good      
498,5.0,                       this cover is absolutely beautiful  the material is very soft  heavier than bed sheets but not too hot  i loved the simplicity of the zip  most covers i had before had buttons or poppers  i also love the corner ties  duvets that move in their covers are never comfortable  i chose the pink which turned out not to be quite right for my room so i am returning it and getting the white  great value  great quality      
499,5.0,                       easy to wash and place my duvet into  very lightweight      
500,4.0,                       the softest duvet cover i have ever owned  only complaint too big for my king size down comforter  so there is loose cloth that gets wrapped around my leg  i m a fidgety sleeper  there are ties on each inside corner  but wish they were longer  every morning i do have to shake out the comforter to get it straight inside the cover  however  the softness got me  so i will be keeping this cover      
501,5.0,                       just like the picture  very great material      
502,5.0,                       i love this duvet  it is incredibly soft and has a very  clean  look to it  it is also very easy to clean  no fuss  just cuteness  i got the pink one   i was a little worried the pink would be too much  but it really isn t  it is clearly pink  but not overbearing  and pink is not typically my color  it s just the color that fit best with the pallet of my room  my only complaint is that it s starting to snag a little from my cats  but also that is completely understandable since i purchased it to stop my cats from tearing huge slashes in my comforter      
503,5.0,                       absolutely amazing       it really feels expensive this is my first duvet so i was kinda worried about the quality but this is amazing  its suuuuper soft  it doesn t have any type of packaging smell which i really appreciate   the zipper is good quality  easy to put on considering this is my first time using a duvet so far im love  i forgot to mention that is completely breathable something that i love cause im a hot sleeper      
504,5.0,                       honestly  this is one of the nicest duvet sets i ve ever owned  i sleep    times better because of the softness and smoothness of the material  it s almost as is if you re laying on clouds  if you re thinking about getting this set i suggest you do  it s easy to clean and just comfortable      
505,4.0,                       super soft and simple which is what i like  it s a little see through which is why i m giving it only   stars  i have a black and white comforter and you can see the black  but for the price it s definitely worth it      
506,4.0,                       i bought this cover with a quilt pattern duvet  it was easy to put together with the little roll up duvet cover hack pros  super soft and thin  laying under this truly felt like a cloud  came with matching pillow cases  which are also soft  has a zipper and ribbon ties for each corner cons  will show the pattern of the duvet underneath  i was able to see the squares if i laid on it or my cat laid on it  i didn t mind this but this might bother some people   if you have pets with nails  i have a cat with claws  and they get stuck  the fabric will pull  i ended up having some lines on it and some strings coming out  even on my pillow case  this was a little hard to avoid cause my cat lives in my room  if your pet doesn t  or has short or no nails  this is easily avoidable   collects cat hair pretty easily  a few of the ribbon ties came undone  but when tied too tight were a struggle to untie i had to stop using this because i live in a hot state so i needed a lighter blanket for summer and my queen bed is now against the wall so too much of the duvet   cover ended up on the floor      
507,5.0,                       very pleased with this cover  nice colors and wash well with no problems      
508,5.0,                       comfy soft and pretty  very affordable and decent for the value i like that it s not too heavy because i get hot at night and sweat   the duvet cover is very breathable and comfy i slept like a baby all night      
509,5.0,                       love it      
510,5.0,                       love this duvet cover  it s very soft and comfortable  the quality you get for the price is awesome  duvet covers can get really expensive so this was the way to go  i also love the range of colors  if i get tired of the pink i will definitely order a different color      
511,5.0,                       its soft and the right fit      
512,3.0,                       i hate it  it looks cheap  feels cheap  washes like it s cheap  you get what you pay for  it has threads pulling and it has only been washed twice  the fabric feels like a curtain or stiff hotel sheet  i don t like it  the color isn t that spectacular either  very flat      
513,3.0,                       nice soft white sheet  just took off   stars because it has not even been   months and some of the threads are pulled        
514,2.0,                       i bought this duvet cover a few months ago in grey and loved it so much i bought another in white  unfortunately  the white duvet cover smells like old cheese  i ve washed it   times to try and get the smell out and nothing has gotten the smell out  i threw away the packaging so i m stuck with a cheesy smelling duvet cover        
515,5.0,                       this duvet cover is amazing  especially for the price  i was skeptical because it was so affordable  but it s a dream  it s super soft and i love the zipper  buttons are such a pain when putting your duvet cover on  what a great buy        
516,5.0,                       looooove this duvet  i ve bought a lot before but this was the most comfiest and softest  i probably could ve fit a king comforter just because there s extra space and my comforter doesn t fill it in all the way  but i love it so much  the color is perfect to mix and match pillows sheets etc  will by in other colors     
517,5.0,                       love it     
518,5.0,                       so happy with this purchase   super soft   wrinkle free   zipper closure   perfect fit   just wish i had purchased it for my bed and not the guestroom      
519,5.0,                       so soft and luxurious feeling  totally obsessed

522,3.0,                       i guess it s my own fault never purchased a duvet so had no idea it was without a comforter  writing this review to inform others you d definitely need to purchase an insert comforter for this  otherwise it s really pretty and comes with   pillow cases as well      
523,5.0,                       this duvet cover is soft  durable  and perfectly sized  i have washed and dried it a few times since purchasing it  delicates cycle  low heat tumble dry  with no tears  shrinkage  or discoloring  i recommend drying it zipped up  or you will get a blob of damp duvet at the end of your drying cycle  other than this one misadventure  which really was my error  not the duvet cover s issue   i have had no problems at all with this duvet cover  great purchase      
524,5.0,                       this is my first duvet cover purchase ever  it was a little tricky getting the comforter in the cover  but once it was in  it stayed in place  i haven t needed to make any adjustments  it looks and fits great  great value      
525,5.0,                       love it so far      
526,5.0,                       i absolutely love this duvet cover   it is super soft and stays looking clean and wrinkle less  the zipper is very nice quality and is nicely concealed as you have it on the bed  i would recommend this       
527,5.0,                       this fabric us very soft  plushy  and feels higher end than the price tag  the corner ties are super convenient  zipper is good quality  very happy with my purchase      
528,5.0,                       i love love love these covers  so soft and comfortable and i love the colors too  i got mine in the mauve pink     
529,4.0,                       this duvet cover is exactly the size and material advertized  and is very soft and pleasant to sleep under   color is true and the product is a welcome addition to my bedroom   it is not wrinkle free  but it s close enough   the only reason i m not giving it   stars is because the very first time i zipped the cover closed  the zipper broke   i was able to do some googling and figure out how to repair the zipper and close it  so i did not bother to contact the seller and complain   it s going to be a little bit of a pain to remove and replace the duvet inside when i wash the cover  but i will deal with it   all in all  a solid product      
530,1.0,                       the reasons why i gave a one start is because the zipper stopped zipping properly pretty much from the get go  i wouldn t recommend this item simply because we not longer use it after only having it a couple months  perhaps i just got a bad one  but i will say i m pretty let down      
531,5.0,                       this is the most comfortable duvet cover i ve ever owned    it is    times softer than the last one i got from bed bath and beyond that cost well over       i highly recommended       
532,2.0,                       i love how soft this duvet is and how it looks  the color is perfect  but unfortunately it really traps it and i live in florida  there s only    days out the year i would enjoy sleeping with this duvet cover  i wish i had realized sooner and tried to return it so if you re looking for something breathable don t even bother buying this      
533,5.0,                       this is a great duvet cover just like the picture  it s feel of great quality and not too thin  the zipper is nicely hidden  the pale pink is beautiful and it s very soft      
534,5.0,                       bought for daughter  she is a teenager and now i really can t her get out of her room  lol     
535,3.0,                       great color and softness   but i have to give it a low rating because my duvet cover cane with a small snag in the material  such a bummer  not as durable as i would have liked  especially when you have kids      
536,5.0,                       i received my cover and it goes over my comforter easily  the fabric was durable and soft  it matches the style in my room  i have a king size bed and i often have to use to separate blankets because my kids or husband take the covers  but now we have a big enough cover to not do that      
537,5.0,                       wow  no wonder this has   stars  super soft  quality material  feels really nice to sleep with and fits perfectly on my     x    king comforter  only wish there were more color options but white works well for now  highly recommended      
538,5.0,                       the color is a beautiful bright white and exactly what i wanted  the fabric is a soft smooth cotton that seems very breathable  the zipper is located at the bottom and very good quality and is hidden when closed  has corner ties to keep comforter in place  overall i m very pleased  great price and worth every penny      
539,5.0,                       super soft material  making waking up every morning for work extremely difficult  i would def purchase this again      
540,5.0,                       this duvet cover is so soft and comfortable   maybe not entirely wrinkle free  but for the price  it s perfect  and easy to wash    i also love the zipper on it  more secure than the buttons that some duvet covers come with      
541,3.0,                       the only reason i m giving this a three is because it is really soft and it does come with pillow cases     but  but  my dumb butt thought that it was a grey duvet cover like the kind you cover up with at night all toasty and warm with   not a cover that goes over a blanket that you are already suppose to have  i wouldn t of spent     on it had i know that  so now i m stuck here with a cover for a cover  to cover up with at night  i m actually depressed rn      
542,5.0,                       this is such a soft and comfy duvet  easy to put on and color is accurate to picture  such a great buy  i have seen duvets sold for three times the price and not be as nice as this      
543,5.0,                       loved it  material is super soft and the color is like a creamy pink super pretty  depending on what insert you buy to go with it  it s perfect for hot or cold weather        
544,2.0,                       this duvet cover is not what i expected  it holds a lot of heat and it grabs you  it feels like the is two covers on you also it needs more the corner ties      
545,5.0,                       this is definitely worth the price  feels like something super expensive  so soft and comfortable  better then more expensive ones i ve bought  not to light or to heavy  highly recommend  i bought the pink mocha and the color is perfect     
546,5.0,                       beautiful     
547,5.0,                       super soft and great color  great for what i intended it for      
548,4.0,                       i am new to using a duvet and duvet cover combo  i found this product on amazon and read a lot of reviews before committing to buying  although it s not completely wrinkle free i honestly don t mind it  it s so so very soft  i washed it before putting over my duvet and slept under it last night  what a dream  i definitely feel like i got my money s worth when comparing this to the      duvet covers i looked at  i would recommend this to anyone looking for a starter set      
549,5.0,                       i am in love with this  going to buy other colors  i can t get out of bed bc it s so soft      
550,5.0,                       this duvet is very soft and i love the color  i want to make it clear that this is not a blanket but a casing for a blanket  i didn t pay attention when ordering       
551,4.0,                       this was purchased as a cover for a comforter in a rental location  it is very soft and nice neutral color  grey    the only  issue  is the zipper closure which at first i was thrilled with because it s faster than buttons  but it s easy for it to get stuck or caught on the fabric so you just need to take extra care when zipping   be aware also  when using any duvet cover  they tend to get balled up in the dryer so you need to dry them in small increments to undo them or dry alone so it doesn t start collecting treasures like other sheets and towels   overall pleased with purchase      
552,5.0,                       this was my first time to purchase a duvet cover  i am extremely satisfied with the material and how easy it was to stuff my comforter inside  i would definitely recommend to others      
553,5.0,                       i bought this because my comforter was starting to look pretty rough  i had never used a duvet before but now i will never go back to a regular comforter  i bought a down blanket to go underneath this duvet and it s perfect  this duvet is so soft  i ve taken it off to wash it a few times and it still looks new  i m very impressed with the quality with it being so inexpensive  definitely worth every penny      
554,5.0,                       i ve been wanting a new duvet cover so i ordered the white colored ones  they re extremely soft and comfortable and literally make my bed look and feel like a cloud  definitely worth the price      
555,5.0,                       so glad i purchased this cover  it doesn t slide around because it has the inside ties  it is incredibly soft  i was worried that when i go to wash it the zipper may start having problems  no problems so far  beautiful  clean  white  and so soft      
556,5.0,                       i liked all the characteristics described above   easy to wash   care for     
557,5.0,                       absolutely love this duvet cover   it is so soft and comfy      
558,5.0,                       soft and cool     
559,5.0,                       this is really soft and the zipper makes it easy to put on  it works perfect for my king size down comforter      
560,5.0,                       i love the look   i wish the pillow cases stayed a little crisp looking  but overall it s a great diver  love the zipper       
561,5.0,                       you get what you pay for  thin  but soft and durable  zipper works great  have had it nearly six months and rotate colors  it has the ties inside in corner to tie your down comforter to  couldn t ask for more for this price point   very pleased      
562,5.0,                       such a pretty color and so soft      
563,5.0,                       i wanted a light soft duvet cover for a summer down comforter  this is perfect   has the ties so the comforter will stay in place  came with   pillowcases which is a bonus      
564,5.0,                       i waited to submit my review until i had a chance to use the duvet for a couple of weeks   the material is very soft  resists wrinkles well  and launders beautifully   love this cover   i will be buying another one for the guest bed      
565,3.0,                       still waiting for my insert but this cover is super soft which is nice  i debated between the pink and the blue but ultimately chose the blue   it s more grey though then blue  it has a small tint of blue     
566,5.0,                       this is so soft  comfortable  no wrinkles  i was afraid the cat hair would be like a magnet to it but so far so good  i washed before use and it held up great so far     
567,5.0,                       i was lucky enough to get this duvet set on prime day for a fabulous price  i just received it and was astounded by how well made it is lux and soft  the shade of pink is feminine and yet mature  i m just thrilled with this product      
568,5.0,                       really like it  it is a nice color  soft  and was easy to put on my comforter  i appreciate that it has a zipper instead of buttons  i wish i would have realized it was hang dry before purchasing though  but it s my own fault for not reading through  i ll keep it though and hang dry it on a nice sunny day      
569,5.0,                       omg i love this duvet cover  i was skeptical at first but one night snuggled in that cloud of paradise and i was a goner  i am contemplating buying in other colors  awesome buy      
570,5.0,                       for such a low price this cover feels great and is so soft and comfortable  even better than some of the more expensive ones we ve bought in the past      
571,5.0,                       really cute and softer than i expected  also very easy to clean  i accidentally got a stain on a pillow case once and i was worried the fabric would get ruined if i put it in the washing machine  i was wrong  it s still soft and didn t wrinkle at all  my only complaint is that i wish there was a matching bed skirt to go with the set  other than that very good quality        
572,5.0,                       quality product  the duvet cover is made of material that breathes  feels light  and if higher quality than i d imagined  each end comes with strings so you can tie your duvet on the inside and keep it in place  especially useful if you re someone who rolls around a lot and leaves the bed looking like scrambled eggs in the morning  highly recommend      
573,5.0,                       this was a good purchase  picked this up during a lightning sale so was able to save a few bucks  the duvet is true to the color shown on the screen  it is soft and easy to care for  glad i picked this up  i ll definitely look into this brand for additional duvet covers in the future      
574,5.0,                       even cuter in person  i was worried about getting a pink duvet cover   but this pink has a mature vibe  anyone can get away with      
575,5.0,                       it s so soft and comfortable  just in love with it      
576,5.0,                       color  soft pink   very nice  has not faded over  mo of washing durable zipper   closuresoft out of the bag  day     continues to improve over time   very pleased with quality   price point      
577,5.0,                       duvet is exactly as described  i ordered the white one and it is super soft and easy to wash remove black dog hair from  the price is great and i would absolutely recommend it to a friend and buy it again      
578,5.0,                       i had been searching for a while to find a duvet cover that i liked   i wanted to change the colors in the room so i started with the cover   i love it   super soft and i love the color   i would definitely recommend this item      
579,5.0,                       wow  amazing quality for a great price  it is so soft and silky and the color is just how i imagined  super happy with my purchase and highly recommend      
580,5.0,                       so far so good  should this opinion change  i ll revamp my review     update still covers the comforter just like a duvet should  well done      
581,5.0,                       i was pleasantly surprised with how soft this duvet is considering how affordable it was  i ordered the pink  and the color is a little more pigmented than i expected  but still lovely if you re looking for something simple and clean  the item was naturally wrinkled due to packaging  but i tossed it in the dryer on high heat and go most of the wrinkles out  there are still some shallow wrinkles in the fabric  but they are barely noticeable and i expect them to slowly fall the longer the duvet lays on the bed  the duvet also comes with corner ties to keep the comforter in place  all in all  i give it   stars based on quality  price  and softness      
582,5.0,                       love the color exactly what is seen in picture     
583,5.0,                       was easy for me to set up  i love it      
584,5.0,                       came nicely packaged  the fabric is amazingly soft and the color is quite beautiful  the duvet cover has ties on the inside which also help hold everything in place  very happy with my purchase      
585,4.0,                       i was looking for something soft  pink and not super expensive to cover my feather comforter  this came quickly  didn t have a weird smell  fit my queen comforter perfectly and came with two matching pillow shams  i am happy with my purchase and would recommend for the price      
586,5.0,                       i am so impressed and happy with this duvet    it is so much softer than i imagined it would be  and really helps to hold my comforter down in one place  i like being warm and it s added such a nice weight for my liking      
587,3.0,                       i bought for our king size bed  the cover is giant and it s always moving around on our insert       
588,2.0,                       i absolutely love the weight of this cover and how soft it is  sadly  after less than a month of use  it was a christmas present for my boyfriend  the zipper split and will no longer zip properly  i would not buy this again      
589,5.0,                       i love this  i had to buy more in different colors     
590,5.0,                       i really like the way this white duvet looks on my bed  how it brightens my room and that it is lightweight making it comfortable and easy to use      
591,5.0,                       sooo soft   comfortable  love the tie strings in each corner so the comforter is not sliding around inside the duvet  perfect shade of dusty pink  feels like a hotel duvet   love it      
592,2.0,                       it s soft and the colors nice but it just looks like a fitting sheet  there s no texture to it  i didn t really like it     
593,5.0,                       this is my second purchase of this duvet  i bought one for my daughter and loved how unbelievably soft the material was and wrinkle free   love it even more now that i have it on my own bed too      
594,5.0,                       this duvet cover is very soft and made well  it fit my king down comforter perfectly  it did have a few wrinkles when it arrived due to packaging but i m assuming they will eventually disappear with use      
595,5.0,                       my search for the perfect duvet cover had me ordering and returning approximately four sets before landing on the pink mocha wapiti set  it is such a beautiful color   so unique and soft  it adds a pop without overpowering the room  i haven t washed it yet  so i cannot comment on that durability  but it s incredibly soft to the touch and wrinkle free within an hour of spreading it on my bed  very happy with the purchase  i m checking to see what other colors are available      
596,3.0,                       such a soft cover perfect size for a duvet  the color is absolutely gorgeous but the thread is really thin and not really sewn tough enough  especially after washing it once the thread started to come apart  short a d simple     
597,5.0,                       i love the color  it is a perfect soft pink  i really like that it has a zipper  and the seams make it really easy to put over a blanket  the ties are a nice touch  but my blanket doesn t have loops   it s also really soft      
598,5.0,                       this is so soft  has ties to hold the duvet in place and has a hidden zipper instead of buttons  everything you could want in a high end duvet for much less     
599,5.0,                       this comforter is absolutely gorgeous  it s very soft  the packing is very nice  it comes sealed and in a box  it was folded very neatly  you get   pillow shams  even with a twin   most companies don t do that  there are no loose threads  it s light weight and not too heavy so if you re in college  like me  and are traveling to your school  it s perfect  there s not one wrinkle  buy it  it s a great price  i m not buying another comforter for a while because the quality is amazing  side note   if anyone is looking for a blush pink comforter  the color they have is called pink mocha  it was exactly what i was looking for      
600,5.0,                       i waited a week to write my review but i have to say i absolutely love it  i normally buy mine from ikea but i decided to get this one since the color looked nice and the material was described just as i wanted  overall product was what i expected     
601,5.0,                       this duvet is such great value  it feels like luxurious hotel linens  the color is not bleached white  but more of a very slightly off white  i actually really like that      
602,5.0,                       the color is a lovely muted pink  the material is so soft  the pillow shams were a nice bonus  ordered a full size and it fits down each side of the bed  but not to the floor  perfect for me     
603,5.0,                       bright white  super soft  easy to fit comforter into it   very satisfied      
604,5.0,                       i have a few airbnb listings and these sheets are perfect for me   zipped duvet saves time wrinkle free and about    minute dry time  guests ask the for brand often so that they can get their own i have bought a few microfiber sheets before but these are some of the softest i have touched  i also like the envelope pillow design as it looks more finished  i highly recommend them and also just saw they now offer the fitted sheets on amazon      
605,5.0,                       putting on duvet covers is my version of hell  this one was no exception  zipper and ties are much appreciated tho      
606,5.0,                       love my new mocha pink duvet  it is so soft  silky feeling and just pure heaven  the color is exactly what i was looking for      
607,5.0,                       it s the best duvet cover i have ever bought  it s super soft and looks great on  i don t write reviews very often but i had to for this one  i loved it some much i bought it again in another color      
608,2.0,                       i want to say i am super happy with how fast i received the duvet and that its by far one of the softest blankets i ve ever had  so i washed it and was excited to put it on my bed and first use the zipper completely broke   i mean really   so bummed out      
609,5.0,                       so soft  looks so big and comfy yet feels light weight and cool     
610,5.0,                       this duvet is magical  i m super picky with comforters and normally don t like duvets but this is super soft and i love it  the ties on the inside are nice as well so your down comforter doesn t move around      
611,5.0,                       cover is exactly as advertised   king fits king   easy to install   color is the right shade of gray   softer than cotton      
612,5.0,                       my boyfriend wasnt too thrilled about a duvet cover  he hates microfiber and things that are hard to wash  but he loves this to bits  i might have to order a second one in case this one rips or something  i love the color and its so soft      
613,5.0,                       wow wow wow  this is so soft and beautiful  i was worried about buying something cheap considering all the expensive options  but this feels the same or better than the expensive options  highly recommend      
614,5.0,                       very soft and comfortable  easy to put on  it has corner ties to hold the duvet in place and a zipper  i love the look      
615,5.0,                       very nice cover  fits great  well made      
616,5.0,                       this is a very nice quality duvet cover  our  duvet  that is in it isn t that thick fits in it really well  i was nervous it would slide around and get bunched up but we ve used it for just over   weeks and haven t had any issues  the zipper is awesome  if anything the pink might be just a shade brighter than the photos but i would purchase again       
617,5.0,                       this product is very comfortable  no wrinkles at all       
618,4.0,                       very nice   but wrinkles easily in my opinion  i subtracted a point for that    i do like the quality and it s very soft   the quality is great      
619,5.0,                       this is a great duvet cover  easy to put on and it s super soft the cover has the ability to tie to your comforter to keep it in place  i was worried that the zipper would show but it s hidden and not at all visible you won t regret this purchase  especially for the price  you can t beat it      
620,4.0,                       you will not regret buying this comforter  i purchased a    dollar comforter from ikea to go with it and i couldnt be more happier    it s a must buy  do yourself a favor and purchase it today update  the ties inside to help keep the comforter in place always unties  i do really like this comforter but that can get reeally annoying      
621,5.0,                       i never had a duvet cover before and i am excited to not ruin my new comforter by washing it all the time  it was a little difficult to get the cover on but its very nice and good quality      
622,5.0,                       very soft sheets  no weird smells like you get with most products shipped online  was super easy to put my duvet fill in   will def be buying more soon        
623,5.0,                       this duvet cover makes it impossible for me to wake up in the morning  too good i ve never thought too good could be a problem  but if you want a deep sleep  go get it two thumbs up  d   b for future improvement  strings should be attached in the middle of each side as well       
624,5.0,                       i love this  we have a long sized bed and it fits perfect but i almost wish there was a next size up for more coverage      
625,5.0,                       after i ve received my first one  i placed the another one right away because i was impressed with the quality of the product  very pleased with the purchase  the duvet cover is very soft and it is lightweight   the price is very resonable as well  i highly recommend      
626,4.0,                       love this  very soft and has ties on in the inside and a zipper which makes it easy to use  the only complaint i have is that it is a bit small for my king size bed      
627,5.0,                       what can i say  this is the duvet cover  nicely made  stays attached to my comforter  super soft and comfortable  we have    white for our guest room and gray for our room  we love them      
628,2.0,                       i do not recommend this item for anyone that would need to use it for regular use   it does not wash very well at all   it loses it s softness immediately   after leaving this review initially the seller contacted me bribing me with an amazon gift card if i deleted the review   i did so and they assured me i d receive a gift card within   days   that was over a month ago   once deleted they never contacted me again nor did they provide the compensation they promised   i do not recommend this product or the seller      
629,5.0,                       it s like sleeping inside of a warm cloud  only bad thing  it makes it so hard to get out of bed lol so comfy and cozy      
630,5.0,                       we have been using this cover for a week now and purchased the white color  we were a little hesitant because we have two cats that love sleeping on the bed  to our surprise it does not collect fur  so worth it for us  also its truly wrinkle free  we love it      
631,5.0,                       it s just as described comfortable and looks great     
632,5.0,                    el color es hermoso y textura muy suave        
633,5.0,                       this duvet cover s mocha pink color is as soft as the material is   i love it      
634,5.0,                       comfortable and soft     
635,5.0,                       it s a good basic duvet for the price  i waited to write a review until i washed and dried it once  there was probably about        shrinkage after that washing  but it still fills my needs which was to be large enough to cover a very high queen sized mattress and durable enough for a surprisingly dirty little dog to shed on all day and night long i enjoy the feel of it a great deal   very lush  as pictured below  my dog enjoys it as well non wrinkly even after a few tumbles in the dryer  didn t need much heat or very long dryer time either  dried very fast  my only complaint which isn t a complaint more of a whine is that when i first got it  i accidentally hit one of the bottom corners with a vacuum cleaner which immediately burned a hole   so beware of those corners      
636,5.0,                       so comfortable  it makes my bedroom look like a hotel room  i ve been using it though a good part of the summer and now below     and it s great  tying up the duvet to it is pretty simple and straight forward  easy to clean up  just make sure to close the zipper      
637,5.0,                       so soft and seems like great quality       
638,5.0,                       soft  and very comfortable       
639,5.0,                       excellent product      
640,5.0,                       true to size  the zipper helps it stay in place and it soft fabric     
641,5.0,                       soooo soft and comfortable  doesnt make me too hot  but keeps me just about right  my husband even likes it      
642,5.0,                       cooling and so comfortable  makes it hard to get out of bed  washes great and feels amazing     
643,5.0,                       this duvet cover is very soft and easy to put on      
644,5.0,                       nice and softgood deal for the pricesoft and easy to care for     
645,5.0,                       i change bed bedsheets themes throughout the year and i wanted to try pink this time around for an inexpensive price  the sheets are wonderful  they are not quite the color in the model  though  they re definitely a mocha pink  almost veering towards salmon      
646,5.0,                       great svc  quality  price        
647,5.0,                       bought this for my daughters room  she s not really into pink put thought i d get this one absolutely happy soft yes easy to put on and has zipper closurecolor on pointonly thing i would love to have seen is that it s non wrinkle but this is much a better duvet cover than her target one we bought for      first is too see the true  color   obviously we went for pinkand pic of the bag it came in       
648,5.0,                       super soft and comfy  love the color too      
649,5.0,                       the overall quality is pretty good  i ve used it straight since i got it and have washed it several times and it s held up very nicely  this one is very soft and comfortable  a must be for every pink lady  i was so excited about it i bought a medium weight down comforter to insert into it and i stay super comfortable  i definitely didn t expect that great quality from this set  looks even better in person than on pictures      
650,5.0,                       i bought this and was a little nervous the color would be slightly different then pictures  i bought gray   but it s perfect  so soft  i love that the bottom of it zips up instead of buttons like some others  it also has the ties inside on all four corners so you can make sure your comforter is securely tied up      
651,4.0,                       needed to get a duvet cover for my grown daughters room when she came home for christmas  wash it first  she loved the color and also the softness      
652,3.0,                       pros  very soft to the touch  i didn t notice any threads or seams unraveling after the initial wash and dry  i have a huge no agitator washer and dryer cons  just like most other microfiber  it s not breathable enough for me  i noticed a difference the first night i used it  and it was hot enough to remove from my duvet and return immediately the next morning  it was also staticky when i took it out of the dryer  despite using both a bounce dryer sheet and fabric softener in the wash  usually this combo eliminates all static       
653,1.0,                       the only thing i liked was the color  cheap fabric  thin material  poor quality overall  cover and pillow cases  i returned item      
654,5.0,                       i love this duvet  it s so soft  which for the price is great  looks good too      
655,5.0,                       i stand by my original review  below   i had gone on to have a bit of a mix up with the seller which i included in an updated review  now deleted   the seller responded immediately to their error and went above and beyond the call of good customer service to make it right  and continues to assure my customer satisfaction  at this point  i can t say enough good things about this duvet and transaction  if you re looking for a great product and trustworthy vendor  you found it here  i have the white duvet and it arrived in great condition  it s super soft  clean and bright  i am adding this update rather than deleting the thread so the seller s comment below makes sense  there was a mix up that unknown to them reflected poorly  but they went far beyond anything i would have expected to make sure i was happy original review this duvet is beautiful  my down comforter fits perfectly inside the king size  the microfiber texture is soft  smooth and silky  it s exactly what i was looking for to keep my insert clean  it was easy to work with and it stays straight on my bed  would highly recommend  great value for the price      
656,5.0,                       so soft  and at an affordable price  the white is very white and the pillow cases are fitted nicely in my pillows  i love that it s a little bigger than my queen duvet insert  and i can tell it s breathable      
657,5.0,                       super soft  really nice color  looks just like the picture  really sad i had to return it      
658,5.0,                       i am so pleased with this comforter  it far exceeded my expectations  it is lightweight and soft and looks quite expensive    i would highly recommend and plan to buy several more for the home      
659,5.0,                       the best duvet i have every bought  it is the perfect color feel and so so soft  just the right amount of weight so you don t sweat      
660,5.0,                       duvet has softness and wrinkle free     
661,4.0,                       super soft right out of the package  it doesn t wrinkle at all  it is very thin which is the only reason i m not giving it five stars  if you try to put it over a colorful comforter you ll definitely see the comforter through it      
662,5.0,                       this product was extremely satisfactory very durable soft and breathable     
663,5.0,                       good quality     
664,5.0,                       love it     
665,5.0,                       the cover is very beautiful  i also love the grey color  the seller is easy to work with      
666,5.0,                       i got it in pink and i just love how soft and beautiful it is      
667,5.0,                       i love how soft this duvet cover is  and the fact that it came with   pillow shams as well   very nice  this color is perfect and the zipper and inside corner ties make it an awesome fit for my king size comforter  thank you for an awesome product        
668,5.0,                       i love this cover  at first i was apprehensive of the texture  but it is so soft and comfortable  but not too hot  i would definitely recommend      
669,5.0,                       i purchased this for our guest bedroom   probably the softest thing i ve put my hands on   very lightweight and soft  the ties were easy to work with  to attach it to the comforter    it looks great and guests have raved about how comfortable it was   will probably be purchasing another when we start filling the  nd guest bedroom        
670,5.0,                       blanket is perfect color and soft  had four ties for duvet  all in the corners  wish it had the side ties as well is my only complaint      
671,5.0,                       beautiful  and super soft  definitely a soft dusty pink color      
672,5.0,                       this duvet cover is amazing  it looks great and is incredibly soft and so far has held up really well   i have only washed it once but it got softer after that first wash  it s not wrinkle free but that doesn t really affect anything in my opinion  my only complaint is that i wish they had more colors pattern options  but the quality is incredible and i love how luxurious it feels      
673,5.0,                       i was skeptical about getting a duvet cover  as i love the feeling of my down comforter  however it is so soft and comfy  it doesn t make me too hot  which is what i was most concerned about  the mocha color is more of a blush pink  but that is what i was hoping for  overall  very satisfied with this purchase      
674,5.0,                       i am absolutely obsessed with this duvet  i would highly recommend this product   i own   air b b s and that comes with a ton of beds   i will be switching all of my current ones to this so soft  so pretty thank you      
675,5.0,                       love it     i ve had it for over a week and it s perfect   soft   decent thickness  wrinkle free  and my down comforter stays in place without using the corner ties      
676,5.0,                       do it  i was sleeping sans duvet and now i sleep like a princess  it is so soft  so nice and so inexpensive for what it is  i turned my bed into a dreamscape  i am picky about what i sleep in and this even comes with pillow cases that are like butter      
677,5.0,                       i bought this as the deal of the day  i got a comforter and hated the color so i bought this duvet cover  this is soft and very light  it brings my room together and the color was perfect      
678,3.0,                       was very disappointed with size of comforter  i have a king size bed  not california king and the comforter would be better on a queen sized bed  it barely hangs over any of the edges  over all  other than size i m ok with it  wish it was a little more light weight but it is very warm  i put in duvet cover      
679,5.0,                       this is the softest duvet i ve ever owned  i m definitely buying it in more colors   it s more of a bubblegum pink than a dusty mocha pink  but the softness is still amazing and great quality for the price      
680,5.0,                       love love love this  i am obsessed with the feel of this  it feels like rayon and silk although it isn t  but i am loving this feel on my skin  it also doesn t get hot and has good airflow  this is great for a comforter  i highly recommend      
681,5.0,                       zipper works great   and the ties in the corners hold the comforter in place   can t beat for the price  would buy again     
682,5.0,                       i ordered   sets before this one  previous ones were way too thin or threads hanging off  this set is soft and thick enough but not too thick      
683,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought the queen and put   queen duvet inserts inside and it is perfect  the material of the cover is softer than my last one      
684,5.0,                       i am just beginning to decorate my guest bedroom and this duvet cover is the first piece i received  as you can see in the picture  i do not have an insert for it yet  but it s durable  soft and the color is perfect  it s exactly what i wanted      
685,5.0,                       love the color  light weight  just wishing if you could add some buttons so that it can hold the comforter in place for most of the time  but overall it was a great purchase            
686,5.0,                       super soft duvet covert  i haven t actually put an insert in it or put it on my bed yet but i love the color and how it feels so far      
687,5.0,                       truly took my bedding experience to the next level  this duvet cover has brought my sleeping experience to a level of luxury that i didn t know previously existed  so soft  yet breathable and incredibly easy to keep clean  the look and feel of this duvet cover is worth twice the price that it s sold at      
688,5.0,                       lovely color  very soft  fits perfectly with the amazon basics blanket  at first i thought it might be an issue bc it s not cotton but it s very soft and my daughter finds it comfortable      
689,5.0,                       i have used this duvet cover for one night and i already love it   the microfiber feels like really good quality and is softer than i expected   a feature i really like is the zipper closure   my last duvet cover had the buttons and the zipper is way easier and faster to use   i highly recommend this duvet cover      
690,5.0,                       i got the pink mocha duvet queen  it looks same as the image  its soft  wrinkle free  warm  looks very pretty  it was slightly bigger than my queen duvet which is old and maybe shrunk a bit after washing   then the vendor suggested me to tie the corners so that it fits my duvet  its not really the same as a perfectly fitted cover but will work  i am happy      
691,5.0,                       i love the color and feel  washed them and they are just as soft  i ve only slept in them one night and it feels a little warm under it but it might ve just been my dog  so excited to use this in my new place  really happy about this cover set      
692,5.0,                       this has been my favorite duvet cover  however  my zipper did break  but no worries  i have i foot board i just tuck it in     
693,5.0,                       very soft fabric crisp white  washed and came out of the dryer wrinkle free  love the zipper closure and  corner ties      
694,5.0,                       the only problem i have with this duvet is that i cannot sleep with any other cover because it is so incredibly soft and cozy  this is the third duvet cover i have purchased because my family members had to have them for their own beds  definitely a good purchase      
695,4.0,                       the set looks much more full and fluffy in the picture than in person  it is more like a thick sheet than a comforter  that in mind  i am extremely happy with it  soft  well put together  doesn t wrinkle easy      
696,5.0,                       works great and is very comfortable      
697,5.0,                       great stuff       
698,5.0,                       great quality for the price      
699,5.0,                       perfect fabric only downsize is that it does not come with the duvet it is only just a cover     
700,4.0,                       everything about this is perfect except the color is a little off  the gray is a little more lilac than i would ve liked  but because it was so inexpensive and soft i m not complaining  just an fyi for anyone buying this in gray      
701,2.0,                       i didn t actually take the comforter out of the package  upon looking at the color it reminded me of a muted bright pink not at what the color looks like in the photo reminded me of the hospital      
702,5.0,                       this comforter is like butter  it is so soft  i washed it once i received and dried  usually  with any other duvet i have had  they come out still wrinkly  but not this one  it s thin  comfortable and easy to get on and off  would buy again     
703,5.0,                       i thought i was buying a regular comforter but when i got it i realized it was a cover  which is my fault cause i didn t read the description  besides that  it s very comfortable and soft  i would definitely recommend      
704,5.0,                       this cover is a necessity for those who like to preserve their duvets from soiling  it was rather simple to get the duvet inside  i got a goose down duvet for alaskan winters and i m not disappointed      
705,5.0,                       hi  i bought this duvet cover a few weeks ago and after   washes it s still amazingly soft   has held up great  my dog likes to get it muddy and the dirt has come right out with one wash   i have a standard apartment sized washer   dryer  the tag says not to dry it  but i have haha  i ve also used fabric softener and i don t feel it s affected the fabric at all  great product  the color is a dusty pink  which i love   it matches my decor very well      
706,5.0,                       i just put it on my duvet  looks fresh in the crisp white color and beautiful     
707,5.0,                       can t love the softness of this duvet cover anymore than i do   i consider myself a bed officinado  and i would like to be buried in this duvet cover  along with my duvet       
708,5.0,                       this duvet cover exceeded my expectations  at this price point  i thought it might be scratchy or thin  i was in for a pleasant surprise when i received this  it s very soft and feels durable  the white is a true cool white and looks perfect in my room  i had never put a duvet cover on before  and i managed to figure this out quite quickly      
709,5.0,                       very nice duvet cover that is soft enough to sleep under without a sheet but strong enough it should last quite sometime  the color is great and matches my decor quite well  the price is great for the quality you receive  the best part are the attachments inside for you duvet  it allows you to attach it to the inside of the cover to keep corners from moving away from the inside edges of the cover which is very annoying let me tell you  no loose threads or missed stitches that i can see  in short this is a great duvet cover and i am glad to have it  would buy again     
710,5.0,                       this product is soooo soft  i slipped it right over my outdated comforter for a fresh new look  it was really simple to put on and the comforter doesn t slip around inside  i am so happy with this purchase      
711,5.0,                       i love this duvet cover  definitely a great value buy  the zipper is very large so it s pretty easy to put in your comforter  i ve had it for   weeks now and it s extremely soft and my comforter doesn t slip out of place inside      
712,5.0,                       i bought these sheets due to their affordability combined with the rave reviews and i don t regret it  they are so soft and breathable and they don t pill when you wash them     out of         
713,5.0,                       it s thin and so nice  lays out nicely and i bought the blush pink  it s a beautiful subtle color  so soft      
714,3.0,                       when i first received this duvet  i loved it  it was super soft and exactly what i was looking for  now however  i am in search for a different duvet because this one has pilled significantly  so much so that it no longer sift and just itchy  save your money and purchase a good duvet      
715,5.0,                       i purchased the haze blue cover  the color is nicer than in the picture  it s a lighter shade of blue  i agree with the other comments  i is really soft      
716,5.0,                       such great quality  i am about to buy another set       
717,5.0,                       love love love  it s soft and looks very expensive     
718,4.0,                       ordered the gray duvet but the color in the picture is much darker than the actual color  it looks like a light gray but its considered their gray  they also have a light gray so i imagine that looks closer to white      
719,5.0,                       love the color  quality  and softness       
720,5.0,                       this cover is very soft and breathable  the corner ties are great  color was a little lighter than what i was expecting but it still works for the bedroom color scheme  would buy again      
721,5.0,                       i like the color of my duvet it matches my curtains perfectly   it s great looking on my bed   it s simple and easy to take care of      
722,5.0,                       much nicer than i excepted for the price  great quality  washing great with little to no wrinkling  going to buy a  nd one      
723,5.0,                       it s so soft     and the color is absolutely beautiful  my fianc  didn t want anything too pink and this was just perfect  not to mention their customer service is amazing  i got the wrong size and a new size was shipped out right away       
724,5.0,                       love this duvet cover  very soft  washed up nicely  i m thinking about buying another one so i can alternate when i m washing the other one      
725,5.0,                       this duvet set was perfect  it is super soft  looks and fits awesome too     
726,5.0,                       very nice   color was true as to what shown on listing   will order again in different colors   very good value for the money      
727,5.0,                       i looked everywhere for an affordable white duvet cover  this fit my price range and the duvet i already had  a little on the thin side  my duvet is white  so it s fine  but looks is soft and looks great      
728,4.0,                       it s very very soft and very nice  i do have to say the light grey color is a little to bluish grey than what i was wanting and i wish it had duvet ties in more places than just the corners but i will probably be sowing some in but love how soft it is      
729,5.0,                       zipper hides nicely   really smooth  no wrinkles   amazing quality for price  color pretty darn true to picture  i sleep very hot and no sweating with this duvet cover   will buy again for quest room      
730,5.0,                       amazing quality  i wasn t expecting much due to the very reasonable price but i was totally blown away  it has totally transformed our bed to a hotel luxury bed  will definitely be buying more in the future      
731,5.0,                       my puppy approves    i have wanted a duvet for my bed for years now  and finally got one  i am so glad i chose this duvet cover  it is incredibly soft  easy to put on  doesn t wrinkle bad  and the color is beautiful  it s very true to the photos and description online      
732,5.0,                       great color  so soft  and easy to put on my down comforter  i ended up using duvet clips to keep it together instead of the strings and they worked great      
733,5.0,                       its sooooo soft  i really love it  haven t see any zip issue like the one star reviews  but yeah  the zip is not the perfect one  but still good enough for me      
734,5.0,                       this duvet definitely adds a soft touch to my apartment  it is very easy to clean  the zipper makes it a lot easier than buttons  i took off a star because you need to fold it right when its done in the dryer  i left it in for a few hours and had to run the dryer more to get the wrinkles out  this really helps to achieve the soft look  i m looking to purchase another color in a few months      
735,5.0,                       overall  i m super happy with this product  it s really soft    exactly the material you want to lay under when you re in bed  i love that it has a zipper closure and corner ties  however  one of the corner ties was missing    slight disappointment since it s a brand new product but not a huge deal  pro tip  buy one size smaller than your comforter for extra plush   i bought a queen but my comforter is a king  extra cozy      
736,5.0,                       love the inside ties to keep my comforter in place it feels lik i bought a new comforter      
737,5.0,                       a lot of people commented on the softness and silkiness of the product which is what prompted me to purchase it over others  needless to say  they were correct and my duvet is perfect  it was exactly what i wanted      
738,5.0,                       i ll be honest   i didn t have high expectations of the quality of this duvet  but wow it really proved me wrong  i couldn t be happier with it  so soft and comfortable  never wrinkles  it looks beautiful on my bed  and it s held up to two washings with no issues  absolutely in love with it      
739,5.0,                       i put this over a solid black comforter and it s still bright white  it makes the bed seem so fluffy and amazing  i would buy again      
740,2.0,                       i was kinda disappointed when i opened it because the picture makes it seem like it s a somewhat thick blanket but when i opened it i thought i accidentally order a sheet instead of a duvet cover but nope it s just a thin as cover but it s cute and i have a throw blanket for more warmth      
741,5.0,                       for the price  it is an awesome duvet      
742,5.0,                       loved this duvet cover so much that i ordered two more for my guest room two days later  it washed well  has very helpful ties  and is beautiful and cozy     
743,5.0,                       this duvet is so soft  after washing it  it got even softer  it s light and airy so it doesn t make you too hot  the color looks great as well  i would definitely like to buy more so i could have different colors      
744,5.0,                       this duvet cover is the best all around cover i ve ever purchased   the cover and shams do not wrinkle and the material is very durable   i plan on buying two more sets for the other bedrooms in my house      
745,4.0,                       i wanted a duvet that has ties   i m tired of the comforter moving around   this duvet has ties in each corner and on each side which is nice   when the package arrived  it was packaged well   straight from the package you can feel it s softness   after washing  it was even softer   it lays well on the bed and depending on the comforter you put it in  it can light for summer or heavy for winter   the zipper is nicely hidden but be careful in zipping it   it can catch   i would give this a five star but as you can see in the photo  i noticed thread pulling   i don t even know how that happened   i do love the color and the feel of this comforter      
746,5.0,                       this is the best duvet i ve ever bought  so soft  the color matches the picture exactly  it was easy to put over my comforter and smooth zipper to shut  look forward to buying more bedding from this brand      
747,5.0,                       absolutly love this      
748,5.0,                       this fit perfectly over my king size duvet and is like being covered in a cloud   the fabric is so soft and smooth   i thought it would be a little bit more pink but it is still very pretty   the price was great as well   i m really glad that i purchased it and would definitely buy it again      
749,5.0,                       good quality as described     
750,5.0,                       i was very impressed with the quality of this duvet cover  it is extremely soft and feels amazing  our cat has instantly taken to it  however  she s also started ripping into it  the color we got has fortunately covered up much of her scratches and i feel like it is a good indicator of how well it can withstand hard wear and tear  overall  i  love this product      
751,5.0,                       great duvet cover  very warm  cozy and soft  it does tend to get a little wrinkly  i would also say it does run a little large  i got this for my queen comforter and i should have gotten a full size duvet cover for it because there is some slack which gets kind of annoying      
752,5.0,                       this is beautiful and very comfortable  i love it      
753,5.0,                       great duvet cover  the only problem for me is that it gets really hot  perfect for people who live on colder areas or prefer more warmth      
754,5.0,                       this duvet cover is sooooooo soft  i genuinely can t believe it s as cheap as it is  added bonus that it has a zipper instead of buttons      
755,5.0,                       my comforter arrived when expected   it was just as described   i washed it and i actually put it in the dryer  i believe the tag said hang dry but i have no where to hang it so i dried it on delicate   it came out fine   i put the cover on my comforter and it looks wrinkle free to me   it was a little larger than my comforter but that s better than being too small   so far it s perfect  just what i wanted      
756,5.0,                       awesome duvet   it s everything they said it would be       
757,5.0,                       we ordered this duvet set after our dog ate the buttons off of our old duvet and are so glad we did  this set is a bright white  super soft and durable and gives our bed that fluffy  fresh white five star hotel bed vibe we were going for  plus  we love that our dog can t eat the zipper enclosure on the duvet  very happy with our purchase      
758,5.0,                       loved how easy it was to put the comforter inside  tie the ties and zip it up  runs a little small  got the king size for our king bed and its not as long on the sides as id like     
759,5.0,                       so soft and comfy  i love it      
760,5.0,                       i absolutely love this  it s so soft and cuddly  doesn t pill or wrinkle  i will absolutely buy another one and i  recommend this to anyone      
761,5.0,                       you really can t go wrong  for the money me and my boyfriend were very impressed  the cover has a soft micro feel to it  the size was appropriate  and the color was nice  i would definitely order it again for different rooms in the house      
762,4.0,                       if you re looking for a very lightweight duvet cover  this one works well  the material is soft and cozy  i decided to go with a lighter comforter to go with this item  happy with my purchase      
763,5.0,                       ladies and gents this lives up to the hype  this thing is so soft  it s so breathable and i just want to bathe in a cloud of it  i spent so many hours researching and i just love it when it pays off      
764,5.0,                       i m using the duvet   weeks and love it  i followed manufacturer instructions for washing and hung to dry  the duvet is so soft  and the pink is exactly what i wanted  very happy with this purchase      
765,1.0,                       when i removed the bedding from the packaging i seriously searched the entire thing for a piece of rotten food like an onion or some thing  the smell was horrendous  i washed it six times and ive finally given up and i m just throwing it away     
766,5.0,                       after searching for a duvet set to look crisp and classy  this one fit the bill  one reviewer commented that the duvet was not white but more beige  so i was hesitant about the purchase   so glad i did pick this one and it is white which was exactly what i was looking for   looks great      
767,5.0,                       the material is so soft  love the corner ties and it fits out comforter beautifully  if you have cats  it doest get caught on their claws easily and there will be pulling  but as a pet owner this is anticipated      
768,4.0,                       the  queen  duvet cover would easily hold a king quilt if so desired   unfortunately  our queen quilt wants to float inside this cover   well made and soft  if just a bit too large      
769,5.0,                       really reasonable for such luxe sheeting   laundered perfectly and the zipper was a huge plus  i had ordered for use as a base under another white duvet but absolutely nice enough on its own  i am ordering another for a guest room      
770,5.0,                       warning     we love this cover so much we never want to get out of bed   it is so comforting and soft that it puts us to sleep and we are high anxiety people who don t sleep well       
771,5.0,                       i wanted to wait to write a review so i could have a chance to use and test it  i love it  it s soft and comfy  and beautiful  i also really like that it s very easy to  de shed  when my golden retriever lays with us  my only minor complaint is i wish the color matched the photo a little better  it s a tad more pink and missing a bit of that mocha mauvey color  but i still love it      
772,5.0,                       wow   i was actually flabbergasted by how soft this duvet cover was before i even washed it and after   it s like laying in a really nice hotel bed or clouds honestly   i m now tempted to search their products to find a flat sheet and bottom sheet to go with it because it s just heavenly   better quality than the     count cotton sheets i just got at costco   zipper is a great bonus and you can t see my dark blue comforter through the white duvet so that s awesome      
773,5.0,                       super soft  thin and light weight  what i really like is the zipper close and the ties inside the corners  stays very wrinkle free and again is so soft  fits our cali king bed  i believe the blanket inside is     x         
774,5.0,                       i ve had several duvet covers recently and this one has been my favorite by far  it is very soft and has the strings on the inside corners so the duvet does not slide around inside the cover  it doesn t add a lot of extra weight to the duvet and is pretty breathable too      
775,5.0,                       this item looks exactly like it does in the photo  the corners don t stay tied well but i can deal with that  i washed it in my wash machine and it still looks beautiful   love      
776,5.0,                       i ve been looking for a soft pink duvet for awhile that didn t break the bank  this duvet is amazing  especially  for the price  it s far luxurious than expected  it also is very warm unlike my high tc cotton duvet   i have a full queen duvet and the queen size was a bit large but nothing too noticeable  i also love that it doesn t wrinkle  i do wish the color was a little more of dusty pink but that is the only con i ve found       would purchase again      
777,5.0,                       always a little skeptical to buy bedding online with not being able to to feel the fabric before buying but would highly recommend this duvet cover  very very very soft and light fabric  really easy to set up with the corner ties and prefer the zipper over the button closing  great product  thinking about order the pink one to have variety      
778,5.0,                       exactly what i was looking for  good quality      
779,5.0,                       i absolutely love my duvet cover  it looks  exactly like the picture and it feels amazingly soft  i highly recommended it      
780,5.0,                       love this set  fabric is soft and cool  perfect for cuddling  this package for under     is a steal  don t regret purchasing at all      
781,5.0,                       love this duvet cover  it s brightens up my whole room      
782,5.0,                       okay  so this is the first time i ve purchased a duvet  and i m so happy i did  this one is light weight  so very soft and beautiful  my daughter loves it      
783,5.0,                       very soft and love the zipper design instead of the buttons  only thing i would change is the sturdiness of the ties on the corners  definitely will be purchasing in the future      
784,5.0,                       i m really happy with this purchase  the fabric is soft and lightweight  which was great  because it didn t make my duvet heavy  when i took it out of the bag it was smooth and not wrinkled up and it was super easy to get the duvet in  very happy with this product for the price      
785,5.0,                       the price for this is item is great  i receive the item and the color is absolutely beautiful  it is super soft to the touch and extremely comfortable  the material is very wrinkly but that s about the only problem  bought a duvet insert at target and it works perfectly      
786,4.0,                       the cover is soo soft i would stay under the sheets all day if i could  i like how the cover makes ur comforter look nice and plump  the only complaint is that there were dark marks on my covers but overall the quality was good     
787,5.0,                       beautiful color  soft and comfortable   i think that is cotton  great      
788,2.0,                       product overall is soft  wrinkle free  and exactly what we were looking for  the downside here  and this could be a one off  is that a pillow case had a brown stain on it as well as the stitching on both pillow cases were coming undone  i expected higher build quality at this price point      
789,1.0,                       the cover is not a twin size it is a queen it does not fit my blanket     
790,5.0,                       this duvet cover is super soft and super comfy  i bought it for my new apartment bedroom and it looks so nice  the color is a little brighter and lighter than what the product picture shows  but the other reviewers  photos are pretty accurate  i got the pink mocha color  it s not too soft to where it s uncomfortable and i don t get hot underneath it  so it s really breathable  i highly highly recommend getting this  pals        
791,5.0,                       this product is exactly as advertised and you can t beat the price   i like how the fabric has a slight washed look      
792,5.0,                       this is the softest bed cover i have ever owned  it makes my bed feel like a cloud and paired with the cover i have inside  the slight weight of the blanket helps me sleep so well  it is a beautiful color as well      
793,5.0,                       this product is so smooth and soft  i have never had a duvet cover feel this wonderful   buy it      
794,5.0,                       this cover is super soft and so comfortable  the long zipper is nice and very easy to take on off  i m using just the cover without the insert since it s getting warmer  this is my new favorite piece of bedding      
795,5.0,                       soft  very comfortable   good temperature regulator   do not need a top sheet   washes well      
796,5.0,                       i ordered this dreaming wapiti duvet cover for a spring summer comforter   i ordered the mocha pink and love the dusty pink color   from the moment i opened the package  the duvet cover was impressive   so soft and inviting   makes me want to hop in bed      
797,5.0,                       this is the best amazon impulse decision i ve made in a long time   i ve been searching for the perfect comforter cover and this is the one   so soft  easy to wash   i love the zipper at the bottom is discrete yet easy to take the duvet out   love love love love this comforter cover i wish i could afford to buy multiple in different colors

808,4.0,                       i love this duvet cover  it super soft and warm but the only concern is that it s not the most pet friendly  of course my little shih tzu loves it but it collects his hair like crazy  i would still recommend this to everyone  it came   days after i ordered it and i was so excited      
809,5.0,                       this is the best duvet cover  so light and breezy perfect for those hot summer nights  it s also so easy to get over your down comforter which was a huge plus for me      
810,4.0,                       pretty soft and comfortable  love the color only complaint is that it can be a little too warm to the point that you feel sweaty where you re touching the sheets      
811,5.0,                       bought this for our king sized down comforter and am super pleased with how soft it is  most duvet covers i was looking to purchase seemed to be so overpriced so when i ordered this one i expected cheap quality but not at all the case   the quality is great  we bought the white and it is a true bright white  just as i wanted  recommend if you re looking to get an affordable and comfortable duvet cover      
812,5.0,                       when i bought this i didn t know it was just the sheets  meaning the comforter  stuffing  did not come with it  with or without that it s really soft and thick  i ended buying the comforter and it just arrived last night  once you stuff the comforter in it s the best duvet cover you ll ever sleep on  i don t like hot covers this one is fresh and soft it s just really great      
813,5.0,                       the color  material  and comfort level is everything i hoped it would be  so beautiful  so reasonably priced        
814,4.0,                       it s super soft and comfy but gets a little hot  the air just doesn t circulate through my down blanket the same as it used too      
815,5.0,                       doggy approved duvet  i had a gray comforter that i no longer liked and instead of purchasing a new expensive comforter i started shopping for duvet covers specifically in a powder pink or mauve color to go with my teal sheets  this was not only super affordable but lived up to its claim of softness  i m very happy with it      
816,5.0,                       so soft so beautiful i apsolutely love this     
817,5.0,                       love love loooveee it   it s the perfect shade of pink and it s super soft        
818,5.0,                       this duvet cover feels like heaven  it s ultra soft and when paired with a comforter its like sleeping with a cloud  i am so happy i purchased it   all the positive reviews about how soft and comfy it is were spot on  great value for the money as well      
819,5.0,                       we were looking for a light  soft  duvet cover to go over our down comforter that was easy to put on  this cover met all of our expectations  would highly recommend      
820,5.0,                       love the color and the quality      
821,4.0,                       i like the duvet cover  it does exactly what it s supposed to  the only thing i don t like is that it s a magnet for pet fur  i have cats and dogs and the fur sticks to this thing  but other than that it s great and not the biggest deal      
822,1.0,                       i disliked the product  the bed set i paid for is thinner than i expected  really thin  false advertisement  the picture used as an example of the product is not at all similar to the one i received      
823,4.0,                       pretty nice product especially given the price  i m surprised  it s easy to use and is soft and good quality  one thing that was a little bothering was it was almost like  shedding  white stuff      
824,5.0,                       this cover is so soft and it s not scratchy in the least  my old duvet cover was a wreck compared to this one  the pillow shams make the pillows feel extremely similar to soft hotel ones and i m looking forward to sleeping with them      
825,5.0,                       bought for my daughters bed  very soft and comfortable  great for price  would buy again      
826,5.0,                       wow  i love this duvet cover  it is so insanely soft  i am completely thrilled with this set      
827,5.0,                       love it  softer than i expected  dark grey is classy looking     
828,5.0,                       seriously so much comfort and value for the price  i couldn t be more happy with it  it s so soft and light feeling  perfect for a summer duvet cover      
829,5.0,                       i really like this duvet cover  it s a cute color and really completes my space  it s in interesting material that i don t totally know how to describe but i like it        
830,5.0,                       in expensive   decent looking   no complaints     
831,4.0,                       love it  feels and looks great  i love it is a zipper closure so my blanket doesn t leak out like it does with my button closure duvet covers      
832,4.0,                       i needed an inexpensive cover to protect my down comforter from my puppies dirty paws for the time being it s not the best quality  but for the cost it s fine  washed it and it kept its shape      
833,1.0,                       so disappointed   the first duvet i ordered pilled so bad after about a week i returned it and they sent me another one  my hopes were that it was just a one off and thought i would give it another go because i loved the color  pink mocha    well  second duvet came and did the same same but the pilling started at week three and it looks awful and now it s too late to return   i don t understand how this product has such good reviews because my two that i received can t be the only ones that this happened to   yes  when you first  get the duvet and pillow cases they will be so soft you will love them and that s probably when most of the people wrote the reviews before the pilling started  don t  waste your money         
834,5.0,                       absolutely love this duvet  this is my first time buying a duvet  super soft  easy to insert old comforter  will definitely order another soon      
835,5.0,                       i love the color of this duvet cover  i am using it in my rv and it is very soft  good value for the money  i would buy again      
836,5.0,                       i love this cover  i bought it initially as an alternate  fancy neutral  to some of my other covers  but fell in love with it  it is very soft  and the thickness almost resembles a sheet  so not too hot cold  great in the hot and cold months  will be buying more in the future      
837,5.0,                       seems to be good quality  color was as posted and both twin covers are extremely soft  my   girls   and   years old say its very comfy       
838,5.0,                       this duvet cover is absolutely amazing and is a great deal  it is so soft and easy to use with the zipper bottom  i have gotten so many compliments and have recommended this duvet cover to friends and family  trust me it will not disappoint      
839,5.0,                       was very impressed by the duvet cover and pillow covers  i was initially looking for just an extra spare cover but think i will be using this full time  my cats hair does not stick and it seems to be pretty wrinkle resilient and comfy  would absolutely recommend      
840,5.0,                       this duvet cover is so soft and amazing  i just got it today and i m already in love  it s so soft  i mean incredibly soft  did i mention soft  and the color is just what i was looking for      
841,5.0,                       omg  had to buy this last minute as we purchased a comforter and it ripped after we washed it  so instead of wasting another      we went with this option and holy moly this duvet cover is soft  i slept like a baby last night and so did my husband  it was so soft and comfortable  will purchase again in the future      
842,5.0,                       easy to install   clean  soft   comfortable      
843,5.0,                       awesome duvet cover  the color is just as pictured and the blanket is very soft  true to size and warmer than i expected  i would definitely buy again and refer to a friend      
844,2.0,                       i loved this initially  but it has pilled so bad  it s awful barely lasted   months    i am super bummed     
845,5.0,                       i absolutely love this comforter cover  it s the perfect pink color  it s soft  and it s easy to put on a comforter  i love that it zips up and that the zipper is hidden      
846,5.0,                       i was nervous ordering this set as i often don t have the best of luck ordering items online  i ordered the king set as my comforter is king and my bed is queen  the pillow cases are a little loose the pillows but i like the messy chic look  will purchase a second set soon in a different color to keep in rotation         
847,5.0,                       right out of the package the duvet cover is very soft and is good quality  the color is a bit more peach than expected  i was hoping for something with more of a purple hue  but it can be hard to tell from computer screens what the actual color will be  for the price  this is great  previous to this i had a jersey duvet cover that was           
848,5.0,                       very impressed with the quality  this duvet is very soft and well made      
849,5.0,                       this duvet cover is uh mazing  it took me months to finally order it  i was skeptical buying something like this online but after reading review after review  i got it  you won t be disappointed      
850,5.0,                       looks amazing  the blush color looks like it was get dirty quick so it s good for the fashion of the room  i placed it over the old comforter in a matter of   mins alone    i love it    it s for my nursery      
851,5.0,                       this duvet cover needs no breaking in   incredibly lightweight and soft to the touch  it is brushed making it super soft and great to snuggle with at night   i think it will be cool in the summer and warm in the winter  i bought a new down alternative duvet to go with it and i am very happy with the results of my amazon bedroom makeover      
852,3.0,                       this duvet is   times larger than an actual king blanket  clinically proven  it is very soft and very square  in the middle of the night when you wake up  you grab the comforter that s supposed to be cozy  it s only the duvet cover because the blanket is somewhere folded up inside the duvet      
853,5.0,                       so so soft  great quality  love this duvet cover      
854,5.0,                       it s not totally wrinkle free for the first month of having it  but the more wear and tear and the more washing they eventually come out and the wrinkles stay away  i love this      
855,5.0,                       this is one of the best items i ve bought  sight unseen   the material is so soft and is a great quality  i would definitely recommend buying this      
856,5.0,                       this cover is really smooth and soft to the skin  the cover remains in great condition after washing and drying  my dry skin doesn t snag on the threads  which it usually does snag on poorly made microfiber or cotton sheets  the pink is very subtle  more like a vibrant dusty pink  i love this shade because it matches my delicate vintage theme at home  it is the perfect size for my queen bed and hangs off the bed at the right amount  the zipper has not failed me and happy to say these have the loops inside to attach to your duvet  i had to sew one of the loops after a few washes  but with a cheap sewing kit  it was fixed in   minutes      
857,1.0,                       it comes without cotton in it so i bought a lot and it s still was i comfy i don t recommend this     
858,3.0,                       wanted for master bed cover but color was not the grey i was hoping for   i would use for my sons bedroom      
859,5.0,                       wow i am so surprised how soft and thick this duvet cover is  i got a queen but have a full size and it was perfect because i prefer it a tad longer length wise  i washed it on eco warm on my delicate setting with some fabric softer and dried it on high to get it wrinkle free and let me tell you how well it dried without any wrinkles  it s been on my bed a few days and looks great      
860,2.0,                       the material is very soft but its really big and there s a lot of extra fabric hanging off my duvet  also there are several runs in the fabric where its thinning and torn  will unfortunately be sending back     
861,4.0,                       i really love this comforter  it is very soft  and feels quite more expensive than it actually is  it doesn t have that creepy microfiber texture  however  and this is a big however for me     it definitely holds dog hair  i believe the description says that it won t attract dog hair  but that is definitely not true  i have a    pound hypoallergenic  essentially non shedding dog and i have to lint roll the cover once a week  personally  the comfort outweighs the inconvenience  but if you have a dog cat that sheds a lot  you will probably notice it right away      
862,5.0,                       comforter was getting a little ragged and decided to spruce it up with this duvet set  wasn t disappointed  super soft and came clean and white in sealed packaging  great quality for the price  the duvet also has little corner ties to keep the comforter in place as well as a zipper at the end  really happy with my purchase     
863,4.0,                       i ordered the gray and got light gray  other then that love the product     
864,5.0,                       i have paid      for a good duvet cover and this cost nothing close  but has all the quality  care instructions are a tad picky  but i still wash mine in hot and dry on medium and have had no issues or shrinking  love it and will order more      
865,5.0,                       this is absolutely hands down the best duvet i have ever purchased  it is super super soft and of high quality  absolutely beautiful     
866,5.0,                       i love everything about this duvet set  it is absolutely gorgeous and soooo soft  the material is of great quality and the color is spot on  i have a new obsession with blush dusty pink i m in the process of re doing my room and i m basing everything off of this set  i was skeptical to purchase because i don t like microfiber sheets covers but i m so glad i purchased it i honestly couldn t be any happier      
867,5.0,                       this is a very well made duvet  it s a very pretty color  it s very soft and cozy      
868,5.0,                       i ve never had a duvet cover slip before  the color  softness   all around feel of this has made me very happy  i love it even more than i thought i would  i definitely recommend it      
869,5.0,                       i love the pink mocha color  quite true to the pictures  it s very soft and comfortable  i like the detail that it has string in four corners  that you can use to tie it together with your quilt  i definitely recommend this product      
870,3.0,                       i bought this set thinking that it includes a comforter like the picture shows  it actually includes sheets and pillow covers  there is no comforter at all      
871,5.0,                       very soft and comfortable  like it     
872,5.0,                       bought this set during the holiday sales and the quality was better than i imagined  the duvet cover and pillow cases were really soft and felt nice to lay on      
873,5.0,                       this cover was exactly what we wanted at a good price   all white  easy to put on and off  and most importantly  fits my king size comforter   a      
874,5.0,                       it is so soft and comfortable   i do not want to get up in the morining   and the color i choose is pink and it is beautiful  i like it very much and i would introduce it to my friends      
875,5.0,                       i can t stress enough how comfortable this duvet is  it feels like super soft sheets and you just melt into it  would      buy another one      
876,5.0,                       super soft material and so far very cozy  has ties on the inside corners for the insert which are super convenient and come with two pillow cases that are also super soft  i really do enjoy this purchase  the zipper is also very nice quality from what i can tell  only thing is when it came it had a slightly odd smell  but i washed it and it was perfectly fine  oh  and the pink is more of a grey ish dusty pink  im not sure how to describe it but it s not bad      
877,5.0,                       these are amazingso soft as soon as i unwrapped it i have sensitive skin and before and after washing these are soft and well madei absolutely love iti ll update if any problems arise     
878,5.0,                       this duvet cover is perfect for what i was looking for   extremely soft  not super wrinkly  and with a zipper enclosure  i have not washed it yet but hopefully it will hold up  it seems very lightweight so i would treat it as a delicate  it is also a very nice ivory color  not white like i had thought  but i actually prefer the ivory now      
879,5.0,                       oh my goodness  this is the best thing ever    it is so pretty  so soft and well constructed  i never want to leave my bed      
880,5.0,                       hands down super soft and great     
881,5.0,                       this duvet is for our son with sensory issues  we had ordered   from other companies but returned them due to the texture of the fabric  this one is soft and has already been through the washer a few times because again it s for our   year old son who loves to make a mess  great quality especially for the low price      
882,5.0,                       this cover is great because it s easy to clean pet hair off  it comes off completely in the wash and it s easy to wipe fur off as well  additionally it s very soft and the material doesn t feel cheap to the touch      
883,5.0,                       very impressed with the duvet cover  very soft and seems like good quality

885,5.0,                       love this duvet cover  it s soft and the white is a bright white just like i wanted  the corner ties are great to keep the duvet in place and the zipper is slim and hidden once zipped  overall happy with my purchase      
886,5.0,                       very soft  no funky smells  no wrinkles  packaged nicely  i am one to read a million reviews before buying a product and am very happy with my purchase  my dogs are too haha  there are ties on all corners to keep the comforter in place which is helpful   i chose white because i like to bleach my bedding  i m so excited to with my new duvet tonight

893,5.0,                       ok wow  not sure if it s both a combination of the insert i have coz it s rly fluffy but the duvet itself is sooo soft  almost silky nd like sleeping on a cloud  the pink is a bit more peachy in person   but muted enough for my liking  true to size     
894,5.0,                       i was very skeptical when i purchased this  as i m picky about feeling my bedding before buying  we have a claritin allergy free duvet that we inserted  there are ties on each corner to attach the duvet to prevent slipping  it zips at the bottom and is so  so soft  such a pretty dusty pink color  would like another one in a different color      
895,5.0,                       it is perfect  the color is a dusty rose perfect for my boho feel  and it is so soft  the packaging was clearly chinese so i was worried  and the low price point made me a little nervous but literally this feels like some      thread count magic  i m super stoked      
896,5.0,                       this duvet cover is awesome  it fit perfect on out down comforter  it was the exact color it said it was and it s so soft

898,5.0,                       ordered this duvet cover for my bed  my boyfriend and i love it  we have a queen size bed and it fits perfectly  it is soft  light weight and washes easily  it has ties in the corners so it holds your down comforter nicely and has a zipper across the bottom that is hidden by the fabric  great purchase  i might purchase in another color  must buy for the price   amazing       
899,3.0,                       nice soft blanket  but i ve had to disconnect and connect several times to get it to heat up   disappointing to go to bed and find it didn t work and the sheets are cold      
900,5.0,                       this comforter and pillow set is exactly what i wanted  a beautiful color and very soft to the touch  the best part it was a great price  would totally recommend      
901,5.0,                       super soft  high quality duvet cover  the pillow cases are very soft as well and fit well with my pillows  the instructions are clear in how to take care of it   always the first thing i check for      
902,4.0,                       it is a wonderful product  super soft and durable  really ties our room together  and i ll most definitely be buying in a couple other colors      
903,5.0,                       good product fast delivery      
904,5.0,                       i love my new duvet   is so soft and comfy   it s a bit wrinkle in the pic because i washed it and left it in the bag for a few days    but it feels amazing        
905,5.0,                       this duvet is made of clouds woven together by liquid silk  it s maintained it s softness through several washes  somehow this product s bright white appearance has survived   kids under   and a black lab would recommend to anyone  super affordable given the quality     
906,4.0,                       my only complaint is that my dog s fur sticks so easily to it  if you have a pet who sleeps on your bed  i would not recommend  otherwise it is beautiful  soft  and the color is perfect      
907,5.0,                       i received this queen duvet and two pillow cases with unbelievable speed  it came the next day  neatly packaged  clean and brand new  i ran it through the washer and dryer for    mins and started to put the comforter and duvet together  i love the corner slips to secure the comforter and i love the zipper  the zipper on this duvet hide the insert without it touching my skin  i hate the button feel against my body from other duvets  i find this wapiti duvet amazingly soft and silky against my bare skin and the first night was like sleeping on clouds  i m not sure about the thread count or fiber quality on this duvet but i have linens of      thread count and this wapiti duvet feels soften  overall i give this a   star for the softness  product quality and price  this is way better than the duvets at target  walmart or ikea

915,4.0,                       so soft  so comfy a great purchase  my only complaint is that the material kind of sticks to clothing   this being a duvet cover  it also moves around a little  i typically don t sleep with a flat sheet  but will like start while using this cover      
916,5.0,                       i had an anthropologie duvet that had gotten old and loved the color of this one so decided to give it a try   it does not look cheap at all and is so soft  i ve had it for a few weeks now and the only downside is the material seems to hold on to my dog s hair    but it s nothing a quick lint roller can t take care of      
917,5.0,                       very soft cover and has the   most important features for me in a duvet  zipper instead of buttons and corner ties for the comforter so they don t slide around inside  highly recommended      
918,5.0,                       i love this duvet  it s very soft and so far  the zipper feels sturdy  the pink is a beautiful muted pink that looks great in my husband and my room painted neutral colors with one charcoal accent wall  it adds a  feminine touch  without looking like a little girl s bedroom  someday when i need to go duvet shopping again  i won t hesitate to purchase this again

931,5.0,                       this is the comfiest duvet i ve ever owned  it feels like a luxury hotel bedspread and it s a steal for the low price  it held up perfectly through the washer and dryer and is easy to attach to the duvet insert  i will be buying more in another color      
932,5.0,                       i m very impressed with this duvet cover   it s light weight  super soft and washes up fabulously   i love the zippered closure      
933,5.0,                       my partner and i have been struggling to find a cover that we both like for aesthetics and comfort  but luckily came across this one  we love it so far and it s the perfect combo of lightweight  for warm summers  and durability      
934,4.0,                       the fabric is buttery soft   love the muted pink   i also love that although it s a microfiber fabric it doesn t show handprints like other types of microfiber   it s super light weight too   i do wish it fit better though   my cal king comforter is swimming inside it   seems like the dimensions are a little off no matter which way i orient it   i really like the idea of the ties in the corners although i think the ribbon should be more generous so that you can tie a slip not bow because the ribbons are so short all you can do is tie a square not which makes it hard to get out when you need to launder the duvet      
935,4.0,                       it s  a good duvet  i like the zipper and ties to keep my comforter in place  the color is exactly like the pic  i recomment      
936,5.0,                       i chose this duvet cover for my king size bed because it was a simple color and had great ratings  all were true  the material isn t too heavy so it keeps the comforter at night light and the material is nice and soft  since it s the middle of summer right now  it s light enough to still keep me cool  i originally bought the grey and now considering buying the pink one
