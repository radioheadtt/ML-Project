0,1.0,                       we revived an empty box  so disappointing         
1,1.0,                       enough said     
2,1.0,                       don t buy it i was mistaken  the promised model was the new nintendo switch with the code  hac           but the model that was delivered was the old nintendo switch with the code  hac    liars and thieves and that s what you are  shame     
3,3.0,                       when i first received the switch i was so excited  everything was in the box and it looked brand new   at first i didn t have enough to buy any physical games so i bought some games for sale on the e shop  and it worked great  but only till after the return date passed did i realize  the game card reader was broken  when i first played one of the games it seemed to work fine  but later when i removed the game and i inserted it again  it told me it couldn t read the game card  easy enough  just restarting the switch made it read  but now months have past and the only game card it seems to read is animal crossing  all my other games just wont read  even a brand new copy of minecraft  since i believe i still have warranty  i wanted to contact nintendo for repairs but it s been shut down due to covid  i hope i can get this fix  i m very disappointed      
4,1.0,                       trying to profit from covid        
5,5.0,                       playing switch games is great  i bought   games with my system for variety  turns out the most amazing feature i was not aware of before i started playing  the online subscription they offer for a measly    bucks a year offers a library of nes and snes games you can play at will  you can save state in them as well up to   save files for each game  you can also reverse time when playing  it is a cheap feature but very cool still  died in mario  just hold in two buttons  reverse the game like a dvr on tv show and bam  try that part again right where you just were   i do not know if it is true but i read they have two more slots for future classic systems in their coding in the system  we have nintendo  bit  super nintendo but we could see nintendo    or game cube in the future as well all   games i picked up for it run great as well  no complaints except it was     dollars more than list price  alas these are the times we live in      
6,5.0,                       i was suppose to receive my package october   th  i didn t receive my package until the   th  it wasn t amazon fought at all  i blame usps for screwing up  they sent my package to the wrong address  so i had to go online and have them redeliver my package when i finally receive my package i notice it wasn t damaged or tampered with  the switch box was still intact thank god  one thing i notice is the switch itself looks more premium if that makes any type of sense  lol you can tell they fixed a lot issues with the joycons and other things  my og switch had so many flaws  my tv screen would go black then turn back on for some reason while playing  the vents on my switch ended up melting off  the back had so many scratches from the dock anywho  the battery life is amazing   if you re like me and you play your switch an hour a day  it will last for a couple days  if you re the type that play your switch for hrs  you can get up to  hrs of play depending on the game you re playing im glad i got the upgraded version          
7,5.0,                       we gifted this for christmas to  family of five   what a surprise to them  and all were very happy   i like that it is portable and not take up  lots of space and also can play on the tv monitor  it seems well thought out to be versatile      
8,1.0,                       please dont buy product as its over priced dont waste your money nintendo still has the switch at        just check their website not worth the price your better off making your own switch from scratch     
9,1.0,                       the price was already heavily inflated  i was more than willing to pay  but how are you going to make me pay      and not include everything  i was excited only to see the straps were missing  if i paid      i would want everything included      
10,5.0,                       love the switch  ultimate for the gaming dad  game anywhere anytime      
11,1.0,                       way overpriced  joycons are flimsy  standard switch is      and yet it can only be bought for       nintendo get your act together      
12,1.0,                       i ordered using a black friday promo code to receive an amazon gift card with unit  the unit came as advertised in two days but there is not trace of a gift card anywhere  nintendo s costumer service chat is useless  there is a robot who is supposed to direct your concern to the appropriate department but no one answers      
13,1.0,                       nintendo left consumers out of luck on this one  no new stocking dates  leaving price gougers to upcharge  the nintendo switch is not a terrible console but the specs are not worth anywhere close to       it comes with a    p screen  almost everything has a better screen than this by now  don t pay the same price of ps  or xbox one for something that s made from       probably even cheaper  worth of parts      
14,1.0,                       you re pathetic trying to sell this for this insane amount  they were going for        and all of a sudden they are       pathetic       
15,2.0,                       i m suppose to love the switch  but i don t   i think it s a bad deal overall    nintendo online doesn t offer much compared to the wii virtual console days   there s no metroid games from the gc wii advance era   nearly all the games for the switch look like something from the    s when flash games were popular  but the games are priced as if they re made out of gold    the frame rate on this console is poor  yeah  some games reach a respectable   fps  but i d say most games fall below that    the dock is very woobly  it doesn t lock in  and it s very easy to scratch up the screen    there is no wired connection out of the box   why should i have to buy an adapter for that   if you play online seriously  you use a wired connection    here s what really bugs me   there s no web browser on this thing   no web browser for a mobile device  are you kidding me   this also leads to bizarre consequences   since there s no reviews on the nintendo store  you re forced to go to third party sites for reviews    but you can t  because there s no web browser   lmao  and i had to create my nintendo account on a pc   rofl conclusion i ll stick with the pc  xbox and playstation   if these issues ever get resolved  i ll reconsider   it s an interesting design  but it s all hype   little value        is way overboard for this gimmicky soy toy      
16,5.0,                       my daughter ask if she could have the nintendo switch  so i log on to amazon to look for one and when my daughtersaw that they were selling the animal crossing edition she asked me if she could please have that one  i was more than please to buy the animal crossing  edition because it was only at           
17,4.0,                       i bought this system for myself as a birthday present  and i have enjoyed using it   the controllers took a bit getting used to detaching on and off properly   i think the main thing is to be careful about what games you buy if the device will be worth it to you in the end  or if you are excited about upcoming games   i waited to purchase the switch until i knew there were about ten games i wanted to play and added about three of them into the in initial cost as well   i m pretty picky about my games because i am a casual gamer  zelda breath of the wild which i borrowed from my brother later  is more intensive than anything i have played in years games are expensive in physical format  although that is my preference   there are some cheaper games on the online store   so far my favorite local game shop does not have any used copies of switch games although they have everything else   maybe some day i might buy a screen protector for it in the future but have not as of yet   if your switch is to see heavy use by an entire family or if as an owner you plan to travel with it i d recommend one but that is not the case for me  i did have a problem within a month of ordering the machine where the fan started whirring loudly   at first only when it was plugged in to charge then all the time when it was at rest  then at last even while playing a game   i called nintendo customer service and had it repaired  although i had to send it back three times with the same issue to a radioshack in syracuse ny   last time i sent it in they just replaced the system  if i have a problem in the future i will request replacement rather than repair  especially if it s going back to new york   just not happening   at least customer service was good  but i was becoming a bit disgruntled toward the end there with their techs   for my troubles customer service gave me a new set of controllers automatically and then later  three months free on the eshop   oh  and the second and third shipments were two day free      
18,5.0,                       it s really nice to take your console game anywhere you want  it sucks that nintendo didn t give us enough storage space  so make sure you buy a microsd card to store your games and their content  i read that it s better to buy the physical game discs  they take up less space  but if you want to download all of your games go for it  if you play a medium amount of games i would recommend the    gb      gb microsd cards  there is a  tb microsd card on amazon for around          get this one if you re a hardcore nintendo player  there are many accessories on amazon to also decorate your switch  you can decorate the controllers with skins or buy the different color joy cons  the exclusive pickachu one has nice pichachu designs on the stand  and i think there s also an eevee version both from japan that cost      or more  you can also buy the switch lite which seems much more available now with the pandemic raging  explore and find the version of switch that works for you      
19,5.0,                       many things could be said about this device but  there s so many things that make up for it seamless connectivity with mostly everything  joy cons controllers  connect right away once attached through wireless electrical conduction like a power mat the u i  makes me happy    home screen desktop  layout  the different ways have use the controllers are interesting indeed like  smash ultimate  if you have one joycons set you split the controllers into two controllers for you friend or friends  if you have a second controller set  to play locallybreath of the wild  with the aiming mechanic by steadily rotating wrist which is optional the ease of purchasing games is and points towards a discount is fair nintendo polish is not joke  joycons do once in awhile lose sync with device but reconnects in      seconds and can disrupt gameplay a tad but you get over it a few seconds because your totally immersed with yourself so i give it a      green light on the a virtuous mission  spread you wings and fly  god be with you      
20,5.0,                       the animal crossing edition is absolutely beautiful  it does not come with the game  just fyi to those who are looking to get this edition  i already had the game since i originally played on a switch lite  however  i think if you are an animal crossing fan this is fantastic in every way possible  i am so happy with my purchase  it only took   days to receive the switch even though it originally was     weeks estimated delivery  please don t pay more than         for this console  have patience and it will be available  check often and you will get one      
21,4.0,                       got this to replace a switch that was in for repairs because i missed animal crossing too much and i couldn t resist the special edition being available at regular price i ve only used it for a day so far but i ve had a few issues with the joycons disconnecting randomly  no more than a mild annoyance so far but not an issue i had with my old switch even after a year of near daily play happy to see switches being available for      again after   months of quarantine price gouging  as much as i love my switch i wouldn t pay the       some jerks have been asking while they re in low supply      
22,4.0,                       i don t use this the way that nintendo advertises  predominantly hand held   i have the skull   company grip case attached at all times and only play in handheld mode   the switch lite is too small and doesn t have the hd rumble like this one has   this model is the better one with the longest battery life currently available   this is not designed with comfort in mind for handheld play sessions so the lite may be a better option if comfort is important   if you get hand cramps like i do  i highly recommend the skull   company grip case   they also have a great travel case that you can get with it that has plenty of space for the switch with case and joycons attached and space for games  a power adapter and power bank   it is very good quality and the switch is dockable with the grip case attached the switch itself has a much faster  more user friendly  prettier  less congested graphics user interface than all of nintendo s previous consoles   it has a solid state drive for saving and downloading some games  and is expandable with the purchase of micro sd cards for additional space   the online store is easy to use and probably the best nintendo has ever had   easy to sort by price  genre  developer   it is fast and easy to use and you can sort for free games and demos too   the load time between starting games and between cut scenes in game is very quick on hard drive  sd card  and game cartridge   much quicker than nintendo s previous consoles   i haven t played with the joy cons detached so i can t comment on how responsive the joycons are to movement and player interaction when joycons are detached   the hd rumble is more subtle than on ps  and xbox but some games have used it very well   mario odyssey for example has done a great job of blending the environments in some levels to match well with the rumble feedback  its hard to explain  but this feels like the next step in controller evolution and ps  and nextbox will be adopting a similar tech so more developers should get on board with hd rumble in future games  hopefully   the switch buttons have a nice click and feel like they will last  much like most of nintendo s products but the stick feels a little looser than the ps    i would like nintendo to tighten that up for the pro version   overall  this is decades of nintendo engineering in the making which has resulted in  arguably their best console to date   it is going to shatter console sales records for good reason   i highly recommend this version of the switch for the battery life  larger screen and hd rumble  but you may want to get a comfort grip if you will be using it predominantly as a handheld   i no longer play on my  ds because this is a much better player experience      
23,3.0,                       the box right out the package was damaged and it had someone s info sticker you get on your items from picking it up at bestbuy  once opening it i noticed the foam wrapping for the items was all crumpled up like someone had changed their mind about throwing them away  i have a feeling this item was already owned by someone but they didn t feel like listing it as that  pretty scummy  everything was their and working perfectly but i thought i was buying this brand new  i guess not      
24,1.0,                       the price is disgusting      
25,5.0,                       we bought this for my   year old son s birthday   he couldn t be happier   this is by far the most adorable nintendo switch console out there   i definitely recommend purchasing it we bought it when it was      plus tax  i do not recommend paying any more than that price   just wait till it gets back in stock   buy it for       do not purchase it from greedy scalpers   keep an eye out because as soon as it gets in stock it sells out usually the same day  we are so fortunate we were able to get one in time for my son s birthday   we purchased this back in october   held on to it till december for his birthday  if you want one for christmas  i doubt you will be able to get one at the      price   unfortunately it s sold out till mid january   but if you can i say go ahead   get it  this thing is adorable   really is a great collector item for any nintendo fan  even if they aren t into animal crossing  it is a very unisex design  i believe it can be for a boy or a girl        
26,3.0,                       it s baffling to me that this special edition console did not include the game  i have never ever seen that before  i ve actually become so accustomed to special edition items coming with the game that i didn t even read the fine terms  i just assumed it came with the game  so i guess that s my fault for not reading the info still  i do not understand what the point of a special edition console is if there s no game relating to the reason why it s a special edition     
27,5.0,                       as someone who s been playing on the ps   the nintendo switch is a great change of pace  this is my ever handheld gaming device and i got to say  man is it impressive for starters  the design of the switch is awesome  not too heavy or light  every time you slip the joycons on the side of the switch  it makes a satisfying click sound  the dock is great for playing games on your tv or monitor  plus it looks clean too   after spending about    hours on the switch  i am satisfied with the joycons and feel no need to purchase the pro controller  although the joycons are a bit small  perfect for kids   they will get the job done  next  it is important that you take storage into consideration since the switch only comes with a base of    gb  i bought the sandisk     gb card and that will be enough for me  if you plan on playing games like mortal kombat  i d suggest upgrading to     and above  since those games take up more storage  ex  mk   aftermath is    gb   depending on how much you play  battery life will vary  of course  more labor intensive games will drain the battery quicker  i only have two games on my switch so far  attack on titan and fortnite  and those games tend to drain the battery significantly faster  i don t have any other games to compare to  but while playing aot  the battery lasted about     hours before needing a charge  this is super impressive since aot is an open world style game with dozens of titans running around the map destroying buildings and such  but frames will drop from time to time if there too much going on at once  even after playing for a long time  the switch is only some what warm  which is great if you are playing in handheld mode  lastly  i want to talk about the price point of the switch  the retail price is         and that s what i paid for when i bought the mario version  it s a steep price since it s alongside the price point of an xbox or ps   but it is worth it if you enjoy playing games on the go and love nintendo titles such as zelda and mario  in addition to the retail price of the console  also take into account other expenses such as extra storage  i would only buy the ones from nintendo  sandisk  or samsung   a screen protector  very important in my opinion  the first thing i did when i unboxed the switch was to put on a screen protector   extra controllers and or joycons  and maybe nintendo s online membership if you want to play online and with friends  games like fortnite will not need a membership  all in all  the switch is a great device and i can t recommend it enough  it s a great console for families or if you just want to play alone      
28,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is the best switch for this year  i bought is at original price of        which is a great deal for this special animal crossing edition  worth the money  as you can see in the photos and video of unboxing everything is there and brand new i cant believe i have it  it was sold out everywhere but now thanks to my dad i have it for christmas eve  when we open the gifts i am so ecstatic and excited for christmas eve thanks nintendo for the best switch ever but it does not include the game  but that s ok because i already have it but if you are going to get this for your kids or for yourself for family fun avoid scalpers i hate them they suck also if you want  buy the switch and game itself it is a great game and i guarantee you will have a blast playing it     
29,5.0,                       new reversion is absolutely worth  games run smoothly  nice brightness and white balance  awesome battery life     
30,2.0,                       im enjoying it so farmy problem is that the box came damaged  and all the bags insite were loosely open  im not sure if thats just how it ships  or yet i was shipped another  new  item that was most certainly used  my concern being that there were no stickers holding the box closed     
31,5.0,                       wonderful product  there are many minor hiccups that i already knew of before purchasing this product e g  joycon drift  shakey joycons  hot while docked  online connectivity  dock scratch  etc  however  most of these risks i knew well ahead of time and so i was not bothered by them as most already have a diy fix for them as discovered by the switch community  great product  do some research before purchasing one  nintendo methodology in developing their products can be a little strange at times but the good outweighs the bad with this product      
32,1.0,                       dock fails to connect to the tv right out of the box  contacted nintendo and they required we send the entire system in  which would take up to   weeks  to repair  customer service person was polite      for a defective component  we will never purchase a nintendo console again      
33,4.0,                       i managed to snatch a retail price switch away from scalpers somehow   which took about two months of attempts to pull off   anyways here is my honest assessment after watching repair videos the switch is an excellent console at an excellent value  as long as you can obtain one at msrp    however being what it is the switch itself is fairly fragile   if your child has the self control of angry german kid tm  this would not be the best gift for them   and if playing it in undocked mode understand by all that is holy that the nintendo switch is not a modern smartphone   there is no water resistance built into the design   submerging the switch or even spilling something onto it will likely be the end of the console   the docking port is another point of fragility   it won t suffer being slammed into the dock well   all of the weight of the unit is baring down on that port while docking so being gentle and sorta gingerly easing it down is advised   the joycons are also rather fragile   not flimsy but they won t tolerate mauling like let s say a ps  controller could take that being said i do not think the switch is cheaply made at all despite these points   the owner and operator just has to accept that they need to be gentle and they ll be fine   and i don t mean you need to treat it like a china cup   but this is not the kind of console for a roid rage neanderthal hopped up on monster drinks and adrenaline      
34,1.0,                       mass buying and reselling at high prices should be frowned upon     
35,5.0,                       as advertised this is the new version oh so happy got it the new battery life is just a charm thank you amazon     
36,5.0,                       we bought this switch for our daughter for christmas  got it early so we can load it up with some cool games before christmas morning  we are so excited to see her face when she opens this present  best gift idea ever        
37,5.0,                       if you re willing to wait  amazon occasionally gets some  and puts them up at regular price   received mine much sooner than their initial estimate  as for the console    it s fun  everyone knows that  great first party games  and a nice selection of third party games  okay battery  unusual but feature packed controllers  and a tiny bit uncomfortable for extended play in handheld mode  less powerful than its competitors  but ray tracing does not a good game make just do everyone a favor and don t pay a scalper for the console  that s the only way to choke them out  stay patient and check multiple stores  regularly  eventually you ll find one at the proper price  you ll have your dignity  do a service for the community  and definitely get your money s worth      
38,2.0,                       received the item on time but the box was opened  it looked like the switch was already used     
39,1.0,                       this is a ripoff      
40,5.0,                       this is the most beautiful thing i ve ever held in my hands as a die hard ac fan      
41,5.0,                       i ve been a nintendo kid at heart for many years  i haven t owned a nintendo since i had a snes  but a friend convinced me to get the switch it s nice  i m not playing it as much as i should   but it s nice  there s a good selection of indie games on the store and i just bought the   in   mario collection  it ll be interesting to see what else comes out of nintendo as we move into the next generation      
42,2.0,                       first i would like to say the switch came in perfect new condition and the colors of the console was nice  no issues setting it up and it does what it suppose to  with that being said  i wasn t impressed with the nintendo switch at all  it s extremely basic and does nothing that the nintendo wii u can t do  it s a money grabber you have to pay a membership for older super nintendo games instead of a one time purchase  i ve had a nintendo wii u since they came out  had it replaced some years ago and it still works perfect  i didn t see any reason to spend        for new console that didn t do anything special  yes i returned it and i m back with my wii u and still love it         
43,5.0,                       i really wanted to be able to play video games while i was at work  i am a doctor and some nights just are slow since i work er overnight  this was the easiest route for me to have the ability to game  only issue i would say is the fact you need a capture card if you want to share with your friends via discord  other than that  its easy to set up with tv just use with joycons  accessories are expensive and so are games so i suggest figuring out exactly what you want and looking for sales etc  also google how to make sure you are getting the new model since they are selling the old model with the same name  theres a few things you can do to ensure you are getting the newest      
44,5.0,                       i love it   it is exactly the same as any other switch but because i love animal crossing i had to get this one   everything works   and i m happy i found this special edition still in stock  a must for any animal crossing fan   i do wish it would have come with a copy of the game  but i m happy i bought either way      
45,5.0,                       i ve been wanting a switch for a long time  and finally managed to get my hands on one close to msrp  at       during the pandemic  i only have one game on it so far  but to say i m pleased and impressed so far is a bit of an understatement  it s nice to be able to play on my tv in the living room  and when someone else wants to play their own game or watch netflix  i can just take the switch out of the dock and play in handheld mode  but stay in the same room and socialize  i like being able to bring the game into my room and not be forced to play it in the living room if i don t want to deal with all the noise it s pleasant to hold  with just a bit of weight to it to feel sturdy  the joycons are nice to the touch  although the sticks are a little too  smooth  for my liking so i put some grips on  i haven t experienced any drift  yet  but it s only been a few days  they re very satisfying to hold  and even more satisfying to click into place on either the tablet or the included joy con grip  i haven t tried the straps yet the screen is lovely  and the speakers are front facing so it seems louder than other handhelds  it is a little frustrating to adjust the volume while i have it on the kickstand  the kickstand is a pain to pull out  and isn t sturdy in the slightest overall i m very  very happy with it  i can t wait to get more games on it and play with friends      
46,1.0,                       it s suck a jerk move to raise the price by     plus dollars  take the extra     and live a terrific life you jerk  only reason i bought from you is because a  only one i could find b  it was my neices birthday and she s extremely sick  that s all she asked for but people like you do what you do best and upcharge  have a great life      
47,5.0,                       it s as amazing as the hype makes it  but don t go overpaying      for it  wait til it s back in stock           
48,5.0,                       it s great  bought this to play pok mon since i waited   years for them to release games i had been waiting on  sold my original switch  this one is the new model with the longer battery life  and it s definitely noticeable  i have gone entire days  hour are a time usage   using it and not had to charge it till i got home or went to bed  one issue that still remains is the onboard wifi on the console is still just as bad as it was in the first original model      
49,5.0,                       i am a huge fan of animal crossing and at the last minute i decided i had to have this  i ran around and called some places  ended up getting one of the last ones at my local wal mart  the console is slick and i am not disappointed  i love the colors and i am super glad i decided to get it      
50,5.0,                       here is an actual product review  not an opinion on the sellers business ethics  to start  i bought this solely because it s the limited edition version  it does not come with the animal crossing game however  so keep that in mind  the product is exactly as advertised and was completely new and unused  absolute perfection  the price is not ideal  but amazon has amazing financing options  so overall it s a beautiful device and so very cute  i definitely don t regret buying      
51,5.0,                       the main reason there are so many   star reviews is because when quarantine  st started there was a price gouge now they ve lowered it to the original price so you should just ignore those my son loves it is helping stay in touch with his friends during quarantine and it has a wide variety of fun games i think that you should should get this for your kids or yourself       
52,1.0,                       horrible price gouging     
53,5.0,                       in terms of raw horsepower  cpu  graphics  whatever  the nintendo switch is far behind the current generation of consoles like the xbox one   but  the switch is a unique device   as a handheld  it is quite powerful  the latest iteration nearly doubles the handheld s battery life  addressing the switch s greatest weakness    this allows you to play the same game on your tv and keep playing it as you take it out with you     a unique ability most importantly  there is a staggering array of software available for it   software is what makes or breaks a console  no matter how good it is for example the zelda game  breath of the wild  is a visual stunner with a huge open world   and this is the first portable system that has the full version of skyrim available for it  the reason i bought it     a high quality port of skyrim with the   add on packs    nintendo has also done high quality ports of other gems from older consoles such as  mario kart    as well as a lot of new titles such as  super smash brothers ultimate  or  luigi s mansion    in addition their digital store has a lot of quality indie games such as stardew valley also  if you purchase the nintendo switch online membership      year  nintendo also gives you a large selection of nes and snes classic games   the membership is worthwhile for that alone basically  because nintendo is only selling the switch as a current console  the  ds is on its way out   all of their best software goes to the one console   and that gives developers strong incentives to bring their best titles over as well if you want a wide variety of games  the switch is a good choice   if you want the best console graphics or performance  obviously the switch isn t for you      
54,5.0,                       the animal crossing switch is just beautiful  i love the colors and the details in the design  the system i received works great and was as described  i actually received it a day ahead of schedule  which is amazing for this time if year  close to christmas  right now  due to covid  most sellers are raising prices on these systems  especially with these special edition ones  most other listings for the animal crossing switch have been almost double the normal price  so i m really grateful to have gotten one from this seller for the standard retail price  this made my christmas      
55,1.0,                       ordered new model  hac            with better screen and battery life  was sent discontinued model hac     instead  new models serial starts with xkw  old starts with xaw  be aware  i did my research and bought what was advertised as the updated model but got bit instead      
56,1.0,                       i will not pay any higher than the original price at           
57,1.0,                       i received mine in a non nintendo box  it had a couple of light scuff marks  it seems to work ok  bit it stinks to get an open box unit when it was not advertised as such  the price i paid was not open box price  by any means  i m not set against open box  but tell me that s what i am getting  if it wasn t my daughter s birthday gift  i would send it back  i definitely feel ripped off     
58,1.0,                       wow how disappointing dont buy this until they get this improved  older version of this is better in my opinion  the newer version gave me    crashes of system and game crashes leading up to finally unable to play this system having to return this system  what a horrible experience this was  being a big nintendo switch player what a great disappointment this was  hopefully they improve this newer version system to where this does not happen again or to someone else      
59,5.0,                       one of the joycons is a little weird but like  wow   my little animal crossing machine is working really good to let me keep my mind off this whole quarantine thing   i ve had it for a few weeks now and my friends were wondering if i died not many downsides  there s lots of games to play on here since the switch has been out for a while and it doesn t even have to be connected to a tv to let you play  if you know a kid who loves video games but you don t want your   year old to get shouted at for being bad at video games by    somethings that want to win games after work  this little guy doesn t have voice chat so you don t need to worry      
60,5.0,                       our household doesn t buy the latest  greatest gaming systems but it was time to upgrade our original wii for another family friendly system  the reviews were pretty glowing for the switch and i can say they re warranted  just make sure you buy the newer generation  this product  so you have better battery life and less decline over the life of the product i love how nintendo the parental controls essentially live within an app on the parent s phone  a motivated kid can hack just about anything so keeping these settings non local is a brilliant little safeguard  my kids have to ask me for  more time  when they ve hit a daily limit  which is customizable for the day of the week   it s very much like a simpler  more reliable version of apple s screen time feature on iphones  of course  you can also unlock more time on the switch itself using a pin code it s also worth mentioning that nintendo did a great job with the  user assisted driving  feature on mario kart that helps young kids and inexperienced gamers be competitive  it really is nice to bring my youngest daughter into the joy of mario karting      
61,5.0,                       real switch  fast shipping  regular price but amazon is the only place for months who s had them in stock  plus it s the special edition for the regular price  just as pictured     
62,1.0,                       dont pay     bucks for this  its worth      just another prat capitalizing on covid      you can get this exact model for          
63,5.0,                       edit  added photos so you all can see this beautiful switch i have waited for this particular switch since it came out in march       the animal crossing edition switch firstly   this switch is a gorgeous color and the little animal crossing details are super cute now  the switch started up fine and hasn t given me any problems yet  it charges as it should  got to my house on low battery  and the joycon attachments seem to work properly  it s super cool being able to control the switch with the joycon not being attached i played mario kart   on my switch and it runs beautifully  everything works as it should      
64,5.0,                       the new battery life is amazing  i bought this for my significant other for our anniversary to play the new pokemon games on with me  during some preliminary tests right before the games release  hers outlasts my original unit by hours  so this is a much improved unit and i am debating just buying me one and gifting my old unit to a family friend or something plus new joy cons always feel nice in your hands  and the colors are amazing      
65,1.0,                       product description    also includes all the extras you need to get started     not   there is not a single game that comes with this   you buy a pc  it comes with some rudimentary games   you buy a mac  it comes with some games   you buy a playstation  it has a few built in games   my son opened this for christmas  was so excited  only to find out that it has no games  not even a cheap little token game  to actually  get started    a quick peak at game prices  and you ll soon realized that you ve been duped by nintendo   their games are ridiculously expensive   due to son s excitement  i m reluctantly going to follow through and drop more bucks  but i m doing so with buyer s remorse      
66,1.0,                       i bought this nintendo for my doughter  christmass       once opened and made all the setup  she asks me where is the game  and i say  well look in the box it has to be somewhere  well no game included  that is what the box says  so what am i buying the animal crossing edition for  to have some animals printed on the console base  that is plain dumb  this is a way to fraud the buyer in getting a console asuming that it comes with a certain game installed because of the name and it doesn t  so i had to buy the game in the estore as was obvious i couldn t give a gift of an animal crossing console with no game of it inside    i feel scammed  would love to return it to nintendo but it s a christmass gift and i can t     next time they won t get me fooled      
67,1.0,                       new at best buy for          
68,5.0,                       i was able to place an order for this beautiful console the day of release during a brief period when they were available for the actual retail price of         and not for some inflated cost   the console arrived today and in great condition  the driver handed it to me directly  which was wonderful  the colors of joycons are two of my favorites and are quite peaceful to look at  the dock is adorable  a refreshing alternative to the standard black  as soon as i took the switch out of the box i applied a tempered glass screen protector on it   i was also able to transfer user data and save data over from my old switch to this new one  something i wasn t aware i could do  which was a very nice surprise  i really hope they get more of these beautiful consoles in stock soon for the rest of the animal crossing fans      
69,4.0,                       i absolutely loved the concept of the nintendo switch and decided to get one due to its popular demand  it s pretty awesome and best to get it at the normal price of         because it really isn t worth          and it really refreshes the gaming atmosphere  however  handheld mode is so enormous that it s a little uncomfortable  i was on the fence about buying this or the nintendo switch lite  because i rarely have anyone else around to play some really cool multiplayer games like mario kart   deluxe or super smash bros  plus  the switch lite doesn t come with controller joy con problems and is smaller  more comfortable  and accessible  one other thing that stands out on the lite is it has a smaller screen but games look a bit sharper on it  that said  some of the free games are pretty addictive  i think it was totally worth the          but it does cost     to buy nintendo online to play any nintendo game s online player  i also wouldn t recommend buying a pro controller because the joy con controller is pretty comfortable  so far  if you re someone who loves hanging around friends and family  get the regular switch  if you re a solo and lone wolf type of badass  get the switch lite      
70,4.0,                    port til  buena consola  nueva y perfectas condiciones pero los juegos en la tienda digital  esta muy caros  adem s no puedes prestar tu cuenta y que jueguen con la cuenta del titular         
71,5.0,                       this review is for the nintendo switch w grey joycons  v  hac           i ve owned the original switch hac      and recently  the switch lite turquoise   battery life wasn t so good with the original switch and only a bit better with the lite  this switch model has improved battery life  up to     depending on brightness settings  volume settings  and the type of game you re playing  another thing i ve noticed is if you download digital games  it takes less time  the graphics colors  seem to be more vibrant if you re a gamer who likes to play games on the t v exclusively  this would be the perfect choice  on the other hand someone who enjoys gaming on the go  might find it cumbersome carrying this console around  it won t fit in your pocket  just something to keep in mind lastly  if you buy plenty of digital games  a micro sd card of       gb is a must  another basic necessity would be a glass screen protector  as the plastic screen does scratch easily  there are two models  one with the grey joy cons and one with the red and blue joy cons  the switch with the red and blue joy cons seems to be the rarer model and is sought after by gamers for it s resell value  there are plenty of games available for the switch  something for everyoneand more to come  if you have your old switch  it isn t really necessary to upgrade to this newer model  however  just for the improved battery life  i would recommend it      
72,5.0,                       grown woman here who bought this for herself  super excited to play mario    and mario kart again  item arrived sooner than expected and in perfect condition      
73,2.0,                       everything about the physical device  i feel like is pretty well made  good set up  some minor future issues that are mitigated by screen protectors and similar  several easy to work with ways to play it  kinda fun in its novelties on its build my issue    games are ridiculously expensive  so many are over priced    online play required by nintendo for a not good service is poor  especially for things like minecraft    where are any older games  the games that nintendo has no need to keep out of the store  the old pokemon  zelda games  or any games really  like  great you are putting witcher   on there   but not orignal zelda and ocherina of time physical  great  nintendo online and games  bad    or   games does not make the switch worth buying  pc has better prices  easier to work with  and you can play almost any game out there      
74,5.0,                       i finally caved and got one  of course at retail price  it s great so far  i love it  the box came on time and in good condition  very easy set up i ve never had a console before  so this is my first official one   i was considering between this and the lite  but i think it s totally worth it getting this one  i like to have the option to play it on my tv  i also didn t think the switch screen would be that big but it s actually a decent size the controllers are so bright  especially the red  i wasn t expecting neon pink  i ve seen videos and pictures of the switch  but it s nothing compared to seeing it in person i was iffy about buying it on amazon  even if it was from amazon themselves instead of resellers  but this turned out great      
75,1.0,                       my screen was blank the first time i turned it on though i could still hear the sound of the menu   it took a call to nintendo to figure out how to fix it   not really what you expect from a      dollar product   i did a hard reboot and put it in maintenance mode to fix it which only worked for a few weeks   now the screen is completely dead   this really doesn t look good for nintendo s quality control seeing that the switch failed to perform out of the box   furthermore  i have had read numerous other stories online of people experiencing the same thing   nintendo needs to get better hardware and quality control processes   the last nintendo system i owned was an n   which was a brick house and never had any problems   the switch just feels cheap      
76,5.0,                       i bought the switch a few months ago and now that i ve spent some time with it  more than i d like to admit      i wanted to leave a review the switch has many pros over other consoles  it s main pro being that it s a portable console with games that previously are only found on pc or console  i am a pc gamer and my pc is an absolute beast with an     k        ti but the reason i bought a switch is because oftentimes i am out and about and can t bring my big honkin  pc with me  obviously i prefer my pc but it s nice to be able to play games like witcher   and then  when i have to go somewhere in the car or something i can seamlessly  switch  to the switch and continue my game there are some absolutely amazing games on the switch  zelda  breath of the wild  mario kart   deluxe  witcher    splatoon  super smash ultimate  etc   which are worth buying the switch  this is especially true for people with kids as most of nintendo s big hits are kid friendly  you may not want your very young children to play violent games like call of duty or battlefield   but they can definitely play a similar kind of game with splatoon   only instead of shooting bullets to kill people they re splattering paint all over each other however the switch also has its cons  let s start with nintendo s  e shop   the e shop sells games that are way overpriced  they charge        usd for games that have been out for years  the fact is you can buy physical copies of these games for less on amazon and you have the benefit of being able to resell the game later if you want too  not so with digital games then there is the price  yes the switch is      which is cheaper than microsoft and sony s consoles but when you factor in the cost of necessities that are almost required for optimal play  pro controller  sd card  screen protector  the cost adds up quickly all in all though i do recommend the nintendo switch  it s a great console for anyone who just wants to have a good time and it s especially great for families or people with young kids who want to play games with them without worrying about violence  drug use  sexual situations  etc   that are in a lot of other games     stars     
77,1.0,                       so  i did some research and bought this switch because it is advertised as the  new  model with serial number beginning with  xkw   it is said to have better battery life  possibly a boosted processor  and generally just be an updated switch model  that being said  the old discontinued model still retails for the same amount  i checked my model on my  new and improved  switch  and it is the sane as my      switch xaw  needless to say  i am rather disappointed in amazon  i installed all my games  transferred data  and now i am stuck with wiping and returning it or just settling for a mediocre version of the switch  thanks for the annoyance amazon  also  the left joy con bumper was broken right out of the box  it was also covered in grease       for outdated switch  and a broken controller  i don t normally leave nasty reviews  but i m pretty bummed  also nintendo will switch out the outdated one  but i have to ship it to them      
78,4.0,                       the system is great  a lot of free games to download  battery life can be better but good enough  screen is large enough  but can be bigger games are more expensive then other consoles  example  rd party games        on other consoles ps   switch        to        no web browsing  no netflix and other video apps besides hulu and youtube switch back stand feels flimsy  seems it will brake if you use too much force  no bluetooth headphones compatibility  need extra dongle for that  hands feels cramped up holding device after some time      
79,1.0,                       thank you for ruining a little girls birthday    fantastic marketing strategy that has alienated a long time consumer  zero reason to call this an animal crossing edition unless you want people to think the game is included  yup at bottom of page last bullet it says game not included but why wasn t that listed first in the description  easy  cause you hope people won t see that  last time i will attempt to make this large and type of purchase through amazon  if i d been in a brick and mortar i would have been able to talk it through and the clever marketing wouldn t have fooled me      
80,1.0,                       i purchased a brand new nintendo switch along with the game pokemon lets go evee  after setting up the console and following the instructions i inserted the game cartridge into the switch only to find that the my nintendo switch couldn t read the game cartridge  i tried trouble shooting the problem by looking up solutions online as well as contacting nintendo customer support to fix the issue  nothing worked and they recommended that i send it in to get it fixed which could take     weeks  as i am not sure if the problem is with the switch itself or with the game cartridge i am returning them both      
81,4.0,                       amazing console handheld device  don t crap on the product in reviews but crap on the scalpers  most of the reviews for switches that don t work are probably people who ve bought from  rd party i bought from ship   sold by amazon  it came with little dust and packaging particles but i believe it was just from the warehouse storage that got into the hole the box has  i ve been playing multiplayer for  hrs now and it works perfectly fine  if you can wait  don t buy  rd party and do amazon  totally worth it and really  really cute  i bought it msrp btw         no overpriced  scalped switch shipping  i bought it as a pre order for the next month  it changed to arriving next week to this sunday for me  there s a chance it will be the same for you too  so if you can wait  be patient  look out for pre orders  they are available every now and then    buy it msrp         it ll be worth it update after   day just found out   vent on the back of the switch is loose and your able to push it in  i don t know if this will be okay but review looses a star for this     works great but slight defect      
82,5.0,                       i had been looking for the switch for my son sunce earlier this year  due to covid it was either constantly sold out or the prices were jacked up  i knew the msrp and refused to be ripped off  i constantly looked at bestbuy  gamestop  walmart  target and others with no success  both amazon and ebay were too high priced  i told my son it was doubtful he would get one in time for christmas and he had accepted that  then a miracle happened and i found this amazon seller who sold it for msrp  plus shipped it quickly so we got it in time for christmas  highly recommend  thank you  it works great too      
83,1.0,                       the product i received was previously used    it has parental password  one control damaged and since i gave it as a birthday present a month after received it  now i can t return it      
84,1.0,                       i ll write the positives after i use it but thoroughly disappointed in amazon  the unit is clearly used and opened  there s a blue sticker on the outside  and it s covered in fingerprints  a shame  three stars off the bat  hopefully i like this thing  after i clean it edit  now this review has become a one star  there s no joycon controller center piece in here  absolutely terrible quality control     
85,1.0,                       i wish i could give negative stars for nintendo  this was purchased as a gift for the kids for christmas after recommendations from some friends  i still don t get any appeal to nintendo  we have only had it open for   days and already both joycons are complete toast  the drift in both is so bad that you can t make right turns playing mario kart  i checked the calibration and followed a number of online tutorials for things to try  but to no avail  come to find out  there is a class action lawsuit against nintendo for this very problem  apparently the solution is to send the controllers to nintendo and wait a month for them to diagnose and maybe repair them  this is probably why i haven t thought about the brand nintendo for almost    years since i last owned any of their products  i ve owned virtually every gaming console created and never once had this issue with any other controllers  if you are so desperate to play outdated video games with nintendo level quality that enduring this garbage is worth it to you  then more power to you  i m fine dumping this console in the trash and going back to forgetting nintendo even exists for the next    years  i ll stick to xbox      
86,1.0,                       i purchased this for myself for xmas  because i wanted to play with my kids   after about   hrs of game play  the left stick started drifting to the right   i mentioned it to my kids and they informed me that  stick drift  is a common issue with the switch   why would you pay for a product that that has a known defect that the manufacturer has no intention of correcting   better yet  why would nintendo sell one   the games are wildly overpriced   games are less expensive and better on other consoles if you are hooking it to a tv i have since returned it   i m bummed   i was looking forward to having some family fun   i will not recommend this product to anyone      
87,1.0,                       bought this black friday  item arrived in one day but the     gift card i was supposed to receive or be able to redeem seems to be a mystery  been trying to get an answer from customer service for    min and i have been transferred  x  i work in digital marketing with coupon codes and this is terrible execution  very disappointed         
88,4.0,                       it s a good console  it s not amazing  there is a limited selection of aaa games  more so if you like action and fps genres  you have more than enough rpgs to choose from and a lot of the asian anime style games  not sure what they re called   nintendo s own selection is pg as always  it sounds odd to say this  but my mistake was buying this when i m not a nintendo fan  the lack of support from major developers and studios means that i eventually turned to a laptop to meet my real gaming needs pros gaming on the move  great on airiplanes and to bring on tripseasy couch coop for supported gamesholds charge for a good amount of timemain console body is durable af  i dropped mine down a flight of stairs and it had no dentscons joycons are a straight rip off  they will fail on you then you ll have to pay       usd for replacementslimited game selection  this is the biggest issue   almost none of the large developers are supporting the switch  some of them are trying  but the switch hardware is already behind the times with current gen releases and you get knocked down graphics  ea gives you remasters or roster updates  take two remasters decade old releases  etc  and all of these are released at crazy prices  you pay us     for games being sold for    on pcs and consoles  it s ridiculous      
89,5.0,                       i love my switch  this console really brings me back to my childhood  there is something about it that recaptured that magic i felt playing my super nintendo and even the gamecube  i ve played every nintendo console and while i was a major fan of the early ones  after the cube  i got sucked into the xbox     and then the ps   but  this console is the first i ve played in years that brings me back to that childhood magic  i got this console on a whim after watching detective pikachu and realizing how much i missed pok mon games  so i had to get let s go pikachu and pre order pok mon shield  as well as getting back into mario  and checking out fire emblem warriors which is totally amazing  all in all  not only are the exclusive games amazing  but  the console and even the joycon controller rig are something special  i can t put my finger on it  and i really can t put it into words  but this is a great system and for kids or those trying to rediscover the child inside of them  this is a must have  just don t try to get inside a child with this is  or you re going to jail sicko      
90,5.0,                       i already own a switch but wanted to pick one up for my fiancee to have fun during quarantine  she is someone who has never played video games and didn t like them on the few occasions i tried to play a multiplayer game with her  managed to pick up a used one  that looked virtually new  from amazon warehouse for about       which was a steal  she is really enjoying it and slowly becoming a regular gamer      hours a day   and the switch has several games that are great for newcomers  she prefers handheld mode while i almost exclusively play it on my tv  so having that option is awesome      
91,1.0,                       yeah this is a great product and all  for        plus tax      
92,1.0,                       i received the discontinued switch for twice the cost of the new one  when i opened the box the controller mount already had a gouge in it  the joycons thumb sticks do not sit in their proper position so the character in the games you play are always moving when you do not want them to  and to top it all off the system over heats within   min of use  i did my research and moved it to an open air location and even at one point had a floor fan pointed directly at it with no success  do not buy this product      
93,1.0,                       just like so many others  the left joy con died  took about a week  get a playstation or xbox unless you like spending      on something that doesnt work and the company thats selling it knows its selling you garbage     
94,5.0,                       finally i could get a flawless switch console in my hands   this one is perfect   battery life  even the joysticks feels more premium now  i super ultra buster mega recommend this one  best switch version ever      
95,2.0,                       we place an order on     and receive it on      during the weekend  we purchase a mario party and start to play today on       but we find out the nintendo switch dock can t work  even the green light of the dock doesn t show up   nintendo switch itself is working well  we re not sure if it s a ac adapter issue or nintendo switch dock issue   just send an email to nintendo switch website for request support and wish we can get the adapter   dock replacement  otherwise  we should just buy the nintendo switch lite for saving money it s really a bad experience for my first time purchasing something from amazon com within past few years can customer support of amazon com help or we need to contact nintendo switch directly without any help from amazon com  thank you jerry huang     
96,1.0,                       so i contact them to tell them it s defective and they reply  if nintendo will repair it that may be the best option  but it is up to you   buyers beware     
97,1.0,                       it s already broken less than   month use  and the window to return is closed      
98,5.0,                       i love my nintendo switch  even though it was overpriced  i understand that it is due to low supply due to the pandemic so i am not that upset about it as the console has been working perfectly and came with everything advertised  the only problems i ran into were low memory and short battery life on the device but those were easily fixed  the seller was also very helpful and the switch arrived much earlier than expected and on my birthday  coincidentally  definitely worth its original price        and even though the rise in price is disappointing and definitely pricey  i would argue that its also somewhat worth it  playing on this is a good way to spend lockdown  so i don t regret making this purchase      
99,5.0,                       i am so happy i pulled the trigger and treated myself to this little beauty  i deserve it  i love the way it looks  i love how quickly it arrived  i love how well it was packaged  this unit arrived in perfect condition  this is my first experience with the switch  so i don t know enough about it yet in order to make a valid review  however  first impressions  i am happy i got it      
100,4.0,                       nice product  however i purchased on black friday with code for a free     gift card  i have received no such card  and now i don t see any notion that i purchased with the code      
101,5.0,                       the only time i ve used a switch has been playing on one that my friends own  just these experiences has really intrigued me into getting my very own switch  i love playing video games and i own an xbox and ps   so i figure at some point it was time to complete the trifecta  while i m more of an xbox person  i will say i am very impressed by the switch  it is a very simple console  but genius in of itself  i ve had some nintendo gaming devices here and there  a snes back in the day  but mostly their portable ones from the gameboy to the advanced to the ds and  ds  the switch combines that of a home console and a portable gaming device and for that i love it  i can put it in the dock and play it on my tv  i can play it handheld which will be great for road trips or maybe just wanting to play anywhere  this was a brilliant move by nintendo and it makes the switch really stand on its own now what i d say my favorite thing about the console is it s simplicity  this device is made for one thing only and that is for playing video games  the console is both modern and old school at the same time  would definitely recommend to anyone who really likes nintendo and their games      
102,1.0,                       i do believe its coincidence but  you re trying to make a profit from a scarcity during a pandemic  isnt that illegal      
103,3.0,                       the switch is a great game system but my blue joy con broke within a couple days of playing with it  it was very disappointing as i bought it for my son s birthday so i waited about a month before giving it to him  of course  that meant i could not return it once the controller broke  we had planned a big road trip and i was hoping the switch would keep him entertained but because of the broken controller  it was useless the whole time  nintendo has a warranty on it  but being holiday season i haven t gone through their  process  of returning it and getting a new one  all i can say is its been a very disappointing experience with this nintendo product delivered by amazon  just sucks something so expensive can break so easy      
104,2.0,                    la caja de amazon estaba entre abierta  no estaba totalmente cerrada  el producto venia en una caja sin ningun sellos de seguridad  es un open box    yo pague por un producto nuevo  la caja no estaba en optimas condiciones  tampoco tenia ningun tipo de proteccion         
105,5.0,                       alright so since the covid    outbreak has officially ruined my sisters senior year she had started getting into animal crossing  after playing on the i phone app for what felt like forever she decided she wanted to transition to a game on the  ds console  since she had started playing animal crossing new leaf she fell in love with the series  so as her big sister i had decided i would get her this limited edition themed switch in hopes of helping with her depression as well as to cheer her up for her senior year being ruined  also so she could get a taste of animal crossing new horizons for when it comes out march   th         the day i told her i purchased it she hopped with joy  i was excited too considering i was sharing my own excitement for animal crossing with my sister  it had finally arrived  its box didn t come in damaged and the console was packed safely to prevent possible damages  it works perfectly as any nintendo switch should with no defects at all in the console itself  the only concerns i have to remind future buyers is that the joycons will stop working properly after a year of use  this is coming from my own nintendo switch experiences and other fellow switch owners where the controls will drift randomly while you re trying to play a game after a year after consistant use  so i d be best to invest in a second set of controllers just in case all i have left to say is that this was indeed worth my money and my sister couldn t be happier with her early senior graduation gift      
106,1.0,                       this is disgusting     
107,5.0,                       this is my review of the  v          version of the nintendo switch  model  hac           so a little background  i was a enthusiastic pc gamer in college who built my own pcs for the purpose and am now   due to the demands of adulthood   someone who only plays the occasional game  my last handheld nintendo console was the black and white game boy pocket in the early    s  so i ve been away from the platform      a while i bought the switch purely because i learned they had ported skyrim to it  and as a huge fan of the elder scrolls genre i was hoping to devote some of my train commute to questing around tamriel  in this sense  the switch does not disappoint  i am not a graphics connoisseur  but   compared to the pc version   skryim plays really well on the switch  no perceptible lag  colors are crisp  yes  it s missing the expansions and yes  the text can be a little small  but that s a fair trade off for the portability this platform brings so far  i only own   games   skyrim and mariokart    another throwback to my college dorm days on the n     and i love playing both on the switch  marokart is obviously the newer game and so the graphics and gameplay are much better but i m a still a sucker for skyrim  at least until the next es is released  hopefully in my lifetime  anyway  all this to say the nintendo switch is a great console for busy adults who want to reminisce about the fun they had         or even    years ago  the switch doesn t take itself too seriously  which i love  but that means it might not be the right choice for people concerned with the perfect graphic or gameplay experience   there are dedicated consoles that do this much better  what the switch does is make gaming on the go effortless  fun for the average busy person and something you can really enjoy with your whole family   which i think was nintendo s real goal here all along      
108,5.0,                       call me crazy     i bought the original switch a while ago and never played animal crossing before  when everyone was talking about new horizon during the start of the pandemic  i thought to give it a shot  boy  i should not have done it    i started spending all my free time paying off my loans to tom nook  hunting for villagers and trying to decorate my island  like many  i got kinda bored after everything was unlocked and got tired of the villagers repeating the same over and over again  i thought of resetting my island  but didn t want to lose everything i had worked for so hard  then nintendo announce to release the acnh special edition switch again and beside i didn t like the idea of buying another switch  it was a great opportunity to start another island with an acnh themed switch  anyway  i didn t regret spending another        the switch is very cute and fits perfectly on my shelf  beside still having my old switch with a developed  but basically abandoned  island i mostly play on the new acnh switch now  i know it s very hard to reset your island  but if you don t have the money to buy another system  you may want to consider it  starting from scratch actually  does bring a lot of the lost magic back      
109,5.0,                       okay so this is going to be a review with my overall experience  yes  it was overpriced  i think this was worth it  i personally got it for the joy cons  and i don t regret it  because you really don t know when you will get the opportunity to get one for less  anyways  arrived in perfect condition  first switch ever  the only thing that was wrong is the left bumper on the joy con  which i don t know how to explain it but kind of loose  more than the right bumper  it bothers me because of something on the inside  and also since i paid a lot for this switch but not enough to complain  its just something i ll have to live with  but besides that  it was a great experience  the bumper was the only thing that gave me a fright since it feels very weird  now i don t have anything to play since my game doesn t arrive until wednesday  but just downloading free games is fun  but originally there is only   gb so i would recommend getting a micro sd  but i think that s all      
110,1.0,                       these prices are super redick  no one should give any of these third party people money  that s just unfair     
111,5.0,                       giving the console a low review because of scalpers is not okay  the console is beautiful and i can t wait for it to come back into stock and screw over all of the scalpers  but come on people    don t review bomb it because someone is charging way too much for it  that s not fair      
112,5.0,                       i m late to the switch party  but so glad i came  haha  it s      worth it  i got the gray  so it d be more subtle  figuring out how it works is very easy   it s quick to catch on  i have downloaded all the classic mario games  youtube   hulu  it s such a throwback to see all the classics again   hear those familiar sounds  the nintendo membership is only     a year  which gives you access to all those free classics  so in my opinion  it s absolutely worth it  i use it everyday  whether to watch movies  or play games  i love it so much   would highly recommend      
113,1.0,                       this item was a hot item during the pandemic which made it almost impossible to buy  when it was available they were being sold at unbelievable prices  so imagine my luck after months searching for a switch to buy they suddenly became available again in september  i bought it quickly with the intent to hold onto it as a christmas gift for my children  bad mistake  now   weeks after christmas the controller that was included with the switch is not working  it has drift issues so it won t let my children go to the left and keeps moving to the right without them doing anything  i figured okay  it must be defective so i will call amazon and hopefully they can fix this for me or just send me a new controller  apparently not  amazon says the item is out of the return window and there is nothing they can do  now here i am stuck with a controller that lasted   days total and apparently prices are between    and     just for a replacement controller  complete waste of money      
114,1.0,                       if you are not a super fan of animal corssing then i think you can just get the normal one  the price just go crazy and it doesn t worth it  if you really whant a cool colour one you can diy  the photo is form my friend  it is not so hard to change those shell  you can buy the shells even on amazon  though my friend get them from somewhere else       
115,5.0,                       i wanted one of these bad bois back in march  i missed preorder and didn t wanna pay      or more  i m beyond happy that nintendo decided to release more of these  the console is beautiful in person and was       worth the wait  snag one of these while you can      
116,1.0,                       as badly as i would love this switch the fact that people are allowed to buy them in bulk and resell them at such a higher value  is ridiculous  i ll either wait for a restock or get a skin for my switch  not giving these scums a penny    which is what everyone should do  then everyone that bought bulk will have wasted   on product they aren t selling  because i will never pay more than the products worth      
117,5.0,                       i can play and explore in games for    hours before needing to connect to the charger  the transition from handheld to tv display is almost seamless  just a slight lag before the display pops up on the tv   i love being able to stay and play at home or take it on the go with me      
118,5.0,                       use apps like hotstock and twitter bots like   kinnybot to notify you instantly of switch restocks at retail       it may take a few days so be patient  it took me about a week or two at most  i missed a walmart and a best buy one but i got lucky on amazon thanks to kinnybot  so it is possible to get it without price gouges      
119,5.0,                       we re very lucky to get our hands on one  the system looks beautiful and it came in perfect condition  if you re looking for a restock check out acpocketnews on twitter  they re a great page that always posts updates when different stores restock  please do not support these greedy people trying to mass purchase and resell this  just be patient and i m sure you ll be able to get your hands on one        
120,4.0,                       i have only tried the game in hand held and tablet mode  i am also using a samsung galaxy charger because it is less bulky  so i cant comment on the dock and charger  though i wish they are working fine  the game console is the v  with the longer battery lifetime  it is amazing and very entertaining  i have played zelda and mario party and the graphics are amazing and very enjoyablei was lucky to get right before the prices went up and still i was thinking that        is overpriced given that there was no game with the console  so u had to buy a game usually ranging between            
121,1.0,                       recieved older version of switch      
122,5.0,                    muy bueno diversi n        
123,5.0,                       a nintendo switch with extended battery life  what s not to love  it s a no brainer  nintendo is always at the forefront of console innovation and they didn t miss a beat with the switch  want to play a game on your tv like a traditional console  drop the switch into the dock and game on in     p hd  need to hit the road  slide the switch out of the dock and continue your gaming on the go in brilliant    p hd  and i haven t even gotten into the built in option for multiplayer gaming with the removable controllers  like i said  cutting edge console innovation from nintendo  come for the innovative console  stay for the myriad of both cutting edge and nostalgia inducing first party titles from nintendo  not into mario and link games  how about the largest library of quality indie games and old school games  no matter how you look at it  the switch is where it s at      
124,4.0,                       ya no i m not one to buy used products but this is second time i decided to buy used  i do pick the used very good thou  but still been used either way  so today got it and i m astonished how well amazon packs there used products and how new everything looks i was not sorry first time i bought used so i m hoping will not be this time  looks in too top brand new shape but have to wait till   th to hook it up and test it as it is daughters bday gift so i will at that time do a review and pics to show how fabulous it is  so if u was like me afraid to buy anything used or refurbished i m just saying give it a shot i m sure  x out of    u wont be sorry  review to come after   th update        everything is great except the controllers  they absolutely are horible will not stay charged for no more than    mins tops atleast the ones that came with the console i got  but everything else is perfectso if u buy this console i would get extra set of controllers right away       
125,1.0,                       love the switch console itself  but cannot stand how people are bulk buying and gouging right now  really gross behavior and unfortunately amazon will do nothing about it      
126,3.0,                       this is a great deal but it doesn t tell you anywhere in the post that it doesn t come in original packaging  it even shows it in the nintendo box  i had to seek and buy an original empty box off ebay because my son knows about gamestop and believes in santa still  i didn t want any doubt put in his head  a heads up anywhere in the post would ve been nice is all i m saying  still a good deal but plan on adding      and buying a box from ebay if you want it in the box as shown      
127,1.0,                       price is outrageous   people try to make money off of people like that is wrong       
128,2.0,                       great product   after further review and updated news stories    the price was significantly inflated   be advised   do better homework than i did      
129,5.0,                       this is the most beautiful nintendo switch console i ever have  and probably ever will  seen  it s so smooth and relaxing to just look at  worth the money as long as it s not bought from a scalper      
130,5.0,                       i am so grateful i did not give into the scalpers    i know how unfair and unfortunate the scalping situation is  but the console itself really is not worth anything but       plastic and basic   please consider trying sites like stockinfo  where i finally got mine after like a month of searching  and save that money for all the games you ll want    plus sticking it to the scalpers out there once it becomes widely available again makes the wait so much more worth it in my opinion      
131,1.0,                       turned on the console for the first time and immediately received error code            i called nintendo support and i have to send it to their repair service  didn t even make it to their profile setup  i have to wait   weeks now for it to return with the functionality that was expected upon purchase  very disappointed      
132,5.0,                       this is my first switch  and i was so happy to find any switch back in stock  i saw this special one  and loved it  i love animal crossing  the box  and console are so much more beautiful in person  powers up great  and was very easy to set up  tried playing a couple games i have and it works great  a limited edition switch for the same price as the regular one was amazing  i recommend this to everyone      
133,4.0,                       i ve had my switch for about a year now and i can say it s a very fun console  it s no where near as powerful as the ps  or xbox but the fact that i can take my games on a road trip or play it at home is pretty awesome and convenient for gamers  the joy cons do get loose however over time and will slide off without having to press the release button so i would recommend getting a grip or a case like the picture shown above  another thing i wan to mention is the joy con drift  which can get really annoying at times  having to calibrate them in the settings menu every other minute can be really annoying and for others  ruin the experience  i usually use a pro controller while playing on docked mode and i don t run into any issues but the problem persists when i m playing on table top or handheld  besides the minor inconvenience here and there  i think the nintendo switch is great  especially with third party games like skyrim or the witcher   being ported over to the switch  it s a great little console      
134,5.0,                    me encanta esta super        
135,1.0,                       nintendo will release this special edition in the beginning of april  this is not a limited edition  so do not waste your money  just wait for several days      
136,5.0,                       spent a lot of time looking to find a switch that wasn t overpriced  and after doing lots of refreshing and looking at stock informer sites  i was finally able to purchase one  is in perfect condition  brand new  and delivered on time  definitely worth the wait of getting it at standard pricing  now to spend countless hours playing acnh      
137,1.0,                       after a little over a month of  very light  use  the hdmi connection no longer works  the switch will still charge while in the dock  but i cannot play on the tv while in docked mode  i can confirm it is an issue with the refurbished switch as i have another switch that i use personally  that works with both docks  my original switch dock and the dock provided with the refurbished one      
138,2.0,                       honestly  i m glad i have a switch but didn t realize the new switch was still only getting sold for the same amount as       i honestly didn t know i was getting ripped off until everyone told me i was  while the design and colors are super cute i m really sad they jacked the price up and i had no idea      
139,5.0,                       the moment that i received my new nintendo switch  so so so much fun  easy to setup and link to your nintendo account online  battery lasts up to    hours before recharge  i have to say  this multi functional console is awesome  console can be used like a  ds or like a regular console  has a docking station   highly recommended  only issue is that there is high demand for this console and not many up for sale at this time nintendo switch is well priced and a easy travel companion which can easily slip into your backpack etc fun for all ages      
140,1.0,                       honestly  the nerve of you people who are charing so much above retail value  i get it  people are stuck at home and want a switch  but you are so damn wrong if you think i or anyone else will pay      or over asking price from stores for a console  i hope you can sleep well with yourself  because you people honestly kill me      
141,1.0,                       it lasted two weeks  amazon would not give me a full refund because once this christmas gift was returned to me it was over thirty days  beware if you are buying a gift      
142,5.0,                       got this for my gf   she loves it  she has been wanting the animal crossing edition since it came out the first time   it sold out so fast  so when we saw it on amazon  we knew we had to jump on it  so glad we were able to get it finally  she loves the pastel joy cons   the design on the back  the dock is even cuter in person it was packaged nicely   delivered right on time  everything that was advertised was in the box   individually wrapped  there weren t any issues upon opening  the system runs very smoothly  my gf hasn t had any issues while playing   she s been playing it almost every day for about   months now      
143,5.0,                       this system is awesome  i love that it can be carried around and used as a personal game system or i can pop it into its dock and play on a big screen  it s extremely easy to set up  to use  and to play i bought the year long family subscription to nintendo online and each of my kids has their own profile  they can take turns playing alone  or quickly jump in on a shared game  we even got my wife involved once i bought monopoly from the nintendo online store  i highly recommend the system for any families or anyone who enjoys all levels of gaming     
144,5.0,                       i knew people who owned the switch were seemingly all very happy with it  and i planned on getting one at some point  when pokemon moved to the switch   some point  became  right now  nintendo likes to make their consoles unique  the ds lite had two screens  a touch screen  and a microphone that were all used to make the experience unique  the  ds  the wii  and wii u also had their own interesting elements  at times  it just felt gimmicky  the switch on the other hand  doesn t feel that way at all it s the gaming equivalent of a laptop with a docking station  you can have the tv experience like any other console  which is also great for party games  then you can take it with you  this is basically the go to gaming device for plane rides  the joycons are also genius  it is just incredibly versatile i m pleased that it has usb c  the dock is easy to connect to as it literally just drops in place  i do think it could use more apps  it pretty much only has hulu and youtube at the time of this review  if i m remembering correctly  i am a bit of a geek so i have plenty of other devices to watch on  but if it wants to compete with some of the other devices  it would be nice to have the option of watching netflix  for example i remember when the wii first came out  and you d go play the sports games with whoever had one  the novelty wore off before long  the switch however  is here to stay  brilliant device     
145,1.0,                       excited for my switch  but i guess nintendo thinks this is a better product      
146,1.0,                       scalpers freak show     
147,5.0,                       this was my first hand held gaming device and i think it is a very unique  innovating what a portable console should be  i love the portability of it on the go and the ability to allow multiple players play at once  for      i think this is a solid gaming console that can be used to pour hundreds of hours into and still find games refreshing  the nintendo game lineup also has the best exclusives out of the other competitors  from mario to zelda to animal crossing  there s a game that suits anyone s taste  of course there are improvements to be made such as the joycons being small and sometimes uncomfortable in the even if you put it in together like a controller  it still doesn t replace the feeling of a real full sized controller  in the future  i would just like nintendo to make the portable screen     p with a    hz refresh rate for an even better gaming experience  but overall  with its creativity and innovation still standing strong   years later  there isn t much you can t love about the nintendo switch      
148,1.0,                       the original msrp for this console is      usd  it s a beautiful device but it s not worth any more than the official value nintendo placed on it  so  if you see listings for more than       don t buy it  it s more than likely coming from scalpers waiting to benefit off of your desperation  consumer willpower is the only way to break the cycle these corrupted scam artists have created      
149,5.0,                       i kept checking and finally was able to find a switch for retail  thank you amazon   we have a couple games so far   animal crossing new horizons  super smash bros  and mario kart     i love how nintendo is more parent friendly games  you don t have to worry about the games your kids are playing on nintendo switch so much compared to say games on other consoles with adult ratings and such   love that most   player games can be played with one joy con   although a second joycon is on our to buy list   the reason being is adult hands holding half a joycon is kind of hard   if you can grab one at retail and are in the market  i d say go ahead and pull the trigger   if you can t find at retail  i d suggest just waiting it out until you can         
150,1.0,                       they re getting bots to buy up all the the switches and inflating the prices      
151,5.0,                       my launch day nintendo bricked and is on the eternal repair list at nintendo due to covid   i got really lucky to get another here at retail   this is the new improved red box v  one   much better battery life and stabilizer   i have noticed the differences   if you love nintendo  get it  much better than the lite  you can play on tv or hand held   this grandma who has been playing since the original nintendo  plays on a    inch  k samsung and it looks fine      
152,5.0,                       good seller  console came with everything as specified on description  i ll upload some pictures so you can see the box and hardware quality      
153,4.0,                       i was quite disappointed with finding a very noticeable crack in the screen   st picture   the description made it seem like the switch only had minor flaws  if any  like those displayed in the second picture i shared  it took a bit of maneuvering to get a shot with the minor scratches in it  these aren t so noticeable and i don t mind them but the crack is an eye sore and i can only hope my son isn t upset when he opens it for his birthday next weekend   initially  the seller didn t provide the accessories  plug and such  and i didn t notice this error til after they emailed me  they were very quick to realize their mistake and corrected it right away  i actually got the email the same day the accessories arrived so it was absolutely fine in my book  i just wish i hadn t paid full retail price for an item with such a major flaw in it  it seems to power up and work just fine though      
154,3.0,                       the game is fine   got up charged       because they could      
155,5.0,                       i want to start by getting the obvious out of the way  scalpers   trash  and i cannot believe with everything going on right now that amazon is allowing them to sell at such inflated prices   wait for the official amazon restocks because they charge msrp  now onto the switch love it  i cannot say that enough   the console won t blow you away  but it will keep you entertained for hours  whether you play in docked mode or handheld mode  they both work very well and looks very good on both screens   the battery on this generation is much improved over the day   release   the battery itself is the same size  but nintendo put in a more efficient processor which extends the battery life the game selection is wide and varied  if you like shooters  you can find them here  if you like platformers  look nowhere else  you have some of the greatest ever made  not just this generation  but former generations in the nintendo eshop the rundown is the switch is a great console and worth the       just wait until amazon gets it back in stock  stay far away from this worthless scalpers last note  follow  fatkidalerts on twitter  he is always keeping up with switch stock on amazon  and that is how i finally got mine for msrp      
156,1.0,                       after three days of use i started experiencing drift  not only that it was used and damaged       for a broken switch is not worth it      
157,5.0,                       ok  here s a review from a mama that has no game  i know nothing about the console itself  here are the things i do know  my son won christmas  opening this baby was a jumping  dancing celebration  he was very  very happy  the hubby had it up and going easily and quickly  and it went from box to play time in about    minutes  be prepared to spend about     at start up to join nintendo  and you get a couple packs of games  some looked retro to me  the battery life is amazing  seriously  we had a   hour road trip getting home after christmas  and it held the charge the entire trip  wow  i feel like it was a good purchase      
158,5.0,                       it arrived today safe and sound in the original packaging without any tampering or damage  the box is of course placed in a standard amazon box with extra cushioning  so it is well protected  it is indeed a legitimate animal crossing edition switch  and everything works exactly as it should  i m so glad i waited for this restock rather than buying one from scalpers elsewhere  this edition is even more beautiful in person      
159,5.0,                       this is my third switch so that i can have three animal crossing islands because i m insane  also i have severe ocd   same thing i guess   and i am absolutely in love with the ac theme  i have a different style color for each one so i can tell the islands apart but this one is def my fave  the switch is my console  i have played a couple of games on ps   atelier games that weren t out on switch until more recently   but now that those games are on switch i will get them as soon as they go on sale  i love the handheld option because i can play while my husband watches something on our tv  and i love that it can also be docked so i can see things on the big screen  i play mostly handheld  it plays smoothly with the joycons and a pro controller  you can even play with a pro controller when it s not docked if you don t want to can t use the joycons  i m sorry about the novella  it s just enjoyable and i recommend it      
160,1.0,                       please don t buy the switch above the msrp  these jerks are creating a vacuum for the nintendo switch and then scalping them for profit  a sad world we live in these days when a global pandemic should be bringing us all together and instead these bottom feeders see it as an opportunity to feast on the wants   needs of others  disgusting      
161,1.0,                       it s incredibly disappointing to see nothing but overpriced third party sellers are distributing this product  and the fact that i had to sign up on several stock tracking websites just to have a chance at owning this console is more than disheartening to top it all off  the game itself feels like a huge downgrade compared to its predecessor  new leaf  not only are several quality of life improvements missing  but tons of content such as the dream suite  happy home showcases  deep sea diving  and more are absent  why is island visiting the only option for multiplayer when multiplayer island tours existed in new leaf  surely not because of hardware limitations   villager dialogue feels empty and simple  devoid of personality aside from their preassigned type  and let s not even start on the one island per switch discourse  not only was getting ahold of this console an absolute nightmare  but having to pay     for a game that feels unfinished is a disgrace  we can only hope that nintendo has plans to add content  hopefully not behind a paywall  in the future instead of relying on nostalgia to fuel sales      
162,1.0,                    no funciona el control izquierdo y me vino sin el cable hdmi  que clase de vendedores son  necesito una soluci n para este inconveniente  el producto no es nuevo  vino con el nombre ya configurado de otra persona         
163,4.0,                       i have an loaded opinion on this console that i want to express  the switch is flawed  as an avid gamer who usually ends up buying all the consoles  except the xbox one  and loves the hardware behind these machines  the switch was super cool when i first heard about it and saw it  i got one not to long after release once they came back to my area  though it took awhile to save up for any games as during that point in its life  everything was expensive on it and  rd party devs hadn t moved to it yet  also there were no media apps on it besides hulu which somehow is still a thing  surprising  but that isn t what i want to talk about  its more how the switch feels really damn cheap i don t mean cheap as with the plastic shell either  but that is an issue  dislike the texture a lot  and it was also damaged by strong adhesives from dbrand before   but you get a wimpy tn panel for its main built in display  in an era where amoled and ips are very obtainable for device of this size  the original psvita was oled  so it could have been possible   as the resolution is at a solid    p  which can help balance good enough quality on the go with actual game performance  i feel like they should have opted for a nicer quality screen to have better range of colors  would have created more vivid scenes using sharper and brighter colors  instead they chose washed out tn panels which leave a lot to be desired when comparing it to any handheld screen semi modern hand held screen with exception of ds s which also chose awful screens   and some might argue tn for faster response time  and to that  i highly disagree with improvements to other display types  and also for the type of audience the switch aims at next i want to talk about the joycons  as they are lovely little controllers that snap onto the side of the console with a satisfying click  i actually wouldn t have minded them despite being kinda awful when using them on a big screen if they worked correctly  but three years in and these things are still built to fail  there is a major design flaw in them that eventually has the analogue stick wear our and start  drifting   making the controller effectively useless  if these were cheap  maybe i wouldn t care as much  but they are     to replace  sure you can contact nintendo customer support and they sometimes take care of you  but this is a hassle and shouldn t even be a problem  they could have just owned up to the mistake  and redesigned the controllers at this point    pro controller is actually a solid design  but its more expensive then both ps  and xbox one controllers so i dislike recommending it  i believe its the amiibo sensor that does this and that s just bad  lastly  i kinda wanna just complain about nintendo being nintendo  but before that i want to praise them for how far they did come up to this point  there is finally  rd party content being pushed on the switch and thats awesome  it seems like they did listen a bit and made it much easier to get games on the switch  ok now onto the bad  the switch has no utility  and i get that its a gaming console  but still its surprsing that the most mobile and potentially flexible console lacks basic os features that things like the ps   psvita  and even  ds were capable of doing such as  have a variety of streaming services  a basic web browser  and customizing the layout of your home screen having fun backgrounds  there is no personality to the switch despite it being one of the most unique consoles i have ever seen  which is quite baffling to me  despite the console featuring bluetooth for its joycons and pro controller  you cant connect bluetooth headphones to it without a  rd party adapter  which is a little baffling for an on the go console  the ui looks pretty ugly when put onto a big screen  just a personal gripe of mine  i really don t like it  lastly  the game cartridges are a letdown  the reason games usually feel more expensive on the switch is because they more often then not are  this is due to the game cartridges costing more to make than blu ray media for the other consoles  nintendo also didn t want a disparity of cost between physical media and digital media  so if you launch a game both ways  you need to have the price be the same  which creates higher costing digital games on the switch store vs any other platform  the cost of the cartridge also varies depending on size of the game  so larger games will suffer more to this than smaller ones that s my loaded opinion which turned more into a typed rant on the switch  its still a pretty ok console that provides a ton of unique experiences that you can t get on any other platform  as a sole console i don t think i would recommend this unless you fully know what you are getting into  but as a side device to play exclusives its not bad  hopefully they will release new hardware and software updates to fix many of the gripes i rambled on about      
164,4.0,                       i bought this for my kids and they seem to enjoy it   i do like that you can play it in a portable mode and connect to a large screen tv   the controller is rather small when splitting it to do two player so people with large hands will find it hard to use   the orientation of the controller and how it s held varies per game and screen so that can be confusing   having the loop at the top of the controller on one side and on the bottom of the other  can assist with a left handed player but for right handers it can feel odd   my biggest gripe is the motion sensors on them aren t as accurate or sensitive as a wii controller   but overall thus far is a fun setup      
165,5.0,                       love my new nintendo switch animal crossing version  i have been waiting for over a year for this  i originally ordered the regular version but it never came so i went to reorder and found that this was finally available  so glad i finally got it  after a year i would have taken anything   my luck   this one was available  so easy to set up  so easy to use  so very happy with the amazon customer service and the nintendo switch  don t buy from scalpers who buy cheap and jack up the price  just wait patiently  worth the wait      
166,5.0,                       love the switch    this switch is so cute and i honestly can t wait to play animal crossing on this  the design on this switch is so beautiful like nintendo did a good job on the color scheme and everything    hopefully this switch keeps restocking so that everyone can get the chance to have their hands on this beauty for the original price and for those scalpers to stop raising the prices on the switch   btw for those scalpers reading this y all are truly disgusting and selfish for not letting people who actually want the handheld system get their hands on it      
167,1.0,                       this is too darn expensive  please lower the price  this is a hard time and is very unacceptable         
168,1.0,                       scalping     
169,5.0,                       love the thing  being able to play a lot of these games at home or out and about is definitely a winning situation  i can t compare the battery life to the previous switch but i haven t had a chance to kill it yet so great job nintendo      
170,5.0,                       so finally find this for the actual retail price  but it said it wouldn t be in stock for another month  said what the heck and ordered it anyways  then started to read the reviews and was horrified  but now i m glad i didn t read those first lol  if i read those first i would have never bought this  now i m wondering if they bought from  rd party sellers so even though it said it wouldn t be in stock for another month   i still ended up receiving this   weeks early   now the box wasn t taped like most boxes these days are so i was scared that something was missing  it was a brand new console  no scratches or scruffs  all pieces needed were there and in working order setting it up to the tv was a little complicated for me  which made me feel old in my   s lol  i had ended up missing a step which extremely frustrated me as i don t recall that step being in the  instructions but i probably just didn t see it  the step i had missed was having the console in the dock while setting it up  once i figured it out it was a cinch lol  if i had seen this step set up would have taken   minutes tops to set up very pleased with this system thus far  will update if anything changes     
171,1.0,                       i was supposed to get the hac         but i got the older version   feel a little ripped off but what can you do spent     more then what it is worth  they can t be honest      
172,5.0,                       i sold off my old nintendo switch  and picked this up at a discount  i tried to sell to gamestop  but they re not very clear on if they give you the full      they where advertising  so i opted to sell it online  the great thing about the new version is the significantly longer battery life  it s quite impressive  here s to hoping they come out with a switch pro version with bigger better screen        
173,5.0,                       tldr  product is so cute   but doesn t do anything special compared to a regular switch  other than give       on aesthetic  so don t buy unless you can afford it the look it worth it to you long review this product is amazing   the pastel colors are so cute and the texture on the back adds a great extra touch  the dock has an ac graphic on it which was a great addition tomy living room  the packaging is also well thought out leading to a great unboxing experience  of course this works exactly like every other nintendo switch  so this is entirely about aesthetic with all of that said  the price gouging on this product is insane  because it is a limited edition the reselling price is crazy  and because it does nothing a normal switch can t do  so purchasing this is a novelty  if you have the cash to drop go for it  i was lucky enough to get one at the normal price   but as i was hunting one down when they were first announced  i watched people buy them up and list them at inflated prices before it even came out  so maybe consider if you want to give those people your money      
174,5.0,                       i know this isn t an amazon product but i can t start this review without mentioning the awesome job this company does in keeping its customers        which for some reason some other organizations have forgotten  anyways   i first purchased the nintendo switch about     years ago   recently  there was a problem with the switch and it stopped turning on   i called amazon  at which time they let me know that i surpasses my warranty on the item   i immediately was disappointed and than immediately relieved for the next thing the amazon representative told me was that i was going to be able to receive a      refund of the     i spent on the item   after    months  if you tell me that i would receive almost a full refund after my warranty had run out    i am still in shock now as for the switch itself    we love it   it s not a playstation   or xbo       or something   but it s a great family system that also is great for when friends and relatives visit   recommend the switch for every household      
175,1.0,                       these scalpers are absolutely crazy  but don t worry  the internet always wins in these situations      
176,5.0,                       please whatever you do  don t pay their ridiculous      price for the same exact  nothing different  product only because they had money lying around for this exact reason  it s sad and pathetic seeing scalpers buy things in bulk just to resell at a ridiculous product just because they have more money to spend than everyone else  it s toxic and should be illegal i managed to buy mine at best buy for my girlfriend and it s exactly what an animal crossing fan would love  aside from not including the game  which isn t too bad because then you can decide if you want it physical for the cover art or digital without having to worry of loosing the game i know we all want to have one right now or at least when we get animal crossing so that it feels more special when playing it but if you can wait  then wait  voice your concerns to nintendo and amazon     
177,5.0,                       i ordered the nintendo switch for msrp and i thought it was too good to be true  but i ordered it thursday and it came monday  the website i used to help me find stock was stockinformer com  it alerts you the minute there s switch stock and you just have to be quick enough to buy it  it may take a few times and a few clicks but i was eventually able to purchase mine and i love this thing  it s really helped me curb boredom  i hope this helps anyone and please don t buy a switch from any of these  rd parties jacking up the price      
178,5.0,                       first off i want to thank amazon for the gracious price magnificent machine  plays very well  fun fun games  as a person that plays video games on every system from playstation to xbox to pc i have to say i am very impressed  highly recommend the games are the legend of zelda breath of the wild  mario s odyssey  astral chain  super smash brothers      
179,5.0,                       this revised model of the switch comes with a number of features that i honestly can t fully appreciate as someone who didn t own the previous model  the big thing that drew me in was the extended battery life  even though so far i haven t played much in handheld mode and not at all in tabletop  but they use the same amount of battery either way i would imagine  the reason i m giving this system five stars probably say more about how good it is than anything else  but i pretty much expected as much  i m sure by now you can go online and find more detailed reviews for the gaming system  but in case you re wondering here  this one comes with the system  two gray joycons  two attachments to turn each joycon into its own controller  a base to connect both joycons into the formation of a singular controller  the required cables  and the switch dock  so you ll probably want to buy a few things alongside this such as an sd card for reasonable storage space  a pro controller for a more standard controller experience  maybe a dock sleeve to prevent the possibility of scratching the screen from insertion and ejection of the system  an online pass if you plan to play any games with online features    just basically a lot of things that would be nice if they came with the system itself  this will inflate the price further  but the thing here is that this is going to replace the old models of the switch and simply make this the main one manufactured now  so    basically  if you want a cheaper switch you ll want to get a switch lite and this one will still cost about     bucks like the      year old original variant still costs  that is  unless you want to go used  i m only bringing up these points because while this is a great system  i do think you should be aware of what is likely to happen with prices and availability going forward and plan accordingly  once i realize a switch was still going to cost the same if i wanted the ability to do on and off tv play i decided i might as well just hop on board with this newer variant  i d recommend you do the same as it has had tweaks to make it just a slightly better version all around than the previous model  otherwise  if price is a concern  wait for the switch lite and see how it tickles your fancy  also  here s tip  if you want to turn the system off as opposed to leaving it in sleep mode  simply hold down the power button on the system for a few seconds and then a menu will appear with the option to restart or shut down  also note that you cannot play on the tv off of the switch s battery power  the dock needs to be plugged in for the dock to function  i hope something in here was helpful      
180,1.0,                       the product did not come with controllers  it had a bunch of post it notes instead      
181,1.0,                       this is so sad to see  i wanted to purchase this for my father as this was the game that we loved many years ago on the gamecube  i thought this would had been a great present for his birthday in a time where everyone is depressed and i come and see other people  not the coronavirus  adding to peoples depression  i couldn t be more disappointed with people that somehow manage to get their hands on a mass quantity of these so they can make a disgusting profit  this needs to be outlawed      
182,1.0,                       i paid the extra price to see what all the hype was about  honestly  i m not impressed  i ll stick to games on ps  and iphone because nintendo doesn t have much to offer and the ones that are decent cost     each  not worth it  and you can t even watch netflix or anything on it   wasteofmoney     
183,5.0,                       its a good system but wow it cost a lot  but the games have reduced a bit so that helps  regardless there was a little boy who nver stopped asking for one lol  its gonna be fun to watch him open it up      
184,5.0,                       i was so lucky    i happened to randomly check one morning after i had already given up on my search for a switch at retail price and they were in stock for        sold by amazon  i nearly cried of happiness and immediately bought it  it took a week and a couple days to get here  there was a delay in my delivery  i was worried they had sold me a sold out switch but nope it came in  just hold on and be patient and don t buy from these greedy scalpers  a few things about the system itself the stand is hard to pop out if you don t have nails  especially if you bite your nails like me  so i bought a stand for it  the game cartridge part is a little hard to take out at first too and i thought i broke it but it s flimsy plastic so it bends the controllers are kinda small if you have larger hands i would also recommend a screen protector  carrying case  and a stand  so you don t have to keep opening the kickstand it comes with      
185,1.0,                       but soon i noticed that the dock can t recognize my switch     so i asked replacement to amazon customer center and they said only return is available i had to send my dock to nintendo repair center cause they said it will only take a week to get a replacement however they are closed now because of covid    and don t know when they will re open i paid      more than nintendo switch light and now i only have to play this small display not my     tv it sucks      
186,1.0,                       i got everything except the real console     
187,5.0,                       glad to get one at retail price  this is by far the most fun system on the market today  if you see one for sale at         or less buy it  just keep checking  that s what i did  try sites like zoolert  google it  to let you know when they re in stock  i have faith in you      
188,5.0,                       just received it today  one day earlier then was told so that s a plus  took it out and plugged it in  my  yr old daughter hasn t put it down since  and for all the people wondering and asking it is the newer model with the longer battery life  yes it is the one with the longer battery life so buy it now because no ones selling the new ones just very few and they re going fast     
189,2.0,                       please don t think bundle means animal crossing game is with it because its not    i feel mislead   now i see where it says game not included but like many when it says animal crossing bundle u just assume because of the price u get the game to      
190,1.0,                       need to replace this switch     year old son woke up on christmas morning and received this unit from santa claus  screen protector was already on it and user name ronin had played over    hrs  with that said the console is locked on nintendo switch screen  horrible experience      
191,5.0,                       finally got my hands on one at the retail price last month  to hell with price gougers   i don t ever support them  i hope they die of covid  and i am having a lot of fun with it  i m usually a pc gamer but i really like that this is portable too  the battery life is nice and the motion controls are alright but i tend not to use them   i was confused about where to put my micro sd card till i looked it up  it s hidden under the kickstand which is kind of flimsy and the only real con when compared to the list of pros  so far i ve got skyrim  lego harry potter  my time at portia  nine parchments  and the deponia games to occupy me for now  i ve wanted one of these for a long time and i do not regret my purchase      
192,5.0,                       similar to other nintendo systems  innovation is always attached to their new ideas  the joy cons are similar to the wii remotes  albeit not as precise for some games where they were used for shooting type games  the joy cons are incredible for multiplayer  i honestly prefer using one joycon whenever i can when playing games  it s really nifty being able to play two player automatically with a friend or family member without having to pay for an expensive controller  or a cheaper built one nintendo apps are so so at the moment  it would be great to have streaming apps such as netflix for streaming  but other apps such as youtube have worked well streaming but i do not like the interface for searching for videos when playing online  after paying for a year subscription  was not as bad as the days of the nintendo wii  but it could be better  wifi play has always been a struggle for companies and consumers that i don t expect to go away with any patch made by nintendo  buying the year subscription also includes many nes snes games you can play with the joy cons in single multiplayer  my roommate got rehooked playing super mario world and it was a blast seeing someone who says they  hate games with bad graphics  overall  if you re looking for a system for on the go or for a house hold device  the nintendo switch is a excellent system with a good range of games to play on  my young nephew and kid siblings are a fan of it  and same for me and several of my friends who are in our early   s      
193,5.0,                       i love the animal crossing switch  i have been waiting for this product to restock for a long time  on october         i got very lucky  i was browsing amazon and i saw the animal crossing switch on nintendo products  i clicked on it and it was at      its msrp price and brand new  i immediately bought the product and have loved it since  it is now february    and i keep on forgetting to write a review so now i am  overall amazing product and recommend to wait it out for the restock  october    was a restock day for all switches because any switch i clicked on it was at msrp price      
194,1.0,                       price increase is ridiculously stupid     
195,5.0,                       don t be discouraged by the     star reviews  this is the real deal  you re only allowed one animal crossing switch per amazon account to allow most people to get their hands on it without the extreme price gouge  the switch looks beautiful while docked   i m a fan on the pastel blue green   cream colored contrast  if you already played ac on another switch console  you re now able to backup   transfer all of your save data by contacting nintendo support  it s a little tedious but  worth it if you have      hours of hard work        recommend to those who have been trying to get their hands on this in months   great holiday or birthday gift idea      
196,4.0,                       the red box tells you that this is the new model with twice the battery life  i never owned the previous model but i can tell you that i played in handheld mode mostly from       am to      pm with the exception of lunch  and i played  til about   pm before i got the low battery warning  i watched a youtube video that also showed that the colors on the screen are more accurate and the cooling system has been improved  so if you re wanting to play witcher   on here  i recommend getting this one  as that power hungry game might warp the chassis from overheating  on top of that they are the same price right now  so i don t think anyone should get the old model until the price goes down      
197,1.0,                       seller deliberately did not state that the console was for sale and use in either korea phillipines dubia as it turned out after calling nintendo and giving them the ups code the one i received was meant for the phillipines  i called the seller wacky jacky and told them what was written on the bottom of the box  he then told me to please wait a minute while he got another from his warehouse and proceeded to verify what i said then said he was sorry and that he had no idea and that his distributor assured him it was a us  north america  console  he then said i feel really bad and was going to send me a      gift card but what he did was refund      of the purchase price thinking that i would then keep the system  i don t know why he thought i would keep the system when i already had my return authorization label printed out and told him i was returning it  never did i say i wanted to keep the system  am i supposed to believe he didn t know it wasn t a north america console when even now he has edited his listing to let any future buyers know that what he s selling isn t intended to be sold in the us  the seller asked me to please edit my review and rating but i see no reason to change the stars although i did edit this review to include the conversation with him and the fact that he did not add a note to his product description to make buyers aware of the consoles region  beware when you are buying a system that it may not be intended for sale in the us      contact the seller before buying and have them verify what is written on the bottom of the box     
198,5.0,                       here is what happened  i already had a nintendo switch but i didn t play with it for a few months so when i wanted to use it it had no power  i put it on the dock to charge and nothing  i thought it was dead forever so i ordered a new one from amazon  later i went to see if my old nintendo would power up after i charged it  what i was not doing is pushing in the power button enough  after i pushed the nintendo powered up  so now i own   nintendo s  it s great to have    this new ns works great just like the old one  i could care the less about the game animal crossing but i like how the ns looks  also there was waiting time if i wanted the exact one i have  over all the ns is great  in fact i like it better then sony play station or x box i don t even play them anymore  i love it i can play the old games from nintendo and others  the first game i played was pong back in the day  nintendo rocks        
199,1.0,                       i purchased a new nintendo switch and what i received a used nintendo switch finger prints all over the screen and also food particles on the screen  im not kidding im so mad so disappointed because my son opened as an birthday gift  it still had the   peoples profiles who had it before      
200,1.0,                       it came very dirty  dark blobs of dirt on joy cons and plenty of dirt and fingerprints all over the screen  this is absolutely unacceptable  i am returning it and i demand a replacement  did i just buy a used switch for full price        
201,1.0,                       purchased for december      gift for my   year old  great fun playing hand held and in game console mode sent for repair bc crouch button he said did not work and the sound jack was loosing connections  tested on multiple headsets nintendo would not repair under warranty because of over use  what  was he crouching too much in his games  you buy something and it doesn t last   months  less than thst bc i made him play on it a couple of months before sending it in   we have to pay to get something repaired that didn t make it a year  totally unfair  what s to break next  you would like to know a company stands behind its product within the first year at least      
202,1.0,                       the product is fine during black friday they gave     promotional credit and advertised as it can be used on items sold by amazon com or amazon digital services llc  but when i try to buy game digital code from amazon digital services llc the code never worked  i spent over   hrs on phone and chat with customer services and changed   customer support representatives and no one can help me out  deceptive marketing promo      
203,5.0,                       i love the game and function of the system so much  the dock mode to handheld and vice versa is fantastic  i will say that this system is one of the most fragile consoles in recent memory  i am afraid to use it in handheld in certain situations because if it drops you ll be very lucky it doesn t break  i went through a pair of joy cons already due to this  all in all amazing system just fragile      
204,5.0,                       i grew up with nintendo  receiving a nintendo system for christmas was about the coolest gift  ever purchased a nintendo switch for my husband for christmas  our entire family has been enjoying the console  the graphics are amazing  i love this version as it can be used on the t v  or in the car my husband is the techie one  so i am sure he can speak to the games  graphics etc  however  if you can get your hands on one  you won t be disappointed  upgraded and exciting for the next generation of nintendo lovers      
205,1.0,                       terrible     
206,5.0,                       glad i was able to get this edition of the nintendo switch  i wanted to purchase the animal crossing switch earlier in      when it first came out  but it was quickly out of stock  my order arrived in a timely manner and in great condition  i only have    gb of memory  but i haven t come across any memory issues yet while playing a few games  i like that this console not only has a cute design and fun colors  but it came in a neat animal crossing cardboard box with every item needed for operation neatly organized  i had to buy or download my games separately from this purchase  this does not include the animal crossing  new horizons game as part of the package      
207,5.0,                       i couldn t believe my luck when i was able to snag one at msrp after the release date  it s so cute  i like the design of this one much better than the other switches  and the dock is adorable  especially if you re an animal crossing fan  and it s the newer version with improved battery life  too  i was thinking about getting a switch for a while  but the lack of games i absolutely had to have and the colors  i m not a big fan of the standard colors designs  put me off  animal crossing solved both of these problems with acnh and this amazing special edition my only complaint  other than how difficult it was to get   finally caught a restock in the middle of the night and even that sold out in less than   minutes  is that sometimes one of the joycons gets stuck when trying to remove it from the strap  it s probably just an issue with mine in particular  but it does make it kind of annoying to remove  i have to put some force into it  and i m sure that one of these days  i ll accidentally scratch myself trying to remove it  otherwise  it s very cute  and at msrp  i d definitely choose it over the other colors ps   i hear that this version is restocking  at least in japan  so absolutely do not buy from scalpers  when i was hunting for this  there were at least     being sold by scalpers for         now there are just over    for      each  it s cute  but it s not worth making a scalper       off of other people s desperation  just wait for a restock  or buy a regular switch and put a skin over it      
208,5.0,                       bought so i could play with the family when i have to travel for work  bought in used like new condition from amazon  inspected the product as soon as it arrived and found zero issues  didn t even appear to have been used at all  everything was wrapped as if it was brand new  i also checked to ensure that someone with an older model switch didn t switch out their console withe the new one and then returned it  needless to say  it was not the case and i did receive the new version  so far i have had zero issues  tons of games and hours of play time  best part  it wasn t over priced in comparison to what is currently being offered by  rd party sellers      
209,4.0,                       when i was little i used to be able to spend all day playing games  of course as i got older  my amount of free time decreased exponentially  if  like me  you need to balance your job and college life but still want to play games  this console is a really great choice  it s loaded with tons of pick up and play games that are great for quick    minute sessions  the handheld mode makes it really accessible and portable  and the new model has a great battery life  my only big complaint is that the controllers when in handheld mode don t always feel securely attached to the sides of the console  there is a small amount of wiggle if you move the console that is not really enough to bog down the experience  but is still noticeable enough to feel sort of cheap  overall though this is a great console for a busy young adult still trying to find time for their favorite hobby and i highly reccomend it if you re interested      
210,5.0,                       the wii and wii u were cool consoles  but i really only used them to play like mario  or gamecube games on  they were never really used to play  wii games   well the switch completely turns my opinion of nintendo consoles around  i have a gameboy advance  and still play the old pokemon games on it from time to time  but the switch is so much more than that  its like combining all of the good things about a wii  a gameboy advance  and even an old n    and packing it all into one box  that can even be taken on the go i am super excited to own one  and i cant wait for more switch games to come out  botw  lets go eevee  smash  the upcoming pokemon sword  and mario odyssey are my definite favorites though they need to fix joycon drift  sigh      
211,5.0,                       the switch is already of my favorite consoles i ve ever owned  as an adult i ve been surprised by how much i play it in handheld mode  it s nice to be able to sneak in some gaming time here and there at work when there is some downtime  and i actually find myself playing it in handheld mode pretty often at home when i m watching football on the weekends  i m glad i waited until this model with the improved battery life came out  sometimes  i don t have to put it on the dock to charge for   or   days  assuming i m playing    minutes here and there  i highly recommend this system      
212,1.0,                       abusive practices should get banned from amazon     
213,4.0,                       after switch s became almost non existent at the beginning of march       it is good to see they are finally back on the market  i pre ordered my switch off amazon in january  it was supposed to arrive in march  but to my surprise and delight  it arrived a whole month early  i ve been having a blast so far  but like everything  there are pros and cons to this device i ve seen some complaints from people about buying the switch on amazon  when buying it  make sure that it cost      if the switch alone costs more than that  you are buying from scalpers  avoid buying switch bundles  they might seem like a good idea but they often jack up the price to get an insane profit  because you don t actually know how much it costs to make all the various extra add ons they are supplying  lastly  make sure it says that the seller of your switch is amazon com  if it comes from anyone else  you might be scammed sold a switch that is supposed to be new but is not pros   great for people who miss the days of mobile gaming  and when i say mobile i don t mean phone games  i mean ps  vita s  ds  etc  the switch gives you the best of both  sometimes i plug it into the tv big screen and enjoy the beauty of it  but having the option to play in my room or in a car is or literally anywhere is a big plus for those who want to   the price  while in comparison to other consoles the switch is not the best in terms of technology  it s not even close   it is the cheapest  it cost     prior to taxes duty  a digital ps  is going to cost at least      and an xbox is       the games  while at launch it might have been a bit sparse  not anymore  there are tons of games available to play  from nintendo classics to indie games   perfect for casual busy players  if you re like me  and can t devote your whole life to gaming  the switch is the perfect device  its cheaper price tag and mobility make it perfect for gaming for one or two hours a day  without breaking the bank cons   joycon drift  if you buy a switch  expect your joycons to eventually stop working correctly  it hasn t happened to me yet  thankfully   but it will happen  to everyone eventually  for some reason  nintendo won t fix this  my best bet is they know people get annoyed and just buy new ones instead of waiting for them to sort it out replace it for free  be prepared to fork out    usd if yours break   the  nintendo tax   expect nintendo games to cost way more than their counterparts  mario cart    which came out on the wii u  is still    dollars  old nintendo games that came out years ago are still selling for full price  why  because nintendo knows you bought the switch just to play these games  also  the fact that you can still buy these games on game cartridges pushes up the price   the dock  the dock is  well  not as advanced as you might expect  it is an electrical part surrounded by a piece of plastic  i highly recommend buying a dock sleeve or a screen protector before using the dock  there have been reports of the dock scratching  damaging screens because of the plastic scratching against the surface   lastly  the storage  i bought   games to start  animal crossing and mario cart  half of my switch s internal storage is now gone  you are going to need to buy an sd card  you do need to be careful however  not all sd cards work with switches  so if you re like me and don t know how the technology works  you might just need to buy the branded sd card for switch  which is more expensive than a regular old sd card  if you are technologically advanced  i highly recommend doing some research to save moeny      
214,5.0,                       i don t know about you but i battled with getting the switch for ages  i wasn t too sure if the price of the device was worth it or not but i eventually bit the bullet and bought it and i have no regrets i like how the device can be hooked up to your tv or you can bring it with you on the go  right now as i get settled in a new place i ve been bringing it with me on the go  sometimes i m on campus and there s nothing to do or i m waiting in between classes so i just whip out my switch and begin to play it was worth it for me  i am waiting for more games to arrive for the switch but there is a decent selection of games to choose from      
215,4.0,                       i m mainly going to list off the pros for this unit  something i like that they did on this generation compared to the other consoles by nintendo and some gripes portability obviously with its docking capabilities   very good move   the way the switch locates itself within the dock is a cool party trick   i like not having to have a rucksack full of gear just to bring my system with the joy con controllers are passable and you can actually play  p games with each one   i do wish they offered a pro controller bundled version the setup of the system is easy  you don t have to fill out another mortgage worth of eulas to play for pennies you get a slew of nes and snes games through nintendo online mario maker   is pretty fun and i wished more games had byo levels like it cue the wave of gamers that will correct me on     games that have their own world building options  i m    and don t have time for games like i did in my teens   let me dip my filthy casual toe back in the game pool now that my kids are grown       
216,5.0,                       sure  it s no ps  or ps   but it s an incredible little machine with such incredible versatility in such a tiny package  while it might not have the pure processing power and graphics capability of the other two major systems it does do what nintendo has done best for a long time  provide a reasonably priced quality portable gaming system  the advantage this time is that the switch is both a home console and a portable console in one unit  this is something that consoles in general have never really been able to do until now and it s amazing how great the game quality is even in this small form factor i mean  the wii was good in the motion control but the gimmick did wear after a bit  the wiiu really felt like a disappointment in that it just didn t bring much to the table and nintendo clearly wasn t going to be able to compete in the home console market against the other two juggernauts  what nintendo has always been great at though is dominating the portable gaming market and the switch sees them bringing their expertise in the portable market to the home console market in a power play that really paid off in my opinion now  this system does still suffer from some of nintendo s generally less favorable business practices so do take that in to account  the price for the switch itself actually isn t that unreasonable so i don t fault them for that whatsoever  the peripherals  on the other hand  really put a dent in the pocketbook if you need to buy anything that didn t come in the box  and you probably will need to at some point  let s be honest   the price of games also comes at a premium just as it has with past nintendo systems as you will rarely see even older games every discounted or put on sale while such things are very common with the the competing systems  for instances   zelda  link s awakening   which has roughly    to    hours of content  will still cost you     which is incredibly high for a game that offers so little content with little replay value  sadly nintendo has a tendency of doing this and always has so do be prepared to pay premium prices for most games with the switch all in all i still think the unit is worth it particularly since you just can t find a better portable gaming platform than this  i definitely recommend getting the switch over the switch lite as those are fully integrated and if you bust an analog stick or a button you re pretty much screwed  with a switch you can replace the side controllers as you need and we all know controller buttons and analog sticks can wear over time so that alone is worth it  i mean  for      more you get a heck of a lot better of a system than you do with a lite so i highly recommend going this route if you re looking in to a switch      
217,5.0,                       i thought i found the deal of the century when it was back in stock and i grabbed on at normal price  yay  this is an excellent christmas gift  which i bought for myself  and i m really excited to have the special edition switch for myself without overpaying  patience paid off and i m so glad that nintendo released another round of this      
218,5.0,                       for quite some time nintendo has been underwhelming when it comes to hardware specs on consoles  to the point that i switched to buying only the handhelds after the gamecube  with the jump to an nvidia gpu  not only does the bar for graphics get bumped up significantly from what nintendo has released recently  it also allows third party title developers the ability to bring their fun games to nintendo for releases let s state that this isn t as powerful as the ps  or xbox one  but still has very good graphics  not only that  but being able to undock it and play it like a handheld is an awesome feature  switch online  a service needed for online gaming  also includes nes and snes titles you can play for free  included in the price really   my one issue  is that chat is needed through an external app  if this is done so the playing experience online requires less bandwidth in the rooms and therefore is smoother on the servers  than it makes sense  otherwise  seems a bit annoying to have to need another device for it      
219,3.0,                       defected  control keeps scrolling right  seems like this is a common problem after some research  was excited to come home and play pokemon shield  this ruined my night  will be returning all items that i bought due to frustration update  instead of returning i went on youtube and found a fix for my controls  after getting that fixed  i ll have to say this is by far the best system i ve ever purchased      
220,4.0,                       i love the aesthetics of the console and i appreciate that i was able to buy it at regular retail price but the storage space is terrible  i ended up buying a micro sd card because of how bad the storage space on the switches  like so bad i was only able to store maybe five to six games before i got the sd card  that s not terrible if you re just the kind of person to play one or two games on the switch but definitely something to think about      
221,1.0,                       i love my switch  so much so that my girlfriend has started wanting to use it too and i suggested she look into getting her own since she just bought a game but has no console of her own  we have looked everywhere and now they seem to be selling for      instead of the      that is normal  this should not be happening in a pandemic where people just want to stay home so as to reduce the number of price gougers amazon  please limit the number of consoles that a single account or credit card can buy      
222,1.0,                       called for help   unable to get help from nitendo   amazone customer  allen   he said he will call back for help next day but he never call back   bought this system for my    birthyday special   my kid  very disappoint it   can not wait too long   have to return it     
223,5.0,                       i absolutely adore the switch and nintendo as a whole  i ve had a dry spell with them recently and buying a switch changed that anyways  as many of you already know  the damper on production ability and rise in demand have seriously affected the availability of this product  but you can still get them new  at msrp  like i did there are bots that can notify you when there is stock for any specific model  color you re looking for  i used a discord called  stock informer  and was able to get a switch at its actual msrp within a day be careful out there  don t cave in to the gougers  it s not worth it  you ll be spending a lot on games  anyway  so save your money      
224,5.0,                       we got lucky and only paid         for this switch  if i were you  i would hold out until you can find one for msrp  don t pay these ridiculous inflated prices it came new in the box  never used  and came with everything needed  power adapter  dock  hdmi cable  joy con grips  and the wrist straps  switch had half a charge upon arrival  and set up just fine joy cons work great reads and plays a cartridge game  i m excited to play this more  it has very nice feeling controls  incredible graphics  compared to the wii that i was used to   and the console is very small and compact don t hesitate to pick this up  but before you do  don t pay      or over for it  that s ridiculous      
225,2.0,                       my son loves the switch  however  the controllers are constantly not working and we have to buy new ones which are insanely expensive  at this point  i ve paid almost as much as the switch itself in new controllers in just one year i am going to try the switch light and see if that works better  so  one year of this switch cost me almost      due to defective controller connection and parts  highway robbery       
226,1.0,                       this form of scalping should not be allowed during a pandemic      
227,5.0,                       it s good thing that was able to get nintendo switch for         few weeks ago and it arrived this week  beautiful nintendo switch  animal crossing  new horizon special edition console it looks awesome with colors and design  and it works excellent at my home  i like that they have few free to play games and that they have snes and nes games from nintendo e shop  i can t wait to get animal crossing game someday  hope they add more free to play games on nintendo switch  add twitch streaming app  and more apps for gamers  and be able to use bluetooth devices and console controllers with bluetooth hope they make more awesome and beautiful special editions designs and art nintendo switch consoles in the future and with  k  k graphics  audio  and uhd quality overall awesome console to own and have with my other different home consoles to play with my family and myself      
228,1.0,                       i received a switch that is unable to connect to the tv  so  it s pretty much just a more expensive switch lite   after an insane amount of troubleshooting  i was finally told by nintendo that the product was defective   nintendo wanted me to ship it in for repairs  the day after i bought it   so instead of offering me an exchange  they want me to send in my brand new switch for repairs   kind of ridiculous if you ask me  they should have replaced my switch no questions asked   on top of that  amazon is not offering exchanges either  i am very disappointed that neither company has a reasonable solution for defective switches  i will be returning this switch  and i can tell you  it definitely wasn t worth the headache trying to get my hands on it      
229,1.0,                       don t waste your money  buy a regular switch or wait for new production     
230,1.0,                       almost everything about this console is perfect but the joy cons are flawed and nintendo continues to ship the defective line as standard issue in switch and switch lite     
231,5.0,                       i m quite pleased with my brand new switch  i specifically got it because i am a fan of animal crossing and was happy i got to snag one on amazon before they sold out  it works like a normal switch and i actually sold my old one just to get this beauty     this switch is a special edition and i hope they release more for the people that actually want it  please avoid resellers        
232,1.0,                    compre la switch por amazon com services llc y al momento de conectar al televisor no funciona y al reclamar la garantia me indican que no pueden hacer nada  tenia fe de que al comprar por aca tendria mejor soporte y aseguraba una compra de calidad pero no  viendo que ahora me toca quedarme con un nintendo defectuoso hubiera preferido pagar casi el doble en alguna tienda de electrodomesticos donde si aplicaria la garantia sin ningun problema  lastima que siendo una pagina tan buena para compras no ayuden con la garantia ni te den soluciones al equipo defectuoso         
233,5.0,                       good console if you can get it for msrp  it took me weeks of trying to buy before i was able to get through the checkout process with all the scalpers buying them up within minutes   don t pay over msrp  the shortage is temporary      
234,3.0,                       does not come with animal crossing  which was the whole reason we purchased this one  my kids and i were very disappointed  it s only animal crossing themed  it s in fine print on the box  but i missed that when purchasing as far as the switch goes  we like it a lot  i would suggest they allow individual time limits for each user  instead of one global time limit      
235,1.0,                       the switch only costs         if purchased from a reputable person so don t pay exorbitant prices   and especially not for a used or refurbished system      
236,3.0,                       had since february  lightly used but now my left joy con won t charge tried the troubleshooting steps on their official website still nothing i also have a standalone charging base for my joycons and it won t charge either  seeing online this is a common issue  opened a repair request ticket with nintendo which advised me to wait until they contact me to ship it to them and once they get it  may several weeks to fix it  bummer i had just got animal crossing too and i  can t play it with one joy con and i refuse to buy another one for    dollars  didn t realize how poor quality nintendo has become i ll be sending animal crossing back and hope since it s no point in having it now
