0,1.0,                       horrible quality  waist of money after waiting so long   dont waist your money      
1,1.0,                       i have ordered   boxes from modenna and have received diffrent packaging that are not in a box or say modenna  i ve returned those because they are diffrent quality the nose strip does not bend easily like the ones that come in a box that says modenna  i m very frustrated and confused why this happens if i m ordering from the same company  modenna disposable masks  and the price also keeps changing      
2,1.0,                       very cheaply made   string break off very easily     
3,3.0,                       i ordered several different mask types from amazon   although i m sure these are fine for whatever setting they were originally made for  i don t exactly feel safe with these on when i m out   there is way to much air that escape and way too much air i feel coming in on the sides   i suppose it is better than nothing but i ve opted for more secure masks      
4,3.0,                       the product seems fine for the purpose  i specifically chose this vendor to order from because of the statement that it was not shipped from china  i look at the product s box    made in china  grammar translation on sides of box is poor  will use the masks because they are hard to obtain  but disappointed in misleading information  if you are looking for a made in usa product  this is not it      
5,5.0,                       great deal  great quality  not one has had a strap rip off  very satisfied with the product  i have bought   boxes so far and highly recommend them      
6,1.0,                       this are nowhere near the comfort and quality of those blue doctor looking masks  i found these black masks to be very uncomfortable on my face and flimsy  i had to adjust it several times while in store  the material is also super light weight  and frankly wont block much i also just noticed the name of this company  not sure if they are trying to get people to think they are moderna  anyway  not happy with this purchase  i will be donating these since they were headed for the garbage  save your money and try another product      
7,1.0,                       the ear loop breaks off as soon as you put it on your ear  the majority of the masks in the box had that same issue  can t return them  very disappointed  they break down it just is very frustrating  as i was walking into the doctors office and looping it on to my ear it broke off  do not recommend     
8,1.0,                       these mask only looks exactly like the ones that are given to folks walking in for routine treatment at mass  general hospital but they do not perform anything like the mass  general masks   that is  one cannot compress the nose piece on this mask to conform to ones nose to create a seal   it just bounces back to its original shape   when i inhale with this mask  the mask itself does not compress like identical looking ones  which indicates that air is entering through the mask fabric instead from around it   exhaling is the same  i e   the air from my breath goes around the mask in contrast to the ones the hospital provides me when i go for routine treatment   i regret buying this product      
9,3.0,                           that these are good quality but non medical  it s probably why they don t show a photo of the box    which read non medical      
10,5.0,                       did the light and breathe test and these passed both   masks are comfortable  cover my face from nose to under chin  i ve had no problems with ear straps detaching  just wish i had ordered more  c   continues in community spread      
11,1.0,                       these masks don t fit securely around the entire face  they are not medical grade so basically you re covering your face with a few layers of tissue paper  i m returning these      
12,3.0,                       i ordered these in may and i imagine there was a rush to get masks into production  but they were both excessively expensive  how do you spell  price gauging    and had an extremely high rate of breakage   i d say one of four either already had a broken elastic ear strap or it broke as soon as it was pulled   such poor quality and expense taints this company permanently      
13,2.0,                       while the product is inexpensive  the material is abrasive after     day wear  nor do i find it to be comfortable breathing in it after   hour of use      
14,4.0,                       paid a mint but what can you do in the middle of a pandemic overall decent quality and meet the basic requirements for public use  there is no sugar coating that these will not protect you from getting  covid    but meet the standards of the wearing minimizing the spread      
15,1.0,                       we ve had a quality issue where the ear loop pulls out with minor pressure  the first ones out of the box were fine  but now we re about halfway through the box and most every mask is useless in the first wearing with the ear string detaching from the mask  useless without the ear loops of course   not recommended      
16,1.0,                       i am not happy with the quality of these masks   the straps break very easily   i must always carry an extra one with me because i am not confident that the mask will last for even a short trip out to the grocery store or to the doctor s office      
17,1.0,                       this was made in china  box was damaged  but only slightly  not enough to send back  i would not have bought these is i had known where they came from       
18,5.0,                       lightweight and low breathing resistance for when you have to wear a mask all day for socially responsible public health protection   good quality and good fit      
19,1.0,                       i bought these to start double masking as i m high risk   i wore one under one of my cloth masks when going to a doctor s appointment and didn trealize how awful they were until the staff wouldn t let me in for my appointment unless i used one of theirs  when i got home i realized these measured       inches wider than the medical masks making them useless the pleats weren t able to expand and conform to your face  i tried adding an extra pleat  tying elastic ends  etc   air escapes from all sides      
20,3.0,                       i only use these for doing low risk activities  like walking outside  two masks had straps broken at the attachment point  but i also have a big face and i was hanging them below the chin  pulling them up when i see people coming  so maybe that stretch contributed  i ve been more careful taking them on off after those two incidences and it has been ok  so i would suggest carrying an extra mask just in case this one breaks and don t pull on the straps too hard      
21,5.0,                       i throw these in all my cars in case of times i forget to bring a mask   they re actually pretty comfortable and easy to breathe with while worn   i re use them a few times but too many times and the material eventually breaks down and makes your nose itchy      
22,2.0,                       wish i would have read all the reviews instead the first page of them  these are cheaply made and don t fit the face   cheek area very well  they leave an      open gap  so it s not really masking much at all  the final negative mark is that the box said  made in prc   a sneaky way to say  made in china    junk      
23,2.0,                       straps keep breaking on every mask     
24,1.0,                       these are so thin two boxes of     masks stacked on top of each other are barely higher then a us made level   box with    masks or for that matter a box of    chinese made masks  that says it all  they are also smaller and thinner then any mask i have purchased from china either in country or outside  this is not a mask you would want to bet your life on      
25,5.0,                       fairly priced and does the job   i got lucky that when i saw this it was priced at        per box   then a few days later it went up to        and then up some more   good thing it has stopped at          still a good price   i bought a couple of boxes to share with my family      
26,1.0,                       too small for adults  for little people or children only  does not stay under chin of an average size adult and i am        tall and     lbs  average at best a larger person than me could not even wear them  don t  waste your time   money      
27,2.0,                       the strap that goes on top of the ears detaches from the mask while putting the mask on  purchased   boxes since the price is reasonable but not happy with the straps  about   in   masks are having this issue      
28,1.0,                       sure they are comfortable if the strap doesn t pop off   so far   have had detached strings straight out of the box and several others have had the string pop off after pulling it over the ear  disappointed      
29,4.0,                       measured   inch  from left to right       inch  from top to bottom  chin  if not stretch    pleats  eyeglass didn t fog if you look straight   upward  but if you look downward   you breath it gives a slight fog  plastic nose clip is okay it molds your nose  breathable   elastic ear straps  i checked all the    pcs    it s good   no chemical smell  my husband used it for    hours inside an aircon building worked as a contractor he said this mask is okay  when wearing  white color is the side that has to touch your skin   the light blue is outside  i tried this  i wore the mask then blow air towards my palm then i barely felt the air in my palm  this mask is a bit thin but over all it s good   we got our order in   days delivered by amazon truck      
30,1.0,                       after wearing the mask for about    minutes i had to remove it  was physically scratching my cheeks and nose  the material used in these is terrible  might as well strap sandpaper to your face      
31,2.0,                       no white lining sewn inside the mask this time  i have ordered these two times  the first box had a white lining sewn in  this box they are all missing the lining  sending back for an exchange  hopefully they can supply the right ones next time      
32,3.0,                       the product is listed on amazon under  medical supplies   however  when my package arrived today  the first thing i noticed prominently printed on the box is  non medical   they are good to wear if you only want to comply with your state s requirement to wear a mask in public  but beyond that i would not rely on them for protection      
33,3.0,                       comfortable but way too big and one ear piece was bigger than the other on every single mask  i therefore can t wear them because it sits closer to one side of my face  off centered       
34,1.0,                       will fog my glasses even if i have them positioned all the way up and glasses leaning forward to prevent fog  never had an issue with the previous ones clearly these are poorly manufactured   nd issue the elastic band has ripped  x in a row and   didn t even come with the bands  look at the picture above for proof that the mask weren t even attacked with elastic bands  on one of my mask there is glue residue of sorts from applying the elastic band  other mask has no residue of any sorts showing that there were never any elastic bands attached  i ve only gonna through      mask so who knows how many more issues i ll encounter      
35,2.0,                       i m very disappointed   made in china   very flimsy  thinner than most blue paper face covers    metal strip doesn t stay in place when i bend it around my nose to form a seal thus creating small gaps which makes the mask less effective my advice is for you to purchase only masks made in the usa   they are now available      
36,4.0,                       i am pleased that these arrived within    days of my order  the quality seems good and they are comfortable to use  i needed these because of covid    precautions that i am taking and the virus is going no where till atleast a vaccine is successfully available to masses i would highly suggest that people buy this for yourself and your relatives each human life is precious  in asian countries  mask is used routinely and their successful in controlling the virus      
37,5.0,                       thanks for good face mask i know is really hard time get deliveries on time but i can tell the employees they re do excellent work i contacted the seller i get back right away have to wait but was excellent service thanks very much     
38,5.0,                       these mask did not disappoint  seem to be well made  the delivery time was very fast  it took just a few days to receive them  not weeks like other masks i ve ordered      
39,1.0,                       the fibers in this mask will become airborne and get in your breathing passages   if i mouth breath  for example  they get in my mouth   you can see the loose fibers when you look at the mask after usage  i would not use them  fearful of what is getting into my lungs      
40,1.0,                       needless to say  these are pricy but arrived quickly   however  not a single one had any earloops   and  yes  even the label describes placing  the earloops around the ears   lol      
41,3.0,                       these masks work really well when you can get them on   i dont know if the box i got was defective  but one out of every   breaks when you try to put it around your ear   but when they are on they work really well and are comfy      
42,1.0,                       i ordered a second box of these because obviously  i was happy with the first  the first thing i noticed immediately is that the coated material was now on the inside as well  that means it was folded instead of cut  it also means it s less comfortable  not as soft   they feel much thinner and lighter  i tried  the match test  and my breath did indeed affect the flame of the match  i m not sure these masks should be sold at all  i m not convinced that they re even safe  so they re going back to amazon for a refund    oh wait  make that an amazon gift card  which is completely wrong      
43,1.0,                       the first few times they were great and came as described  just ordered two more boxes and the white cloth side which is the reason i ordered these is gone  it s just solid black on both sides and not comfortable on my fave  not as shown in pics     
44,5.0,                       you ask for an honest rating and then sensor because of  sensitivity   really  your review board needs a reality check   these may cost a bit more than some other chinese made brands but hopefully the bands wont keep coming disattached  so far so good       
45,1.0,                       avoid this cheaply made product  all the ear holders fall off before you can even put them on  it s scary that you would trust this  i cannot tell that its actually   layers either      
46,5.0,                       so far so good  sturdy  was able to tie a small knot in each piece of elastic to better fit around my ears and face  no smell  if some ear straps break  so be it  i am an aprn and even the masks we get at work have had some ear loops that have broke  it happens  these will serve their purpose  i ordered another box      
47,5.0,                       i make my own masks but purchased these to have on hand for guests who do not brings one  also wear them outside as air quality is not good at this time   keeps my allergies from being overwhelming   then i use the nose strip and elastic on ones i make  after washing      
48,5.0,                       my third time ordering masks  ships very fast  our county just went to manditory masks so for a family of   i purchased     before the prices jumped back up      
49,1.0,                       i have to wear inside a cloth mask  otherwise it is useless  can serve as a filter within another mask  i have bought this type from a competitor and had no such strap problem  modenna ia a cheap surgical imitation  find another brand      
50,5.0,                       unlike other companies  this one delivered its product in record time and presented a well made mask for these stressful days  grateful  at     cents per unit for a one time only wearing  the masks are expensive but are much more comfortable than the very nice home sewen one i have been using      
51,3.0,                       they are okay   ear hook breaks easily first one broke as soon as i took it off an hour later   i tied it making it able to work to be able to get in the store  mask required   so is ingenuity     
52,5.0,                       i ve bought a couple packs of these and have been really happy with them  they re light and comfortable  i m a woman on the smaller side and they fit fine  and would fit a larger face too  too big for kids though      
53,1.0,                       i am a physician and have used face masks for many years  these masks are sub standard  the nosepiece is not made out of metal and is ineffective at making even a loose seal around one s nose   the masks slip off of one s nose easily  don t block respiratory droplets well and fog up glasses  i would not recommend these      
54,3.0,                       unlike these mask  but what i didn t like was that in just a week after i order these same mask  you went up on the price  it something to make a living  but this is uncalled for      
55,3.0,                       false advertising  it is not one size fits all  unless everyone is an xxl  you can use clips to adjust the make to make it ad snug as can be but it still isn t a perfect fit  i bought these for the convenience of grabbing on the go  to sit down with each individual one to adjust with my own non disposable clips  only to dispose of the mask and remove the clips  is a huge inconvenience  this isn t the first  one size fits all  package i have bought that is clearly meant for giants  if you have a large nose face then these will be perfect for you one thing i do like is the quality and feel  which is why i am giving   stars      
56,1.0,                       i am concerned upon opening the box i see non medical under modena disposable face mask   when i ordered them the photo of box did not have  non medical   i just looked as i would if i was ordering from amazon doesnot have  non medical  on the boxes pictured  why would i not want a medical grade facemask to fight covid      very disappointed  i feel very mislead by your description and picture of boxes  please be truthful      
57,1.0,                       upon opening package  i noticed that the box containing the mask list them as non medical and made in china  didn t give me a warm feeling that i did the right thing in ordering them      
58,1.0,                       i thought all these masks were pretty much the same   i was wrong  there are open gaps all around this mask that allows free air flow   no matter how much you adjust you get gaps along the sides and nose   also  the fit is very loose because there is too much slack in the ear loops   but that s not the main problem because even if you tie off the loops to make it not loose  you still have the gaps   if you want covid protection or want to not spread to others  don t get this mask      
59,1.0,                       if you are desperate for a made in china mask this will probably do   i have tried many masks over the years and this one is one of the worst   it does not hug the face well leaving gaps   nose bridge metal piece does not bend easily and retain bent form again leaving gaps   at over    cents mask this feels to me like price gouging in a difficult time      
60,4.0,                       now that the mask is must have  i think this is the best mask i bought for the price  although i m happy buying it but there still some disadvantages and i think same with other mask  the rubber band are easy to get detached so i m always bringing extra one of these which kind a hassle  this is less thicker than other you can buy but more comfortable since can wrap your face easily      
61,5.0,                       this is my second order of these masks  my first order cost         which was reasonable  and came packaged in a box as shown  they do have the metal bar over the nose to adjust fit  they fit comfortably  and as they should   and you can breathe in them  ordered for my son who works in retail  but use them myself for shopping  etc  also  the time shown for delivery is way off  my first order came early  this order said would not arrive until august  just ordered saturday and they are tracking to arrive tomorrow   and now at this price   hell yeah      
62,5.0,                       i am a repeat customer ordering this item and will continue to be  i m very satisfied and happy with the affordable price  quality of the product  security on how it s wrapped mailed  and it s speedy shipment  excellent      
63,1.0,                       very poor quality  slides all over  the ear rings tear off when moved oradjusted  they are quite frankly  useless i am a frequent amazon customer and i m very disappointed that it is sold on your site  the cost was        plus tax and i am requesting a refund  i don t want to lose faith in buying from amazon  i would like a response please  thank you  i can t return the product because dueto the pandemic i am unableto go out      
64,5.0,                       got mine today    stars for being exactly what they are described to be addressing a lot of the low ratings comments on here   they are not intended to be sterile but the bundle of    were in a sealed clear plastic bag inside the box   the elastic is comfortable and it the mask fit my large ish face  no broken elastic but they re only forty cents a piece  iow   disposable   i wouldn t be surprised if some of them broke off   they are not intended to be sterile  so expecting that is a little unreasonable   i got the brand as advertised   the box had a mfg  date  lot number  and expiration date printed on it      
65,4.0,                       nicely packaged in a box sealed with a sticker   the masks were comfortable to wear  it takes time to get the breathing down meaning at first it s hard to breathe out of but the more you wear it the more you get used to it   i feel protected while wearing this mask      
66,1.0,                       do not buy this product  i put it to a test with the mask on and a liter in front  i blew and the liter blew out  again do not buy this product      
67,1.0,                       these would be great if i had   ear but unfortunately out of the   if have attempted to use    were missing   ear loop and of the   that had both ear loops   of the elastics broke immediately   i wanted to like these   i love the black color   but the quality is garbage      
68,2.0,                       ok i gave them   stars when i first got them  now i give them   stars  about    of the    have broken before i even get to use them  always same side and when you go to put then on  plus you can t  breath through them at all  they just make you sweat  sorry but i would never but these or recomend      
69,2.0,                       don t waste your money  as other have said the straps are prone to detachment right out of the box  anywhere from   to   out of every ten break  rendering them useless  filters fine when you find one where the strap doesn t break or detach  at     waste on average  this is not a recommended product  avoid      
70,1.0,                       the box advertised does not say non medical yet of course the ones i received did  i purchased these masks for my father for father s day for his dental office because he s struggling financially to keep it open and cannot afford to keep ordering thousands of dollars worth of masks  now  fathers day is a few days away and i don t have the proper gift because he can t use these in his office  real shady to photoshop out the words  non medical  on the image description  smh      
71,5.0,                       i bought these masks at       per box  i think they are a bit higher now  they re entirely satisfactory and serve to throw the box in my car so i always have a fresh mask on hand      
72,3.0,                       purchased this item twice  first box had no problems at all  fit was good  no issues with straps breaking  and seemed to be good quality  second box is a different experience  only used about    masks so far and three had straps break off  fit is a bit different than the first box  the box itself was also slightly different  the first box had ce  fda and iso      printed on it  the second box had none of those things printed on it and the quality of the box changed      
73,5.0,                       happy with mask seems to work just fine  our state mandates you have to wear one in public so here i am  i like that you can mold to your nose   they delivered quickly also  hope there is not a need to have to order more because of covid crisis   however  would order again from here      
74,1.0,                       this product has a very strong chemical smell i left the box open so the masks can breathe for a while and the smell is persistent it smells like gasoline and melting plastic very hard to keep it on your face more than a few seconds  my nostrils were irritated amazon customer service was excellent in handling this issue for me      
75,5.0,                       looks like mine are fine  all in tact  didn t break  i have used one so far  does suck if you wear glasses  looking into ways to avoid fogging      
76,1.0,                       the ear loops broke after a slight tug   came unattached from the mask   and the bendable nose piece does not stay bent so it won t shape to my nose bridge and the air comes up and steams my glasses   at about     for    of them i find them extremely overpriced for the quality   don t waste your money      
77,4.0,                       i bought these because of the great reviews   i don t know if it s me  but they all seem to be too tight and i have a small face   i ve returned some from other sellers because of that   haven t decided what to do   i have one on now    trying to get used to it   i ve been wearing these disposable masks for months now   anyone else have this problem   can t imagine it fitting on a man      
78,3.0,                       my doctor gave me a handful of the shaped ones  but i used them up  i preferred those to these because my glasses get fogged up easier with these  and then the last one of these i was going to use had a detached strap   i m using cloth now and that s better than either  still keeping some of these modennas in the glove box in case i forget my other mask at home      
79,5.0,                       i keep a box of these in my truck to wear as a backup under my reusable cloth masks when i have to leave my home and go to the grocery  super comfortable  update  i see many people complaining about their masks not having the white inside lining  my masks do have the inside white lining  white inside  blue outside      
80,1.0,                       these are made in china  i spent over an hour looking for a product made in the u s a  i had even filtered out any other countries  now  i am stuck with a box of face masks that look flimsy and i do not trust      
81,4.0,                       these were a great price and seemed to be a decent quality  not thick but does the job  the only thing is  i work in the medical field and order these kind of masks all the time  in various brands and this is the first time that i ve gotten ones that are not a standard size  these are actually quite large and i had to knot the ears to make them fit snugger      
82,2.0,                       i was led to believe that these masks were of a good or even better quality than most that were offered for the price  i received them quickly and was pleased  however  upon use i was soon disappointed  i put three new masks  in a plastic storage bag to have handy when i needed to go to the grocery  i took two into the store with me  when i attempted to put on the first one inside the store  the top left string just came off   i took out the other one and it too had a bad unattached string  i ended up having to tie the broken string onto the top of the mask  it was the only thing i could attempt to do at that time  i m sure it looked pretty chintzy  but i had to have on a mask  very disappointed and now i have    of them  i checked the box of them when i got back home  there were several masks with the strings just unattached  others will probably come off upon attempting to wear  very disappointed especially since face masks are becoming the norm at this time  will need to check a different supplier hopefully with better results      
83,1.0,                       these took over a month to get to me  when i received them the strings on a third of the package were already broken  these are very thin and i always need to bring     to work with me  i also have to be super delicate or the string snaps when i put them on      
84,1.0,                       the straps break right off  in my opinion they garbage      
85,5.0,                       theses disposable face mask are as good a quality  better in some cases  as any disposable mask that you would have saw or got in your doctor hospital before covid    and now  they come sealed in pack of    and sealed pack in a box that is also got a seal on it at a time where getting disposable mask in under   days  instead of maybe almost   months  and at a reasonable price for the time we are in thru amazon  i truly appreciate and will be recommending      
86,5.0,                       i use them regularly  i use the same one for some time and then toss it when it breaks or has a problem  i go through maybe two per month as i don t use them all the time  i may use one for an hour or two  then back home  and don t need it until i go out again  which may be a week or more       
87,5.0,                       so  the masks themselves are good  though in my first    i had two of them break on me on first use  elastic band detached on one side on first attempted use   it seems these are coming from different sources at different times so that s really the thing to watch for  get them when there s prime shipping  i saw    packs at home depot for    bucks  so for    or less the price is right      
88,1.0,                       defective  returning these as they are missing the extra white polypropylene filtration layer advertised   i ve gotten these before and these are not the same masks  buyer beware      
89,1.0,                       do not waste your time or money on this  thin material  bad workmanship  amazon should not allow this garbage on their site      
90,5.0,                       items came in about   weeks  modenna is a s distributer in the us   product comes out of china   you need to note if their items are in stock   if so you should get timely delivery as i did   the product  is blue on once side and white on the other with a covered plastic nose piece   the seems around the mask are all molded and the ear straps are all well attached   we have used several and we find them comfortable to wear  will  reorder when needed from them     
91,1.0,                       make sure you always carry   extra masks with you because they pop easily  sometimes when you re trying to put them on for the first time  they are horribly made  i want a refund  but my family and i have gone through most of the masks in a week because they keep popping  so i have no product to return  waste of money  p s  my friend bought the same masks and had the same issue      
92,4.0,                       they are exactly what they say  people who complain about them have clearly never worn a face mask before  the elastic isn t amazing quality but it does the job  the mask is just fine like any other one of course they are overpriced  but that s just the case for any face masks today don t listen to people that say that quality is bad  they clearly have no idea of what a disposable face mask looks like      
93,5.0,                       wear one everyday so does my family  bought two boxes and ordered two more  these masks are of good quality and allergy free  i am a frontline worker and wear masks all day long and very sensitive to masks not well made or if good quality and with these masks i have no allergies     
94,5.0,                       worth the money because safety is what we need right now  good quality for my family and they are sturdy as far and the ear hooks will not break      
95,2.0,                       i ve used about    and   have broken before even putting on  so     will break  i ll be returning for a full refund if i have more breaking  i ve used others at work and none have ever broke  in fact one broke in the midst of my shift      
96,3.0,                       some of the mask exhibit elastic not being securely attached to the mask  comes loose when pulling over ears also some do not have the metal nose piece or the metal is only on one side of the mask  and therefore not properly usable this being said  being able to use       out of the    is still okay for the price      
97,1.0,                       bad batch  elastic comes off  had to throw away most of the masks      
98,5.0,                       thsee are well made masks and much nicer than any we had seen locally  the price was very good   we use them daily  keep an extra one in each car   i found that i could wash them by hand in antibacterial dawn and wear them more than once   as seniors  we re not out a lot but these are fine for trips to grocery store  doctors  and other errands      
99,3.0,                       the black coating removes any softness from the fabric paper  these felt rough and scratchy compared to our typical blue masks   they should work fine especially when double masking    but they aren t as good as others      
100,2.0,                       i repurchased the black mask because i thought they were extremely comfortable and lightweight to wear at work all day  however i was saddened when i opened up my new pack to see that the quality had changed  the black mask no longer have the white lining on the inside so now it s extremely flimsy  almost feel like i have to wear to mask with this new box      
101,5.0,                       they are usable up to   hours and then they must be disposed  but i will tell you  as an rn  i like these much better than cloth masks   you are able to breathe   during covid    they are the best in my opinion   and    they are triple layered      
102,4.0,                       good quality  not sure what others who were unhappy received  but was expecting  based on some comments  to be disappointed  i wasn t at all displeased  received sooner than promised what s the big deal about being made in china  i always look for made in usa  too  and am willing to pay more for usa  but none available   i hope this coronavirus has shown how unwise depending on other countries  for critical materials is  but    for now  it is what it is   if you are  drowning  you grab the first hand offered      
103,1.0,                       china made   labeled  not for medical use   disappointed since my search criteria was  made in usa  and  medical grade disposable face masks  for a high risk family member when going to doctor appointments      
104,1.0,                       has a weird smell to these masks don t think i am going to wear them     
105,5.0,                       wow totally impressed   was expecting a lesser quality due to the other reviews but i think the manufacturer has improved the thickness of the product in the last few months  these have to be medical grade because they appear to be the same thing as what i got from dr  they also seem to be thicker than other masks i had  i had masks the doctors office and the feel of the fabric along with the smell of the mask is identical  the smell of a mask really is key to its quality  it has the same smell as the masks i got from my dr  the color was typical blue and white  the elastic bands looked identical in attachment to the mask  the top has the wire ridge that allows you to conform it to your nose  it also is layered so you can spread it open across your nose and mouth  just as the photo  they arrived in a plastic bag inside a box that was taped shut  to be extra cautious i put the whole bag on the dashboard of my car to let the sun and heat kill off anything  but that was my own choice  nothing about the masks made me think i had to take this extra step  i ve been wearing them in closed environments from grocery to errands  no issues      
106,1.0,                       i was very disappointed that the elastic attaching the mask on the first several masks i took out was detached  making it unusable   for the masks where the elastic was initially attached  most of them had at least one elastic detach upon putting it on making it unusable   i was very sorry i ordered them   a complete waste      
107,1.0,                       when i received the package it was all smashed  that wasn t the real problem though   so far   out of six of the masks  that i have tried to put  on the strings have broke  not a good product   very bad quality  i would return them if i didn t have to go all the way across town to do so  very disappointed      
108,1.0,                       the stretchable ban on these mask break off as soon as you put it on   they are not bonded at all well   do not buy the first   we tried broke in less than   minutes      
109,3.0,                       fyi     these came in from china     
110,5.0,                       i ll probably buy some more from this seller  the masks are not too thin not too thick  it s an average mask  quality is good enough for everyday use      
111,2.0,                       cheaply made and tiny  doesn t measure up to others that i ve purchased via amazon  the maker couldn t spare another     to  inch of cloth to make it fit properly    picture provided was misleading      
112,1.0,                       i almost never write reviews on products i purchased  in this case i felt i had to because this is the worst value i have ever received in a product  the elastic pulls away from the mask after one or two times of putting it on  if you spend anything on this product you are wasting your money      
113,1.0,                       i m so hurt  we live in a hot spot and has lost family members  i was so happy and comforted by finally being able to order masks for my family and elderly mom and these things are a joke  we would have to restitch every single one for them to even work  the strap breaks before you can put it on  how dare you do this to people at such a serious   deadly time    shame on you     
114,2.0,                       these are not modenna brand and are only   ply  not   ply   will use as a back up as not worth the effort to return   if you want to send   ply modenna as represented as a good will gesture  that would be nice update   seller refunded the purchase price  very responsive to my issue      
115,1.0,                       these mask are not good   i should say the straps are bad  they break off  everyone has been breaking off   would not order again      
116,3.0,                       the string part snaps often  i usually carry extra in my bag  but it happens about half the time i m wearing them   one time i lent an extra to a friend who forgot their mask   and it embarrassing broke while they were wearing putting it on other than  the string snapping off   the material and fit to my face is fine  the mask is  efficient otherwise      
117,1.0,                       i bought these bc i thought they were made and sold in the united states first of all then i open the box to see they are made in china   nd complaint if they are from china they should be dirt cheap but they are almost a dollar per mask  isn t that price gouging    either want more masks  a cheaper price or some local masks that i feel more safe using      
118,1.0,                       all    in the pack i ordered or missing the nose clip  these are basically worthless to to me as i won t wear them without that      
119,1.0,                       not happy with the quality of this order   many of the masks were missing one of the ear straps      
120,5.0,                       i was wearing cloth face masks and getting a rash because they were too warm in the summer   i bought these and even though it is now winter  i m not going back to the cloth masks   i find these lightweight and the elastic is comfortable around my ears   the mask fits comfortably on my face      
121,1.0,                       wouldn t buy again due to poor quality of ear loop attachment  they re glued on and not very effectively  otherwise mask size is ok   as other reviewers stated they are thin  but i can t tell if they have the   advertised layers  nor their effectiveness  they were one of the highest rated masks available in late april for early may delivery   i noticed the price has dropped by     since then  as have most mask prices   but i still wouldn t purchase again      
122,3.0,                       came i day  late  but still fast  the masks look good but state non medical on box i would send back but using as a second maskvover my kn         
123,5.0,                       these masks were on the early side of on time  delivered in a well wrapped box  the masks were in a  sealed zip lock bag inside they fit well and are easy to breathe in  ear loops are quite secure  nice long flat metal nose piece allows a real custom fit i got them for     and would love to reorder at that price  but even at     they re better than a lot of the competition  don t have to wait a month for delivery  either  mine came in   days      
124,1.0,                       the ear loop breaks off the face make making this product is useless     
125,2.0,                       i got this masks package only one week after i ordered it  i appreciate the shipping and it really helps because i need to wear it during the work  but the quality was not good enough  one of the was broken before i got it out from the bag  there were more than five of it broke down just because i was adjust the spot  i only used one finger and put the sting on my ear and it broke down  if this mask is tightened with my life  that s not acceptable      
126,5.0,                       these are great masks  and my husband   i plan to wear them under our homemade cloth masks for added protection  very easy to breathe in  good coverage  and the elastic and nose fitting piece are efficient and comfortable      
127,1.0,                       these masks are junk  you ll break off three of the elastic bands before you ll get one to work  i would not recommend this product to anyone     
128,5.0,                       these masks shipped super quickly  they are a great value and are very comfortable to wear  they don t pull on my ears at all  i like that it has the adjustable metal piece at the top to help ensure a better mask  my    year old also was very comfortable wearing these and he hates masks      
129,2.0,                       i have a small face head and these are way too big  so i have to tie knots on the elastics to make them fit  they fit my husband but he has complained he s constantly having to pull it up as it slips below his nose these have a bit of a chemical smell  and when i had to wear one for over an hour i had broken out in a rash all over my face we re now putting them inside fabric masks and using them as a liner      
130,5.0,                       fits my smaller face good  all the fabric made masks too big for me   would buy again      
131,3.0,                       they re cheap but you get what you pay for  price wise they re overpriced so you re really paying for the quick delivery  cheaper options are available but the deliveries are in the   to   week range      
132,1.0,                       i don t usually leave reviews but i feel like i need to this time  these are terrible  i don t know how they have such a high rating  every single masks ear strings rip off instantly  or were already broken in the package  i did not even use any force to stretch the strings  i had my friends try as well  all instantly broke  when the first one that worked was wearable for   minute before tearing  it was comfortable         but yeah totally unusable  dont buy these unless you wanna waste your time and money      
133,5.0,                       these seem legit and comfortable for everyday use to grocery or work more breathable then fabric but not so cheap that if seems worthless seems like quality that they could use in a surgery   good price and good quality     
134,1.0,                       i wanted to have these as back up for when washing my cloth masks or just to give them away  well i m very disappointed i ve used   so far and on all of them the straps have detached with in minutes of putting them on  also the wire piece that goes over the nose doesn t bend at all  leaving the sides opened  un protected  why even bother       
135,3.0,                       i got two boxes the price was kinda cheap but you get what you pay for the quality isn t very good but i think it get the job done when you are outside  the earloops are kinda fragile and break a bit easily      
136,1.0,                       these are nothing special and not medical quality  i am a nurse and purchased these for family and friends  it s subpart quality for a higher price  i can really but the same or better quality for less     
137,1.0,                       not buying it again      
138,5.0,                       the product came nicely package   in a box and inside the box its wrapped in a plastic   i can say decent for the price   guess the material used is better than other masks being sold online   i am waiting for the next price drop so i can order the same   guess if it will be sold for     per box  the sale will increase more   i can see that more than      people made their review  with the price drop  this will surely go trending   seller should consider this      
139,4.0,                       these blue colored disposable masks are made from china and has expiration date on nov           months from manufacture date   price is       free shipping   others are higher     or more  and yet im sure theyre all the same quality  masks came in a bundle of   s  in a clear plastic pack and in a mask box  box came clean   not dented  mask came clean  no stains  ear loops were intact  tried one of them  smell is like any other mask from manufacturer  a little chemical smell which is probably from the material used and color dye of the mask but otherwise not harmful to the lungs  i dont think this mask is   layered  its a little thin compared to medical grade you buy from medical supply or cvs pharmacy which is a little thicker  if youre sensitive to the smell in the mask  air the masks first for      days  im ok w  this purchase  whats impt is that you have a face covering and to prevent you from touching your eyes  nose  mouth w c can be portals of entry of any virus  not just covid    these masks are sold by modena and fulfilled by amazon  prime amazon delivery is on point  ordered       delivered       if i need more masks ill order from modena      
140,1.0,                       half of the masks in the package are worthless   i attempt to put them on very  very carefully  but the bands come off the masks anyway   didn t even wear them for   second   the bands practically fall off just picking up the mask  that bad my girlfriend gave me some similar masks   and i can put those on  and take them off many times without the rubber straps ever  breaking   never no way would i buy these again or recommend them   junk  garbage     
141,5.0,                       the face masks had quality packaging and arrived on time   the price was more than fair as similar masks are much more expensive  i would reorder if needed      
142,2.0,                       i am a nurse and work in a hospital so i know masks and these are poor quality masks   they have a poor fit on the face  the metal piece doesn t work well so the ability to get the mask to conform to the face isn t good   while they are light weight  they seem too light weight and poor quality   i would look elsewhere if wanting to purchase face masks      
143,5.0,                       in this covid    era  there s a lot of masks out there  i used cloth masks primarily  and one day had to visit a hospital to do some consulting work  i was given a mask like this as that was the only mask they allowed in for visitors  no gaiters  no cloth masks  etc   and i realized instantly how comfortable this style is on your ears  and how much easier it is to breath in    degree weather  and you can buy this style mask almost anywhere these days  but for me  i was happy to grab them off amazon for ten bucks less than any comparable retail price for a box of    in an unprecedented time  where we all must do our part to keep our neighbors safe  these masks make thing a little more comfortable  this review can probably apply to     other amazon listings  as i m pretty sure these masks come out of the same factory as most of the other similarly priced ones  and just have a different logo on the box  so honestly  buy the cheap ones  when i purchased  that was modenna      
144,3.0,                       i have purchased several boxes about     since the pandemia started  once in a few one strap will brake not even stretching it that much and been new never worn   today back to back more than   masks strap bursted   i gave up and used another box from another brand  first annoying  second waste of money and third every mask is needed since we can t find many around      
145,1.0,                       when wearing the mask the string falls off from the attachment point this happened on about    of them out of the    i have used so far       
146,1.0,                       didn t know disposable masks we re so flimsy  if i use these  i ll wear two at a time  but really  i feel better protected wearing my bandanna as a face mask  order only if you can t find a reusable mask  arrived in   days  which was the estimated delivery date      
147,5.0,                       i like to wear this disposable face mask under my cotton mask to double up with  it is comfortable  has a nose piece that you can adjust to make the mask for your face  will reorder when i run out      
148,2.0,                       the quality of these masks are not the same as the originals modenna masks i ordered a couple of months ago  these masks are thinner and bigger  so much bigger i have to tie a knot in the ear string to fit but they still don t fit snug around face like the others one did   also a lighter shade of blue compared to other ones   i don t think these masks are the same product as previously ordered  other than the box is the same      
149,1.0,                       what i received is not what s described  i  want black masks with white lining     
150,5.0,                       they pass the lighter test  they past the water test  these are as good as it gets      
151,5.0,                       very good fit  they don t hurt my ears or nose  so far every metal nosepiece is in place and working  these are some of the most comfortable masks i ve bought for wearing over long periods of time  and they are well priced      
152,1.0,                       i would recommend not buying  i m no strongman  but half the time i put these on  i break the elastic that holds these masks to one of my ears  then the mask is useless      
153,5.0,                       they don t have a weird smell and it doesn t seem like the elastic will break easily unless you stretched it really hard and fast  i have a smaller face head and these still fit me but my      partner can wear them too      
154,1.0,                       these are overpriced and cheap  the strap has pulled free on the first   i have tried      
155,1.0,                       junk   nose piece is flimsy and will not conform to face leaving big air gaps  made in china   inside gets fuzzy and itchy after very short period of time   straps break easily   total waste of time and not safe        
156,2.0,                       the elastic ear pieces oten break when putting them on so be sure to have several masks for backup  you don t want to be caught out somewhere when it decides to break  probably won t buy these again      
157,5.0,                       i was extremely grateful to be able to get facemasks during the difficult time dealing with this virus  they are made of good material with a wire across the top to bend over the bridge of the nose  i expect these will help provide safety against breathing impurities as well as exposing germs to others  i know lots of at risk people and senior citizens that were going without one  i bought these to give out to them and my family  thank you modenna for making these available  i hope they continue to offer them so i can purchase more to donate to more people  i recommend this product and company      
158,1.0,                       half of the masks in the box  from china  fall off very easy   these are garbage don t buy them you will regret it     
159,3.0,                       i gave this a   star because of the price and the presentation  when i received and open the package it was individual packs   i guess i was expecting it would be in a box since it s    pcs   and   of my packs were open so i have to count and make sure it was     product is good quality and it would be very useful with this pandemic      
160,4.0,                       several of our family members  particularly those that wear glasses  prefer the disposable masks to cloth reusable masks   these are no exception   the only complaint is that they are slightly less tall than similar masks we have received in healthcare facilities so they don t sit as far under the chin   though the nose wire is thinner than some other masks we have found them to work perfectly and hold form around the bridge of the nose well   i think we will look for a brand next time that is a little bigger  but these are more than adequate and have an exceptional price      
161,5.0,                       great masks  they do not break at the elastic part like most others  really a must have to stay safe      
162,1.0,                       i have had several different paper masks and have not had a problem with any of them   these are large  even when twisting the elastic   the corners dig into your face and the paper is really stiff  making it not fit well at all   i wore one for about    minutes and all i did was adjust it  trying to bend the corners over so it stops digging into my face   my face still hurts    min later      
163,2.0,                       there is no box just in the plastic bag  and you can smell terrible something  that s not good quality mask      
164,1.0,                       these are absolutely the worst mask i have purchased   the bands break just barely touching them   i gently touch band to go behind ear it snaps off   horrible   the only option is to try to hot glue the bands or throw em away   waste of money   not happy at all       
165,1.0,                       these are poorly made masks  most were stretched out  the little metal strip for the nose is very flimsy  break easily and didn t even fit the size of the mask  short   on all most all of my masks the metal strip is sewed into the stitching  making the mask uncomfortable      
166,5.0,                       arriving within reason considering civil delays and back orders     works well as a covering to help prevent catching colds  caughs  flu and this lingering virus     can use two or three days then dispose in trash     good product        
167,1.0,                       we bought   different brands of   layer disposable face masks  and this particular brand  modenna face mask  was the thinnest it is definitely a one ply mask  false advertising description  this mask feels like it was very cheaply made  with low quality materials with the other two brands  you can feel the different layers between your fingers   this brand  modenna face mask  is not   layers  you can see through this mask and you cannot feel any more than one layer the ear loops are thinner than a small rubber band and was very flimsy  the front back of the mask is indistinguishable  and again  you can see through the mask there is also a very petrol chemical smell to the mask  but when we opened the sealed box and let the masks air out for about an hour  the smell did dissipate and was not as strong  we are very disappointed with this purchase and wish we could get our refund   this brand   modenna face mask  is a waste of money      
168,5.0,                       i put these to the test and they passed holds water cannot blow out flame light test does not catch fire     
169,1.0,                       it wasn t a good sign that the very first mask from the box i put on and the elastic broke  basically rendering the mask useless  very disappointed that these are squares instead of the typical shape of a functional face mask  will not be ordering these again      
170,2.0,                       if your shopping for price  this is your face mask   i assume this mask serves the purpose  who knows these days  but the fit and finish leaves the impression of hasty manufacturing and the material seems flimsy i ve had better  masks but those are not available as of now      
171,3.0,                       these came pretty quickly  however  these are paper thin  was expecting more for    ply   my mom is a nurse and had brought me home a few basic surgical masks  and those were thicker than these and considered   ply  kinda disappointed  as these i ll need to double up so i ll go through twice as fast      i also noticed on the box that it says non surgical grade which isn t what i was looking for  lesson learned   these are also pretty big  so i need to tie smaller loops for the ear loops  for a tighter fit      
172,2.0,                       having used these now for a bit  i d say don t purchase them unless you ve a very small flat face   the band in the top for adjusting to your face is not all across and adjusts very poorly   cheap imitation  caveat emptor      
173,5.0,                       these masks are very comfortable  i appreciate the lightness of the product  if you re not going the  reusable mask route   these are great alternatives  i would definitely buy these again      
174,1.0,                       these are not the modenna brand masks  a cheaper  less well made version  see picture of what i received versus what i should have received      
175,3.0,                       we used this box for almost   months now its clean and good quality however  ear loops are too short and i cannot use it for more than    minutes      
176,5.0,                       great quality   i received quickly  sooner than expected actually   the elastic is comfy around the ears   so glad i ordered  does the job   thank you        
177,1.0,                       non medical  if not medical what good are they for protecting my    year old father   if it is hidden inside the description you should have made it clear and obvious        
178,5.0,                       price was good  quality is sufficient and delivery was quick which given the circumstances make this an outstanding company product      
179,5.0,                       i m no doctor or scientist  but i didn t find anything wrong with this product  besides a little upset that this was double the price when i purchased it  compared to now  ha      i didn t do any hard core testing like ripping it apart and test each layer  etc  but the mask layers feel pretty  sturdy  to me  my father did put water on it just to see if it would absorb seep through  and it didn t  so i guess it should be able to block big droplets of saliva if any should be coming at us  or prevent them from going out   i hope     there is a little paper slip in chinese that came with it which stated that the product passed inspection and the materials used  etc etc   i know some of you don t trust anything made in china  but really  there are recalls on stuff made here and elsewhere  too  if you are going to be distrustful then it might as well be with everything  can t trust labels  social media  etc etc  anyway  a couple of the masks did have fallen ear loop bands  but it was ok for me as i have a cloth mask which allows me to insert the mask in  so for the couple that had fallen bands  i just did that  an easy fix could be to staple the bands on the mask though  like some people already pointed out  it should hold  stay safe      
180,1.0,                       we ordered these facemasks and gloves for safety purposes   when we received our   items they were horrible   first  the facemasks had apparently been opened because they were all dusty and dirty looking inside the box   we threw them away  no one needed to have them so returning them was not an option for us   plus the gloves we ordered were yellow and old looking   we are using those because we were desperate for gloves to use with our ill patient who recently had surgery we have been very  very good customers for many years   and these items were just a rip off in price  and quality   we are not asking for our money back  but we wanted you to know we are very dissatisfied with this order   these   items are difficult to find in our area   but sending this horrible product is just not acceptable for long time faithful customers  you can check our account     sincerely  marion powell  email   tjpmppp aol com     
181,2.0,                       i received these a week  or so after ordering  i hate to give a bad review but these masks are made with such poor quality  every time i try to put a mask on the strap detaches from the mask and makes it impossible to wear  i have had to keep the mask on my face by holding it with my hand  inconvenient and annoying  now  i have to carry a few with me and test which one actually works for a while until it falls apart and i have to get a new one  skip      
182,3.0,                       each mask has an indescribable odor to it   i ve been using them as we have no choice  but if you can find a better option  please do      
183,1.0,                       on over     of them the rubber band on one side disconnects after a few minutes of use      
184,5.0,                       so far so good  been wearing them for about a week now  the straps break easily if you tug on them  but that is my only complaint so far  they are easy to breath with  which is great  but also means the filtration may not be too good  probably equal to a cloth mask  but aside from that they are pretty good      
185,5.0,                       easily dispensed out of the package as i m heading out  delivered fast  breathable and i has asthma so that helps alot  love the adjustable part over the bridge of the nose too      
186,1.0,                       i repurchased these black masks specifically because of the double layers and white linning on the inside this second box i received is not as shown in the pictures  these masks are just one single layer  very flimsy and loose on the face and no white linning at all very disappointed  bad quality  i will be returning these      
187,2.0,                       disappointed  this mask has two deficiencies  compared to masks i was using      the baffles are cut too close  so the mask does not expand too much over the nose  mouth and chin  resulting in it feeling tight and uncomfortable against the nose      the all important wire to conform the mask to the nose is extremely weak  i can also say that the fabric is not as soft as what i had  but for me this is not so important  hopefully you can understand the problem from the photos and learn how to look for something better      
188,2.0,                       amazon sells this under medical supplies and it says right on the box  non medical   there should be a photo of the box for the actual product instead of a person dressed in medical uniform  they were not individually wrapped so they are unlikely to be as sanitary and germ free as you want  if you need something for show  so you can say you are covering your face this will work  if you want something that will keep you safe this may not      
189,4.0,                       i have not really used these yet but tried one on and loved everything about it  i will add more after more use  my reason for this review is because they arrived here   days earlier than they said  that s a good thing      
190,5.0,                       these are nice masks  but they are made in china  which i found to be a little misleading   since the ad said shipped from usa   i guess i should have looked closer at the fine print  i will not buy them again  considering the chinese communist party is the reason we all need masks        
191,1.0,                       something in these masks  in this particular order  broke my face out  and i am not allergic to masks in general  a set of masks i bought from the same brand a few months ago did not have this effect on me  maybe this was a bad batch that had been sitting around for a long time or in less ideal conditions in a warehouse     
192,5.0,                       these masks are great  they fit better than any other mask i ve tried  they have a nice feature where you can mold it over your nose so your breath does not steam up your glasses  would highly recommend      
193,5.0,                       arrived quickly  my family is using it at emergency masks just in case they don t have their reusable ones  the packaging was interesting  they arrived in a bag and then my mom set up the box to place them in  they work alright though so no harm done      
194,3.0,                       compared to other masks substandard  doesn t conform to face well as well be breathing straight hair  interior feels rougher another masks      
195,5.0,                       great masks   i wasn t sure how good the quality of these masks would be but i am definitely happy with these   they came in a sealed bag within the original box   it says on the box that they re not medical grade  but i am an rn and these masks are as thick and sturdy as the ones we wear in the hospital      
196,5.0,                       a great company with great products  the masks are excellent and they arrived couple days early  do not be afraid of doing business with them  i would buy from them again      
197,1.0,                       don t waste your money on these mask they are so poorly made  the first stretch and the war loop snaps  at first i thought it was just one but after using a few they were all ripping from the ear loop     
198,5.0,                       i was so nervous to order these but they are excellent quality at a great price  they are exactly like the picture  they arrived faster than expected  cost less than      for each mask i will be ordering more for friends and family  i know it s not  recommended  but we spray these with     alcohol and wash these by hand with antibacterial soap then hang dry this let us get more uses out of them and these masks held up perfectly with hand washing        
199,5.0,                       i bought a box of these a year ago and am still using them  they wash well in a laundry bag  they are as comfortable as any mask  and fit tightly      
200,3.0,                       the first time i ordered these  they were awesome  they had a great filter  i felt safe  the adjustable nose piece was sturdy  my son wore them everyday to high school and had zero problems with his glasses fogging  we just ordered our second set and it s awful  the masks don t have the white filter layer inside  i almost feel like they forgot to put it in  they masks are thin and flimsy  the nose piece is floppy and ineffective  i don t feel safe at  all  it s a shame that this company is so inconsistent  i really did like the first set we ordered      
201,5.0,                       we like these face masks  they are great for our trips when there are a lot of people  such as the grocery store  i keep some in a zip lock bag in the glove box of our car  however   i think they were a little pricey      
202,4.0,                       i needed to go to the medical center  for an mri and needed masks to leave my house   these were fine   the elastic ear bands weren t very stretchy   but they were cheap enough that i could carry extras      
203,2.0,                       on my reorder  i received a different product in the same box  there is no longer a white liner and the wire on the nose was a lower quality  i will not reorder these      
204,3.0,                       i was hoping this mask would fit me  i have a smaller adult face and it did not  my husband will be able to use them  they were nicely packaged inside and out      
205,5.0,                       perfect for my needs   i have seasonal allergies also asthma  these really help when working out in the garden  and when using cleaning products    i also use in my craft room when using anything with an odor      
206,4.0,                       i only wear paper masks as i read they provide the best protection and i believe that  this is the perfect mask to wear  i have the blue ones which fit perfectly but the blacks one are a little loose on my face  simple solution  i just twist the straps before i put it on and once it s on my face  i fold the edges to close the gaps      
207,5.0,                       i was kind of weary about purchasing these based off some reviews  but they re good  i didn t check all of them but i did spot check a lot of them and i didn t have anything break off like what others have experienced i m         lbs avg size head and had no issues with fitment and i am able to bend it shape contour it around the bridge of my nose  i could see how others had issues  but i have worn the same one for multiple days and it was fine  i may have gotten a good batch  but i would feel comfortable buying them again if i needed them      
208,4.0,                       they aren t n  s  so they offer only modest protection for the wearer  but they do help to keep from spreading the coronavirus via exhaled droplets   for most people  they would be perfect  but the distance to behind my ears is greater than most  so i have to staple the straps to the mask to keep them from pulling out   otherwise  perfect      
209,5.0,                       you know the drill  i ran out of disposable masks and needed to buy another box  i decided to go with black ones this time and i really like this  very comfortable and not too much pull on the ears but fits nicely  i ll be using these as solo masks as well as to double mask  and they fit their purpose      
210,5.0,                       these have been reliable  i wore one for weeks of off and on use where some friends had ones that broke during the first use  maybe i have a smaller head  the comfort behind the ears is bit uncomfortable  after long uses  i think it s just that there is constant pressure on the ear with this style mask  would and have bought again  fairly priced     
211,3.0,                       these masks are decent  however  the wire inside the nose bridge is very thin compared to other face masks of this type i ve purchased before   this leads to a very loose fit around the nose and the exhaled air just blows upwards out of the mask  which is especially annoying if you re wearing glasses   if the wire was more firm like other masks then you could mold it around your nose for a better fit      
212,5.0,                       yup    its a black     mask that will  save  your life    especially if its mandatory at your work place    not that i wouldn t wear one anyway  because wearing a mask  will save your life       
213,1.0,                       fake masks   your inhaled air will come from around the edges   your aren t breathing filtered air   your breath is not filtered on the exhale either   even clamping down the edges with my hands  i have to push   pull very hard to get air to go through them   if you believe covid is fake news   want to flip society off  but put up a good appearance   these are for you   hey save money   cut up a black garbage bag in a mask shape   it ll filter just as well as these   maybe the         reviews giving these       stars are shared among different moderna products   what i got is garbage   being returned      
214,3.0,                       we had to get masks  and there a lot of them to choose   i m starting with these   most of them are in my vehicle for emergencies and those that forgot a mask   this mask does not tighten over the nose enough and a few have fallen apart on the band to attach to the ears      
215,5.0,                       i have to say i m impressed  shipping was fast  masks came in box sealed in perfect condition at a great price  this is my  nd order from this seller and as long as they can hold prices as is i will purchase more  i don t understand the bad reviews at all  i ve done every test  they are   layer and by far thicker than what i ve bought elsewhere  this time the box was smaller but masks are same size  less bulk maybe  and there is no smell  none  the fact they come from china does not factor into my decision either  they are sealed in a sturdy box  and best of all i got them next day  they may not say medical grade on the box but they might as well be  legit item and seller  many many thanks  again       
216,1.0,                       i wasn t expecting much  if i m going to be honest  i figured they were gonna be a cheap  thin mask which they are  but i didn t expect them to be so poorly made  the elastic snapped on every single one i ve tried to put on thus far     of them  there are fifty in here  goodness  they re terrible  don t buy them  trust me      
217,1.0,                       first time purchase is the left mask   layers not bad comfy and covered my face well enough to buy  nd time  mask on right  the mask had one paper thin layer for my  nd purchase   i was surprised and upset  idk if that s how they are making them now or if it was just a bad batch  refund requested      
218,2.0,                       these masks are basic and probably do the job they are designed to do  they are conveniently packaged  five packs of    and each pack is resealable  this is convenient and hygienic  but the material is coarse and the part that should be secured around the nose bridge is rough  scratchy and uncomfortable  i also found that these masks tend to slip down and  as much as i did not want to touch my face or the mask   i was often having to adjust the fit      
219,1.0,                       both the box and the mask itself has a strong petroleum grease chemical smell  who knows what that is you are breathing in  string loops broke off within   seconds of putting one on  immediately returning      
220,5.0,                       i was thrilled when these masks arrived  locally i couldn t find masks anywhere   they are breathable so i don t feel like i m suffocating and i have a sense of protection   not sure what information regarding mask protection is true or false but i m very thankful for modenna    amazon s excellent customer service      
221,5.0,                       bought these a second time  works well as a shield  passed the test to see if they are good as a shield  all three sections      
222,1.0,                       these masks fit well enough and weren t too expensive but they all smell like someone used the entire package to wipe their sweaty stinky armpit with  cant wear them because they smell like a butt against your face  its pretty bad   at first i thought ok maybe i have really stinky breath  then i had other members of my family try them out and they all had the same result  and they brushed their teeth beforehand so that was not the problem  would have been great if they didnt smell like an ass crack     
223,4.0,                       elastic straps pop of the mask lining extremely easily i solved this with a drop of super glue on each of the four attachment points i pre glued several to avoid waiting for the glue to dry a sliver of tape would probably accomplish the same thing not ideal but it s workable the quality and fit of the mask itself is good      
224,1.0,                       so far  i am very disappointed in this product  the very first mask i put on one of the straps broke immediately  i chalked it up to well one out of    isn t bad  the very next one i put on lasted maybe half an hour before one of the elastic straps broke also if this keeps up i will be requesting a return and refund     
225,1.0,                       please do not order these masks they are useless  gaps on sides of masks             
226,1.0,                       amazon wants to hide the fact they are made in china  cheap and unacceptable masks    we don t want anything made in china        
227,5.0,                       if you wear glasses  there s a thin metal strip in each mask at the top  so you can push it to conform over your nose and cheeks  and that keeps it from fogging up your glasses  five stars just for that      
228,3.0,                       the elastic straps are larger than expected so the mask keeps sliding off   only way to hold it in place is to double loop the strap which makes it uncomfortable  you get what you pay for      
229,4.0,                       these masks are good for protecting yourself and others from germs  this is the second time i have purchased this brand but noticed a few of the masks slipping off the bridge of the nose  i have tightened the mask by pinching the nose areas and some of them still slip off  maybe a few of them are defective  not sure      
230,1.0,                       the first time i ordered i received a mask similar to the one of the pics  black on the outside and white on the inside  i ordered them again since i loved the material and received regular thin ones  i returned and re ordered  got the same black thin ones  how can i order the ones with the   ply white inside       
231,2.0,                       on my first order i received a boxed pack of masks just like the pictures  good quality and moldable nose piece  the second order i received was this unboxed pack of masks that felt cheap  and have this plastic piece around the nose that s barely molds  super happy with the first order  very disappointed with the second order  don t understand why i received different products from the same link ordered      
232,5.0,                       i have small face  my sister face is lager  they fit perfect  i don t like doing reviews  but so many times you guys review has helped me  theses are the best disposal face mask i have worn and the price is perfect      
233,4.0,                       these are fine but they break easily  the elastic detaches after one use  some came with the elastic detached already  they should be advertised as single use masks      
234,3.0,                       the nose bend doesn t work well  therefore you can t shape it to your nose properly  i use them instead behind a cloth mask due to this        
235,1.0,                       the masks were comfortable but hot aug             once i had a chance to wear these face masks i found them to be not a good product   i gave a few to a friend and he said everyone of them were defective   the ear loops came apart from the mask   i tried some and the  same thing happened   not worth the money  shouldn t have to repair them before you can wear them   i would like to have my money back but i suppose it s too late for that   i wouldn t recommend  them to anyone      
236,3.0,                       the masks overall were fine but my problem with them is that they do not fit well with an american adult   they would be fine i guess for a child but not for an adult from the usa   the masks were made in china  which i understood when ordering  but the size is just too small   this was a huge waste of money   when will masks be made in the usa become available sized for american adults    we need masks but all you can find at least fore now are ones made in china   i have nothing what so ever against china making them but come on  they at least must fit adults in the usa      
237,5.0,                       all    modenna masks arrived very quickly  all sealed and in perfect condition  they are comfortable and the loops fit easily over my ears  very pleased with the product      
238,5.0,                       this was the first time i ever considered purchasing a face mask  social distancing made it happen  i found the modernna mask in amazon  received very quickly  the mask has   pleats so it adjusts completely and comfortably over my face from nose to under the chin  a small wire embedded in the top of the mask assures a secure fit around the nose  lightweight and breathable are must features and the modernna mask is both note  after using the mask  have washed by hand in woolite detergent and  solar  dried outside for a day  this is high pollen season and the mask filters the pollen nicely   only used washed mask while cutting grass or working in garden on high pollen alerts      
239,5.0,                       it is so hard to get masks i wan t sure what i would receive  was very happy with delivery which was over a week earlier than projected  they are fine quality and will work well for the current need  face coverage is adequate and ear loops hold mask in place well      
240,4.0,                       the goal of using a mask in a box of masks is to remove the top mask with one quick smooth grasp that does not disturb or contaminate the masks below in the stack  it s likely the most elementary part of putting a paper medical mask on however  the addition of a large heat sealed bag is cheap and it could have been put on the outside of the box of masks for easy and permanent removal  but  this is a china  made box of masks there s virtually no way the folded paper part or the elastic ear loops can be improperly fitting  they are  as far as i can see  one size fits all   there is a very small metal nose contour piece and the pleats in the mask easily allow the mask to be pulled down from the bridge of the nose to underneath the chin securely i was able to remove the plastic bag from my huge pile of masks in the box  but that s not the way masks should be handled  regardless of use above all  please buy ppe and wear a mask until we are said to not need them by official health sources  these fit the bill  they just have one inconvenience the price is very low and good one last thing  i wouldn t know i wasn t using hospital medical grade masks if i hadn t bought them myself for home use and know the provenance is not the pre  pandemic supply chain for us hospitals   this means they seem to be good paper masks  i wear mine under a fabric mask  double masking is over     effective in stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus at the date of this review              best of health to each of you      
241,3.0,                       i expected better  but at the price i paid  i should not have expected more   i have seen many other similar masks that appear to be better quality  and now that demand is lower  so are prices      
242,1.0,                       poorly made  the elastic straps fall apart when trying to put the mask on      
243,4.0,                       only bought them to keep the  maskstapo  off my back at work and out in town   haven t got covid yet  so i guess they re working   oh wait  they re on my face to keep me from spreading what i don t have to other people   the mask manufacturers are loving this      
244,5.0,                       perfect fit for both myself and the husband  i m     with smaller face  he is       and medium large face  masks do not smell inside the mask  as some of our cloth ones did  super easy and comfortable to wear  with nose piece  makes it perfect fit the mask are too large for a child  our   year old   so disagree with reviewers who say it runs small only thing is   each mask is not wrapped individually  so not sterile      
245,5.0,                       this pack of    was purchase during covid     i like that it s a good price for     shipping took a few days more but was good to wait  like the feel of them not so heavy  see images for your help  would but again  i had based this off of buyers comments      
246,5.0,                       lightweight easy to breathe with dsnt really catch my stubble which is a plus  only realy reason i bought was because apparently we need one every where we go any how        
247,1.0,                       dont buy  these are a ripoff  very poor quality  the elastic that goes around your ear will break before you can even put it on the first time  at least half of them broke first attempt to put it on and were completely unusable garbage  if you are comparing these to other brands on amazon you should consider that only about half of these masks will be usable so you might factor that in to your pricing consideration      
248,3.0,                       not what i was expecting  i got three of them and one didn t have all fifty in it  plus it also irritates my skin if i m wearing it for couple hours  quality needs to be improved  but delivery was on time and they were sealed  hence giving three stars  i hope it helps       
249,2.0,                       i bought these because most everyone gave them a good review   the elastic seems to snap when i put one on   i can either throw them away or reinforce them   i wouldn t recommend buying them      
250,1.0,                       these masks are cheap and not well made  the straps come off easily and most were unable to be used  don t buy these      
251,4.0,                       item was as described  the outer box was not taped shut but the inner bag looked to be sealed  the couple of masks i used so far have been fine  they are not n   but at least it is better than having nothing to use in public      
252,3.0,                       first mask out of the packet  the ear loop came off completely   i had to thread it thru the hole and tie a knot on the ends to use it   the one side of the mask was lopsided the entire time because of the ear loop   kind of annoying   i m hoping that doesn t happen to the other    i purchased      
253,5.0,                       the fit  comfort and size was exactly what i was looking for  i have the same brand masks in pale green  but the black offer a more  formal  look for in person work meetings  etc  this brand fit better than others i tried      
254,3.0,                       these masks are made in china  and come packaged in one plastic bag  not individually   some of the ear elastics were not sewn in   the masks are large enough to cover a large portion of face   extending  from bridge of nose to just under chin  and are comfortable and light to wear   they seem to be several layers of thin material  thick  and are sealed together by machine   they are a pleasing shade of pastel blue  with white on the inside   they do not have a pocket to add extra layers   as to whether these masks work well  i don t know  but i don t  have the virus        
255,3.0,                       the elastic breaks easily  breathable  thin material  doesn t protect against viruses  it s mostly for anti dust or anti allergen  n   masks protect against viruses but the public can t get them  so these masks will have to do  better than nothing      
256,2.0,                       received early    bags with masks  did not cone in any kind of box  has gaps between face and mask on the cheek area  has a slight smell    not really a bad smell just a weird one  bot sure what that is  seems to stay together when you put it on  fits well around the ears      
257,2.0,                       doesn t stay close to face  and nose bridge  metal  doesn t work   seems like a thin plastic versus moldable metal  better off with a cloth mask that fits properly than these that leave big gaps around nose and side of mouth      
258,3.0,                       nicely packaged   nice masks   they are okay to wear under my cloth mask the nose piece doesn t conform as tightly to my nose as i would like it to i will try to find some that work better if i order more      
259,5.0,                       i bought these for the price and they are actually a good mask  i did the flame test and that passed  i like them so much i ordered   more boxes to share with family      
260,2.0,                       out of the first    of these mask i have used the ear loops came loose at mask on   of them this happens right out of the bag  the very first time i put on no over stretching   just not made correctly i have used this brad before with no problem  this patch is junk      
261,1.0,                       they say there are multiple layers but they are different from the first order  now they are a single layer and very thin      
262,1.0,                       terrible fit and they break   they do not fit anyone in my family   they gap at the sides   they ear loops consistently break      
263,3.0,                       these arrived quickly   just   or   days   i paid    dollars before tax and i see now they are    dollars for a    count box   the inside plastic bag is sealed with an adhesive flap   i would be more comfortable with a sealed plastic bag that needs to be torn open   the masks i received do seem brand new   they look just like the picture   they  fit my adult male semi large head a bit snug but acceptable   the elastic straps do seem a bit dodgy   i haven t had a strap break yet but i carry an extra mask in my pocket just in case   i think a scarf bandana is a more secure option and obviously cheaper   i m not going to return this type of product after i ve already opened the package and used a couple of the masks  but if i could go back i might pass on the purchase      
264,2.0,                       i got    masks not     counted   times  not a major deal but disappointing  masks are nice     
265,2.0,                       for the price was a decent mask  shipping was also a decent speed  however  as i began wearing the masks i noticed that several were missing ear loops  had to throw these defective masks away  so essentially you are getting fewer masks than advertised because they are not usable      
266,1.0,                       strings broke on the first    right out of the box  very poor construction      
267,1.0,                       these masks are non medical masks     therefor you are not getting any protection    i will admit they are comfortable to wear and are very breathable because of how thin they are but once you receive them on the box it says non medical very clearly   honestly a waste of kidney if i m not getting any protection       
268,1.0,                       the first three times i bought a box of these masks  they each included a wire that could be pressed to mold the mask around the bridge of the nose   the latest batch is missing the nose wire  which makes the mask gap and slip   they are almost useless   the product description is false  because it says the masks come with an adjustable nose piece      
269,5.0,                       effective at getting me past the door dragon at the supermarket  that is  the moisture from my exhalations fogs my glasses and becomes unpleasantly swampy   it is slightly easier to breathe through than my improvisations involving a shemagh or turtle fur neck warmer      
270,4.0,                       the order shipped promptly and arrived at the earliest estimated delivery date  the masks look just like the display and appear well made  i find my glasses fog up less and my voice comes through clearer with these disposable masks vs  the   layer cloth reusable masks  i like this product so much i placed a  nd order      
271,2.0,                       metal band does not seal around bridge of nose no matter how much i try      
272,1.0,                       horrible product  way way way too loose  doesn t even cover your mouth and nose because the ear loops are so loose  don t waste your money  i bought this when the pandemic started and they were great  now they are crap      
273,5.0,                       excellent product  lightweight  fits great  the piece that fits over nose is more comfortable than most disposable masks and it s a great price      
274,5.0,                       these are great for helping protect the public  with corona virus circling our world these are an essential part of everyone wardrobe  i was very please with how many i got at such a cheap price  they are extremely durable for being disposable and i feel like i am protecting my family and friends when i go around them when i am wearing this  they are very comfortable and just the right amount of elastic to go around the ear making it so they don t hurt when wearing them for extended periods of time      
275,1.0,                       the first few we used were fine   they are difficult  however   to keep from creeping over your eyes big problems came a few months later   don t know if the glue holding in the elastic deteriorates or what happens  but can t even get some of them to go over my ears without the elastic snapping off    sometimes on both sides   the others can t be worn more than a short period or the elastic pops loose and these are loose on my face to start with   not worth the money      
276,3.0,                       i really like these masks  the way they fit is nice and i prefer having a box of disposables handy however  once i got halfway through the box  i realized that the rest of them were missing a loop on the left side  now it is already past the return date and i don t know what i m going to do with them  i will likely buy another box of these  but check the masks on the bottom as soon as they arrive      
277,1.0,                       could not use   odor that burned my eyes and rough interior that scratched my face  expensive loss of money     
278,5.0,                       but does absolutely nothing for  covid  or any other virus bacteria   don t kid yourself the only reason i bought it is b c i have to wear a mask for short periods in some places   this does the trick   i chuck them over the left field fence after about   hours use   masks are dirty  filthy  unhealthy things if not changed often      
279,1.0,                       inferior quality  does not fight right  very loose  and with every other mask used  the ear loops come off  don t waste your money in this item  these are probably rejects      
280,1.0,                       i disliked everything about this face mask if i can call it that  material feels like paper and cannot seal your face because the loops are extremely long for everyone in my house  plus i waited almost   weeks to get the product and they just kept adjusting the delivery date      
281,3.0,                       they show medical info and it looks like they should be safe but    box has non medical disposable face mask on it  well i did not order this for the   ply  i could have just put a bandanna on my face is it does not do the job intended  i will not buy any more      
282,1.0,                       almost every mask s strings snap while putting the mask on  some of the strings are not even attached in the package  these are poorly made  instead of having to waste them all  i ve resorted to carrying around a small stapler to reattach the strings  i will not purchase this brand again      
283,1.0,                       itchy  as an educator  i need masks that don t itch or have fly always while being comfortable  within the first    minutes of wearing the first mask  the fly always from the inside stitching started to itch and tickle my face  i do not recommend this brand  after looking through the masks in this package  they re all the same  cheap and itchy  get a different brand  do not waste your money like i did        
284,1.0,                       several times the ear loops break off from the mask as soon as you put them on  the box may hold    pcs but you may get less than    usable ones out of those         
285,1.0,                       these suck  the ear straps break so easily and that with only one use  i put it on  and it either breaks then  or after a little adjustment  i would never buy modenna masks again  you should be ashamed of yourself  putting out such an inferior product during a pandemic  these ear straps break so easily  and always when i am out and have no other masks with me  i bought   boxes in one purchase  and i wish i had not  i trust amazon to stand behind them but it looks like they did not do this  this time      
286,2.0,                       let me start by saying this product would of had   stars  i ordered this product twice before and as you can see in the picture  they were lined   it was comfortable and snug on my nose  i felt it was a good value for    of them  the third time i ordered this product  no lining    i don t even know what to do with them  i have to order filters to add or something  very disappointed      
287,1.0,                       apparently these masks are from someplace in china and at first i wasn t worried because i thought it would be made in a completely sanitary place but now i m a bit worried since i got very badly sick after a full day of wearing this mask   it was the only new mask i bought and i got sick in an entirely different way than previous times i d gotten sick   this time my symptoms were a lot more severe   it could easily have been something else that caused me to get sick this way but as i m not sure  i returned these masks   my other family member who wore this mask also got sick  and we both decided to nix the masks   hope this doesn t happen to anyone else      
288,1.0,                       very cheaply made in china     
289,3.0,                       it seems to do the job of making the liberal minded people happy your wearing a mask that doesnt do anything to stop covid  but i digress we did have about   pieces that were missing the   elastic ear band      
290,1.0,                       though the color is very pretty  the mask is a letdown   the mask does not fit tightly enough around the face and  the nose bridge is flimsy and barely grips   also there appears to be only one thin layer  so disappointing compared to my kimberly clark i purchased years ago against sars   this mask will not protect anyone against these aggressive covid viruses   i do not recommend   i will have to keep searching for a better mask      
291,2.0,                       straps for ears come apart from mask very easily  if you readjust  do so carefully  the mask does cover the facial area fully      
292,1.0,                       i had an issue with the straps popping off on a high number of the mask   i assume the person working quality control must have been on break or had a bad day when our mask were made   i did have some success when i turned the mask around and wore the mask backwards  color on inside    i may have just got a bad batch   i bought additional mask from another vendor and they work great      
293,3.0,                       great at first   but as i got further into the pack   the earloops are uneven and one ear hurts every day because that loop is smaller      
294,2.0,                       these are very basic single use masks worth bout    cents each  after having them on for a few minutes they have an odor that smells like urine  it makes me wonder about quality control because they come from china      
295,1.0,                       the first thing i saw on the package was  non medical   i want it to protect against the coronavirus    so apparently not good for that secondly  the packaging inside the box was completely in chinese writing  i would not have purchased this product for those two reasons      
296,2.0,                       bought these a few months ago and have worn them everyday  very comfortable and don t hurt your ears  i re purchased thinking they would be the same quality masks and they have changed them drastically  very thin  i pulled the elastic to my ears and the mask literally busted open as pictured  the original box had the masks with a white lining that was thick  yet breathable  these are just   ply and don t pass the breath test  the new black lining material is the same material as the outside of the mask  it is extremely irritating when in contact with skin  very disappointed      
297,2.0,                       the material from which these masks are made seems okay  feels similar to most basic procedure masks however  the nose bridge piece  which should mold to the wearer s nose bridge snugly   form a seal is plastic and does not form anything close to a seal  the plastic piece is flexible  but does not hold its shape which results in    ineffective protection against droplet   aerosol exposure    instantly fogged glasses if you want something for a dust barrier while house cleaning or doing yard work  these will suffice   if you want something to use as a barrier against droplet   aerosolized pathogens  these are useless garbage   if you are a healthcare provider  do not buy these      
298,5.0,                       excellent product just as described   mask came in a sealed package inside of a sealed box  mask are comfortable and of excellent quality  i d buy these again when  needing more      
299,1.0,                       came on time and the packaging was okay   it came in a labeled box and the masks were inside a plastic with a chinese product certificate inside  my problem is that the masks are really really thin and flimsy  didn t feel entirely safe when wearing one  not sure it offers much protection  the ear loops are loose  so they don t really pull the mask snug on my face overall  definitely not the best mask out there and honestly not worth the price  but better to have some sort of protection than have nothing at all      
300,1.0,                       worthless  i was really hoping these would work but i tried putting   of them on and they all broke  can t even carefully slip the straps over my ears without them snapping loose  complete garbage     
301,2.0,                       i am using this product for being around in public places  gas stations  grocery stores etc    sadly  i have recently found that some of the masks did not have a  metal insert  that bends over the nose area   if i come across these defective masks  i throw them away   it certainly is not a problem with all masks  roughly      but there seems to be a problem with quality control      
302,5.0,                       comfortable  lightweight  and the same quality as nurses in a doctors office use to wear  pre pandemic  not as effective as fabric  but your standard disposables      
303,1.0,                       better off putting together a few paper towels with rubber bands   don t waste your money like i did  this offer no real and partially real protection      
304,5.0,                       these disposable face masks have worked great for us throughout the pandemic  well made    ply  with slightly elastic straps that don t bother the ears  for people with really small faces  these might be a little loose but still workable  a godsend during this very difficult year      
305,2.0,                       after wearing    or so masks  three masks had the side strap break off the front   it looks like the straps were not heated enough into the material so the pull away   the masks themselves seem ok  but very frustrating not to be able to use all the masks because of this issue   i would not recommend these because of this issue      
306,1.0,                    no quiero ni perder tiempo en poner foto   pero estas mascaras son de muy mala calidad y el nailon de adantro llego roto y para nada son para protegerse de ningun virus   solo para el polvo   muy desepcionado            
307,4.0,                       i got these to comply with public health order requiring face coverings when i go to stores  etc   these are well made  with soft ear loops that are not too tight  just right  they have a bendable metal insert that you can shape to the bridge of the nose to help prevent fogging eyeglasses   they were delivered by prime shipping in two days  they are reasonably priced considering the demand due to covid     the only fault is with the design that does not keep the sides of the mask tight against the skin  allowing air leakage  that s why i deducted   star  but i recommend these and would buy again      
308,2.0,                       the masks are too big for my face  but i was able to fold the top over without spoiling the nose bridge  and can wear them that way  also the masks are flat  not rounded as they are pictured  and the pleats don t open very far  i won t buy these again      
309,5.0,                       gotta keep a stock of masks on hand  received on time  as advertised   thanks     
310,1.0,                       the ear loops are defective even when taking one out of the box  you cannot rely on them to hold while wearing  shoddy workmanship  a box of    may net    usable      
311,3.0,                       these face masks are acceptable in size and shape   however  the nose bridge strip does not hold it s shape   even for my small nosed family members  these will not retain their placement against your cheeks to protect from air freely going in and out   perhaps they can be retrofitted with additional wire straps added      
312,1.0,                       your product does not have enough glue on the straps of the facemask     
313,1.0,                       the ear loops did not stay attached  there was a foul odor that seemed to be present in every single mask  one might think it was their own breath after lunch but even the masks that were still in the box and had been on worn or untouched for that matter still had this strange odor  given the current predicament we are in with having to wear facemasks in public  a reliable product would ve been great instead of having to deal with the hassle of returning something that was not functional  i purchased these masks as a back up to the fabric masks my children and i wear every day unfortunately these did not hold up      
314,1.0,                       i bought a box of these and the first six i have tried all have the same problem   the elastic string detaches from the mask  in every case  it has been the lower connection on the right hand side  my right   which indicates to me it might be a manufacturer defect  in some cases i have simply stapled the elastic string to the mask as a repair and it seems to hold  but i should not have to do that      
315,1.0,                       i m giving this   stars   the face masks i ordered  finally  arrived  but on the box  but not on website image   it says  non medical   deceptive website  problem is even though i ve been a prime member since the beginning  you can t get faster shipping than a week from now   what happened to overnight or next day delivery      
316,4.0,                       these masks are not bad for the price  good full mouth nose coverage  bendable metal strip   straps are stretchy  if too long  tie a knot on them to make shorter i did this for my little one   i will purchase more as i believe they will be needed      
317,1.0,                       i ordered the box of    masks for my wife who is a healthcare worker and she said she doesn t like it because the mask don t give here a tight seal around her face and chin  she said  i can feel air around my chin it feels too big   after using the first mask she said i need to order a better mask because this one doesn t feel useful  the box cost me     with tax which i thought was a ripoff but she needed protection  we didn t find a problem with packaging and the item arrived on time      
318,2.0,                       wasn t super happy with this purchase  the mask is very big and awfully stiff  the bands on the ears stretch out and get loose  also the fibers tickle my nose badly  fine for one time use but if you re like me and pulling it off and on all day and also pulling it under your chin while not using it i don t recommend      
319,1.0,                       this product is not currently available  so maybe this is moot   these masks are rated    on amazon in  medical supplies and equipment    the product description includes   high efficiency to filtrate particles  spittle  and micro organisms    so i got my masks today   the box they are packed in is very nice  seems factory original  and the masks are clearly denoted on the box as  non medical    thanks a lot      
320,3.0,                       this is not a medical grade mask  which are hard to find now for non medical personnel  it is the same width as other masks i have had  but when opened  probably an inch to inch and a half shorter  from my perspective it fits tighter across the face  probably because it doesn t go as far beneath the chin  for example  the masks we were given during a hospital visit extend down to the adams apple  this stops about an inch or so above  still adequate to cover you nose  mouth and chin  i ve tugged pretty firmly on several from the box and haven t had any strings separate from the mask      
321,1.0,                       the first time that i ordered these in january      these were great   then my sister and i ordered the same ones again in february       and they do not come with three layers   they are one layer  no white lining  and are flimsy down to the elastic band   another friend of mine was getting these same masks from a local store and when he went back  he was told that they are not the same as the ones he bought before and looked just like the ones i just received   note that most of these great reviews are from        amazon needs to have them change the photo as it is false advertising on the black masks      
322,1.0,                       a month ago i ordered a box of    modenna    layer face masks and they were pretty good for the        i paid for them  so i  ordered   more boxes and was surprised that the price had come down to      a box the boxes that arrived were a completely different  generic  no name brand the nose wires do not hold their shape  and the surface area of the mask is slightly smaller than the actual modenna brand do not buy these      
323,3.0,                       if i could i would give this a     i would  they were relatively cheap compared to others  they arrived quickly  the reason why i m not giving more is because the material is a little weak  but it s still a good purchase     
324,4.0,                       they are adequate  the straps cut into my ears after a while which hurts  but is to be expected  i felt they were a little shorter from nose to chin than other brands i ve worn  if you have a small face you ll be fine  but i find that sometimes it hits between my chin and lower lip or gets pulled below my nose      
325,1.0,                       the string that goes around ear brakes off      
326,1.0,                       when the box arrives  the words non medical are clearly there  but not in the photo  misleading  i sent them back      
327,1.0,                       crud do not buy  adequate mask  lousy quality earloops  first two pulled loose  no effort  poor fit as well  suspiciously minty smell am speaking as crtt respiratory tech      years  do not buy these notice that price dripped      and  dripped   is correct      
328,1.0,                       every time i go to put one of these on  the strap snaps off of one corner     every single time  they are useless  i use surgical masks at work every day as i work in a medical facility and never once has a strap snapped  these are very bad quality  a complete waste of money      
329,4.0,                       they run slightly large  the slide down off my face easily  but they are comfy and i like that they aren t an ugly blue color      
330,1.0,                       these masks are terrible  the little strings are very fragile and snap off very easily      
331,2.0,                       the masks were manufactured in china      
332,3.0,                       i ve bought many of the blue masks directly from modenna and they are by far the most comfortable ones i found  however  the black masks are made of different material that doesn t  breathe  as well and therefore holds moisture close to your face  after a few minutes wearing one  my nose started to itch  unfortunately  this was the only mask i had with me and i had to keep wearing it for about    minutes      
333,1.0,                       i purchased the box of    modenna face mask and have tried to use six of them so far and the strings have broken on all of them  the strings break as soon as you go to wrap the loop around your ear or right after you get in the store and move your head  the string falls off      
334,1.0,                       when viewing this product online  it shows that the inside of the mask is white  but when received the inside was black   the main reason for ordering this product was because the masks were white on the inside  after receiving the masks and seeing that they were black  i immediately went online to amazon to look to see if i didn t look a them correctly and they were shown  as having white on the inside   had i known that they were all black  i would not have ordered them   the only reason that i am not returning them is because i had already opened the box and thrown the box that they were in the trash      
335,1.0,                       if you pull even the slightest on this mask  the strap breaks and it becomes useless   also  for some reason  i was charged over     for these   i would expect some sort of refund since they are       in any event  these are useless   i ve had   break  out of    i ve tried to use  simply by trying to pull them out of the plastic bag they come in      
336,1.0,                       i purchased theses masks after a friend gave me a mask and recommended this product  the original mask had a soft white lining that was comfortable to wear and wasn t thin  the masks i just received are thin and don t have the soft white lining  like the product image   other buyers are reporting the same issue  returning items      
337,1.0,                       super super upset  i have bought this masks two times before  i just bought my third mask and i wish i could return them  they are completely different from the very first two boxes i bought and not worth the money  they are not   layers but only two now    you can t even tell which side is the back anymore  the first two boxes the back was obvious because it was white   i m pissed      
338,4.0,                       seem to be reasonably decent quality for the money  bought based on others reviews  we are unable to get disposable reasonably priced masks locally  so this is an acceptable option  did not want to deal or feel comfortable with cloth  washing constantly and  in my opinion  cloth is very unsanitary  rather have disposable clean  throwaway masks until we get to other side of coronavirus  already ordered a second box so have in event of a fall virus spike      
339,2.0,                       these don t fit the face well and the nose clip doesn t stay bent and they floated to partially obstruct vision plus they were super expensive i ve had other similar style  before this that fit very well so these are subpar     
340,1.0,                       so i reviewed the product screen and was tricked into believing it was not made in china by the little ad boxnext to it saying made in usa   the we go to the question that asked where it is shipped from and it says usa both of these are not truthful  it is made and shipped from china   but  alas  i should have expected this sincei am dealing with a democratic party company      
341,1.0,                       the straps on these are terrible  at least half of the straps break off as you try to put them on  they are very cheaply made  i will not buy these again      
342,3.0,                       most people are buying masks for protection from covid     which is a medical problem  so i m not sure these will work for that purpose  the box i received states they are non medical  since what i ordered looks like the ones in the picture i would guess the box image has been photoshopped to remove the non medical statement from the box      
343,1.0,                       i ve bought   boxes of these   the first box was great   i loved them so i ordered another box   the second box i am so disappointed in   the first box the nose piece was a metal piece that would form perfectly to the nose and the second box it s just a flimsy plastic piece that will not form to the face so it makes it pointless to even wear the mask   i will not buy again and have wasted my money on this second box that i will never use      
344,3.0,                       the edges were kind of scratchy on my cheeks  but i like that they were white on the inside and black on the outside      
345,1.0,                       this is crap  the material is flimsy  one ply and the ear bands so big the material doesn t stay closed  it will not provide you with protection at all  very frustrating to have companies sell crap in the midst of a pandemic      
346,1.0,                       i find the name very misleading  look carefully  potential buyers   i thought i was buying masks from the well known pharmaceutical company moderna   i thought they would meet the standards advertised   not be some knock off from an american company not a chinese one      
347,3.0,                       these masks aren t the highest quality  but they serve their purpose  they fit an adult  and were way too big on my   year old  be careful with the ear elastics as they break easily  they also don t fit as snug around the nose and mouth as a medical surgical mask  they serve their purpose as a face covering during this pandemic  so i can t complain      
348,1.0,                       the elastic has come out of   masks that i have tried to wear so far   also  the nose piece popped out of one when i was out walking and then the elastic came out   the masks are comfortable and the right thickness  but because of the poor quality  i would like to return them      
349,4.0,                       i certaily am not a conniseiu on masks but went eeeny meeny miney mo whem chosing these   we are required to wear masks when we go out our doors     to a box should last a long time as we hardly leave   high rsk  had to leave   times in the past       months for short distances and very short timewise  out of the   times only one mask lasted without an incident   the ear loops kept failing   i had to sew them back on and now i do this before i wear a new mask   so  i want to buy another brand and have no idea what do buy   mind boggling      
350,1.0,                       received today  i put a mask   it broke within   minutes of wearing  i thought maybe a  dud  in the box   no biggie  i ll put on another  second one broke within seconds  i had my husband put one on   broke  the straps are coming right off  i work in the medical field and wanted to have a staff in my car etc  i am highly disappointed         
351,3.0,                       they ve lowered the price since i bought them and they re worth the lower price  not medical grade  you can kind of blow through them if you try  lit match test  match flickered but wouldn t go out   so they re better than nothing  but not as good as the actual surgical masks i had before      
352,5.0,                       this masks seem to be standard issue paper masks   i bought these because we are layering them under our cuter cloth masks   this just adds another layer of protection   there a lot in the box and the price was right
