0,5.0 ,                       the smell and the bubbles that you get out of this product are just great  i found that using this creates a better and stronger smell than using lavender bath bombs and you get the fun bubbles on top  also the bottle is huge i have used it   times now and i still got so much left in the bottle it really is a steal for the price      
1,4.0 ,                       no not really but i have felt the   soaking in the    feel good      
2,1.0 ,                       this product wasnt sealed on arrival  shouldnt it be  disappointed  dint get a scent at all  wont be buying again     
3,4.0 ,                       nice product  although the bottle looks cheap  of course  we paid cheap  so it is a      valid  but just fyi  loved that the bubbles are just perfect  really great product      
4,5.0 ,                       this product is a wonderful gift for friends who like relaxing bathes  it smells good and you get a lot of product for the money  i don t know that i can speak as far as pain relief or moisturizing      
5,5.0 ,                       such a soothing smell for my bath at night      
6,5.0 ,                       the lavender smells amazing  it didn t irritate my skin in any way and it actually made plenty of bubbles      
7,5.0 ,                       i liked this product i did not have pain so can t answer to that and don t have sensitive skin but it was soothing and i enjoyed it     
8,5.0 ,                       this is wonderful after a long day  literally  helps me feel sleepy      
9,5.0 ,                       i love everything about this product  the scent is delicious  the bubbles are more the consistency of suds  the epsom salts ease both bones and skin      
10,5.0 ,                       love this bubble bath      
11,5.0 ,                       very good product  however  more pain relief with the epsom salts  nice clean scent  price not discounted  same as in market      
12,5.0 ,                       the scent is great but when buying a bubble bath  i look for one that can yield a great amount of suds   this one didn t do that   i had to use a lot to get an okay amount of bubbles   for pain relief  you may want to go with epsom salt for that   this one was more for relaxation   this was okay   i don t think i would buy again      
13,5.0 ,                       bubbles slightly  great scent  leaves skin moisturized      
14,5.0 ,                       this product smells very good  it say it promotes good sleep however i m not very sure about that      
15,5.0 ,                       foaming great  satisfied     
16,3.0 ,                       bought this for the bubbles  but it doesn t make much      
17,3.0 ,                       i honestly wanted to love this  but i found myself using soo much to get a good amount of bubbles  and i have a standard tub  so although the price is great you are using an insane amount  to get the result you want  but i guess the result is achievable so that s a plus      
18,4.0 ,                       would have given   stars because i love this product except the bottle came damaged      
19,5.0 ,                       love this product  always helps me relax so much  i also use for daughters bath time and she loves it too      
20,4.0 ,                       i love the product but it was leaking  good thing they put it in a bag      
21,5.0 ,                       so good scent  very relaxing foaming bath      
22,5.0 ,                       i used to use products of another brand  but their quality is far from as good as yours  your products are in line with the high quality products advertised  i am very glad that i have changed brands  i love this stuff  it s great     
23,5.0 ,                       i need to order more  nice  thick liquid so you don t use a lot  i am a chronic epsom salt bubble bath taker and this lasted me a nice long while  especially for the price  fragrance is very nice  not overwhelming  great stuff      
24,5.0 ,                       wife loves this bubble bath   ordered a few times now      
25,5.0 ,                       excellent     
26,3.0 ,                       if you pour the product beneath the spout right as the water is filling your tub you will get the most bubbles  the ingredients seem fine to me  although the lavender smell is not strong and isn t the best smelling  however  it does have the epsom salt and it makes a great combo  the price is amazing to  i give   stars  not the best but really not bad either  i have sensitive skin and i seemed to be okay so far and i ve used this twice now  the major thing i did not like was it was not sealed  i ordered twice because the first one came with stuff all over the bottle  neither one was sealed  can t say my pain level is different but my skin feels amazing  soft      
27,5.0 ,                       love this bubble bath  so relaxing      
28,5.0 ,                       i love this stuff definitely worth           
29,5.0 ,                       best bubble bath  it has it all and the bubbles last     
30,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          the bottle suggested to pour a generous amount which i did and i was surprised by the amount of bubbles produce  after a few minutes the bubbles were pour out of my jacuzzi  i highly recommend this product if your looking for bubbles      
31,3.0 ,                       not all that concentrated but smells nice and feels smooth     
32,1.0 ,                       no bubbles at all  oily tub  didnt like it      
33,5.0 ,                       the bottle leaked a little bit in transit  but because of the way it was wrapped   sealed  no harm done to the other items in my box  which i appreciated  it has a lovely lavender scent  i only wish the cap had a lever for easy pouring  instead of having to pour from the full bottle  which tends to drip down the side      
34,5.0 ,                       i was pleasantly surprised nice bubbles  smells great  very relaxing   didn t color my tub at all rinsed clean easily  felt moisturized afterward      
35,5.0 ,                       delicioso olor  poco espumoso pero huele y se siente bien     
36,5.0 ,                       great for bubble baths  foams quickly and easily  very nice smell and great to relax in at the end of the day      
37,5.0 ,                       i use this for my kids  we love it      
38,5.0 ,                       love this product  usually buy it in the stores but was happily surprised that amazon offers them      
39,5.0 ,                       i enjoy bubble baths and lavender so for me this was the perfect product       
40,2.0 ,                       purchased   at that great price   both arrived with no seal  tops weren t screwed tightly  luckily no spills  and the bottle necks were smushed   then read all the negative reviews  sent online msg on dr teals website asking about why their products wouldn t have seals and sent them the link to this product so they can be aware   no reply of course   took two baths but will be throwing the remaining away since i did feel a skin burn and didn t have a relaxing experience   the smell is ok   but feel it s possible product may not be true blue      
41,5.0 ,                       light scent   heavy bubbles and long lasting     
42,5.0 ,                        i especially like it on amazon since it is made in usa  some retails are selling made in china    not sure why small so good  if you don t need too much bubble  you could lesser the amount put into the water  very relaxing scent  love dr teal and brought many packs of salt  going to try other scent foam bath as well      
43,4.0 ,                       it does produce bubbles  the bottle is a lot bigger than expected  the lavender scent is a bit strong but enjoyable  i did have itchy arms and back after using it  but tolerable      
44,5.0 ,                       simply bought it for a friend  but they say it s awesome and much better than other bath bubbles     
45,5.0 ,                       love this stuff and i got a good deal   fast shipping too      
46,5.0 ,                       this product has a great smell and bubbles up very well using just   capfuls for a huge hot bath   it has a lighter  more natural scent than many others  and is not artificial smelling   i am not so sure about pain relief  but it sure is relaxing knowing i am getting a real good bubble bath for not too much money      
47,5.0 ,                       i use this regularly to relax and sleep   i also use it for my kids and it really seems to help everyone relax more at bedtime      
48,5.0 ,                       hello fellow bath lovers  while this product is passable  it is not a genuine dr  teals product  the one i received smelled much different  like cheap lavender oil  than the product i buy in store  it also came without a safety seal  the bubbles do not have the same longevity either      
49,5.0 ,                       smells wonderful  helps make me feel better due to my fibromyalgia      
50,4.0 ,                       i love this bubble bath  only problem i have is that it takes so much to get a good bubble bath that you re done with half the big bottle before you know it  i only got like   bubble baths out of this and it s a pretty big bottle  kind of disappointed but i still love it     
51,5.0 ,                       i take a bath several times a week with this lavender bubble bath soap  i love it   the lavender scent is perfect  calming  natural and lovely  not artificial and not too strong      
52,5.0 ,                       love this stuff  only use a tiny amount though  otherwise it s to much      
53,5.0 ,                       it smells great  i slept very well the night after    will definitely but again     
54,5.0 ,                       definitely should use   cap fulls lol i put way more and the bubbles were so high   great product though     
55,5.0 ,                       love dr  tealss     
56,2.0 ,                       i bought this because i couldn t get my avon bubble bath  and the reviews said this was great stuff  lots and lots of bubbles  i liked the price point  so ordered   bottles  what a huge letdown   i m not sure what people are comparing the bubbles from this product to  but for me  a total fail      i had to use a third of the bottle to even get close to the amount of avon bubbles from a capful   on the upside  the smell is nice  but if i m in the tub i want lots of bubbles  without using a ridiculous amount of product  i wont buy again      
57,5.0 ,                       i stock up whenever i see this for a decent price i ve tried lots of different bubble bath products in the past  they re a harmless guilty pleasure   but dr  teal s foaming bath is by far the best product out there   the scent is potent  the bubbles are plentiful and long lasting  and i only need to use a small amount of  product to get the desired effect lavender is my favorite  flavor    it s super relaxing    guaranteed to help me prepare for sleep when i have a lot on my mind or a tired body after a long work day      
58,5.0 ,                       i love this bubble bath

60,5.0 ,                       my girls always love this for a gift      
61,5.0 ,                       y all  this is the best bubble bath i have ever used  not only is it an amazing value  but it smells amazing  makes a ton of bubbles  and is ridiculously soothing  every time i have used it  i have had to cut my bath short because i almost fell asleep in the tub  it is that good  if you re looking for a relaxing bubble bath experience that doesn t break the bank  this is definitely the product for you      
62,4.0 ,                       i guess the label saying  foaming bath  is correct   do not expect this to be a bubbly bath  took about     of the container to really bubble  smells great and works great otherwise      
63,5.0 ,                       favorite taste it makes me feel relaxed  i love this product      
64,5.0 ,                       sooo lovely and the scent was perfect  highly recommend getting the lavender  made for a relaxing bubble bath     
65,1.0 ,                       it doesn t do what it supposed to do     
66,4.0 ,                       lot of bubbles  smell good   i suggest add epson salt with this  i been using bubbles bath to relax for years  and this one smell good  i will reorder   i don t have sensitive skin  so don t know will this work on sensitive skin  always try with your hand or feet before put your whole body in it      
67,5.0 ,                       i love this product i take a bath every night before bed      
68,5.0 ,                       it feels so great to sit in the tub and smell the lovely lavender scent   it s like being at a spa      
69,5.0 ,                       i love it woks just as well as more expensive  ones that  used to buy     
70,5.0 ,                       love it     
71,5.0 ,                       love it  gentle but works for soothing my muscles      
72,4.0 ,                       this bath bubbles is amazing smells beautiful   leaves skin soft  doesn t smell fake or chemical like which is great     
73,5.0 ,                       love this bubble bath    i can not believe it was only     best bubbles       
74,2.0 ,                       came without a seal  kind of sus     i don t think i m comfortable using it  just buy it at the store      
75,3.0 ,                       notice how the bottle is called foaming bath and not bubble bath  i bought this after seeing a photo of a woman as a glorious bubble monster  and was disappointed  after i used the entireeee    oz bottle and all we got was a mild foam  id would go to walmart and check out what they have there  i cant remember the name  but i bought this sleek white bubble bottle w green letters  it was branded for adults  and i poured like a    th of it and there were soooooo many bubbles     
76,3.0 ,                       i haven t noticed any pain relief  the smell is a little perfume y  it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft  so the oils do their job  the label says to be cautious of utis  which is kinda sketchy  especially since we bought it for our daughter who is in diapers  we don t let her use it for that reason  and i m slightly paranoid each time i use it     
77,5.0 ,                       i love dr  teals  made in the usa  it smells fantastic and is so soothing      
78,5.0 ,                       the scent is good and it is not very strong      
79,5.0 ,                       bought two of these and use it after my long runs and bike rides  the lavender scent is great and so is the foaming component  the price is so reasonable   much better than any spa or salon  will definitely keep using this brand a   have ordered this item two times now   absolutely love it      
80,1.0 ,                       i ve used this before and it was pretty good  the one i received is flat as can be  i barely get any bubbles  it s been watered down  avoid it      
81,4.0 ,                       love the scent  didn t moisturize as much as i thought  produces an okay amount of bubbles  i had to add   caps in order to have a good amount of bubbles  i would say it s good for the price  and the bottle is thick  overall i liked the product and probably will buy again      
82,5.0 ,                       i love this product  makes for such a relaxing bath      
83,5.0 ,                       this is a great bubble bath   a little goes a long way which makes it very economical   it would rival very expensive brands      
84,5.0 ,                       super cheap for the size   the fragrance is awesome and helps induce sleep  super relaxing     
85,5.0 ,                       i dont know what it is about this product but it gives me massive bubbles in my bubble bath i love it    haha  also as far as pain relief  i have a serious back injury and i find this product always helps ease my pain which makes it easier to sleep at night   i constantly buy this stuff

107,4.0 ,                       i didn t give this product a perfect score because i found i needed to add a little more product into the bath water to get the scent and amount of bubbles that i enjoy  it s relaxing  makes my skin feel soft and is a pure joy to soak in  a bath pillow a glass of wine and one or two candles make it heaven  enjoy        
108,5.0 ,                       this is an awesome soaking product     
109,4.0 ,                       use   capfuls and it gives plenty of bubbles  not sure why other customers are saying not a lot of bubbles  we are adults so i don t know how much bubbles you actually need lol  it s nice for those stressed out work days      
110,4.0 ,                       first time trying this product and it s been helping relieve some pain  the only downside is that the bottle arrived half empty since it wasn t properly sealed and spilled during delivery

115,5.0 ,                       love this stuff  i love all the scents i ve tried  really live the feel of the water with the epsom salts in the fluid  not grainy much softer  i have terrible eczema on my legs and surprisingly this doesn t seem to inflame it at all      
116,5.0 ,                       great body wash      
117,5.0 ,                       it works perfect with my jacuzzi i use two cups and works perfectly enough bubbles     
118,4.0 ,                       good value     
119,5.0 ,                       enjoying enough     
120,5.0 ,                       great scent  my favorite bubble bath      
121,4.0 ,                       i buy this product all the time  but the box is open  i don t like that one bit      
122,5.0 ,                       this is the only brand of bubble bath i have found that doesn t break me out  the smell is amazing and it s so relaxing  i bought the big bottle as a refill to my travel size one i keep beside my bathtub      
123,4.0 ,                       many people told me that just a small cap of this stuff would produce a mountain of bubbles   i wish that had been the case  but unfortunately  it was not   it did make bubbles though  and it did smell nicely      
124,5.0 ,                       we are happy to use epsom salt bath      
125,1.0 ,                       do not buy from amazon  it s not the real dr  teal bath bubbles   i ve used it for years buying from walmart or a drug store and the amazon quality is watered down and does not provide bubbles nor nourishment to your skin     you re going to harm someone selling rancid fake products that is for our bodies            
126,5.0 ,                       i love the subtle scent  not overwhelming and just enough to enjoy the aroma   i learned that i need to start making bubbles while the water is still shallow in order to make good dense bubbles  they stay strong bubbles    mins      
127,1.0 ,                       not sure if it s a shipping or production issue but the safety seal had been removed from under the cap  i believe the liquid inside was replaced since it did not smell nor make any bubbles      
128,3.0 ,                       not as much bubble as i thought but the price is good      
129,5.0 ,                       i love dr teal s foaming bath with pure epsom salt  it bubbles beautifully  and is soothing to the skin    the lavender helps me sleep in the tub until the water turns cold and awakens me      
130,5.0 ,                       a little bit of this will make a lot of bubbles  not very dense bubbles  but at this price  it s great     
131,5.0 ,                       will take this on vacations with me  bubbles are great  last for a good       mins  soothing in smell and feel      
132,3.0 ,                       my husband tried this   while he loved the smell   the softness of his skin he wasn t happy w the sparse bubbles  so if you want a great smelling bath but no place to hide your whatnot but this w great confidence   i received this at a discount for my honest review      
133,4.0 ,                       i have a back injury which left me with a chronic pain syndrome  this item is used to relieve my severe pain      
134,5.0 ,                       lots of bubbles  nice smell      
135,5.0 ,                       my favorite scent and it is very reasonably priced     
136,5.0 ,                       the best for bubbles best for smell best for skin being soft     
137,4.0 ,                       i m a big self care person  i was in need of a reasonably priced bubble bath product  and this definitely fits the bill  i bought both the lavender and eucalyptus scents  the lavender one is so nice and the scent is strong  but not overpowering  my only con about the product is that for the amount of liquid i pour into each bath  i would hope for more bubbles  i ve taken about   baths and still have a quarter bottle left  so i am still very happy with this  i also use it after workouts to ease sore muscles      
138,5.0 ,                       i like it but not good for soaking too long     
139,5.0 ,                       i ve been using this product for almost a year  it smells good  feels good on the body  relaxes you  and it repels the mosquitoes i ordered it on amazon because it was more convenient i didn t have to go to the store      
140,5.0 ,                       i love this stuff  smells good and big bubbles      
141,5.0 ,                       enjoy product  smells just like lavender essential oil      
142,5.0 ,                       well worth the cost  it was at described      
143,2.0 ,                       this has a wonderful natural fragrance but it doesn t really foam up very well      
144,5.0 ,                       i feel like i use more than half the bottle to get a mediocre amt of bubbles      
145,5.0 ,                       love this  always so perfect after a long day     
146,2.0 ,                       unless you use almost the entire bottle you don t get many bubbles out of it  i had to use about half the bottle to get even a couple inches of bubbles  it s cheap but at that rate with my kids it only lasts a week  alaffia cost a tiny bit more but lasts much longer  it s fare trade  does great charity work  and is      biodegradable      
147,5.0 ,                       excellent for my back and other areas where i have chronic pain  sometimes it really helps me get to sleep when the pain is too much to bare      
148,4.0 ,                       the product itself is great  but the way they ship it needs to be improved  i m not sure who thought putting this in a big box by itself with no padding anywhere would work well  it got banged around a lot and was leaking everywhere  i m going to buy this from a physical store next time      
149,5.0 ,                       very relaxing  the scent is not overwhelming      
150,5.0 ,                       i was pleasantly surprised to find out it was   bottles instead of one  the smell is very nice and relaxing  my daughter loves the scent and the foam      
151,2.0 ,                       this is my second bottle that i have tried  the lavender scent is so calming and nice  but i never got any sides or bubbles  and the ones that i did get barely lasted until i got in the tub  so disappointed     
152,5.0 ,                       relajante     
153,1.0 ,                       this product seems watered down compared to the real stuff you get at target or walmart  it takes a ton of it to produce any bubbles  it also came open already  would not recommend      
154,4.0 ,                       there were a lot of bubbles and they lasted throughout the soaking   this is my no    concern when i buy  bubble bath       
155,5.0 ,                       love the scent of this nice bubble bath      
156,5.0 ,                       love this bubble bath  the scent isn t overpowering  good for sensitive skin too      
157,5.0 ,                       the price was more than     off with free prime delivery  wanted the product for the epsom salts and lavender scent  very large bottle here bigger than your normal    oz  used immediately with some luke warm water as a foot soak   wow       results could not be more pleased    min soak followed by a ice cold rinse and an air dry   lovely sensation and the feet are remarkably clean       
158,1.0 ,                       just didn t care for it     
159,5.0 ,                       i love all of dr  teal s products  but my favorite one has to be this  its fragrance is delightful yet subtle  it doesn t take much to create a decent amount of bubbles  and it doesn t leave soap residue on the sides of the bathtub  not to mention  it really helps me relax  also  you can t beat the price  i ve seen this go for twice as much at various stores in my neighborhood  get yours while you can      
160,5.0 ,                       loved it back pain     
161,1.0 ,                       this must be a knock off dr  teals or their quality has gone down extremely it didn t matter how many ways i tried  no matter how many bubbles i poured in  it would barely bubble up   those handful of bubbles would be gone in minutes barely any scent  extremely disappointing  i guess i ll buy a better product   mix this in with it so it doesn t go to total waste   unlike my money      
162,5.0 ,                       this has been my favorite dr  teal s of all other products  bubbles lather up thick and rich  scent is not overpowering   true spa experience  i put quite a bit in  but a little goes a long way    hope this helps  stay safe      
163,5.0 ,                       this product helped soothed and eased my back for pain and helped me sleep better at night     
164,5.0 ,                       smells great and feels good on your skin     
165,5.0 ,                       i really like this bubble bath  only a little bit of the product can make lots of bubbles        
166,5.0 ,                       love this product   love the smell and it makes lots of bubbles     
167,2.0 ,                       the product itself was very nice while using it but had a skin reaction to it as soon as i left the water  will not be using again      
168,5.0 ,                       always a joy to use      
169,1.0 ,                       pour half of the bottel but there was no bubbles     
170,5.0 ,                       this is a really cheap product that actually does good  i m a person who would rather take bubble baths than showers so a lot of product for cheap  goes a long way with me  i ve tried others but i really enjoy the lavender scent and the bubbles lasts over an   hour  i have to wash them out at the end of my bath      
171,5.0 ,                       best i ve ever used     
172,5.0 ,                       enhances your bath experience  smells great and helps you relax   sleep better     
173,5.0 ,                       package came in very well packed and no spilling and the lavender scent is so calming and relaxing it s a great addition for your bath time     
174,5.0 ,                       smells really good and creates lots of bubbles      
175,5.0 ,                       smells great  skin softening and very relaxing      
176,5.0 ,                       love this brand  all of their products are amazing  and this one is on my weekly list of must haves  i have chronic back pain  and i m currently  months pregnant and im going through more of it than ever bc i live in the bath tub these days lol but it s a brand i always trust      
177,5.0 ,                       i love the scent of this bubble bath after an anxiety attack  it s perfect in a hot bath     
178,5.0 ,                       this stuff is inexpensive and ridiculously amazing  i couldn t believe the bubbles  and i usually only use lush bubble bars  this is way better      
179,2.0 ,                       not very bubble and the scent is mediocre at best  you ll have to use at least half the bottle to make your bath foamy      
180,5.0 ,                             would recommend  bring a glass of wine      
181,3.0 ,                       overall  it s a good product except for the amount required to generate bubbles  when the instructions say  pour in a generous amount   they aren t kidding  you may be wondering if the fact i needed to read  bubble bath instructions  undermines my credibility as a critic and that s fair  i guess one bottle is good for about    bubbly baths  compared with the inefficiency of bath bombs  a first world problem if ever there was      this is the more frugal indulgence  but for the price  it remains underwhelming i found the character of its lavender musk a bit cloying but maybe the clamminess of the bathroom and its squalid bare cfl bulb undermine its true allure      
182,5.0 ,                       this stuff is great     
183,2.0 ,                       this hardly made any bubbles for my bath  i poured in a good amount  i m not sure how much i need to pour in to really get the bubbles going in the tub  maybe the whole bottle  not worth it      
184,5.0 ,                       this is a great product  lots of bubbles that last a long time for a very relaxing for a soak  smells good too      
185,4.0 ,                       i was looking for a kind of soothing bubble bath for when i get migraines  although it smells good and does help  i was looking for a kind of bubble bath and this doesn t really bubble enough  it s more just a scent for a bath than anything      
186,5.0 ,                       love the lavendar scent   its very relaxing      
187,1.0 ,                       i this product several times a week   this specific seller diluted the product   the consistency was watered down and bubbles were less and what was there evaporated quickly   very disappointed     
188,5.0 ,                       for relaxing in a bath and relieving sore muscles after yoga or a workout my wife loves this bubble bath   she loved it so much that we purchased it again for a ski trip so she could soak her body after a long day skiing and relieve some of the soreness      
189,5.0 ,                       great product for value     
190,5.0 ,                       nice foam which keeps the water hot for me     
191,5.0 ,                       soap is great however shipped poorly    leaked a little bit in the box  crystaljanielle     
192,5.0 ,                       as expected      
193,5.0 ,                       its not super scented  very subtle  but enough to be relaxing for a bath  a little bit goes a long way      
194,5.0 ,                       i really like it also makes lots of bubbles     
195,5.0 ,                       nice smell  very thick and high quality     
196,5.0 ,                       super love this product  i use it all the time it s my fave        
197,3.0 ,                       it smells good but it does nothing at all for pain or relaxation  and the foaming bubbles all disappear within minutes      
198,3.0 ,                       not very bubbly  takes a lot to really get some bubbles  smells great though      
199,5.0 ,                       works great     
200,4.0 ,                       nice soothing soak  not sure what is giving the pain relief  this stuff  the additional epson salt i add  or the deep soak hot bath but  all together  feels good and helps after the honey do s  which have not been affected by any viruses     will buy again      
201,5.0 ,                       the bottle says to use a generous amount  but really it doesn t take a lot to get a nice  foamy bath  i don t love lavender  but i found that the scent was not too strong once actually in the bath  it made my skin feel moisturized all night and i still felt great the next day  i ll be using this on a regular basis  totally worth the money for this giant bottle      
202,5.0 ,                       love love love  my body feels relaxed after a   min bath  i use a lot more than instructed  i just like bubbles a lot      
203,5.0 ,                       this smelt great  and had wonderful long lasting bubbles  very soothing  also good value price wise and fast shipping      
204,5.0 ,                       excellent product for the price  lots of bubbles and really fun to switch it up with this      
205,1.0 ,                       i bought two bottles at a discount it tastes all right it just tastes like water  no bubbles take a good shower it s so different form the rest  i really don t like and the lid is upside down showering is super messy no more buying

208,3.0 ,                       i just attracted by the price of this product  it is not good enough but it s worth the price      
209,5.0 ,                       i was disappointed in this product   i was going to use it in my new foot massage machine but it just seemed too oily and i didn t smell much fragrance at all   this might be good for a bath but again it seems greasy which makes for a hard cleanup      
210,5.0 ,                       don t have much to say the item was well packaged  great price and works without an issue  if you are looking for a nice bubble bath this is the best one to get

225,5.0 ,                       cant wait to use it  i thought is was a small bottle but its not       
226,4.0 ,                       this bubble bath is just as foamy and soothing as the honest company lavender scented bubble bath for a fraction of the price   my daughter loves it too      
227,1.0 ,                       left me with a huge rash       
228,5.0 ,                       highly recommend  i ve been ordering these for a while now and i won t order anything different  perfect for my bath to relax  smells good  has foaming bubbles  and relaxes you so much  love the epsom salt for the muscles  couldn t be more pleased  thanks for the recommendation from blogger dani        
229,5.0 ,                       as advertised     
230,5.0 ,                       i really enjoyed this relaxing bath product   its the best     
231,3.0 ,                       es muy poco concentradaaa hay que colocar much simo producto para obtener una cantidad de espuma agradable       
232,5.0 ,                       what can i say  i love a good soak in a hot tub that has a head on it   the smell is wonderful  and since i do not have jets to make the bubbles better i stand in the center of my tub and kick the water back and forth   instant foamy water      
233,4.0 ,                       as good as any bubble bath and less expensive   but why a   i remember bubble bath producing more bubbles  but that could be nostalgia   perhaps they removed a chemical that caused us to grow a third arm but we know that to reduce crushing  tomatoes now have thicker skins and less flavor   tasteless i know   and roses resist diseases better but don t smell the way they used to    a scentsless choice       
234,5.0 ,                       great     
235,4.0 ,                       smells great but doesn t bubble up very much in the bath      
236,5.0 ,                       i always love dr teals products  the scent of lavendar is so relaxing   it doesnt leave a residue in the tub or skin      
237,5.0 ,                       i have always loved dr teals bubble bath and amazon has the best price       
238,5.0 ,                       this is my all time favorite product for bubbles   no better product      
239,1.0 ,                       the product has arrived on time but the quality is very poor  it doesn t smell like lavender and you need to use a lot of it to make it foam  it also gave me an allergic reaction  my whole body was itchy after using it  i have never had this type of reaction to any other product  it must be something in the ingredients of this product      
240,2.0 ,                       i have used dr  teals products for a long time   i was not impressed at all and i dont know if i believe it was the actual product   within minutes  less than    the bubbles were gone and the scent of lavender was very faint   you get a lot for what you pay for but i am not convinced it was the actual product      
241,5.0 ,                        value for money      
242,5.0 ,                       the is wonderful  the pain relief was great  and it was very sensitive to the skin      
243,5.0 ,                       great scent and makes lots of bubbles  especially in the winter  on a cold day  a hot bath does miracles i get leg pains from standing a lot at my job  it soothes my legs      
244,3.0 ,                       this product smells amazing  i m not sure how much relief it gives thought since i haven t used it enough  it doesn t bubble up as much as i would like either      
245,5.0 ,                       smells wonderful  lathers in hard water  relieved  my aches      
246,5.0 ,                       bought it cause people talking about it  smells good  it s thick but to really get the feel of it you have to soak in a bath sigh     
247,5.0 ,                       great scent good price  son uses for nightly bath relaxes him for sleep     
248,2.0 ,                       i was expecting this product to be better  the liquid is thick which made me hopeful that it would create a lot of bubbles and they would last  but it does not  i ve used it a handful of times now and it has been the same each time   the bubbles are completely gone within    minutes  each time i put a decent amount t in the tub  maybe   or   tablespoons   and it has a lavender scent that isn t too overpowering  however  i feel that if i put more in the scent will be too strong and cause a headache  the epsom salts do help with pain relief  but i ve found that regular epsom salts on their own work better  overall  not super impressed      
249,5.0 ,                       this is the only product i buy for bubble baths  it s a huge bottle so it lasts quite awhile and it s such a great price  you can get a lot of bubbles easily from this and it smells amazing too  i will probably never look for a different bubble bath product again  the lavender smell is super relaxing and nice     
250,5.0 ,                       smells great and you get a large quantity of product

254,5.0 ,                       this bubble bath is exactly what i needed  the lavender scent is fabulous  and the bubbles last forever  i have to refill the water once it gets cold because the bubbles are still going strong  great way to unwind after a long day  will definitely purchase again

257,3.0 ,                       want a quick bath you re ok   but i m in for an hour and the bubbles disappear within    min      
258,4.0 ,                       used twice so far and enjoy it  the scent is pleasant and not overpowering  i was very concerned when i first opened my amazon box because it was not wrapped or sealed in any way  very sketchy  amazon  the bottle was pretty scraped up too  however  instead of going through the hassle of returning and reordering i tried it out  so far no issues      
259,5.0 ,                       i bought this bubble bath because of that lavender scent  it was amazing and   cap fulls make a huge amount of bubbles and i love it  i have very sensitive skin and this leaves my skin soft and not irritated at all      
260,5.0 ,                       i love all of these because they make your bath water super silky  they contain epsom salt which exfoliates naturally but can also make your skin  ashy   be prepared to use extra lotion once you towel off      
261,4.0 ,                       ok product   lavender scent fades to quick but it does what it s supposed to      
262,5.0 ,                       epsom salt and long lasting bubbles   what s not to love

265,4.0 ,                       i enjoy dr  teals empsom salts a lot  i m an athlete and work out all the time  this is great for relaxation and sore muscles  i do favor the actual salt crystals a lot more than the liquid  i feel like you get lord out of it and it s easier for your body to absorb  otherwise if you re looking for a good scented body ache relieving bubble bath  this is your product      
266,5.0 ,                       great fragrance  bubbles foam long lasting   very relaxing      
267,1.0 ,                       very unhappy  the product was very watery   almost no bubbles  the smell was fake like  when reading the label and seeing can cause ut irritation   what s the points can t even take a long soak      
268,5.0 ,                       great buy  smells nice and leaves skin soft  i cannot use many bubble bath products due to sensitive skin but this one has never caused me any problems at all   i even use it for shaving my legs  as a liquid soap

276,4.0 ,                       good value for one s money however though the warning label states keep out of reach of children  it does not have warning information re  domestic animal s  various plants  plant extracts   oils  etc  in any form can be toxic to animal s from just the mere smell alone      
277,5.0 ,                       beautiful relaxing product for soaking in tub  of just washing your face   hands  great relaxing soap for home use      
278,5.0 ,                       i use this stuff all the time i love putting it in a hot bath it makes my skin feel so good and when i get done with my bath i feel so good and when i go to lay in the bed i go straight to sleep      
279,1.0 ,                       i m not positive  but i m pretty sure this isn t what you d get in a store   the bottle didn t have any seals and it barely creates any bubbles   i don t think its the real deal      
280,2.0 ,                       we love the smell off it butt unfortunately it s not kids friendly whenever out kids take a bath we would use this site they could have fun in the bubbles  they love bubbles  we re love that it makes them smell really good  however  off the bubbles get in their eyes port off they touch their eyes then they cry and we have to get a rag to whipe their eyes      
281,5.0 ,                       she would buy it in a five gallon bucket if she could find it      
282,5.0 ,                       i don t even buy any other kind of bubble bath any more  these foam baths all smell wonderful  not like perfumes or chemicals  just lovely light scents  they make a great bubbly foamy bath  the bubbles last a long time  and they leave no yucky residue in the tub  the price is great too  usually around    for a    ounce bottle  i love to try all the different formulas  one of my favs is matcha green tea  best bubble baths i have ever used      
283,5.0 ,                       dr teal products are always top notch  this bubble bath is great because a little   very little  goes a long way  the fragrance is subtle and very pleasant  i also use their bath salts   can you guess that i m kinda spoiled    great for relaxing after working all day       
284,3.0 ,                       arrived very quickly but thank god the bottle was sealed in plastic  product had leaked all over the bottle  making it difficult to get the plastic off as well as cleaning it all took a bit of time as well  product smells great but the issue with the leak could have been solved easily with a seal in the bottle itself  also the cap was not screwed on all the way so that was the cause of the leak  still will use the product but just as a warning to other who order      
285,5.0 ,                       you cannot go wrong with dr teals products  this particular scent is a great way to end the day  lavender scent is amazing  and a little goes a long way  treat yourself  you won t regret it      
286,5.0 ,                       really bubbly  i used a large amount for the first try but i think it can still be really bubbly with less product  scent was barely there but that s okay because i also like to use a bath bomb      
287,5.0 ,                       this product  is amazing not only is it great for a bubble bath it s also great to soak your tired achey feet after a long hard day  this product smells great and has a good aroma of lavender which is therapeutic and relaxing  i used it for my first foot soak since i suffer from diabetic neuropathy and it has been a life saver      
288,5.0 ,                       fantastic  love the scent and the bubbles last a very long time  thank you

290,5.0 ,                       it is huge and so cheap  i won t get in your private parts either like most other bubble bath soaps do and scent and paint relief is just so good  i would buy again forever

292,5.0 ,                       amazing     
293,5.0 ,                       dr teals by far the best bubble bath  bath bombs cant come close to this  price is very much cheap and great value  highly recommended      
294,2.0 ,                       i got minimal sudd after using almost the whole bottle of solution  i liked how it made me feel after the soak but i feel like this is for small bath tubs  probably the tub i was in was too large     
295,5.0 ,                       this is an awesome product  smells very nice and makes a lot of bubbles for a very relaxing bath      
296,5.0 ,                       bigger then i thought it was going to be for how much it was  very happy with purchase  and smells amazing      
297,4.0 ,                       i know a child that has eczema  so he can t have a normal bubble bath  this seems to be a great substitute  he loves it  so much that he runs though it quickly      
298,1.0 ,                       had to throw away as it did not come with a protective seal  smells great and i am sure it s a lovely product  however  money tossed down the drain      
299,5.0 ,                       great when you want to relax      
300,5.0 ,                       this stuff is wonderful   i was sold when i first removed the lid and smelled the product  beautiful lavender  lots and lots of bubbles  having epsom salts as well is awesome  great price and one day shipping  i just ordered another one and i m sure i will be ordering more   i highly recommend this product      
301,4.0 ,                       while there are better and more expensive brands out there  i really find dr  teal s gives you the most bang for the buck   i have used numerous scents from dr  teal s and found each to be enjoyable   dr  teal s will not fill your bathtub with bubbles  but you will have plenty of suds   i actually prefer the lower level of bubbles in this bath   furthermore  the fragrance is pleasant but not overpowering at all   as the title suggests  dr  teal s is also a great value and is very long lasting with the   oz size      
302,5.0 ,                       omg  i bought the cream and bodywash for my daughter to help her sleep earlier and better and i can t believe the results she usually fights to sleep   but since i m using this    days  she s sleeping better  yesterday she did sleep all night relaxed and today she felt sleep at   pm wow  i m so glad i bought this because she s going to school and she was going to sleep after    pm so  she was sleeping onli     hours  but now  she s sleep       hours      
303,5.0 ,                       wonderful product     
304,3.0 ,                       the scent is nice and not overwhelming  i bought the bubble bath based on the reviews of lots of suds and bubbles  i don t know if i needed to pour a lot more out  but i used two caps fulls into the tub  half filled  and within ten mins the bubbles all disappeared  a little disappointed  i don t know if it is for sensitive skin but i wasn t irritated by the product  and it doesn t do anything for pain relief  i don t know why that was part of the review input  maybe next time i ll try adding more bubble bath solution  but i feel like it would take like a quarter of the bottle      
305,5.0 ,                       great bubble bath  smells so nice  relaxing scent      
306,5.0 ,                           capfuls in my    gallon jacuzzi  made ample bubbles that lasted   mins  soothed my aching bones  will buy again      
307,5.0 ,                       cute and a lot of bubbles  smells so good     
308,5.0 ,                       works well     
309,5.0 ,                       i have more bubbles than i know what to do with and they last until the end of my bath which is usually    to    minutes  i only use a small amount  there is nothing i dislike about it  smells nice  too      
310,5.0 ,                       this is extremely relaxing  i m ready to drift off to sleep after taking a nice bath      
311,5.0 ,                       this pairs beautifully with the dr  teal s epsom salts we get at costco in bulk  lovely bubbles but no itch   highly recommend      
312,4.0 ,                       i love dr  teals products  especially bath salt products  which has soothing and therapeutic properties  so i naturally leaned toward their bubble bath gel as well  i love that the scent is relaxing and soothing  however  it s hard to get these to foam up in the tub  i use a pretty liberal amount but get very little foam  the little kid in me wants a lot of foam but maybe the epsom salt properties prevent the foam from rising      
313,4.0 ,                       we can t wait to try another scent from this foaming         
314,5.0 ,                       this size of this bubble bath is great and lasts so long  the lavender is the perfect addition to a bubble bath and really allows you to just relax and enjoy  i highly recommend      
315,5.0 ,                       love the lavender smell and the amount of bubbles it produces after running it under the faucet  haven t used it for pain yet  haven t noticed how it moisturizes because i use lotion  it is a relaxing bubble bath      
316,2.0 ,                       i put   capfuls in bathwater and there s absolutely no scent at all  bubbles are underwhelming but that s okay  there s enough  i will say the water is softer but i can get that result from grocery store sea salt  so i m thinking it s useless  i won t buy again      
317,1.0 ,                       this does not even make bubbles in the tub regardless of how much you pour     
318,4.0 ,                       pleasing bubble bath     
319,1.0 ,                       have been using this product for three years  this most recent order found each bottle in a separate  baggie not shrink wrapped as in past orders   decided to order from this seller because price was     less than before   looks like i got what i paid for  product has been tampered with and thinned out to the point that i must triple the amount used in bath water  no scent and few bubbles   refund please      
320,5.0 ,                       useful for relaxation  it gives you a lot and isn t too expensive  smells nice     
321,5.0 ,                       not a lot of foam  but leaves skin smelling great   very soft        
322,4.0 ,                       i bought this foaming bath product to use as shower gel   i do like the scent   a soft lavender with a hint of vanilla   it s not as medicinal or herbal like some lavender products out there   it cleans well  but doesn t leave much scent behind on the skin   while i usually use shower gel or bar soap to shave my legs  i found this product to not work as well when shaving   i cut my legs a couple times  which is unusual for me   the product just doesn t have enough  slip    also  like others  i found it difficult to use this massive bottle in the shower  but i shouldn t be surprised  since this product is not an actual shower gel in a regular sized container  i ve just decanted a smaller amount into another clean bottle  to make it easier to disperse in my hand in the shower   overall  the scent is good  it cleans well  and the price is very attractive   i d purchase it again      
323,5.0 ,                       the smell is perfect  it s a quality product for a good price  i ve bought it more than once      
324,5.0 ,                       i was looking for a bubble bath that didn t waste my money  bubbled well to fulfill the goal of reminiscent childhood  but also smelled good yet didnt slap me in the face with an instant headache  success  it bubbles well and they last  it smells so good but it s a relaxing lavender smell and it s not perfumey or annoying  and my skin felt so soft  i absolutely love it  there s no way i would be more impressed with a small     bottle of bubble bath where the lid breaks before delivery that oprah endorsed  this is all you need boo  oh  and a bath pillow cause that changed my whole experience      
325,5.0 ,                       i don t know about pain relief because i m honestly not sure if epsom salt does anything for me  or if it s just the soaking in hot water that helps  but this stuff is definitely a keeper regardless it foams beautifully  smells lovely  and really does make for a relaxing bath    perfect for unwinding at the end of the day and getting ready for bed since i have eczema and psoriasis  i didn t use as much to create heavy bubbles like some have in the review pictures  but i still got a nice amount of bubbles without any irritation  this means that i can hopefully treat myself more than just a couple of times a year without  paying a price  to my skin  hello stress relief   also  my children used this stuff as well  the difference it made in their bedtime routine was jaw dropping    they fell asleep so much faster and actually seemed eggar to settle down for the night  as apposed to being  determined to stay up and play    all in all  we got about    baths out of one bottle  stress relief  the feeling of being pampered and getting a treat  and happy skin  worth every penny   just keep in mind that i only half fill the tub for my kids because of splashing         
326,5.0 ,                       i bought this during quarantine to give myself a little relaxation  it says to use a  generous  amount of soap for a bubble bath  don t   i use a capful for a pretty big bathtub and i get a bunch of bubbles  it s a really great price for this much product  the smell is reasonably strong  not too strong or too weak  and lasts for about       mins  maybe more  i didn t time it   the smell is pleasant and not artificial  i have sensitive skin and had no irritation from it  i don t know if it actually does any pain relief or not  but it s definitely a good product      
327,3.0 ,                       doesn t get as bubbly as i hoped  had to use a lot to actually get any bubbles  it is a really relaxing smell and add that extra touch to the bath      
328,5.0 ,                       this bubble bath really does work  after using it  i really do feel the difference  it smells great  too  and it s a great value      
329,4.0 ,                       needs almost half the bottle to get the full bath of foam  very nice light scent  feels relaxed

331,5.0 ,                       bought this for my husband and he loved it   thought he could use a little stress relief and this really helped      
332,3.0 ,                       we purchased this and the epsom salts  this has very little lavender scent compared to the epsom salts of the same brand  and one has to use almost a cup of the fluid to get any bubbles at all  we won t purchase it again      
333,5.0 ,                       a friend of mine had told me she used this for her baby at bedtime to help soothe her   she mentioned how much you get and how inexpensive it is   so i bought it and my baby loves it and it also helps him relax and sleep better

335,5.0 ,                       pro s  smells great  great price for the quantity  makes lots of bubbles  relaxingcon s  noticed absolutely no pain reliefconclusion  must buy for every bathroom as it is extremely relaxing     
336,4.0 ,                       i wish the smell was stronger but make lots of bubbles      
337,5.0 ,                       a little bit goes a long way      
338,5.0 ,                       i ve ordered two different scents but i ve used both  they re both amazing and the bubbles last the whole bath   i have super sensitive skin and dr teals is the only bubble bath soap i can use    i switch between this and bath and body works body soap and dove       
339,5.0 ,                       great smell  you don t need to add much for a good amount of bubbles  usually one bottle lasts about six months  it smells very natural and not artificial  i recommend      
340,5.0 ,                       it gets the job done     
341,5.0 ,                       lots of bubbles  feels relaxing and smells great     
342,5.0 ,                       i used to spend a lot of money on bath bombs but always thought that was cost inefficient  then  i saw this in my friend s bathroom and asked about it  she said she liked it so gave it a try since this was like    for a big bottle  when i first tried it  there was no bubbles and i kept on putting more and more    then  i read the instruction and it said put in while the water tab is running  i started seeing so much bubbles it was unbelievable  the second time  i used a good amount and it was amazing  this smells nice and it was very relaxing  just remember  if you don t want to overuse this  make sure you have your water tab running when you put it in   it will create bubbles on its own         
343,4.0 ,                       smells great and makes for a good bubble bath  the  foaming  is a little underwhelming though  i think if you put any normal soap in the bath you ll get the same amount of foam      
344,5.0 ,                       there s nothing negative about this product   large size long lasting bubbles heavenly scent safe for children  i ve had skin rashes  uti s  and extremely dry skin on my     year olds  dr teals is  perfect      
345,5.0 ,                       some bubble baths don t foam up much  you have to put a lot in   this one  you just drizzle it in under the running water and it foams up quite a bit   some bubble bath liquids have the consistency of water  which i personally find disturbing when i pour them into the tub   consistency of this product is pleasant  thicker like shampoo  etc      
346,5.0 ,                       i like being able to relax with the lavender and epsom salt foaming bath liquid   there are no salt crystals to dissolve  just pour it in and it bubbles up and lavender is known to be relaxing  while epsom salts soothe sore muscles   i would definitely purchase this again   you don t have to use much to get the benefits      
347,5.0 ,                       like

349,5.0 ,                       wussup wt the bubbles i need more bubblessssssss  lol its great tho        
350,5.0 ,                       alright  so i m giving this five stars but only because this product met my expectations in a way i didn t intend  i was really hoping that even     of this product would create lots and lots of bubbles   i m talking like the kind you see in the movies when the woman is drinking wine and settles back into a bath filled with bubbles that act to cover her up in the scene  unfortunately  this product doesn t do that  i think i used     of the bottle and while i definitely had bubbles  it wasn t anything like the massive amount i was hoping for that being said  the bubbles it did make  more like a thin layer   remained in the tub for the full    minutes i was in there  i m pretty sure they would have stayed longer  too  but the water was cold so i wanted to get out  and the smell was really nice   my skin felt really soft  too did i get my disney princess lifetime movie bubbles  no  but honestly  it wasn t bad   i may just have to accept that i ll never get all my bubbles  which is more of a me problem and not a product problem      
351,5.0 ,                       literally my bath time go to when i get off work  i just love the smell and the feel of it   very relaxingwith a nice hot bubble bath   i never run out of dr teals

353,5.0 ,                       this was a great deal price dropped below three dollars and the bottle was huge    oz bottle  it smelled so strongly of lavender it was great  used up the whole thing within a few weeks  loved it      
354,5.0 ,                       it is the most delicious  relaxing and luxurious bubble bath ever  i use it for years  sometimes  when i have excessive back pain  i add a cup of dr  teal s epson salts  and it is just like magic  i recommend it to anyone who works hard and has one hour to take good care of her himself everyday      
355,5.0 ,                       it smells so good  i m relaxed in the shower  it makes a lot of bubbles and for me it s perfect      
356,3.0 ,                       bought this cuz if was cheap and highest rated  it s pretty decent product  have to put extra under running water for bubbles      
357,5.0 ,                       i dance and do lyra  aerial hoop  and aerial silks hammock so i often end up with a lot of achiness and bruising around my legs knee pits  this   reg ol  epsom salts in a hot bath  followed by a smothering of arnicare cream after i get out of the bath are a life saver  i notice a visible difference before after my baths   very red sore before and less visible bruising pain after  no pain the next day  too  def recommend said routine for aerialists dancers      
358,1.0 ,                       this  foaming  bath with  long lasting bubbles  smells wonderful and the scents are soothing    but it barely foams let alone  bubbles  and neither scent nor the  foam  lasts very long at all to be fair  the directions do say  pour a generous amount  under running water    but i had to dump about    th of the   oz bottle  so at least  oz   in to get even a small amount of bubbles

418,2.0 ,                       i bought this by looking at the reviews but it doesn t make any bubbles at all  i almost poured half of the bottle into the tab it barely made it somewhat bubbly  bubbles do not last long   mins max  and also made my skin veeeery dry      
419,4.0 ,                       got these to replace my preschooler s  mr  bubble  as he uses his nightly baths to wind down before bed  he has sensitive skin and i ve noticed he is scratching less since switching they put out enough bubbles to keep him from noticing a difference  i wish the scent were stronger  i was expecting the smell of lavender epsom salts all in all this is a great deal for a huge bottle  the packaging was very good  the bottle had leaked a tiny bit during shipping  but it was all contained in the plastic wrap covering the entire bottle  had to use scissors to get it open  great buy      
420,5.0 ,                       i used this bubble bath for about a week before i ran out of the product  the scent is amazing  i used it as part of my quarantine pamper routine

423,5.0 ,                       wife loves this product        
424,3.0 ,                       i got this for my teen son but it caused extreme itchiness all over  both times  he drained the bath and refilled it with plain water to stop the itching  this happened twice  so we threw it out  he has no allergies or any previous sensitivity to anything  he has previously used other bubble baths and also plain epsom salts in the bath  without any problems  so i don t know what caused this itchy reaction  but i can t give it a good review  since it seems to have something in there which is an irritant      
425,5.0 ,                       you can t go wrong with this it s epsom salt and bubble bath all in one so you save some money   the bottle is large and lasts longer  it has an excellent scent  i love lavender and it smells as it should  perfect way to end the day is a nice relaxing bath using this

431,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       just wow  i wanted to take my first bubble bath  glad i went with mr  teals  the bubbles were long lasting and so much bubbles  the smell was great  my body smelt amazing and super smooth  can t wait for another bath  you won t be disappointed  promise      
432,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this photo is after thirty minutes in the bath  i honestly got this product in today and i love it so much   i ve been using mr  bubble extra gentle but the bubbles didn t last as long as i wanted them to  it was amazing to see the bubbles last so long       
433,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       beware  i don t know if what i received is even the real legitimate dr  teal s product or not  but it gave my   year old son a terrible  almost chemical burn like reaction on his skin  i was really surprised given all the positive reviews on here  and given the fact that he does not have particularly sensitive skin   he s never really broken out with a rash or anything like that before  i purchased it thinking the lavender would be a good relaxation aid for him before bed time  but after only a few minutes in his bath  he started screaming for me and saying his back was burning  i drained the bath and immediately washed him thoroughly with dawn dish soap  but it still gave him that awful rash burn you see in the picture  thankfully  he did not seem to get any sort of burn rash anywhere else  be careful  especially with your little ones

435,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i would like to start with what i liked about this product  it smells great  it doesn t make my skin feel dry  and it s kiddo approved what i didn t like    when i first received the product the bottle was all beat up in the box  but i thought whatever the reviews are good  however the bubbles are extremely underwhelming i started with a capful after a time but once i was at    c or so of soap i figured there was no use adding more since the bubbles weren t multiplying i m still in the market for a new bubble soap       
436,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       when i first tried it out  it was also my first time using bubble bath foam   i was severely disappointed because there were almost no bubbles and i had followed the directions exactly  which was simply to run a cap or two directly under a warm hot water stream  the lavender smell was fine and not too overwhelming to me  but i was still grumbling about the lack of bubbles and almost threw the bottle away  weeks later  i stumbled across a ytube video of a person using a handheld electric mixer whisk into a bubble bath  and poof  bubbles spouted instantly  since there are obvious dangers to using electronics near water  i got the idea to just use my hands to flap and stir rapidly like in a whisking motion near the running water  as stupid and silly as this seems  it works to create real bubbles to fill the bath  about     minutes of on and off hand whisking  using about     cap fulls per minute  is enough to get a good inch layer of bubbles to cover a normal economy sized tub  after     baths using this method  i still have about     of the bottle left  can t say how much this bottle would last if you re trying to fill a giant fancy jacuzzi or hot tub overall  despite having to exercise my wrists and arms a bit  i feel much happier that at least i found a simple way to get real bubbles without any fancy tools and that this bottle won t have to go to waste after all

438,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       smell is okay  subtle  but this stuff burns my skin  after maybe   minutes in the water i m stinging all over  i don t have this issue with their regular epsom salts or essential oil espom salts  just this bubble bath  which  by the way  isn t a great bubble bath  there aren t many bubbles from the start and they fade away after a few minutes      
439,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i can t thank you enough for the lavender bubble bath  my   youngest daughters are   and    and when i tell you they fight their sleep baddd  i mean they have laid awake until almost morning until they finally crashed  they are extremely active little girls with ants in their pants  they are constantly on the move  which is expected with kids  but i m sure we can all agree  can drive us crazy sometimes lol  sometimes  us moms  dad s too   just need an early night so we can have some quiet i bought this originally because i had a coupon code and the deal was too good to pass up  besides  what s a bath to little girls with no bubbles   it just isn t fun  so  after our first use  they got out the tubby and into their jammies  within    minutes they were both knocked out completely  i was even able to carry them into bed without waking up at first i wasn t sure if was from the bubbles  we used the last bit of our old ones in the next bath and they were jumping off the walls all night again  well  next tubby we used the dr teals and the moment their little heads laid on the pillows they were sleeping i will never not use this again  i d also like to point out that my kids are allergic to almost everything you can imagine with the most sensitive skin i ve ever seen  and they have zero issues with this i without a doubt wish i could rate this over     stars  this has become my saving grace  i d also pay quadruple the price for how amazing this is  who would ve ever thought a bubble bath would save my sanity and put my kids right to sleep  not i  dr teals has out done themselves with this  if there is one thing you need in your house with young children  it s dr teals lavender bubble bath
