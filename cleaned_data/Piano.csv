1,5.0 ,                       used for a while to see if i d like   and stick with  piano  it worked  love it and have since upgraded to the real deal  but this sounds great  has everything you need to learn  and is priced right for trying out a new hobby  highly recommend      
2,5.0 ,                       teen daughter loves it  i love that it has a headphone jack      
3,5.0 ,                       it has a seat and stand and a pedal just like a very nice product to learn to play the piano      
4,5.0 ,                       very good quality

6,5.0 ,                       great keyboard      
7,1.0 ,                       cheaply made and overpriced  you get what you  pay for  spend    more dollars get quality      
8,3.0 ,                       we really did like this keyboard for beginning piano and bought it december      for christmas  today it started smoking and now has no sound  we think the speaker blew but it was really scary and now smells like fire      
9,1.0 ,                       i am very upset with amazon     the item   rock jam    keyboard  came incomplete i e  without the set screws needed to put it all together and any set up manuals  etc   after several tries i was able to reach your rep  alex  who told me in so many words he could not complete my order     i would need to contact the manufacture      i bought this from amazon    you need to see that my purchase is complete     not throw it back in my lap  i make a lot of purchases through amazon     this is unacceptable    thus the low rating      
10,1.0 ,                       i would give more stars but we didn t receive everything in the kit  we just got the keyboard  no stand  headphones  seat  chords  nothing  it wasn t even packaged well  we can t plug it in or anything      
11,5.0 ,                       i am  an    yr  old who was trying to find something to pass y time these days   i played piano a long time ago and also clarinet   this unit is perfect for my needs   sound isn t too bad and so far so good   i enjoy getting back to practice and passing time in a somewhat constructive way   well worth the money   very reasonable priced      
12,4.0 ,                       disclaimer  i do not play piano  to me the keys feel like real piano keys  headphone jack is great  stickers for beginners to place on keys seems to help      
13,2.0 ,                       very good value     a christmas gift for my daughter  but the stand  legs  were not in the package     kind of tacky when a christmas gift is not complete     a bit difficult to pack up and return  especially when i am      miles away overseas         
14,3.0 ,                       very cheap  sound quailty is horrible  i had one key broken when arrived   didn t return as i didn t want to mess with it   my son still uses it  kinda     
15,5.0 ,                       the keyboard arrived exactly when it was supposed to and ws very easy to assemble on the stand   my grandson loves to play on it and i have been able to practice my choir music      
16,5.0 ,                       i got this for an   year old last christmas and she loved it  we use an app that teaches you how to play the keyboard and also can tell you when you ve made a mistake  it s great  i like that it has optional headphones so she can either play it for others to hear or practice on her own where only she can hear      
17,5.0 ,                       lovely       
18,4.0 ,                       we are almost a month in an this far i m impressed  unlike some other reviews i find the sound to be spot on  my son is   and taking piano lessons  he loves this new piano  the application that offers free lessons quickly converts to a        monthly charge  with that said he loves it and has progressed much faster using it  the piano incorporates his phone  i think this addition makes it more interesting to children versus the traditional books and lessons      
19,5.0 ,                       bought as a bday gift for my    year old   she loves it and is teaching g herself to play  assembly wasn t difficult      
20,5.0 ,                       my daughter loves this      
21,5.0 ,                       gave to both my grandchildren and they enjoy very much   recommend      
22,1.0 ,                       you get what you pay for     this thing is cheap  flimsy stand  worked for about   minutes  then something burnt out and no keys nor buttons work even after unplugging to try to reset  kid is crying  ruined xmas  now i m mad  returning item for full refund and spending more money to get a better brand and quality  that ll teach me not to be a cheapo for xmas  ugh      
23,4.0 ,                       it s an ok it s a little too clumsy  and it s some kind of difficult to learn for beginners  all the buttons and options it gives you  it s just confuses you my kids love to play and press different buttons      
24,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my grandson for a gift  he loves it      
25,5.0 ,                       great product for beginners and fantastic gift idea  highly recommended      
26,5.0 ,                       this has been a great buy  my daughter has been wanting to learn to play the piano and this is a great substitute  you get free app access with lessons and it s just been great fun for the family  the bench and stand are both very sturdy  no complaints thus far      
27,5.0 ,                       great product    easy to follow with music sheets     
28,5.0 ,                       this is the perfect fit for my daughter   she is beginning piano lessons and this keyboard is the perfect size   it s even good for adults also      
29,5.0 ,                       bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it  great quality  great sound  easy to use and loads of extras  was pleasantly surprised for the price this was such a quality item      
30,5.0 ,                       my daughter is just learning and it it small and convenient  the best part are the headphones so only she hears what she is playing  very happy with the size and sound      
31,5.0 ,                       works great      
32,4.0 ,                       great keyboard for taking lessions  the built in songs is a welcome surprise  comes with headphones but you might want to get some better ones  the seat is sturdy      
33,3.0 ,                       sound is adjustable  lots of extras as far as percussion options and different instrument options  great to learn with serval app options  comes with head phones and you can adjust height   can plug in your phone  great for someone just starting out  however i ve had mine for two months and when i hit middle c the key next to it also plays very frustrated and would return it if i could because of this technical issue  good value hopefully this flaw will not bother me too much      
34,1.0 ,                       bought this piano not even two months ago and it suddenly stopped working   i sent e mails to the rock jam company and they didn t answer me back   so i won t recommend it        
35,3.0 ,                       i took lessons for many years as a child  got older  lost interest and sold my piano   fast forward many years and i was looking for a relatively inexpensive way to see if it s a hobby i d like to pick up again as an adult  before i made the decision to buy a real piano  right out of the box i was disappointed because both the piano seat and the stand were broken  the knob that is used to tighten the stool is made out of a cheap plastic that looked like it had been crushed with a hammer  i had the same issue with a couple of the screw knobs that hold the stand together  i didn t expect world class quality since this was pretty cheap  but i like the chance to break things myself  we were able to replace the screws to get the stand to work  but gave up on the stool  that being said  i am pleased with the keyboard itself  the sound is clear and keys feel great  the included headphones sound great and are a great addition to the keyboard  this would be a great keyboard for someone with limited space  someone looking to get back into playing or for a child just starting to take lessons      
36,5.0 ,                       entertainment     
37,5.0 ,                       this was a great keyboard for a beginner like me  it is only    keys but its easy to learn  i ve been using a lot of youtube tutorials and others apps to learn and improve  overall i ll give it a           
38,5.0 ,                       i m not a musician  with that said   as far as my opinion goes  this item sounds great  functions as it should  and my son uses it all the time creating his own music  he loves it  he is the musician   so i love it      
39,5.0 ,                       was a gift for my grandson he set it up and started playing     
40,5.0 ,                       my son loves this and plays often     
41,5.0 ,                       this is fabulous   words don t describe how much fun it is   was a gift for a   yr old  who mastered many of the functions easily  abc keyboard stickers helped in general   functions are user friendly   keyboard unit is well made  simple to put the stand together   a great bargain that guarantees lots of hours of fun for the little   big ones      
42,5.0 ,                       this is an amazing keyboard for the price   we are absolutely blown away by the quality of it   we bought this for my   year old because she seems to be interested in playing the instrument   this will be the perfect stepping stone to test if this is something she really wants to pursue or not   if not  its still fun to have around but we didn t break the bank      
43,4.0 ,                       my daughter loves this piano   a free month of lessons comes with it and the app for them is great   had to exchange the first one i purchased because the speaker sounded blown   but the replacement i received is great      
44,4.0 ,                       personally the only keyboard i ve ever owned  have nothing to compare it to  but love it  still learning how to play  i have no musical background and never received any lessons so i am learning as i go  comes with labels for the keys which is nice  stickers   only giving a   star rating because i ve only had it for   day and want to see how it goes from here      
45,5.0 ,                       this is great for the price  my daughter loves it and i love that it comes with headphones  its not as sturdy as it looks so i just make sure its always pushed up against a wall and its all good  light weight and has lots of options      
46,2.0 ,                       doesn t work with midi as i expected  my computer can t even recognize what i m plugging in and i had to buy a separate cable for another decent bit of money just to test that  and now for some reason  there s a constant buzzing in the background of every note that gets pressed and it s very annoying  this was probably almost not even worth it at all  the keyboard constantly falls backward on the stand  the headphones were also trashed immediately since they re pretty bad      
47,3.0 ,                       i ve been playing for years and imagined this to be a little bigger than it actually is  i must have had    keys on my last keyboard and not realized it   the music rest is flimsy for actual music books and sitting them on there pulls the keyboard stand over backwards  so that s a disadvantage for my purposes  however  it can hold individual sheet music pages and probably an ipad or chromebook of you re downloading specific pieces from that  as opposed to an entire book of music   it s easy to put together and very hi tech  with a guide showing you what all the different buttons can be used for  it also comes with a promotional code for   months of free lessons  so all in all it s good for someone who s just learning to play  but if you re already a pro i wouldn t recommend it    an update just a few days after getting it  i tried to raise the keyboard so i could play it standing up       it fell over backwards and the flimsy music rest broke off  it didn t detach  it broke  because the stand is designed with a back leaning angle  once you raise it to a certain height it falls backward  so  not a good keyboard if you ever have a need or want to play standing  and no  i m not unusually tall  my height is           
48,5.0 ,                       the keyboard   electronic piano comes complete with stool and very sturdy stand  an adult should put it together for a child under   years     older could assemble it it has study guides for piano practice  has a memory card  like in a digital camera  to store music  and has a  demo  mode to give the child some ideas on how it will sound my grandson loves it  it sat and played  sort of   on it for about   hours on the day  his b day  and focused on the unit   he is   and it would be fine for an older child depending on their size  a child over   might need to just set the keyboard unit on a desk or table since the stand is height adustable to only a certain size child you kid s  won t be disappointed if they like to get into music and look to advance their piano playing      
49,5.0 ,                       gift for    year old grandsons   they use it lots     
50,1.0 ,                       if i could give   starts i would  i purchase this for my daughter for christmas  it work the  st   days then after that it had a buzzing sound whenever it was turned on  we retuned it figuring it was just a faulty one  and just got a replacement  the replacement came and as soon as we set it up   what do you know that buzzing sound again  this is garbage  spend the extra money and get a better brand   absolute garbage      
51,5.0 ,                       the rj     model has the midi output to connect to an android apple device or laptop   in order to play music through learning apps like simply piano  skoove  playground sessions  etc  you will need a midi output  the midi cord is not included but can be purchased separately according to whether you are connecting to an android device  ipad iphone or laptop the first keyboard we purchased from another vendor did not have a midi output so we returned it  our   y o son is a beginner and we wanted him to be able to use learning apps like simply piano  etc there s also an aux input port to play music from your phone or mobile device  through your keyboard he loves it      
52,1.0 ,                       one of the tweeters speaker went out after a few minutes of using it  did not turn up the volume to a crazy level  i left it at the volume level it was when i open the box  probably is no longer available and i will be returning this     
53,5.0 ,                       i am very pleased with my rockjam rj      keyboard   the quality of play and sound that you get for the money is absolutely a value for the money   i love playing this keyboard   have had it for   months now with no problems   this is a best buy for your money      
54,5.0 ,                       cannot beat this for the price  our daughter decided she wants to play piano  so we went this route for more until we know if she s going to stick with it  the sound is very nice      
55,5.0 ,                       this keyboard is very easy to move from place to place and the headphones work great  the stand doesn t hold very heavy books objects  but it holds my ipad  the bench is comfortable  and the entire keyboard is easy to assemble      
56,1.0 ,                       beginners only  that s it  this is not meant for experts      
57,4.0 ,                       love the keyboard but the bench is a little flimsy and the keyboard stand isn t as firm as i would like it to prevent it from falling over so easily      
58,5.0 ,                       this has bright so much joy to our son  it was extremely well priced and the quality is great  he has spent lots of time practicing and has become great in a short time because this is easy to use and easy to learn on  very satisfied     
59,2.0 ,                       i hoped this keyboard would be more interactive for a beginner   the free music songs are only downloadable on a i phone or i pad    i have neither and was unable to download on my computer  seat was broken on arrival very disappointed overall      
60,5.0 ,                       very nice for the price   this is not a top of the line keyboard but for the price it s a great product   perfect for my   year old who is just starting out     
61,5.0 ,                       love it      
62,5.0 ,                       this was a christmas gift for my grandchildren   they love exploring the sound options   the key labels make it easy for them to read beginning sheet music by matching the notes on the staff   entertaining and educational   this gift is a hit      
63,5.0 ,                       bought for my   year old birthday  he has been begging for a grown up piano and this one was perfect  he loves it and the stand  chair and headphones were a great add on to make him feel like he s using a grown up piano        
64,5.0 ,                       easy to set up  lightweight  and the press of the keys are similar enough to a piano but i ve yet to encounter a keyboard that      mimics the keys and sound of a grand piano  the tone is good enough for teaching and practicing  the sheet music stand is incredibly flimsy like     it bends    horribly but i enjoyed the ease of setup and it s a good deal for the products  the keys when pressed do not stutter and repeat like some other competitors and i m incredibly glad for that  it came early and safely  it was well packaged and i m very happy      
65,5.0 ,                       it s been a year and my kids still use it      
66,5.0 ,                       el tama o es conveniente   a mi hijo le fascina ideal para principiantes y para  conocedores     
67,5.0 ,                       for the price and functions as a beginner can t be beat  would buy again      
68,5.0 ,                       this is the perfect thing for a beginner piano player  i didn t want to spend a lot of money on something until i knew how well the learning would go and how much it would actually get used  so far so good  i like the sound and i love the headphones that help to keep everyone else in the family from having to hear the beginner sessions  highly recommend this      
69,4.0 ,                       my    year old daughter loves this keyboard  the only complaints are that the piano sound setting doesn t really sound like a piano  the record feature only lasts for about    seconds  so if you want to record an actual song it isn t long enough for that  great for beginners but will eventually need to be upgraded if your child really wants to explore the creating their own beats and songs      
70,1.0 ,                       i bought two of these for my grandchildren s christmas  one stopped working just prior to the refund date and the other stopped working after the refund date  don t waste your time and money      
71,5.0 ,                       this piano is great for a beginner child  my  yr old is able to work it and loves playing with it      
72,5.0 ,                       great for kids  high quality  great purchase at an affordable price     
73,1.0 ,                       this seems like it would be great  if it worked  some of the keys didn t work  defects happen  but it took almost an hour on chat with customer service to get a replacement and it won t arrive for another   weeks  this was a christmas gift for a child  so the situation is very disappointing      
74,5.0 ,                       easy to assemble label  and fun to learn      
75,3.0 ,                       the stand is flimsy trash  it was leaning to the side in days and broken in a weak  power cord is short  keyboard comes with letters  had to watch youtube  video to know where to place them  other than those things my   yr old daughter loves it      
76,5.0 ,                       great     
77,5.0 ,                       this a great beginner piano because it comes with everything u would want  it came with stickers to learn how to play the keyboard and i loved it  the sound quality was also very good and love how u can change the volume      
78,5.0 ,                       my    year old granddaughter bought this piano with her birthday money  i was really impressed with the sound and the quality of this product  i recommend it highly      
79,2.0 ,                       this is pretty good for a young child  the sound is not the greatest  and sounds like a high end toy  the letters on the stickers began to wear off after two weeks  the keys make a lot of noise and it takes away from the music  one key stuck from time to time  but not always  the bench and stand are actually pretty stable  easy to put together  i must say that the owners manuel was the easiest manuel i have ever used in my life  very step by step and clear as daylight  i m going to fork out the      for a really good one  so  you get what you pay for      
80,5.0 ,                       the perfect keyboard for learning  my son loves it and just in time for the holidays      
81,4.0 ,                       it s a great keyboard   i can use it well     
82,1.0 ,                       it is overall very nice and easy to learn but it malfunctioned and broke after only a few months of very light use  i attempted tp get a hold of customer service several times with no answer  luckily amazon was able to give me a refund  unfortunately with a     restocking fee but at least i got most of my money back      
83,5.0 ,                       i love this keyboard i just started playing a month ago and this is a great beginning keyboard  i had no problems with it the keys are stiff but i was told that the stiffness wears out  the speakers work the headphones work the chair and stand both also work and the instructions were easy and it came with all the nails and gears  i couldn t be happier about this keyboard          
84,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my six year old grandson and he loves it  he s taking piano lessons and this size is just right for him to practice on  i bought a colored keyboard add on which is helping him to memorize the hand finger positions      
85,4.0 ,                       this keyboard is awesome  easy to use  easy to learn  comfortable seat  nice stand      
86,5.0 ,                       i purchased this for my son  this piano is awesome  sound is amazing and has many features construction of the base and char were extremely simple and painless to complete  definitely a great product      
87,4.0 ,                       en general el piano es muy bueno para aprender y sacarle mucho provecho  lo  nico malo que tengo que decir del piano que compre es que vino con un desperfecto de fabrica debido a que el asiento llego con una soldadura rota en la parte de abajo en donde se une la base  fuera de ese detalle esta todo bien      
88,4.0 ,                       my daughter wants to learn piano just opened set up today fresh out the box she likes it and is enjoying to early to say if i would recomend but if it holds up i think it will be a great buy at reasonable price if it doesn t hold up i will review my review and update i researched but with so many amazon sellers offering rebates or free items for review i m sketchy on all reviews but so far so good i m taking time to right a review that s legit for other customers quality is about what u expect sounds good but your not taking it in a studio to make beats stand and seat is so so but for a    year old to try to learn piano it s pretty darn good for price  it s only been   hours if problems in the next day or two or even this week i ll update review     
89,5.0 ,                       we have a budding musician in our   year old little girl   she just spends countless hours working through the keyboard   great value for the price and it sounds great      
90,5.0 ,                       this has been a big hit  easy to set up and use  looks sharp and sturdy and much more expensive than it was  stool is pretty solid too  lots of features  great buy      
91,5.0 ,                       great for my granddaughter and love that you can learn from your ipad       
92,1.0 ,                       the first one they sent just stopped working after   uses  i ll update this review once replacement is used      
93,5.0 ,                       i like it because is a light weight keyboard and instructions easy to understand for my daughter      
94,5.0 ,                       this is the perfect instrument for a young person learning piano without a piano   my grandson is    and expressed an interest in playing piano  he is taking  lessons and enjoys the keyboard very much   his words are very portable  helps him play and practice   e likes all the extras that come with this model       
95,1.0 ,                       not worth it   my    year old used his birthday money on purchasing this upon arriving i thought it was pretty nice and may have been a good buy after all    weeks later he unplugs the power cord from the back of the piano and it s broke  a piece on the inside broke and just keeps pushing back when you try to plug it up  now his birthday money was wasted  i m not sure if the product he received may have been a defect but i def don t want to take a chance again      
96,3.0 ,                       okay so  this is definitely for a young kid or tween  i m    and it s a bit too  kiddish  for me  the size is fine but the sound makes it seem like a toy  also not super sturdy on carpet so make sure it s on a non carpeted surface  overall it s not bad because it gets the job done but if you re an adult trying to learn  spend a little more money on something of better quality      
97,1.0 ,                       the earphones were broken from the beginning  only one ear worked and was a hassle to return so said forget it and kept it  within months the stand broke  very flimsy      
98,5.0 ,                       for the price this is a quality and fun keyboard with a good stand and strong stool  and it comes with headphones too  my kids love it      
99,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          we are in love with this piano   my   year old  started his piano classes las week he is only gone to   classes and he is already living it  love the sound of the piano perfect and steady chair that comes it is   loveeeee the headphones    that way he can practice all he wants without disturbing anyone in the house     
100,1.0 ,                       three years ago  i purchased a different digital keyboard that was fifty dollars cheaper than this one  over all  i would rate my previous experience with the other keyboard as positive  with the other keyboard  the piano sounds were pleasant and even though not nearly as good as a pricier model that is musician quality  the sounds were fairly convincing  additionally  with the cheaper keyboard  there was a decent selection of pre programmed songs and the tutorial section was fairly well done and fun to use i can say none of those things about the rockjam rj     the worst part of this particular keyboard is the sound quality  the grand piano  for example  is totally synthetic and is not in any way  convincing  it sounds plastic and cheap  furthermore  the tutorial section is basically useless and the selection of songs you can learn with it is lacking and uninspiring  to make matters worse  the action on the keys is horrific  i cannot think of a single good thing to say about this product  not one single positive thing to say about it when i bought  the rockjam  i didn t have very high expectations  i knew that i wasn t buying a professional grade instrument  but i made the mistake of assuming that since i was spending fifty dollars more than what i spent the last time i bought a digital keyboard  that it would be better than the one i bought before it wasn t better  not in any way  shape or form  i cannot think of any circumstance in which someone should even consider purchasing this product  not even for a young child  for the quality you are getting  you would be much better served buying a much cheaper model  at least that way  even if the cheaper model isn t very good  you won t have spent the extra money to get garbage      
101,5.0 ,                       great value  perfect for my   year old to start learning the piano  i even play it from time to time  heavy duty hardware doesn t feel cheap or like is gonna fall apart  honestly great for what you re paying      
102,5.0 ,                       my son received this for christmas after he struck an interest in music  it seems to be good quality and just what he needed for a beginner piano player  he s just been teaching himself to play with the note stickers that go on the keys      
103,1.0 ,                       lasted   year  was great while it lasted but one day it stopped powering on  i d adjust the cord and at a particular angle power back up but only for a short time      
104,1.0 ,                       do not buy this  it smelled up my whole living room for days  i let it air out on a fresh day but it continued to smell very strongly for weeks  especially when on for a long period of time  now i see sears has posted a california proposition warning on it         
105,5.0 ,                       grand child likes using it     
106,4.0 ,                       keyboard is good and my kid is happy to use it   unfortunately   headset stopped working with in few days  but when i contacted the seller i got good response and they are going to send me new headset   i appreciated the customer support       
107,2.0 ,                       get what you pay for  got this for my kid to learn the basics  legs are a bit too flimsy  sound is just ok      
108,1.0 ,                       we loved this keyboard for a very few months untik it stopped accepting the battery source plug  it doesn t turn on  we tried to buy a new battery cord but it still won t turn on  don t waste your money        
109,1.0 ,                       it was wonderful until the power stopped working and it wouldn t play      
110,3.0 ,                       for the price and for a beginner  it is perfect  set it at a height that is perfect for my   year old  she has practiced almost everyday for a few months now and has moved on to songs  so it is serving its purpose very well  but  and unless there are settings i haven t figured out  you don t get any of the key tap sound sensitivity like you would on a higher end piano keyboard  to play real songs  you are missing     of the experience and that is the volume of the ringing dependent on how hard or soft you hit a key  so imagine a robot singing monotone compared to a human singing the same song  it s like that  i tried playing yiruma  the river flows in you on it like i do on a real piano and wow  same notes  same person playing  but on this keyboard  the song is unrecognizable  so just know what you are buying      
111,5.0 ,                       easy to use and set up  sound quality is good  perfect for beginners      
112,5.0 ,                       great piece   bought it for my grandson  thinking of buying one for myself if i can figure out where to put it      
113,5.0 ,                       the grandsons really enjoy their keyboards   the older grandson has started to pick out keys and with practice will be entertaining us all      
114,4.0 ,                       great product  love the key stickers  only problem i ve had is the stand is not very sturdy  bench is nice and comfortable  great product for the price      
115,4.0 ,                       the keyboard looks good  the bench is great  i thought it would include the microphone but it didn t  there was a big box and no list of what the contents were supposed to be  i haven t had it long enough to say that i love it      
116,1.0 ,                       the power cord did not work out of the box  i used another cord and after about    minutes of playing  the lowers keys stopped working      
117,5.0 ,                       my son learned so much from the app and the keyboard  he loves to play now      
118,3.0 ,                       i am unable to find tone code for indian instrument sounds like harmonium sound and also rhythms tables sounds etc  manual is also not helping if someone knows  let me know  is it possible to import sounds  rhythms etc  i wish that i should have looked earlier      
119,1.0 ,                       this lasted   year before the circuit board for power went bad      
120,5.0 ,                       plays     
121,2.0 ,                       my son loved it and practiced it but recently a key has stopped working  we ve had it less than a year      
122,1.0 ,                       seriously  box was said to be damaged  i m okay with that but when i pulled it out  the keyboard was crumbling apart  plastic shards spilled onto the floor  i d be okay with a crack  accidents happen  i d return without a bad review  but there is no excuse for the condition i received it in      
123,5.0 ,                       this was a gift for my nephews family and they are so over joyed with it  exactly as described and sound perfect  this is easy for them as beginners already in just a few days are playing like pros      
124,5.0 ,                       we just recieved this  the absolute perfect gift for my son  it teaches you the keys on a keyboard  has many features and definitely has the wow factor  for the price you can t go wrong  it comes with headphones and a bench but it s not adjustable  no biggie  it has stickers you can place on the keys to help learn  i love this item so much i highly recommended it to my moms group  it arrived fast and it s in perfect condition  i did add the        year warranty just for piece of mind      
125,1.0 ,                       fist thing i noticed was that as soon as it was plugged in a faint but annoying buzzing comes rom the speakers regardless of how low the volume is    nd is that some of the white keys were bent enough to the left or right that they actually catch on the ones beside them making it impossible to play  didn t even get to unpack the whole thing before i realized it needed to be returned      
126,5.0 ,                       bought this for my   year old  she loves it and so does her    year old sister   seems to be good quality so far  only had it a month  the sound is good  there are so many options of music and sound  it comes with stickers for the keys      
127,4.0 ,                       great little product   everything you need is included   only complaint is that the volume automatically turns on at full blast every time you power it up   not a problem for the older kids  but when my toddler turns the keyboard on and starts jamming  everyone jumps out of their skin and races for the volume control      
128,1.0 ,                       i am a beginner and was excite to learn how to play the piano   the keyboard was easy to set up  the chair is comfortable   once i plug in  there s an interference with radio frequency playing in the background   i tried difference outlets in the house  away from antenna and cell phones  nothing worked   the background noise was distraction for me to learn   i ve googled and looked around in the reviews  it doesn t appear to be a common problem for most   i even called amazon support  no one was able to solve the problem      
129,3.0 ,                       while the keys do work and the variety of sounds and styles are nice  my biggest problem is that the keyboard is somehow not in right key pitch  the middle c sounds way too high than average and when i move down the the first c it is way too low to use  i m fairly disappointed with this  no matter the brand or piano  middle c should sound the same through out  for the time being  before i invest into a higher quality piano  i will use it to practice via muscle memory than sound      
130,4.0 ,                       i got this as a gift and it was a wonderful way to introduce the piano  the sound is a little off  but works great and is a great price for beginners  i definitely would take advantage of the app is comes with because it helps learning tremendously  it s the most popular electronic in our house      
131,1.0 ,                         of the keys stopped working    we have had the piano less then   months  my kid really has little interest so it s been sitting in my room not being used   we turned it on today and   of the keys no longer work   i would say you get what you pay for   spend the extra and get something that last more then   months      
132,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my   yo son who is learning the piano   i thought it was a great buy     comes with a stand and a stool so he can keep it set up in his room   he has enjoyed having it and navigated through the menus pretty well   it also comes with labels to put on the keys which is very helpful      
133,4.0 ,                       granddaughter loved it as christmas gift   offered training course requires ipad to use   still haven t figured it out  but will eventually      
134,5.0 ,                       grand daughters really enjoying   they are quickly able to learn the use of each function   this keyboard has great sound and is well worth the money      
135,5.0 ,                       this sounds wonderful  i was worried it was going to be more like a toy but it really sounds great  my daughter is really happy and the santa brought her that out of all things   i like the fact that it comes with headphones so that i don t have to always listen to it   it has a tempo setter it also has a program where the child can actually play song by a diagram that flashes on the screen showing them which keys to push in time teaching them the song  this was a good buy      
136,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my wife s birthday  she loves and has been learning to play the people a few times a week  good buy for someone wanting to play the piano but not spend an arm and a leg      
137,5.0 ,                       great quality my granddaughter loves this piano if you re thinking about buying it you should     
138,5.0 ,                       purchase for grandchildren to play on when visitingme   they r enjoying it     
139,5.0 ,                       should have bought ear plugs for myself        
140,5.0 ,                       my grand daughter mikailah love it  i think that it is very appropriate for a beginner      
141,5.0 ,                       absolutely a great value  bought this for our    year old son who is just dabbling in piano and he loves it  it comes with a folding stool and a set of legs to support the piano as well as headphones and a manual on learning to play  it has alot of great features that youd expect from a more expensive piano  we were very happy with this as is our son      
142,5.0 ,                       i got this for my    year old daughter and she loved it        
143,3.0 ,                       good for beginners  but some quality is lacking   stand doesn t feel very sturdy  paint was flaking off one of the legs of the seat and an earpiece for the headphones is broken   other than that  seems to be an easy one to start with and learn on      
144,4.0 ,                       i ve never owned a keyboard so i don t have anything else to compare this to but from what i have seen with this keyboard it s very simple to learn to use right out of the box  i ve already learned several simple tunes through simple piano  my teenage children who ve never shown interest in learning an instrument like to sit down at this keyboard and play  i think it s greta to have in the house for th family  i ve always wanted to learn to play piano and the violin since a child and now as an adult i ve given myself the joy of learning to play an instrument  it s a great hobby and very soothing after a long hard day at work      
145,1.0 ,                       all around this is one super cheap keyboard  terrible sound  terrible settings      
146,5.0 ,                        easy to learn   is an odd thing  it s  easy  if the time is put in    haven t used the lessons   got to replace a bulky old out of tune piano   like the setting options and volume increase     
147,5.0 ,                       bought for grandson learning to play and taking lessons   great starter and he loves it      
148,4.0 ,                       great product for the price    if you are looking for something to start out or for a child learning to play this is prefect has so many functions keeps my daughter entertained for hours the only reason it s   instead of   stars is the packaging it came dented luckily the product was undamaged      
149,5.0 ,                       i purchased this for my kids  their ages are       and    the set up was easy and everything was packaged perfectly  well except the stickers that go on the keys  those were wrinkled a bit and when i needed to stick them in the keys  one or two of them were folded  other than that the sound is great the headphones work and everyone in the family is learning how to use it  it was the best present i got my kids they are working together and not fighting   i loved the price of the product and the quality is great as well      
150,5.0 ,                       nice for the beginners      
151,3.0 ,                       for the price it includes a lot  i am a vocal coach so i needed something more reliable then my ancient casio  i received it timely however on opening the stool broke   the handle is made of cheap materials so be careful headphones are also cheap however the most important things to me are the piano and stand  for the price its fair  i am using it for everyday use not for gigs so fair      
152,3.0 ,                       this item was suppose to come with   months free lessons  the notice i got states lessons start december          i just got it this week how can lessons start before i get product       
153,4.0 ,                       missing cross member for stand that piano sits on and one of the fasteners inside of piano to fasten piano down  piano is fine and works good  get what you pay for i guess update amazon was great with replacing it  just sent me a whole new piano and i didn t have to send old one back first  the new keyboard came with everything and works good kids love it      
154,3.0 ,                       i bought this for my    year old and he loved it but after using it about   times the speaker started sounding distorted now everytime i press a key the speaker makes that electric buzzing type sound but the headphones still work great     
155,3.0 ,                       the sound on this keyboard isn t that great  but other than that  it does the job  my daughter is able to learn her songs on it and it is a decent option until we can invest into something better      
156,5.0 ,                       perfect affordable option for my   yo daughter   she s been taking lessons for a couple years now and this is a step up from her previous keyboard      
157,4.0 ,                       easy to assemble  kids love it  training my kids to play it and they are actively enjoying  the keyboard  lots of options to have fun with the kiddos as beats are pre made and you can play along to them      
158,4.0 ,                       great product for kids just starting out  it seems very lightweight and cheap though  it works well but i don t know that it will be very durable  the headphone jack came loose the first day off use  just from bumping it against something  we can still use it  but have had to tape it in a certain spot for it to work      
159,1.0 ,                       i bought this piano for my kids and myself to learn to play   we just received the package today   i set it up properly  and within a few hours of me playing on it  the power started glitching out and eventually turning off completely   it would turn back on  only to glitch again   mins later and turning off   very frustrating when you re in the middle of practicing   i then moved it to a different outlet in another room  hoping it was just faulty   same problem   i even then attempted batteries to which i still had the same problem i am hoping maybe this was just a faulty one out of the batch  but it was really discouraging and disappointing   especially since me and the kids have eagerly been waiting on its arrival   other than that  it is the perfect size for my    year old   my   year old struggles a little bit on the piano but that s mostly just due to his age and little fingers   he also has no experience playing the sound quality was fine   but my ears aren t tuned to fine piano ing since i m just a beginner   i haven t really tried out the headset at this point   and i haven t reached out to customer service since it is so late at night  hopefully i can get it resolved or just buy a more expensive piano after returning it      
160,5.0 ,                       great keyboard  my    year old loves it  she was so happy to receive it  the seat is sturdy  i m     pounds and had no problems  overall a great purchase      
161,5.0 ,                       gave this to my granddaughter for christmas   she loved it and was sufficient for her need      
162,3.0 ,                       the keyboard itself has been good  sounds decent for the price  gave it as a gift to my    year old and she hasn t taken much interest in it so it s barely been used and even with that little use the stool broke  in a part where it looks like it was welded together so there s no fixing it       
163,5.0 ,                       daughter loves it        
164,5.0 ,                       i m gonna write an honestly review  i battled with the idea of owning a piano for a few years after getting my house  the house is a split floor plan and no matter how hard we planned  it made no sense to bring a piano up a flight of stairs to the living room or down a flight of stairs to the den  we chose this keyboard and it s light weight  portable and sounds great  i absolutely love it  i have no desire to ever own the real piano after getting this keyboard  the best is i can move it up and down the stairs with no issues  i don t even the free piano lessons  i like to just youtube songs  and i don t think all the buttons are easy to use  but overall my entire family has been enjoying this keyboard  i recommend      
165,1.0 ,                       it broke before we had it for a year  cheap stuff don t buy it  you get a better deal at target and it lasts       
166,1.0 ,                       the ac adapter does not work so i have no idea how the keyboard worksupdate    amazon replaced the ac adapter it came today  and the darn keyboard does not work it turns on and there is no sound     
167,5.0 ,                       my kids love it     
168,5.0 ,                       it sounds really good  excellent for beginners      
169,4.0 ,                       works good     
170,5.0 ,                       piano has too many features for me  so cool  teaching myself piano is fun on this keyboard  i have thin walls  so i plug in my own headphones and the neighbors are saved from my annoying plunking and botched practice songs  stable stand  great keyboard  i don t use the bench seat and i place the unit next to the wall as the music stand is not durable  and the headphones are cute  and work well  but hurt greatly after    mins of practice  i ordered a micro usb to midi adapter and with my various free apps  i m able to connect piano to program and learn even faster haven t tried their free piano classes  looked like a hassle      
171,4.0 ,                       i rent a small room and it doesn t take up much space  it also came with headphones  so the neighbor won t say it s to loud  the only thing that bothers me are the back support for music sheets and books  it s real flimsy      
172,2.0 ,                       headset stopped working within days     
173,5.0 ,                       bought this as a gift for all   kids  ages            and    and every single one of them loves it  they are actually fighting over it to practice  and the best part is  now they can play without disturbing anyone else because of the headphones  it s really sturdy and well made  especially for the price  easy to assemble  too      
174,5.0 ,                       purchased for my grandaughters birthday she loves it good buy         
175,5.0 ,                       good     
176,5.0 ,                       much better quality than i thought and bigger than i imagined  works great  my granddaughter loves it  see for yourself      
177,1.0 ,                       we set it up and it would be very likely to fall over easily  the stand is horrble    for a little kid to begin on it would fall on them or a pet  it is so unsturdy   i have pets and i could never leave it alone like we did our daughters yamaha  sound quality very inferior      
178,4.0 ,                       it s a relatively cheap keyboard  and the speakers can t handle the volume higher than   when you press more than a couple keys at once  it s also not weighted so you can t adjust the volume of a note by pressing it harder or softer that being said  i think it s great for beginners  both kids and adults  we have an  yo who wanted to learn how to play  but good keyboards are expensive  this is perfect for her to learn on and we can get a better one when she outgrows it  overall it s a good value if you re wanting to learn  but it just doesn t cut it for intermediate or advanced players      
179,4.0 ,                       i bought the rockstar for my son to take piano class in school  he really likes it and i really like the fact that it came with headphones so he can do class  practice and i can t hear it  i would have given it a five except when unboxing and setup  i realized the company seller company did not supply enough  x   thumb screws that the directions was calling for to complete the setup to attach the keyboard to the stand  however the sound quality so far is great for what it going to be used for      
180,3.0 ,                       keyboard is very nice with many options but a couple of pieces arrived broken    the music sheet stand and earphones      
181,5.0 ,                       this was purchased as a christmas gift   we had assembled it and i told my granddaughter to help me in the back room   she went in  saw the keyboard  and the look on her face was priceless   we set it up and she started playing on it   this was the best investment we made  and it made a   year old very happy      
182,5.0 ,                       the piano sounds great  i actually thought the piano was going to be a little to long but i m happy that it fits perfectly where i planned to put it  i love how this came with a headphones just incase you re playing too loud and you can use the headphones  great for beginner and great for kids  if you have a small room or if you live in a small apartment this is perfect  very easy to put together      
183,5.0 ,                       i have seen a few bad reviews on this but this was a good starter bundle as far as we could see   the issue we had was we needed the usb midi interface and we needed to order the model above this one as this keyboard lacks that important feature   outside that feature this was a really nice start set a good value      
184,1.0 ,                       cane broken  lcd display won t light up and loud humming sound     
185,5.0 ,                       great     
186,5.0 ,                       my son s favorite christmas gift  easy to unbox and set up  easy to use  for my   year old  but can be used by adults  my husband loves to play on it too  very satisfied with this product     
187,5.0 ,                       was iffy if this was going to be a decent keyboard  i was very pleased  it shipped quickly and was packaged great  i absolutely love it  great for anyone who just wants to play music  not for someone who plays professionally but it is great to teach on or just play because you love it  the stand is not too sturdy  but fine for people who don t have jumping cats or dogs or kids who don t have manners lol  stool is great  everything was nice except for the head phones which only one ear piece works    don t waste money on something more unless you want a professional keyboard      
188,5.0 ,                       so far so good  it was supposed to arrive tomorrow and it arrived one day sooner      
189,1.0 ,                       amazon does nothing to verify that this product is safe to use and that it is not a health hazard  apart from the fact it stopped working properly  do not buy this product until you get verification that there are no cancer causing parts inside      
190,5.0 ,                       great buy for my nephew      
191,3.0 ,                       bare bones assessment  not a good starter instrumentwhy  keys are particularly hard to press for a starter keyboard  as compared to other similar models  keys are not pressure sensitive  about     way through the press  you get a full volume tone no matter how soft you press  no option for addition of a sustain pedal  usually sold separately don t get fooled by the bait and switch the model has changed or the company is fraudulently using reviews from another model  in either case  it is unlawful to use reviews in advertising which do not reflect the product being offered  i carefully read the reviews and two of them confirmed that it had a jack to allow the addition of a pedal  the unit i was sent did not have the input jack on the back  so it can not be added  i consider this a very important feature      
192,5.0 ,                       works great and sounds great      
193,4.0 ,                         year old loves it   earphones broke within a month but i figured they weren t top of the line  love that you can adjust the height of the keyboard      
194,1.0 ,                       we purchased this for my    year old son who wants to learn piano as an early christmas gift  we set it up and he played on it for about    mins that night before turning it off  he got up the next morning and went to try and play and every     notes he would press it would make a high pitched squeal noise  even when playing on the low keys    we tried turning it off  unplugging it for a bit and trying again but it still was make the horrible noise  emailed rockjam the manufacturer and received an email back stating that the retailer would need to handle the return  contacted amazon and after the amazon rep tried to contact the company but with no luck  she just refunded my money and ups will be picking up the keyboard tomorrow to ship back to amazon  the keyboard itself was really nice when it worked  and the stand and stool were decent as well  but the lack of customer service from the manufacturer is very disheartening  purchase at your own risk      
195,5.0 ,                       great beginner keyboard  my   year old daughter has been practicing on this keyboard for   months now and it has helped her excel  in her piano lessons she has been taking  we have not had any issues with the keyboard  earphones  or bench  the bench is super sturdy and comfortable  everything is great quality      
196,5.0 ,                       great value  my   yr old daughter just started piano lessons and her teacher suggested a keyboard  well this one does it all  set up was easy  loved that it came with a stool and headphones  easy to figure out  we really love it      
197,3.0 ,                       i bought this piano to begin to learn how to play  its a good piano for beginners and children  i personally am not a big fan of this piano because of the sound  it was very easy to assemble and its easy to use  the sound is a bit distorted and it gets cut short  if you don t mind the sound it will be a good piano for you      
198,5.0 ,                       great keyboard  the base is a bit flimsy   could have been made with better aluminum but overall a good product for the price      
199,4.0 ,                       great keyboard  we especially loved that it came as a set for the price  we rated it four stars as we wish it had more piano settings instead of just a grand piano  it has lots of other instruments and sounds though  it is nice that it has a metronome  a digital screen that shows the notes you are playing  and headphones  the petal doesn t seem to be great  overall a solid four with some room for improvements      
200,5.0 ,                       great keyboard for the price     
201,1.0 ,                       stopped working a few months after we got it  manufacturer would not replace or refund  also was  out of tune   notes didn t sound right      
202,1.0 ,                       set it up as instructed and it did not work  i bought   d batteries to see if it was just the adapter  and there is no sign of life it won t power on  there is no customer support from the manufacturer  the only email in the packaging for product support keeps getting kicked back to me  i don t want to have to disassemble the stand and repack everything to send it back to amazon   i just want a piano that works  what a disappointment       tax so we can stare at an unusable piano      
203,5.0 ,                       i purchased this keyboard set for my daughter  who just started piano lessons  set up took me no more than    minutes  and she s already practicing  for a beginner level student who doesn t want to invest too much right away  i think this was a great choice      
204,3.0 ,                       keyboard is good   has lots of settings and sounds   headphones are okay  not the best out there  but definitely okay for kids  the stool is fine  the keyboard stand is trash   i overtightened one of the bolts on the legs and the whole thing came apart   fixed it  then the stand got bumped a few days later and fell apart again   fixed it again  and is currently tolerable      
205,1.0 ,                       i got this delivered yesterday and power plug jack is not fitting properly  piano is not turning on hence will return this  very disappointing     
206,1.0 ,                       extremely disappointed  when i bought it  the power chord did not connect to the keyboard and i had to return it  worst of all i had to pay     dollars in order to send it back and amazon only refunded the amount of the keyboard  now i am out     dollars to never use the product      
207,5.0 ,                       exactly as described  purchased for a   year old  the headphones are a nice touch   great value for the price      
208,5.0 ,                       this thing is awesome i m glad it come with headphones because it really jams but it was the perfect keyboard to start with i really dig it      
209,3.0 ,                       if you are looking to purchase this be prepared to buy a stand as well  my stand is significantly off balanced and uneven  i can t even set my keyboard on it to begin playing      
210,1.0 ,                       after a few months there is a static noise in the background that makes playing very difficult   it s a loud static hum  we have tried new power supply and new batteries but the noice is still there   very distracting when playing      
211,5.0 ,                       when i was young i was given a keyboard and loved it so much that i learned to play piano  later buying myself a full upright that i still play every day  as my son shares many of my interests  i bought this keyboard for his   th birthday last august  at first he liked to play  guess the instrument  with me  by configuring the settings and pressing a key   a difficult thing to guess  because like all keyboards  the sound of a violin or clarinet is not entirely accurate    it s been about six months now and he loves the keyboard more than ever  now he plays fluidly with both hands  and i m impressed by how well the keyboard handles simultaneous keys  he has learned to configure the keyboard in a way that he can play a different  instrument  for treble or bass sections simultaneously  even if he never makes a lifelong hobby of it  i feel that my investment in this keyboard has paid off with the sheer amount of time he s spent on it  all at his own discretion  too      
212,5.0 ,                       surprised when i saw it out of the box     
213,5.0 ,                       daughter loves using it and is steadily learning how to play     
214,5.0 ,                       love     
215,4.0 ,                       nice keyboard for beginners  and very loud  i just got it couple of weeks back so can t tell much about durability  but i can tell that few parts are cheaply made such as lcd screen cover  you get what you pay      
216,5.0 ,                       been really happy with this so far  whole family plays it daily  good starter keyboard      
217,5.0 ,                       purchased this for my daughter  she uses it everyday      
218,5.0 ,                       my grandson was playing songs in no time      
219,1.0 ,                       this piano has a strong chemical plastic smell  even weeks after it arrived and despite us trying to  air it out    we are extremely disappointed   it seems to irritate the eyes and throat as well   we unfortunately did not keep the box but if we had i would return it immediately  i would appreciate if the seller would follow up with us      
220,5.0 ,                       i wanted this to see if my   year old grandson might be musically inclined  maybe he would like to take lessons  it does everything i need it to do  sounds good to me  i am happy with my purchase      
221,1.0 ,                       no no no no no   this is for my daughters birthday this weekend  she wanted the whole setup  i only got the keyboard    shes gonna be so upset  i need this fixed      
222,5.0 ,                       really a good deal for the price      
223,4.0 ,                       the keyboard in question was rather nice and it has some excellent settings on it to really get one into the art of finger dancing  however  my headphones that i got with it went out in one ear on the second day of use and the keyboard is rather light  so it s easy to push over  so i ve had to add weights on the end  the electronic interface has some issues in respects of the notes are just slightly above where the should be at multiple angles  so learners may have to rewire their brain to try and figure out the differences between an a note and b note positioned on the scale  overall nice sound quality  though      
224,5.0 ,                       easy setup and granddaughter loves it      
225,4.0 ,                       my kids are absolute monsters and they still haven t broken this keyboard or stand   i feel dumb for buying the additional service plan      
226,2.0 ,                       this is a small child s keyboard   and that wasn t clear in the description      
227,5.0 ,                       this is a nice keyboard  my teen is learning to play and loves it  the sound quality is great and we are happy with our purchase     
228,5.0 ,                       i can t believe all the bang for your buck you get  a nice stand and music stand  with a great cushiony sturdy bench  soooo many beats too  i m just amazed at how you get all you need for such a bargain  thank you         
229,5.0 ,                       i should wait a little bit more to write a review for this product  but honestly i feel really good with this selection for my kid  the sound is so good to be a basic and for beginners  the overall quality of the hardware is good  and the plus given by the stand and the chair are just great      
230,5.0 ,                       my   year old was starting piano lessons and we found this keyboard on sale   great product   good size for kids  and comes complete with stand and stool   we haven t used the learning apps just yet  but very happy with the purchase      
231,5.0 ,                       i love this game i never knew about this game until my god children was planet they taught me how to play it      
232,5.0 ,                       here we re learning how to play piano  surprisingly this piano sounds good  and it s great for beginners      
233,1.0 ,                       my grandchild is disappointed piano keys stick he s not able to enjoy   i would like to return but i don t have the box pls respond  i would like to be compensated    pls respond     
234,4.0 ,                       great keyboard piano for little ones to explore their musical interests  my only reason for not giving it a perfect score is the fact that the volume goes from   to     and resets to     half power  every time you turn it on   how many of your other electronic devices  don t recall the settings from a prior session   nothing like having to remind  holler at  the kiddo every time they turn this toy on      
235,5.0 ,                       love it    easy to learn and set up  bang for the bucks  arrived super fast  thank you so much amazon  i highly recommend your site for all purchasing needs      
236,5.0 ,                       bought this for a beginner piano player  compact  comes with a seat and built in metronome  highly recommend     
237,5.0 ,                       i debated getting this for quite a while   after all my son is only two so why would i spend so much   but then i looked at toddler keyboards and they were       i might as well get something that will grow with him for twice the amount   i love this thing   he figured it out immediately and even started learning simple songs   there are tons of features i will likely never learn   the only thing i m not a fan of is everytime it turns on it starts at a really high volume   the volume is adjustable but the increments are not linear so i have to keep it on the lowest setting  which is still pretty loud    he s learning so much  i am really happy i got it   as he grows i m sure we ll try out other features   setup was really easy  too      
238,4.0 ,                       perfect beginner piano and super easy set up  less then    minutes  my kids love it      
239,3.0 ,                       im a beginner learning piano  and i have many songs i want to learn to play on piano unfortunately the piano i got has   white keys that make no sound    of which are essential for the songs i want to play  and   black keys that also dnt work this causes a problem cuz well i cant play any song to completion like this     
240,3.0 ,                       i have asked multiple times for replacement headphones with zero response     i d love to rate this horribly but the piano is great    my sons love it and play on it every day   not sure if that s a blessing or not loljust need new headphones        
241,4.0 ,                       works great for an inexpensive keyboard   has a lot of features and the stool is pretty sturdy      
242,5.0 ,                       this is the best birthday gift i ever bought for my son he s taught his self to play so many songs and he s only had it since september definitely a wonderful product purchased     
243,5.0 ,                       this keyboard is great for beginners and really good for the price     
244,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my five year old granddaughter for christmas  it was very simple to set up and she plays it every day      
245,1.0 ,                       no power supply  no screen  no manual i have contacted amazon  x   nada garbage product  without a power supply   it was meant to be a christmas gift  worthless  product snd worthless customer support      
246,5.0 ,                       for the price it s so good and it works awesome     i like it a lot   the  assembling it s easy to do and it s not a lot     so it s all good      
247,3.0 ,                       usable for a beginner  keys closer together than on an acoustic  if you plan to buy a real piano  i wouldn t get too use to this one because you will be training your hands improperly for the real thing      
248,5.0 ,                       exactly as described  my daughter loves it      
249,5.0 ,                       amazing piano keyboard  my kid is enjoying a lot      
250,5.0 ,                       bought for my daughters birthday  she absolutely loves it  love that it came with key stickers also  no need to buy them separately  this was a good buy  all pro s  no cons         
251,1.0 ,                       arrived defective     leftmost keys did not work   they produce no sound  still usable for a complete beginner      
252,1.0 ,                       waste of money   now amazon is a platform for selling chinese trash     
253,5.0 ,                       my daughter really loves it  i love that the keys are labeled  she easily taught herself several songs  i may even be able to teach myself a few      
254,4.0 ,                       awesome product at a nice price  the only complaint i have with the keyboard itself is the little tiny screws included did nothing to hold the stand together  we replaced them with bigger screws  problem solved  my little guy thinks this is the best thing since minions  the sound is good  has big keys to give a  real piano  feel  it has several tones  rhythm and percussion options  along with some nice demo songs  headphones are a plus  overall  this looks decent  feels nice  and plays rather well  maybe not for a  professional   but perfect for my little guy to learn on  it even looks cool enough that the older guys like playing with it  the only disappointment lay not in the piano  but in the bonuses  the included joytunes app is only for ipad  the extra skoove membership is only for pc  there is no midi on the keyboard  but i didn t expect one for the price  oh  and the volume resets every time you turn it on  which can be surprising      
255,2.0 ,                       overall great keyboard set  comes with a decent stand and seat  easy assembly  quality keyboard as well with that said  this package was missing the lcd monitor which is the main reason i purchased this keyboard i relayed this message to amazon  which they had sent me a new keyboard set all together which was also missing the lcd monitor  very unhappy  no reimbursement for the lcd monitor either       
256,5.0 ,                       for the price the sound is as expected  can sound like a toy more than a piano    but it is a stepping stone to see if our son is all in and great starting tool to get into playing a full size     
257,1.0 ,                       the speakers produced so much feedback it was impossible to play  i ve never heard so much feedback from a keyboard before  tried with headphones on thinking maybe could be salvaged  same thing  clearly an electrical problem  will be returning the product      
258,5.0 ,                       bought this as a christmas present for my boyfriend and he loves it  he s played piano in the past but got out of touch with it and this was a great purchase to get him back into it  the stool is a little debatable so he uses a chair      
259,1.0 ,                       the keyboard sound is now on high and you can t lower it   nor can my grandson use headphones because of the loud sound   he was not abusive to the keyboard   it just stopped working and it is too late for amazon to do anything about it   very disapppointed with the product and would not recommend it   i am waiting for a response from the company  but since they are in the uk and would probably have to pay for shipping it seem unlikely i will get the fixed and therefore have to buy a new one   it will not be from this company      
260,5.0 ,                       value for money  bought for a beginner  it has been played with everyday      
261,3.0 ,                       my kids all enjoy this   more suited for my    year old   originally my    year old wanted to learn it       
262,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this for my daughter when she was    perfect size  great quality  inexpensive  we ve had it for almost   years now  end her baby sister uses it and she s not soft at all  i am amazed by the durability of the material used to make this keyboard      
263,5.0 ,                       got this for my   year old son  perfect for him and he plays on it about everyday for the past   months  nice all in one package without overspending      
264,5.0 ,                       i am    years old  was looking for to learn keyboard  went to guitar center keyboard prices are around             range  did some google search and checked this items reviews and ordered it  i liked it  it is simple doesnt need too much space  it is reasonable price  i am happy with it ps  yes  i am actual customer bought this item  not the ones who gets discounts from seller to give good review ali     
265,1.0 ,                       at first the piano worked perfectly after   weeks it started making a loud noise when you press two keys at the same time  and we have to be turning it off and on all the same so that the loud noise stops  not recommending this piano      
266,1.0 ,                       the stand was a main reason i got this package rather than just a keyboard  i have a very small house and it s easier to have it on the stand as opposed to finding a place to store it  the stand came without the screw holes so i couldn t even set it up  i ve contacted the company and they asked for proof of purchase and it s been    weeks since i even heard back  if i could send it back  i would but i recycled the box the same week i got it so i could store it  i didn t find out the stand wasn t usable until i went to set it up      
267,5.0 ,                       my son loves it and never had a lesson but loves sound so perfect match      
268,5.0 ,                       i really like this keyboard   it isn t cheesy at all   amazed at the quality for the price      
269,5.0 ,                       made for a great christmas gift for my son  great bundle of stuff for the price point for sure     
270,1.0 ,                       please listen to the reviewers on the issues  they are real unboxed day one the piano already had a  crackling soundwhen attempting to connect to usb  no app or even computer would recognize the keyboard i was not expecting the issues to affect me on day one but they are real the piano is too big for me to ship back to return too      
271,2.0 ,                       i used it once and it stopped working   there is no customer service number to get help   i would not recommend   sounds like it is too cheap      
272,1.0 ,                       only lasted a few months before it started having issues  not it in usable  spend a little more from a known manufacturer  you ll be thanking your self later      
273,5.0 ,                       very good for learning the piano   i am very happy with it      
274,4.0 ,                       i think this is great for the price   perfect for beginners  i got this for my    yr old son for christmas   he loves it  my only complaint is that the on off lights are reversed  the light turns red when it s on   it turns blue when it s off  it s not a huge deal but it s super annoying  the stand is not very sturdy but we just put it up against the wall   be careful with it  the stool is very sturdy  i was pleasantly surprised for the price  overall i think this was a great gift that the whole family can enjoy  we are very pleased with it      
275,1.0 ,                       bought this in december and it broke by january with little use at all  the right speaker doesnt work at all  i ve contacted customer support to no avail  they don t seem to care to replace or repair the keyboard   avoid at all costs     
276,1.0 ,                       this keyboard is already broken and my daughter just got it for christmas   she only plays it about    minutes   or so times a week  it stays in the same location and it s broken   just doesn t turn on anymore   very disappointed what a waste of money     
277,5.0 ,                       great christmas gift for our    year old  very easy to assemble and our    year old has enjoyed all the different sound combinations and ease of playing  she is a beginner and can t wait to play more  the headphones are great so she can practice without disturbing others      
278,5.0 ,                       my son so happy  best gift ever     
279,5.0 ,                       great for kids and beginner     
280,5.0 ,                       i like this product because it is small  easy to ensemble  and fits in my tiny house  i bought it for my baby daughter  trying to get to like to play on the piano  even though she just slams on it and make noises   even if she happens to break it  i would not be sadden by it because it doesn t cost us thousands of dollars like all the grand piano      
281,3.0 ,                       bought for my son  the headphones did not work  we never heard back from the seller  we still kept the keyboard      
282,3.0 ,                       had not played a keyboard in several years and wanted to reconnect with this outlet  but noticed right away that this keyboard sounded tinny and had an awkward ringing sound after the keys were struck while in the basic piano mode  the keyboard i had as a    year old sounded better even after all these years  confirmed via facetime   i wish i had taken a video audio to share   i returned this one and bought a basic yamaha from guitar center and instantly i started to play songs from my piano lessons so long ago  because it sounded closer to the real thing  amazing how that works      
283,5.0 ,                       i have a   and   year old and this keyboard is perfect   sound quality is great  you can add an amplified speaker  headphones  microphone   teaching demo screen works well  my   year old is already playing a song   the stool is great quality and sturdy enough for me to sit in at     lbs   i would recommend this for anyone looking     
284,1.0 ,                       just stopped working out of the blue after using it for about   months  but       for   months of use doesn t seem terrible to me  so where does that leave us    sorry i m still saying   star  because that s a lot of landfill space      
285,1.0 ,                       usb midi port broke and there appears to be no way to contact anyone to get a new one   i cannot use the piano learning program without a working usb midi port      
286,4.0 ,                       great deal  i set this up and my kids were drawn to it like a magnet  i think you get so much for the money  i love that it had headphones so that practices are quiet  my only complaint is that it auto defaults to the volume setting on max high  which i need to correct so my kids don t blow out their eardrums      
287,3.0 ,                       excellent keyboard stool but the earphones stopped working after a few times   luckily we had another pair that work   kids love this and its easy to move around      
288,2.0 ,                       you get what you pay for    this is a very low quality keyboard  it feels cheap and looks cheap  there is a horrible buzzing noise coming from the speakers that sometimes goes away when you slap the back of the piano  headphones fell apart and sound terrible  the stand is not sturdy and wobbles while you play  keys sometimes don t even sound when you press them  and overall this keyboard just does not sound good  the only good thing about it is it comes with a stool  i would recommend investing in a better keyboard  this is more like a cheap toy      
289,5.0 ,                       great gift     
290,5.0 ,                       this keyboard kit is a great value  easy to set up and use  my teen daughter is teaching herself the piano and this was perfect  she loves it      
291,5.0 ,                       its a basic piano that does the job  still holding on  nothing fancy      
292,5.0 ,                       great keyboard  lots of cool features  worth the money  good build and durable      
293,5.0 ,                       at first i was hesitant to purchase this piano because i thought it would be too small for me   but  to my surprise  it works well with me and my grandchildren   i m the beginner with the piano  they are teaching me to play and i m enjoying every minute of it   they love this piano so much that they will drop their instruments  flute and clarinet  to practice with me   the headset is great because it allows you to practice quietly      
294,5.0 ,                       my    year old son loves it      
295,5.0 ,                       teenagers having a good time with it   good for the money   stand and chair are cheap  but the machine itself is pretty decent      
296,5.0 ,                       i love this piano key board  i bought it for my niece who is self taught  she used it fir her talent piece  excellent buy  great value for the       
297,5.0 ,                       superior product   fast shipping     days to korea      
298,5.0 ,                       my son loves it  the bench is the perfect size  the keyboard stand is sturdy and convenient  keyboard seems to be a nice quality so far     
299,5.0 ,                       with the exception of fedex leaving the box in the lobby of my    floor     apt per floor building in the original marked box  on christmas eve without attempting delivery  the keyboard is amazing  the stand requires   minutes of assembly and it is completely adjustable  the headphones are not loud at all  but i purchased this for my   year old daughter and it is by far her favorite gift  the keyboard is perfect for her beginning fingers and i am very happy with my purchase  the adsituonal lessons and pianomaestro app that was included is an amazing perk  this product definitely exceeds the price   i suggest that fedex be cut out of the deal  they almost ruined this review sn  the box was also damaged in the delivery  i could put two fingers inside of the closed box and feel the keys  this may be the cause of so many bad reviews  see photo      
300,5.0 ,                       espectacular relaci n calidad precio  env o sin problemas y en fecha     
301,1.0 ,                       i thought i would take a chance with this product because there were some good reviews and the price was right at    for piano chair n stand   package was delivered a mess and looked like it was dragged through town but we opened packaged anyways hoping it was well packaged internally without damage to the product itself however  like others mentioned there were crooked keys  and cracks in the keys and when playing along with the app it didn t pick up the d note at times   i really really wanted to keep this since it was such a great deal and for my toddler   so disappointed we will have to return and keep looking  on a good note the seat was comfortable and the stand worked well and was sturdy   if u are lucky to get a good piano then this wouldve been a great set  i wanted to add customer service was wonderful to work with  returning the item was easy with at home pickup   i would ve been even more upset if i had to lug it back myself      
302,2.0 ,                       my son loved it  but the little bench broke within a month  they said they would send a new on but never did  about     years later  would only work if you carefully hold the power cable in  bought a new power supply  but no change  it was the piano  then it just stopped working   warranty is only   year so they said  sorry       
303,5.0 ,                       this is a great key board  my wife loves it      
304,3.0 ,                       a decent starter keyboard  the sound quality as in tone is not good  the keys seem to not correspond to the correct scale

308,5.0 ,                       easy to assemble  easy to use   fun for kids and adults of all ages   great sound  does not take up a lot of space   download a piano teaching app and you re all set

310,5.0 ,                       love this  easy to use  works great      
311,1.0 ,                       received keyboard  worked great the first and only time i played     nd time went to play    no sound  will not work      
312,5.0 ,                       this is an ok product  i don t have the space for a piano so this enables me to practice hymns  i love that it has headphones  it does not have the same  feel  as a piano  the keys are not weighted  but it at least lets me practice the simple hymns that i love      
313,4.0 ,                       package arrived without the top crossbar for the stand   without the crossbar  the keyboard doesn t attach to the stand   cannot resolve this issue so far as customer support couldn t help me   we may need to  jimmy rig  the stand ourselves to make it safe   other than that  my   year old son loves it      
314,5.0 ,                       goog learning piano for kids     
315,5.0 ,                       you get a lot of stuff with this keyboard  headphones  stand  seat  lessons  the sound isn t great  but its perfect for someone who is just learning  overall  its a great keyboard for the price  i would recommend it      
316,4.0 ,                       i bought this for my   year old  though i end up playing on it more than she does  it s a great keyboard for beginners  wide selection of tones and beats  fairly simple to operate  we have a lot of fun with it  the sound is fine  and the keys are decent  very pleased with the purchase      
317,5.0 ,                       this keyboard is a great addition to our home  excellent quality  heavy  and very easy to put together  i can t believe the quality of this product for the price point  you won t be disappointed      
318,2.0 ,                       ugh  purchased july   th  and here we are   gently used too   half of the keyboard is no longer registering  and it doesn t wake from standby on those non working keys      
319,5.0 ,                       the quality exceeded my expectations at this price point  the keyboard is steady in the stand  the stool is sturdy  and the sound decent  i just started learning for the first time  as an adult  to play the piano and am loving it   i can see myself using this for a couple of years  and then potentially upgrade      
320,2.0 ,                       i bought this almost a year ago  a few keys at the end were not working from the start  i planned on taking it back but forgot to and just thought it didn t matter since the keys were all the way to the end of the keyboard and i did not think my daughter would use those keys much recently  the power cord has stopped working  i am not sure what to do      
321,1.0 ,                       this keyboard would be a great toy for a young child to pretend to be a musician with  it is not a serious instrument the keys are not weighted  the speakers are muffled  there is not a true sound of a piano or of an organ i would equate the sound of this keyboard to that of a kazoo i would prefer to have a refund      
322,5.0 ,                       i don t normally write reviews  but i had t for this purchase   bought this for my grandson s  th birthday and it s so much bang for the buck   it s awesome    the added   included headphones are amazing   so the kids can practice without w shown having t hear all the time   if you are considering a  learning   keyboard   this is the one you should get         
323,5.0 ,                       great starter piano  i have   little ones and i wanted to expose them to music but also not spend a lot of money on something they could tear up  the fact that it comes with a stand  stool  piano and headphones is a major plus  it also comes with stickable notes that can be placed on the keys to help with learning  within a day of having the piano my   and   year old were both able to play  twinkle twinkle little star  just by me calling out the notes to them  it s the perfect height for both adults and kids  my   year old often hops on there and attempts to play which is why the headphones are absolutely wonderful  the only and i mean only issue i have is the volume is automatically set to the highest level upon turning the keyboard on  i feel it s a little much especially when the kids have on headphones  sometimes the little ones don t turn it down and that causes me some concern for their hearing but other than that it s a solid product that even my munchies haven t been able to destroy  it s a great bundle  if i could make a suggestion maybe a booklet with a few basic songs such as twinkle twinkle  happy birthday etc would be a great addition      
324,5.0 ,                       gift for grand daughter she liked it     
325,1.0 ,                       so this is only the second ever item in about a decade i ve had to return on amazon because of how unfortunately broken it was  i am completely clueless why it doesn t work  but today was literally my first day of owning it  and i played on it for    hour  in that time  there were multiple instances of the volume turning all the way up and down for no discernable reason and it was alternating between all of the different instruments for no discernable reason  sometimes both would even happen  meaning i would be playing at a low volume  and then for no reason  bam  super loud and suddenly the sounds of drums and cymbals it appears this is an unusual problem because i can find no troubleshooting on it  but honestly  it was a super easy return decision for me      
326,5.0 ,                       my entire family uses this  my son     wanted to learn the piano and this works great for him      
327,5.0 ,                       i d give     stars if i could  but i rounded up to   because overall  i like it my major complaint is not being able to connect a pedal  the sustain feature helps but it s definitely not the same  also  the keys dont push in as smoothly as on other  nicer  more expensive keyboards but again  overall  this is great if you just want something cheap and handy to keep up your piano skills or to get kids started  i use it often and it s easy to move around      
328,3.0 ,                       i m really irritated because i m multiple answers to  does it have an midi port   it specifies it does  on the packaging  it claims to have it  in the description  it says it has it  on the actual keyboard itself  it has a spot for the midi port  but no actual port  it s covered by plastic you have to cut off and then no actual port  the keyboard works fine  but it was just disappointing when i was expecting the port     
329,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my nephew and he loves it the sound is beautiful and it has so many features to it the price is so low he well enjoy it for many years      
330,5.0 ,                       really cool     
331,4.0 ,                       this is a decent unit  a good bang for you buck  it will be fine for my aspiring   yr old daughter  we had a casio small keyboard and the quality on the casio is definitely higher however gave this unit   stars review  clearly has never been to a   star hotel or steakhouse  with that being said  it s a solid   star unit      
332,5.0 ,                       great product for a beginner  chose this keyboard for the options and pedal      
333,5.0 ,                       this was a christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it     price is less than half of some of the more expensive brands but the quality seems to be the same   also get the bench and headphones as well   my daughter has had this for almost a year now and she is still on it almost everyday      
334,5.0 ,                       the sound could be better but it is still a nice piano for a low price      
335,5.0 ,                       granddaughter is learning to play music gave for christmas present     
336,4.0 ,                       it s a piano for beginner  i mean if you can afford a better piano you shouldn t get this one    the sound quality is not good  plus the installation is not very stable if you strike the keyboard hard then the whole piano will shake      
337,3.0 ,                       this keyboard is only good for beginners  which is why i purchased it  but i chose this brand because it was supposed to come in with the headphones and adjustable stool  but the stool that i received is not adjustable as it was promised  i m very upset i tossed the package  otherwise i d return it and get another brand      
338,5.0 ,                       this product was easy to set up  i like how our came with everything i d need  headphones  bench  sheet music easel  and even stickers to identify the keys  my son loves playing with it      
339,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my eight year old son and he loves it  works great  the three month free online course is very useful      
340,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my   year old daughter learning to play the piano  this has served her well and will grow with her  she is getting fairly good with her lessons and she has enjoyed having this to practice on  of course her teacher suggested a keyboard that had keys that bounced back like a real piano  but those are not cheap  for the price  this is probably one of the best you can get  we also bought her a foot pedal to learn with as well and it easily plugged into the back and works nicely  it has lots of other fun features to play with      
341,4.0 ,                       i got this for my son and i love it  it makes me feel like a kid again     
342,5.0 ,                       es pr ctico  f cil de instalar     
343,5.0 ,                       kind of difficult to set up but well worth it amazing product comes with every single part comes with a free voucher for lessons for a month overall amazing     
344,3.0 ,                       you won t like playing it  you won t want to record with it  it s mediocre  but it s cheap and has all the parts  yes  you actually get everything you need to play in one box  just plug it in  you can buy one of these and stick it somewhere just to punch notes  it s not good enough to be temporary permanent or permanent temporary  it s a cheap  temporary solution  period      
345,5.0 ,                       purchased for granddaughter to learn on  i was very pleased with quality and the multiple features      
346,5.0 ,                       good keyboard and easy to hold and swing on my idiot brothers head but to bad dreams don t come true i guess i ll just use it what it was ment to be used for     
347,5.0 ,                       great setup  for the price you ge this awesome keyboard  the stand  the bench and it even comes with i believe two free online lessons  this is a killer deal and a great quality item so far  if it doesn t hold up to the test of time then i will update my review     
348,5.0 ,                       just gave this piano keyboard to my   year old granddaughter today   it was easy to put together   she sat right down and started learning how to play by using an app  i think it s called simple piano    the stickers to label the keys are helpful   she is thrilled with this and it sounds great      
349,5.0 ,                       i bought this because i wanted to learn the piano but before i made a huge investment i wanted to make sure i would stick with it  i ve been practicing using youtube videos and studying music theory on my own  i practice every day since i ve had it and it has good stone quality  i ve already learned a few songs  i used stickers to label the keys but i m also learning them  very affordable for a beginner or just someone who wants to have fun but has minimal space  i would absolutely recommend it      
350,5.0 ,                       tal cual como se pidi      
351,4.0 ,                       my    year old  budding piano player loves it and has been practicing on it every day  it s perfect for the beginner player like her  will update rating once we ve had it for a month      
352,3.0 ,                       nice array of sounds to choose from  but the regular piano sound isn t great  keys are all on off  so you can t control the volume of the note by how hard you press the key  decent weight to the keys  but a bit too much lateral play in their motion  maybe this is standard for lower end keyboards  but i was disappointed by it  speakers don t handle the lower pitches as well as the higher ones  the record feature doesn t let you play on top of a recording so don t expect to be able to do any sort of multi track work      
353,1.0 ,                       this keyboard played for at most   mins before it completely died  very disappointed  amazon customer service was very helpful with trying to find a remedy  but was not able to find a remedy  i m now waiting for a follow up phone call  complete waste of money  now i will have to fight to get a refund     
354,1.0 ,                       didn t work      
355,2.0 ,                       you get what you pay for  when it first arrived a lot of keys weren t working so i had to take the whole thing apart and fix it manually and after i did that i gotta say it s ok if you re just starting piano and if you need something to learn beginner songs with but the keys don t sustain notes for more than   seconds so once you getting into learning songs with more than half notes it becomes useless  it does come with some cool features but i think it s better to buy a better piano for more money     
356,3.0 ,                       keyboard was nice the stand was junk  lasted only   yr   months before it died  i have two daughters who take piano lessons  i decided to upgrade to a different brand but a full    key keyboard for further development      
357,5.0 ,                       my   and    year old love playing with this keyboard  heck  my husband and i love playing on it  the headphone option is godsend  i highly recommend this product      
358,3.0 ,                       please be aware that the actual keys on this keyboard are smaller than a regular piano key   also  the keys are not weighted   it is good for young players to work with weighted keys because they are similar to a real piano  these keys have a much softer push and will not develop the hand muscles in the same way   so if you are looking to start of a young piano player before you commit to purchasing a real piano  try and find a keyboard that has the weighted keys      
359,5.0 ,                       my husband  is  really amazed  by this piano  is nice  sturdy  very good  product  for  his first  piano     
360,5.0 ,                       i wanted to learn keyboard very much   when i purchased this i wads not sure if the quality would be good for me to learn on   i was pleasantly surprised and am learning well   iplan to upgrade this keyboard as soon as i am certain i will learn to play it   very happy with speed of service      
361,2.0 ,                       worked for two months  the stand is held together with tiny screws and is wobbly  the lower    keys stopped working entirely after two months of use  probably a bad connection   started out as just what we needed  but if you plan on having it a long time look at other options      
362,5.0 ,                       very cool my kids love it  many functions     
363,5.0 ,                       my son started playing piano in march and his teacher recommended getting a more affordable keyboard to start since he s so young       we bought this one and so far it has worked great for us and what he needs for his class and also has a great variety of settings to play with  we re very happy with our purchase      
364,2.0 ,                       right outta the box it had a buzzing sound coming from the speakers and when you hooked up the headphones too  i like how affordable it is but the quality isn t great      
365,4.0 ,                       this is a great starter keyboard for our daughter it has options that can help learn and is user friendly      
366,5.0 ,                       my   year old need a keyboard for music class  this was perfect comes with stickers to label the keys  really helped her learn her scales  sound was great  plug is a little short  so get an extension cord      
367,5.0 ,                       this was a perfect gift for my   year old granddaughter she still loves it     
368,1.0 ,                       we got the keyboard for our daughter for christmas and only   weeks later and the speaker is blown with a really bad sound coming out of it  we called company and they said your warranty to return expired   days ago  well we bought it a couple weeks before christmas and it was not opened until christmas day  we are returning it  but overall quality is not that great  the kit itself is convienent  but not good quality      
369,5.0 ,                       my grandsons love their keyboard      
370,5.0 ,                       daughter loves it  for the price     wow      
371,5.0 ,                       just as described love it great deal for the price     
372,1.0 ,                       this was a great product except for the stand the stand broke  maybe i just got a lemon i reached out to company to see if i could buy another or have it replaced by them  but they never followed through i would have gladly gave this product a   star review if company had followed through not even a courtesy email      
373,1.0 ,                       two keys are defected   can t return do to lockdown     
374,4.0 ,                       nice keyboard good customer service  only down fall it was missing a part so it s not as sturdy      
375,5.0 ,                       it was easy to set up the stand and keyboard  i love that it comes with stickers to place on the keys to make it easier to find the right key when you re a beginner   it has headphones and a great sound  good buy      
376,5.0 ,                       this is the best keyboard that i have ever bought  price is correct and sound is perfect  nothing less than an aquatic piano      
377,5.0 ,                       very good     
378,5.0 ,                       my daughter loves this keyboard   good product for the price      
379,5.0 ,                       good for beginners     
380,3.0 ,                       i did not open this until   months after i purchased it  i had to make room and it was a timing conflict  and i was past the return date  when i opened it  it was rattling on the inside of the keyboard  i looked around there were black pieces of plastic in the bag and i shook the keyboard and all these additional pieces fell out  i look along the sides of the keyboard and one side is smashed in  it works and everything but there is a giant hole on the left side of it  drives me crazy so it sits there this keyboard would be badass otherwise  don t let this deter you      
381,1.0 ,                       seller had my original review pulled down as it did not follow community guidelines so i will add more in order to help my fellow amazon shoppers first off  the seller charged nearly      for a      product  i m not sure if others have experienced this but i paid well over double for some reason sound quality is fine  it worked when it was plugged in so that s nice now that i have submitted feedback on the keyboard it now falls within the community guidelines bottom line  if i get a refund in the amount i was over charged i will change my review to reflect as such      
382,5.0 ,                       my nephews teacher told our family he enjoys playing the piano at school   so i bought this for him for christmas  it came after but that was ok  it s big but surprisingly light   the headphone were a little on the smaller side  watching him play fur elise made this worth the wait  i would recommend this      
383,1.0 ,                       no power cord  no instructions and no stickers  now i have to go through the hassle of boxing this back up to return it    happy birthday to me i guess      
384,1.0 ,                       if i could give it zero stars i would   i was excited about the low price but the first one we received had a broken key  the key was snapped off   had to package the whole thing  break down the seat  the stand   everything  back up and send it back for a replacement  when the replacement arrived we set it up   multiple keys wouldn t even work when pressed  now having to package up and send back once again  this time not even bothering with a replacement  two defective products and hauling a    lb item to the ups store twice in three days is definitely not worth the savings on this item      
385,5.0 ,                       very good     
386,2.0 ,                       bought it in feb     metronome keys went bad mid           
387,5.0 ,                       my daughter wanted a keyboard for christmas  and i was browsing amazon one day  and ran across this one  i ordered it  and it was perfect  she loves it and plays daily  i have one complaint  it s not compatible with a foot pedal  she was used to playing on an actual piano  with a pedal  so it s a learning curve      
388,5.0 ,                       i picked this up after reading reviews  the key weight is moderate and good to earn on for those not used to stretching and pressing their fingers  the simplypiano code is a bitch sketchy  ended up buying it without using the code because of the way it s confusingly written and paid full price    aside from this  it s a nice piano  the chair is comfortable  headphones are tight on my head  i have a big head      
389,5.0 ,                       am really impressed with my new rockjam rj      it came securely boxed and all parts were there   it went together quickly   the stand is sturdy and the seat is well padded   most impressive is the keyboard itself   very professional looking   the sound is superb   i was concerned about the quality but feel i got my money s worth   my only complaint is since i m a beginner  i wish there had been more explanation on what buttons controlled what rhythms and tones   and how does one get to the installed lessons   also the free training is not available for use in my kindle tablets   maybe amazon can fix that  hint hint      
390,1.0 ,                       i just recieved this item  i was going to save it to give as a gift but decided to open it to make sure everything g was there  to my surprise  the keyboard is broken into pieces  the box looks like it s been thrown around and i m completely pissed      
391,5.0 ,                       our granddaughter was over the top when she got this keyboard  it came with a pedal  earphones  a stand and a seat      
392,2.0 ,                       this piano is very poor quality  it feels cheap and the sound quality is terrible  the basic piano tune doesn t even sound like a piano  i would recommend spending the extra      for a nicer keyboard  this one is simple not worth it  if you intend to learn and continue playing buy a nicer one      
393,5.0 ,                       loved this present  bought for grandson and he has really enjoyed      
394,5.0 ,                       was great for my son as a learning keyboard     
395,5.0 ,                       ordered for my   older granddaughters  they are extremely happy with the keyboards and accessories  fast delivery  items were well packed and arrived in perfect condition      
396,4.0 ,                       nice set up for a student  the sound isn t as good as our      s casio keyboard  but it was inexpensive      
397,2.0 ,                       the keyboard itself is alright  it sounds like it s slightly out of tune  but it works  the stand provided  however  is a joke  it was not designed well  so you have to lean the entire thing against a wall or it will fall over backwards  to be perfectly honest  i would say find a different brand and don t spend your money on this one  it s worth maybe half it s price      
398,5.0 ,                       nice price  excellent product and easy to set up  what more could i want  thank you  would buy it again      
399,4.0 ,                       i ve read some negative reviews on this product  but no trouble here  only thing i have to say in a negative sense is that there was no sustain pedal included      
400,5.0 ,                       this is very good for me since i ve never learn how to play the piano   the app that comes with the keyboard is too awesome   i love this     
401,2.0 ,                       items looks nice  but i m missing the power adapter   i received the headphones  i ve received the seat along with the other items but i don t have a power cable to be able to determine if the product works      
402,2.0 ,                       the first and foremost thing that will annoy you is that the sound starts on full blast  i ignored that in the other reviews thinking   meh  not that big of a deal   well  guess what  it is  secondly  it broke  eight months in and the power supply is shot  not simply the cable  it turns on for a half second  off for three  on for a half second  repeat  what a waste of money      
403,2.0 ,                       assembly was minimal and quick but that s the only good thing about it  everyone of the different sound settings are exactly the same  not what i was hoping for when i bought this     
404,1.0 ,                       it was so cheap that   of the black keys were loose and one broke off completely the first time we played it  you get what you pay for though and maybe i just got unlucky  never the less i ve returned it and plan on buying a name brand keyboard instead       
405,5.0 ,                       i can t believe how cheap this was for what you get   set up was incredibly quick and easy  it sounds great and looks great   it s not flimsy nor cheap looking  the chair is sturdy for my   year olds and even for me  my kids have no idea to play piano so it s all just for fun  even so   i think it could be used for more serious play  a lot of buttons and functions we will probably never use  but for the more advance players there are a lot of options  i like how it came with stickers to put on the keys to help them learn  unfortunately  it does not come with any booklet that will show them how to play some simple songs  there is an app that they suggest to help them learn  but it s      per year      
406,4.0 ,                       i now have a humming noise in left speaker  changed locations  adapters  and tried using battery only   same results      
407,1.0 ,                       after reading all the reviews  i unpacked this immediately upon arrival  plugged it in  and tested each key  sure enough  when i hit the lowest d key all i heard was a hollow  click  sound  this was enough to go back to my desk and initiate a return to amazon  without replacement i also noted that the instrument  sounds  did not resemble their labels much  and  flute  sounded much like a  concert grand   the overall feel of the keyboard is cheap and somewhat fragile  the keys had an odd  mechanical feel  i didn t bother to assemble the stand  of course  but all of the parts were in the box  the stool was actually quite nice this gets only one star because the broken key makes it useless to us and i m not willing to gamble the time on a replacement  even though this is for a twelve year old  he deserves a working instrument      
408,3.0 ,                       by beginners i think means child piano because it small for adult beginners     
409,5.0 ,                       first year music student in love with the keyboard  it stays out and all the kids enjoy it as it sits against a wall  perfect for what he needed      
410,5.0 ,                       bought this for my daughter who is a beginner  she loves it and has learned a lot  she plays beautifully  she has no complaints      
411,5.0 ,                       great product     
412,4.0 ,                       got this as a birthday gift  great for beginners      
413,1.0 ,                       my wife purchased item for value and use it for stay home during coronavirus    after assembling and set up this product and we discovered that item not working   not turning on   no power     it was big disappointment        
414,4.0 ,                       such a great value for the price  my niece absolutely loved it and has already learned to play many songs since receiving it  would recommend for a beginner       
415,4.0 ,                       my daughter wanted one in her room   she s    and is just starting to figure out what interests her so we thought this would be a good price point and size to start with   she s enjoyed it and we ve enjoyed hearing her experiment on her own when she doesn t want my help   i on the other hand do not like playing it at all   i m used to weighted  touch sensitive keys and a sturdy stand  we knew they were not touch sensitive but the keys just feel like thin plastic keys that clank loudly when played the way i m accustomed to and the whole thing wants to rock back and forth   she s still a bit timid  lighter handed and so it doesn t seem to bother her much   this has been a good start to see how interested she is but we will probably get her a more recognized brand within the year and pass this one on to another family in the same boat who is also gauging their child s interest      
416,4.0 ,                       great piano style keyboard but the  free  teaching app that made this buy key for beginners was only free to download and the  st lesson  continuing lessons are      yr  not terribly expensive but not free  included in purchase price      
417,2.0 ,                       very disappointed  more of a toy  than anything     
418,5.0 ,                       grandsons christmas gift     
419,5.0 ,                       purchased this for my   year old daughter  and she loves it  well worth the price  perfect for someone just learning  it s well made  and very easy to set up      
420,5.0 ,                       this is the  nd keyboard i ve bought  exactly this  for various members of my family  this one was even small enough and      self contained to bring into the icu of a hospital to help out my friend with the lung transplant  you won t be sorry if you buy this      
421,5.0 ,                       great beginning keyboard with teaching capability  sound and speakers are excellent  easy to use  much complexity is available  but even a child can use the keyboard  good investment      
422,2.0 ,                       i loved this piano for about   months  then the power stopped working  i am not sure if it is the cable or where it goes into the keyboard  if i hold the cable at a really funny angle it seems to work  but now i can t find that position long enough keep it operational  i would love to get it working again if there is a way to purchase a new cable or otherwise problem solve this      
423,1.0 ,                       i wanted to give it   stars or talk to customer support  but i ve been unable to find any way to contact the company about this  the keyboard worked for a month or two before it started making this awful wavy buzzing sound  it makes it whether i am using the speakers or using the headphones  so i don t think it s a speaker issue  really just wanted to get in contact about this      
424,5.0 ,                       the keyboard came very promptly   everything was included in the price   stool  pedal  etc  most impressive  it set up quite easily      
425,5.0 ,                       i am no piano enthusiast  bought for my daughter to play with  lots of features  easy to use  looks pretty  for us  this has offered a good experience       
426,1.0 ,                       the only purpose this would have is for a child  but only if you believe your child won t ever learn to actually play  if you want to learn  bite the bullet and buy a keyboard that has  fully  weighted keys  you can find a reasonably cheap one that will last longer and allow you to genuinely feel like you re playing something  trust me  i get it  they re expensive and it d seem a lot less troublesome to get this then transition or whatever  no  it is not  this keyboard was a waste of      and i finally sold it for like     that i had to bargon just to get rid of without having to scam someone  this keyboard is hollow  nothing close to anything real  except maybe like half the size of a real one  but even then it s just a large toy  i gave up trying to learn from it after a week or two because as much as you try to pretend  it will never be the same if you ve ever touched a piano  i ended up getting a      weighted keyboard for       great deal  plays amazing and i absolutely love it  go to a music store and make a deal with the manager  don t buy something from amazon    it s not a guitar     it is not the same    trust me or suffer a piece of crap  i didn t trust the comments when i bought this       
427,1.0 ,                       middle f key broke on the first day  disappointing      
428,5.0 ,                       great value    great first time keyboard for the kids     
429,5.0 ,                       my son use for personal practice and piano development      
430,5.0 ,                       entire family really enjoys playing this      
431,5.0 ,                       so far so good  my son has been learning songs at a rapid rate  i especially love the headphone option  as it keeps me and the rest of the family from having to listen to the practicing     we just get to hear when he has somewhat mastered a song  plus it fits great in his small bedroom      
432,5.0 ,                       very easy to install  my   year old is in love with his piano  it even comes with piano stickers   and head phones and free app  perfect      
433,1.0 ,                       i very rarely give a negative review but like others that bought this keyboard  the one i received had keys that didn t work properly  simply not a good product      
434,5.0 ,                       very nice keyboard   like that the keys are full sized  use it to practice the songs i play for church      
435,5.0 ,                       bought this for my daughter and she loves it  the stand stinks and tips over easy as well as the chair but i got it for a steal so either way worth it the keyboard itself is awesome      
436,5.0 ,                       my   year old is taking piano lessons and this is working out great for us      
437,5.0 ,                       this piano is great  i decided i wanted to learn to play since i m stuck in the house now and having the bench is perfect      
438,5.0 ,                       a very decent keyboard for the price    i m wondering if the negative reviews were botched refurbs     this seems like a sturdy instrument   i m very pleased      
439,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my    year son for christmas and he loves it  it s made in china and it had a funky smell when i removed it out of the box  i wiped everything down with disinfectant wipes and it took about   days for yhe oder to go away  it does have good sound and the stickers are easy to put on      
440,1.0 ,                       less than a year later  no longer works  too much to spend  if i had just wanted a toy for my grandson i would have bought one  he needed it because he just started taking lessons and now has to get new one      
441,4.0 ,                       our daughter just got this for her christmas present  the speaker has constant feedback and is staticky  very disappointed since this was what she really wanted for christams this is an update  after calling amazon they sent a replacement right away and the new one appears to be working amazingly  no complaints so hopefully it was just a fluke with the other one      
442,5.0 ,                       perfect size  grandchildren love it   easy to use     
443,5.0 ,                       works perfectly as a practice piano for my   year old      
444,5.0 ,                       good price     
445,5.0 ,                       bought this for our granddaughter s  th birthday   it is a great  quality built keyboard and sets up so quickly   her mother did order some stickers for the keys so that helped her learn  happy birthday  within a few minutes   she will be starting her piano lessons and this is going to be so helpful for her to practice on   definitely would buy it again      
446,5.0 ,                       my children love it  video games now take a back seat to this piano and they put youtube on to challenge each other to learn a new song and the best part is they do it together   so happy  now do get me wrong they still play their video games but it s so much easy to get them off the video game with out the attitudes and sighs of how mom is ruining their world  lol         
447,5.0 ,                       when we first ordered the piano the package didn t come at all  so amazon had to send us another one  but overall the piano itself is very nice  great for beginners especially  i would definitely recommend buying this piano      
448,5.0 ,                       it s fantastic     
449,5.0 ,                       daughter loves it     
450,3.0 ,                       the options in the piano are too good  but i thought of buying this for my   year old kid and he is just a beginner and he is getting so much confused with all the options  probably this would be a great product for     years of kids and adults than below    kids  it would be just another fun toy for below    kids      
451,1.0 ,                       okay so i bought this for my wife  it s cheap you know  her parents used to have an amazing very expensive and authentic piano  all we had was this    year old beat up piece of plastic  i was able to assemble it but it s kinda wobbly  it also doesn t come with a foot pedal  it sounded good but the keys were just so heavy to press down on  we ve had it for roughly   weeks  today the power completely cut out on it  at first just no sound  but now it s not working at all anywhere in the house      
452,4.0 ,                       the stand could be sturdier overall a good product     
453,5.0 ,                       the kids love it  wish the keys would light up  good value        
454,2.0 ,                       bought for my   year old granddaughter  it looks good and sturdy  keys were full size but not weighted like i expected from advertising  what shocked me is the factory preset volume at    or maximum range   this is a major fault as a level     is comfortable  i may return the product based in this alone because i don t want my granddaughter s ears being assaulted every time she turns the keyboard on      
455,4.0 ,                       very impressed on the solid weight on this keyboard it has easy to use tunes i wish their stickers for the keys were either better or provided another sheet of them  they do tend to unstick after a week or        
456,5.0 ,                       i love the key board it s really good  the stand is horribly built and very unlevel  i had to make about a   in shim  very disappointing     
457,5.0 ,                       me encanto es grande  viene con todos los accesorios  estoy fascinada  me encanta lo recomiendo mucho gracias        
458,2.0 ,                       im a total beginner so this is fine for me  but honestly for what i spent i should have just spent the extra thirty dollars on a good yamaha keyboard  this one has no realistic piano sound and the stand only works because it s leaning against my wall  the keys and all of it are pretty cheaply made and i m pretty sure this will probably break before i grow out of it and get a new one  again  it s okay since i m a total beginner but really for the price you can get so much better      
459,2.0 ,                       easy to set up and kids like it so far  however  i m writing this review because the base of the bench is very bent and unstable  likely due to overheating at the welds during manufacturing    i would expect the stability of the bench to be a higher priority for something designed for small children      
460,5.0 ,                       we added the key stickers to our purchase for our son   this keyboard has been great for him      
461,5.0 ,                       it s great i like it my daughter likes it also     
462,4.0 ,                       this is my first keyboard  i m writing a review two years after ordering this product  it still works the same from the very moment it came in the mail  i ve practiced so much on it that i am now ready for a more sophisticated keyboard  highly recommend for beginners even though the sound isn t as sound or clear compared to more expensive name brand keyboards  my headphone jack broke almost instantly though but my playing doesn t bother anyone so to me it s not a huge deal      
463,1.0 ,                       product quality is not good as price you paid and  piano stand  required wall support to stand    table is to low quality please think before buy it   its  made spot on my wall       
464,1.0 ,                       do not waste your money on this  i bought this for my daughter s birthday and it had a broken key  i requested an exchange which was relatively easy and came quick however the second one has a broken key too   i can t believe it  waste of time and money      
465,5.0 ,                       i liked this product  it arrived as expected  my   years son loved it      
466,5.0 ,                       great product for the price  my son loves the feature where you can teach yourself how to play  the seat is sturdy and can support at least    lbs if not more  no complaints      
467,5.0 ,                       great iteam for those that want to learn     
468,5.0 ,                       my daughter loves it  it is definitely a must have if you have a child that is interested in music to get them started  it is now february and it still works the stand is a bit cheaply made but then again i have   kids that keep moving it up and down and all around the room      
469,5.0 ,                       the keys are large and alot easier to play than a lot of keyboards   i really love the earphones because i can play while my husband watches tv      
470,5.0 ,                       for my beginner piano student this has been a great piano  i m sure it s not perfect sound quality but it s a good size for my seven year old to get some piano practice in      
471,5.0 ,                       delivered on time and very much like the keyboard   my grands age   and    love playing with this keyboard   the headphones are a plus      
472,5.0 ,                       i bought it for my   year old daughter who is just starting her lessons and this keyboard is just perfect   have so many other functions that keeps her enganged to the keyboard because she know she can learn to do more  size is perfect and sounds very good      
473,5.0 ,                       the grandkids loved this key board good way to see if you got any musical intent kids in the family well after of the grandkid having this for over   month she s is still very happy an liking it nothing bad to say so it was defiantly a awesome purchase      
474,2.0 ,                       seems steady and of quality  however  it did not come with a power adapter  i purchased the correct power adapter on my own  and it doesn t play  trying to get batteries and see if i can finally get to play it      
475,3.0 ,                       how does anyone play the free app simply piano that is offered when you buy this rockjam keyboard when there are no mdi or poor connections on the back  this unit has only the basics  jack plug in  microphone plug  and earphone jack  are there other items that can be purchased to connect my ipad pro so that i can use my apps to play on this unit  they should not offer a free app simply piano if you can not use it on this keyboard  does anyone have suggestions     
476,4.0 ,                       excellent product accurate description and fast shipping     
477,5.0 ,                       it was gifted to me for my birthday   and i am really satisfied with it   i wanted to learn to play the piano synth  but i was not ready yet conclusion   good quality product   enduring and easy to assemble      
478,4.0 ,                       delivered on time and in great shape   my    year old son loves it   my only negative comment is that the seat isn t super sturdy   the center already bent inward  but it s still usable   otherwise it s a great product      
479,1.0 ,                       cheap quality not as other good brands for kids ok     
480,5.0 ,                       my kids and i are loving this new addition to our music room  highly recommend  easy to set up  we ordered removable stickers for the keys  makes it easier to learn to play      
481,5.0 ,                       my grandson loves it      
482,5.0 ,                       have just had this for  days  bought for older adult who use to play the piano      
483,5.0 ,                       my daughter love it aaaaa              
484,1.0 ,                       i wouldn t even pay     for this keyboard now that i know how terrible it is  here are some of the issues    the key action is terrible to the point of being unhealthy  it actively pushes up against you even after the notes have been depressed  so just holding a chord down is tiring    when your hand has to move forward on the keys  they re almost impossible to push down  they might as well not have the back inch of the keys    the regular piano sound has a built in reverb which basically just means the sound doesn t stop until half a second after the key is released  so you have no control over the articulation    the keys are incredibly cheap  they wiggle from side to side so the keys will rub and scrape each other  and they re also very very noisy when played      
485,5.0 ,                       my daughter is happy with her piano     
486,5.0 ,                       awesome keyboard      
487,5.0 ,                       for grandchildren to begin keyboard lessons      
488,5.0 ,                       great sound and good for experienced musicians      
489,5.0 ,                       this keyboard is perfect for kids and beginners  i love that it came with headphones so my   yr old is t driving us crazy or waking up her new little sis  assembly was easy and comes with a cute little seat  it doesn t take up much space either and comes with stickers for the keys      
490,4.0 ,                       great keyboard  however it didn t come with the screws to assemble the stand nor did it have the seat  it was supposed to have both and failed to include these necessary items      
491,5.0 ,                       great price and very good instrument for my daughter thanks  love amazon          
492,5.0 ,                       for the price it s a great deal for those of us trying to learn and practice   there s definitely some  white noise  or  feedback  coming from the speakers when the keyboard is turned on but isn t being played   i would not use this for any kind of performance recital showing off crazy skills      
493,5.0 ,                       this was my gift to my granddaughter for christmas   she s taking piano lessons and is doing very well   i only wish that i had bought the full    keys   it s been wonderful for her and her teacher said it s fine having    keys at this point      
494,5.0 ,                       i have been totally happy with this keyboard  i have decided to learn to play the piano in my later years and this keyboard has been working perfectly for me  it doesn t take up much space yet the sound quality is that of a grand piano  i love it        
495,5.0 ,                       i am floored  i expected a decent piano  but this thing is wonderful my daughter is entranced and very excited to learn  the stickers are helpful  and she s engaging with the piano daily i love the sound quality and the fact i can put on headphones and play when she is sleeping  the quality is excellent for the price       
496,3.0 ,                       i did notgive this review   stars because eventhough you could see the keyboard and all its features seem pretty self explanatory  it would  be easier for the learner it they were provided with  a music book  something like music for therita  bk     
497,5.0 ,                       great for the money  i got it to learn piano during quarantine  it s a good piano for the bucks

499,5.0 ,                       this is a great piano for a beginner player  we have had the piano for a few months now and my kids love it  one kid takes lessons and its great to have at the house for practice   this included stand and bench makes it feel like a real piano and it doesn t take up much space  it is very loud but the included headphones allow the kids to practice without disturbing the entire house   very sturdy on the stand and the bench is very sturdy   this keyboard also have many different sound profiles that allow it to act as many different instruments      
500,5.0 ,                       my daughter is very happy with this keyboard  it sounds great and is just perfect for beginners      
501,5.0 ,                       this is definitely for beginners but is so great  very easy to use  souds good  easy to learn how to play  sturdy  and the price is good      
502,1.0 ,                       so angry  surprised my daughter set up the entire piano  cleaned everything up  tossed th box in the trash  she is just learning on the piano so we are only playing on the black keys  but tried to play and two white keys do not work  no way to return it  very frustrating

504,4.0 ,                       bought for a young preteen piano student  good piano sound  light weight and easy for her to move it about the home as needed  the stand is a little light but i love how easily it can be set up and taken down  stool seems very sturdy as well  perfect for our need

506,5.0 ,                       i absolutely love this set  it was so easy to set up and it was such a great deal  stand feels incredibly sturdy  i especially love the edition of the head phones  i didn t realize how necessary they would be until i started playing  overall  such a great value and i m immensely happy with my purchase      
507,5.0 ,                       everything looked  it s a birthday present for my granddaughter  i think she is going to love it      
508,3.0 ,                       the stand is really flimsy  the keyboard is too heavy for the stand  can t complain for the price  i just use a different table      
509,4.0 ,                       my daughter loves it and the training software is really nice   the sound could be a little better  but the price i am not complaining      
510,3.0 ,                       this is a decent beginner learners keyboard  a good deal for the price  however if you re looking for something to jam on i do not recommend  one key in the middle was dead on arrival

517,4.0 ,                       after only a few months the power will not come on unless you fiddle with the cord for a while then you literally can t move a thing or it powers off  tried another adapter and it s actually the connecting part that is on the keyboard that is the problem  also stand is pretty wobbly   update  i was issued a refund on my order with no problems as i had purchased a protection plan  changed my review to   stars      
518,5.0 ,                       we are really enjoying this keyboard  i am using it to teach piano to three of our great grandchildren as beginners  it is working well for that right now  they love to play their little pieces on it      
519,4.0 ,                       worth the price  a great first for learning and deciding if you enjoy playing

522,5.0 ,                       my daughter loved her bday gift  great equipment      
523,4.0 ,                       only problem is can t get the songbook to stay in place   frustrating      
524,4.0 ,                       this was a much anticipated gift for my son and he loves it  very reasonable      
525,5.0 ,                       my grandchildren and my son all love to play on this piano  all are beginners and this is a good piano to get started on  sound is good and it is plenty big enough for them to play      
526,1.0 ,                       piano function was good  but   months into owning it  some of the electronics burned up and made our entire room smell like burning plastic   still is operational  but with only very weak volume levels   submitting a warranty claim      
527,1.0 ,                       i had this item for not even   months and by the  rd  it was already starting to break  it sits in my room  so no one has any reason to move it around  i make sure to keep it unplugged  i have been extremely careful with it  i tried contacting the actual place where it comes from for an even exchange for a new one and they told me to contact amazon and once i did they told me there was nothing they could do for me  save your money  it s not worth it        
528,1.0 ,                       great product     
529,5.0 ,                       complete system  has headphones to keep peace in the house  reasonable price     
530,5.0 ,                       ordered it and received it the next day  my son loves it  working great and best part is headphones  we don t hear a thing while he practices  i find it necessary sometimes        
531,5.0 ,                       perfect      
532,5.0 ,                       i bought this as a christmas gift for my    yr old and have been very happy   i d like to point out some things that i think might be helpful for those considering buying it    the picture on amazon is a little misleading  at first glance  it looks as if there is a large display on the top of the keyboard showing the piano learning application notes to be played  if you look closer  you ll realize it s a tablet sitting on the top of the keyboard  showing the app  the  display  feature mentioned in the product description is a small display directly above the keyboard   obviously  the piano doesn t come with a tablet included  i knew this when i purchased the keyboard but i think it s worth pointing out  my kid has used his iphone propped on top of the keyboard to play the application so he can learn piano  it works okay  the notes can be a little hard to see at times  but it s not that bad  if you use your tablet to run a piano lesson application  it would be a lot easier probably but using the phone is still doable    this set comes with earphones  this is great  however  be aware that the  simply piano  application requires no headphones because it has to  listen  to the piano being played to advance to the next level or lesson  i don t know if all of the piano apps require this but i didn t think about it when i purchased the keyboard  my kid can use the headphones when he s goofing around on the keyboard  but whenever he wants to use the app to learn  he has to use it without headphones   i hear him play and practice  which is both a fun upside and a noisy downside  lol    there are a lot of buttons so the keyboard looks very complicated  i think this keyboard is a great buy for beginners interested in learning piano  my kid has really enjoyed it  there are a lot of features   functions  it s a little intimidating at first glance  but most of it is pretty intuitive  there are record   play back functions to play back what you ve been playing  which my kid really likes  the are buttons to change the sound instrument or rhythm  i didn t see any point in overwhelming my kid by going through every description of every button in the manual  but he s had fun exploring   figuring out what each button does on his own    what i love most about this keyboard is how much fun he has been having with music  the  simply piano  application has been good and the keyboard itself has been exactly what i wanted  in my opinion it s a very good value at this price if you re interested in learning to play the piano keyboard      
533,5.0 ,                       awesome product   good for my daughter as new student     
534,2.0 ,                       this keyboard is just ok  i bought it for an adult beginner piano and after just a few months  i am already over it  it kind of has a weird sound sound to it  the keys also have no sustaining power unless you switch to a different tone and none of those sound good at all  it s ok if a kid wants to tinker around with learning the piano  i will be replacing it very soon though      
535,3.0 ,                       hit for my    ur old to learn  the quality of materials is kinda cheap   the sound  speakers  are horrible   it does have lots of bells   whistles that make it a good fit for the price  but definitely a beginner unit that they will grow out of in a few days     
536,5.0 ,                       this is an actual instrument not a toy  i purchased it for my granddaughter who is four years old and she is learning to play the keyboard  it s a perfect size and has great sound     
537,4.0 ,                       the pitch bend piano does not have an midi  i wanted an midi but i would have to buy an more expensive piano  the stand isnt that sturdy but i love the piano      
538,1.0 ,                       bought this as a christmas  present  for my daughter  ten of the keys and six  of the buttons don t  work   very cheap spend the extra money for a name brand      
539,5.0 ,                       it came fast and was packaged well  my daughter loves it   i have not had any problems with it in any way  it was the perfect birthday present      
540,1.0 ,                       when this item arrived it turned on but that s all it would do  no sound at all  this was supposed to be a gift and was greatly disappointed when it arrived not working  returned it immediately      
541,5.0 ,                       the best gift idea i could have had for my    year old son  easy to set up and although a teaching app is available for download  my son decided to use youtube specific video s to help   he already knows how to play a guitar  various wind instruments and can read music so it wasn t much of a stretch   the best thing a parent can hear from a    year old is   mom thanks for getting me the keyboard   i love it and have already learned how to play a few songs    warms my heart      
542,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my   year old to learn on  she really enjoys playing it and learning the new features it has inside of it  worth the money  and easy to see why it is a top seller on amazon  packaging was great  too      
543,5.0 ,                       the quality is great  the set up was under    minutes  seat feels sturdy and not cheap  i am very happy with my purchase      
544,5.0 ,                       set up in our living room and everyone stops to play on it   works good and sounds good   definitely recommend

546,5.0 ,                       this is a very nice keyboard for my daughter to learn to play on  sounds good  so many options and sounds and the bench and stand are very nice  it comes with stickers of notes to place in the keys and a stand that slides on top that holds sheet music  well worth the price      
547,4.0 ,                       very nice  tried to get the lessons that it came with however it was impossible to get hem  process prevented you from ever getting the lessons      
548,3.0 ,                       some of the keys on the keyboard stopped working  i wouldn t purchase this keyboard  i tried contacting the manufacturer but they have not responded to my emails      
549,5.0 ,                       the kids enjoyed this for christmas  unfortunately it arrived missing keys  it was never opened until christmas morning so the return date had passed  or i would have returned it for a non defective product  otherwise the kids just use it without the missing keys      
550,4.0 ,                       the quality are bad     
551,5.0 ,                       purchased for a    year old beginning piano player  she loves it  and it is the first activity she and her friends do when at the house  easy to set up   the stool is a great fit and height  we have no issues with it   love it      
552,5.0 ,                       i don t love the teaching mode  but playing the keyboard is a good feel  the sound is good  the look of the menu options is attractive  all in all a good buy for this price range     
553,1.0 ,                       i cant stress it enough dont waste your time on this product their lcd display is just the little display on the keyboard that many other cheaper models and brands haveand the sound quality isnt very good and the built in speakers are not loud at all but the wost part is it just completely stopped working after about    minutes and amazon diesnt even want it back and now im responsible to ewaste it    not worth the headache     
554,3.0 ,                       not the nicest keyboard  but it s very good for kids beginners      
555,3.0 ,                       it s user friendly     
556,3.0 ,                             you get what you pay for and this is no exception to the rule  the stand is pretty sturdy but the legs are kind of uneven or something is off there  no matter we carry on  the keys are not weighted at all which is disappointing    overall a pretty good stepping stone  wouldn t buy again but do not regret the buy      
557,5.0 ,                       wonderful piano for beginners or better  watch out for your stickers it is easy to accidentally throw them out  music stand is a bit weak for any heavy music book  great piano      
558,5.0 ,                       got as a christmas present for my    year old  it is perfect for beginners and had better sound quality then i expected      
559,2.0 ,                       i don t normally write reviews for products  but i felt something needed to be said about this one  not sure how the ratings are so high  the sound quality is absolutely horrible  it honestly makes me dread practicing altogether  for the price it is  definitely not worth it  i regret my purchase  but it seems like too much of a hassle to return      
560,5.0 ,                       for her birthday and she couldn t be happier with it      
561,5.0 ,                       perfect for my son     
562,5.0 ,                       i bought this piano for my daughter as a christmas gift   oh my  best gift ever  she has learbed so much using the suggested app  she enjoys her time with her keyboard  she says is therapeutic  i definitely recommend this product  materials are good quality and sturdy  great for beginners  and the price is unbeatable      
563,3.0 ,                       it was easy to put together some minor glitches with screw hole placementi already know how to play the piano looking for smaller keyboard for ease of use and locationneeds a bigger and stronger music holder flimsy especially if playing books with lots of sheet musicoverall ok for its purpose     
564,2.0 ,                       i ve had this piano for   weeks now  loved it at first but the sound quality is already getting worse  every time you hit a note  you can hear a  twang  sound and hear the sound of the note drop off and it can t hold a note  looks great and i love the stand it comes with  but the sound quality is such a let down  might be good for kids who don t care about quality but it drives me crazy to not hear my notes carry all the way through      
565,5.0 ,                       price is decent   package well   it s perfect for my   year old granddaughter starting piano lessons   piano sound is good   lots of choices for different sounds as well     
566,5.0 ,                       comes with easy to assemble chair and stand  they had provided stickers and instruction to put it on  these stickers are very useful for learning  it had some free classes and online subscription which was good  sound quality is very good  headphones which came free are decent  overall i would recommend this product for any beginners      
567,4.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is a great beginner keyboard  however  middle c sticks to c       
568,4.0 ,                       good for beginner but cheap  sound quality is ok      
569,3.0 ,                       its really nice and compact  it is sturdy and is as advertised  the only thing is it smells  it causes the room to smell badly  it smells like a cross between new electronics and wet diapers  i really like it  but i do not think i will keep it long term  cannot get rid of the smell      
570,5.0 ,                       with this quarantine we needed something to do  we love it  can t wait to keep learning      
571,1.0 ,                       it s on but no sound contact me so i can change my review      
572,1.0 ,                       opened keyboard  set it all up  started to play and one of the keys doesn t work  if you push on it really hard it may work    it may not  i m really disappointed after setting this all up  that i now have to disassemble it and ship it back      
573,5.0 ,                       i don t know how to play the piano  but the keyboard is fun to play around with   i have taken one lesson  online  but hope to take more   i like all the sounds and rhythms   it was easy to set up and i think it was a decent price based on others i ve glanced at      
574,4.0 ,                       as a complete item it contains everything you need except the electricity it will use when you use it   midi capable so can even function as a generic controller in a daw   my kids enjoy having their own now because it gives them liberty to explore more in depth      
575,5.0 ,                       lo compr  para mi hijo y le a gustado mucho   viene tal cual est  en la portada   tiene un buen tama o y suena bien es ideal para aprendices      
576,5.0 ,                       good for beginning levels  great price      
577,3.0 ,                       not the greatest quality but okay for someone to tinker around with  sound is on the tinny side  i don t see how the recording feature can allow me to record a segment and then play it while i m concurrently playing another segment for a duet      
578,4.0 ,                       some of the screws that mount from the bottom to hold the keyboard on the rake had plastic stuck in them and i was unable to secure it safely  very nice product for the price still  i would buy it again     
579,1.0 ,                       after reading the negative reviews  i hoped for the best and ordered this keyboard set anyway  before setting anything up  i decided to plug the keyboard in first to make sure all the keys worked    the crap didn t even stay on  the blue led screen would light up for a second when we pressed power and the it went off  we pressed the keys but heard nothing  i soon realized the blue led screen is supposed to stay on indicating that power is working  we read the manual too and followed the simple steps but the crap didn t stay on   so now i have to deal with the returns process  so annoying  i should have listened to the reviews and not wasted my time      
580,5.0 ,                       great product   arrived quickly and has been nonstop entertainment since christmas  and the added headphones helps with the noise      
581,4.0 ,                       daughter just started piano lessons   does not sound the best but great for someone starting out      
582,1.0 ,                       it didn t come with enough screws to put it together and i haven t heard from customer service in over month      
583,3.0 ,                       unfortunately  the top bar for the stand was missing and when i requested that the manufacturer send this  likely very inexpensive given the cost of the rest of the product  part to me i was told by customer service that i d have to purchase the part  in other words  i purchased a product in good faith and then  after i had to give my child a gift that was not quite complete  i was expected to pay extra for the manufacturer s mistake  i m very disappointed because i bought this for someone else who really enjoyed it so was excited to give it to my child      
584,5.0 ,                       my    year old grandson absolutely loves it he loves the app he put on his ipad he learned very quick and absolutely loves it excellent bye     
585,5.0 ,                       awesome  i love it      
586,4.0 ,                       some keys are bent out of place     
587,5.0 ,                       my youngest wanted to learn the piano  so we looked for an inexpensive option in case he lost interest   i talked to a piano player i work with and he said this would work   i could not agree more   the bench and stand are great  and easy to put together   the piano is light and easy to move  and small enough to fit in a corner   the headphones are comfortable for the kids  not bad for me either   it does come with piano key stickers  which are a must for me as  i learn to play and teach my kids   one of the best things is the   month app that comes with the piano   i showed it to the music teacher i work with and she was impressed the main point of my review is that i am very happy   once my kids are better  i will up grade  but for learning this is great      
588,5.0 ,                       hasn t stopped playing it since he received it  definitely a great idea for students in the distance learning phases   music class at home     
589,2.0 ,                       product works and sounds fine  shipping was terrible  we opened the box today to assemble the stand and piano for christmas and discovered that the keyboard has a giant crack in it  most likely due to the too large of a box it was shipped in that allowed it to shift and move too much in transit  disappointed my kid will recieve a damaged present on christmas morning  but she ll like it enough  at least it s still working as far as we can tell      
590,5.0 ,                       bought this for my    year old daughter and she loves it      
591,5.0 ,                       bought this for my    year old grandson for christmas   he super awesome in his high band playing the trumpet but he wanted to try something different  he loves this      
592,3.0 ,                       help   our keyboard arrived and we enjoyed it for   days  now when plugged in the screen just flicker and nothing happens  i d rather we heard from someone to trouble shoot this problem  than re box and return  i did reach out to the amazon automated bot for assistance  but it s communication on trouble shooting and problem solving is limited please help     
593,5.0 ,                       this is the second and keyboard i have bought and i couldn t be happier with it  the first one i got from target and it broke very soon after   my boys love it too  i bought it for my older son  but the little one wants to practice playing too all the time  plus  the price is right  the warranty was priced well too  we have had and used for about a month  and both of the kids are playing it almost every day  and it still sounds amazing and looks great        
594,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my  yr old who is learning to play the piano at his school but i couldn t afford a big  real  piano at my house and this is perfect for him   it does feel a bit  flimsy  and is really light  but i must say it s standing up to my son and he loves it and it sounds great   this is a great deal for those on a tight budget  yet want their child to have a great started keyboard piano   he plays it daily and loves it and is getting quite good very quickly      
595,5.0 ,                       my daughter love this  she had it for over a year and it still going strong      
596,1.0 ,                       well  where do i start i ordered this early so that it could arrive in due time with  no rush  shipping  it arrived  i opened it to ensure all the pieces were there   then i wrapped it back up and gift wrapped it  as it was intended as a christmas gift  we opened the gifts in the early part of december  and lo and behold the left   keys don t work  no sound  nothing  in anyway  so we go to see about sending it back and now we  can t  because we had it too long the actually quality is only partly decent and is not a  full keyboard  if you re looking to utilize this as a replacement for piano the accompanied sounds have no similar qualities to actual instruments  as we tested them cello to cello  violin to violin  guitar to guitar  and some others  it reminds me very much of a cheap keyboard from the   s that has horrible sound the  free  learning app is not free i d avoid this  honestly  not even because it doesn t actually work  not because we surpassed return time  but because for the price  you re better off getting something cheaper that comes with less and yet retains amazing quality      
597,5.0 ,                       great all inclusive item for beginners at a great price      
598,5.0 ,                       this has been great for my daughter as a beginner      
599,5.0 ,                       good for beginners or seasoned players      
600,4.0 ,                       kids got this for christmas   they we loved everything about it except that you only get to demo the first few lessons on the app  you have to pay a lot for the rest of the content       
601,5.0 ,                       i love that this came with keyboard  bench  and earphones all for this price   and the bench is sturdy  i m not huge on needing high quality because it s just used for my   year old who is a beginner at piano  but it meets all of our needs and we re very pleased      
602,3.0 ,                       the keyboard works great and my   year old loves it so far  my only complaint is that the top bar that is supposed to mount the keyboard to the stand was missing      
603,1.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          this product is chinese crap  amazon is importing any crap they can make     ontrust me don t buy any electronic from amazon is not the first time this happen     
604,1.0 ,                       this product was a major let down  my daughter had worked hard to earn this as a reward during the quarantine  once it finally arrived after prioritized shipping  nearly two weeks of prime shipping  the product did not work  after assembling all of the components  stand  stool  etc     we plugged in the piano and the power light came on  but no sound happened when you tried to play a key  i attempted to change the type of key set and nothing happened  after unplugging and re plugging from the back of the piano unit then the power on the display appeared  but no sound still  no functionality  nothing  unplugged from wall  and now just power light i am attempting to get a replacement for the unit because of all the good reviews and the price point  and hope this was a fluke      
605,4.0 ,                       assembly was easy and the keyboard set was packed well   sound is great and i love the headphones option   there are a lot of great features on the keyboard and my son  who s a beginner  loves learning all the functions   the only thing that knocked this down a star was that one of the screws that hold the keyboard to the stand  there are only   of them  does not screw in      
606,3.0 ,                       seems good so far  only been a few weeks  right off the bat the mic input is worthless  at max volume it can barley be heard at all  the rest of the key board seems pretty good  the fact that the mic can t be herd via the key board  speakers caused me to buy over      worth of speakers  cables and mixing board to make it work like it should     
607,5.0 ,                       i was apprehensive about buying this keyboard because of the negative reviews but i was pleasantly surprised by the quality  it was a birthday gift for my   year old and she absolutely loves it  it s very easy to play  no sticky or broken keys  the stand works great and we have not had any of the problems others described  it was very easy to set up and the app is such a wonderful added bonus  my daughter has several high quality headphones so i didn t care whether the included ones were useable or not but they are actually quite good  too  this is the perfect keyboard for beginners and  with all of the included extras  it is really a great deal  i would absolutely recommend it to others      
608,5.0 ,                       great quality good for beginners  my son just started music lessons and so needed a keyboard for home in between practice and anyway this was a really good purchase we re really happy with it     
609,5.0 ,                       granddaughter loves it      
610,5.0 ,                       the product arrived fast  my son us using it to learn how to play piano and is great     
611,5.0 ,                       it s just something to try   i m wow going at it and i like that      
612,3.0 ,                       they tried to put in as much as possible as far as they could sacrificing quality for quantity but don t expect the top quality out of this you know the stand is poorly made i had to you screws the stripped when the latest amount of pressure pressure would drop the stand down on the side you are putting pressure on  vichar is ok bekisar average quality like i said they just try to put too much in here ancich way but it does work to learn the keys board is ok the sound on the speakers is i guess about a   and then i think it has    keys but other than that it s not anything to brag about     
613,5.0 ,                       this is the best      i have spent on amazon in a long time  this is so much fun  i set it up myself in half an hour and already have it playing a variety of songs when you hit the demo key  this is in a vacation home where we have loads of grands and greats come visit and i know they will love this  adults too   any review that complained  other than if there was a legitimate issue such as breakage  i don t know what they were expecting for           
614,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my    year old daughter learning to play the piano  she is getting fairly good with her lessons and she has enjoyed having this to practice on  great value  great first time keyboard for the kids very good for learning the piano  i am very happy with it      
615,3.0 ,                       i bought this for my     year old for piano lessons   i didn t want to invest in a full size piano until i knew he wanted to do it for the long term   now     months later  he s doing great   so great that his piano teacher says i need to get him a larger keyboard with sensitive keys and a foot pedal   i can buy one by this same company on amazon for around         of course  if i had known this last year  i would have just paid the     more for a significantly better model   so  if you are in my same boat  i suggest you upgrade to the next level      
616,5.0 ,                       my son loved it and still has it      
617,4.0 ,                       it is a good starter s keyboard   although there are many functions  my kids don t use most of them   good sounds quality  however    keys lost sounds after   months   luckily  they are almost to the end of the keyboard  not the major c keys we continued used few months and decided to get a new one   it serves the purpose with the price      
618,4.0 ,                       it s a nice intro to keyboard for my   year old grandson to grow with  headphones are a great accessory      
619,5.0 ,                       this was bought for someone     
620,3.0 ,                       decent product for the money  the keys are are a tad weird to press but i m happy with it for the money i spent      
621,5.0 ,                       i love the touch buttons and the headphone jack  the kids can focus without distractions  we have   kids and live in a loud house    comes with key stickers and lots of tones rhythms to choose from  i bought this piano in part because of the app compatibility but i wish it was more than just one month free  considering the price  overall  i am happy with it and so are the kids  thanks for bringing music into our home      
622,1.0 ,                       it s ok for a child to play with  you can t even buy an attachment foot pedal for it     
623,5.0 ,                       it was for a   year old grandson     
624,5.0 ,                       my   years old has started taking lessons and we wanted something for him to practice at home  this keyboard has been fantastic and super convenient  love that it comes with a headset  great value for the price      
625,5.0 ,                       i got this for my   year old daughter and she loves it  i was larger than i expected so i wouldnt recommend it if you plan to tote it around   the stool is great quality   we were also very surprised to see it came with headphones  she just plugs them in and only she can hear her banging on the keyboard  it has a power cord which is nice  thanks rockjam      
626,2.0 ,                       i bought the keyboard for my grandsons  th birthday expecting there to be an easy piano mode for him to start with and options for him to grow into   the keyboard was difficult for me to play let along teach him   seemed like very strange options for chording and sound that made it pretty complicated   probably great for and experienced keyboarder to scale down to   stand seemed a little flimsy      
627,5.0 ,                       grand daughter loves it  lots of bang for the buck  would recommend and purchase again      
628,4.0 ,                       for the price of this piano it is really good   good learning piano   sound is okay for this type of piano   would recommend      
629,4.0 ,                       very nice beginner  intermediate level keyboard  easy to assemble too      
630,5.0 ,                       great product for beginners and at the price it s hard to beat     
631,5.0 ,                       daughter loves this  was an xmas gift and she can t stop playing it     
632,5.0 ,                       bought this as a gift for my significant other  i accidentally tipped over the whole set and the entire thing smashed into the floor  and it still works perfectly fine      
633,1.0 ,                       i ve had the keyboard for about a month now  used the headphones mostly because i am still learning and don t want the rest of the household to hear how bad i am    i ve used the normal speakers about   times on level   master volume and the left speaker has already blown or has never worked  i had emailed the sending company  i think  and have yet to receive an email back  i would recommend spending the extra few hundred dollars on a different brand  because this was the worst experience i ve had with amazon  rock jam yet      
634,5.0 ,                       great price for what you get  perfect for beginners      
635,1.0 ,                       volume ranges from medium loud to crazy loud with nothing quieter display light works but the display itself doesn t  won t show what notes are being played  which sound is selected  etc keys are hard to press and black keys pop off     
636,5.0 ,                       easy to learn     
637,5.0 ,                       a nice piece of equipment    i m still learning all the functions   great buy and i m very happy with this     
638,5.0 ,                       great value and good product  my son plays with it every single day  had it for few months now  and he s still thrilled       
639,5.0 ,                       good product and fast delivery     
640,5.0 ,                       i have not touched a keyboard in many  many years and i wasn t great back in the day  but this keyboard and a good  how to  book has me on the way to playing again   the multiple features on it allow you so many tones it is amazing   the basic piano tone is fine   the keys seem a little firm and i have had some trouble with playing unintended double notes but assume with practice that will stop   i absolutely think this keyboard is a great instrument and for the price it is bringing me a lot of joy   i tried a kalimba and a recorder and they just left me frustrated as i could not really play music  but now i can      
641,5.0 ,                       bought for my wife for mothers day       soon as we took it out of the box  we started making music     this piano is so user friendly        highly recommended          
642,1.0 ,                       missing all small screws and keyboard stickers      
643,3.0 ,                       i give this piano a      it had endless different types of tone options  but none of them sounded particularly right  if you are a very very new player and are looking for something cheap  i still probably would avoid this  save up a little more and get one in the           range  trust me it s worth it  this piano didn t sound very piano like  it played the notes but there was no depth behind it  holding down a note it only plays for a few seconds then completely cuts out  completely unlike an actual piano which would keep the note going  unless you are brand new  or are getting it for a kid to learn  i would go the next tier up in pricing  you just won t find the quality here     
644,5.0 ,                       love it love it love it   only bad thing is that out was delivered kinda delayed but is will with the wait   great product   great sound   excellent learning tool in this covid    world  some of the songs in the first few lessons are quite fast   i do believe having slower songs first will help with learning the notes faster and then increase the tempo as one becomes proficient   but it s great nonetheless      
645,5.0 ,                       i bought this a couple years ago for my kids for christmas  and they think it is great fun   they are old enough now that they ve started proper lessons  and this is a nice keyboard for beginners  they love playing it  the stand is durable and it has some neat features  i like that we can plug headphones into it so the rest of the household doesn t have to hear every practice session  had a minor technical glitch with it  contacted rockjam directly and their customer service was above and beyond what i d expect      
646,5.0 ,                       like     
647,5.0 ,                       my son is in percussion in band but wants to learn piano   he has not stopped playing since we got it and there are so many different sound options   he is able to connect percussion and keyboard piano while learning and it makes him feel happy and accomplished  the headphones are nice because he can play and i don t have to listen to it  all of the time      
648,4.0 ,                       i bought this for my grandson  he s      he loves it he says it is easy to learn the keys and it comes with the letters to put on the keys   the sound is pretty nice you can make your own sounds   i thought i had to get a more expensive one to sound good but this one is perfect and not bad for the price     
649,4.0 ,                       i originally bought this just for the keyboard and all the different tones  i really love that there is a training program showing what keys to press to play along  the sound is a bit off compared to my old keyboard  but the old one only had a grand piano so it s difficult and unfair to compare the two  on a side note while i am playing i really don t notice the sound quality  it sounds good when i am having fun  same thing goes for the stand wobble  overall  a decent starting keyboard  but i will definitely need to upgrade if i want to make music for others to enjoy on youtube cd lol  etc cons there is no midi usb out for connecting directly to garagebandthe stand is very wobbly when playingi was expecting more diverse sounding tones  but then i found the percussion settings and that alleviated some of my tension      
650,5.0 ,                       este piano  tiene unos aud fonos para usarlo  y que no moleste  el sonido  a los vecinos  eso es parte  del instrument y con el uso dej  de funcionar  me gustar a comprarlo  pero igual al original  y compatible  con ese equipo        ser  possible    muchas gracias                me gustaria reponerlo  con su ayuda      
651,5.0 ,                       this was a great buy      
652,5.0 ,                       it was a christmas present for my granddaughter  and she absolutely loved it       
653,5.0 ,                       have had this for a few weeks now and so far so good  my daughter is loving it for her introduction to learning how to play the keyboard  a good investment for beginning piano lessons before investing in a traditional piano      
654,4.0 ,                       my only con is whatever the volume is when you turn it off   when u turn it back on it s at max      
655,5.0 ,                       perfect  real piano  not a toy look   great price   stable   as described by seller   recommended item      
656,5.0 ,                       my    year old daughter loves it  thank you all always east     
657,4.0 ,                       i love its portability  my daughter loves it  actually its for everybody      
658,4.0 ,                       was looking for other same product   yet picked this for fair reason   however it is not the right and good choice      
659,5.0 ,                       my daughter loves it  the sound and quality good for beginners      
660,5.0 ,                       the keyboard and the stand seat was worth the price  good for beginners and there are many settings and features that can be explored  the one month of free simply piano classes was helpful  the app is simply wonderful  without any music knowledge  i was able to read the music symbols and notes within couple if days      
661,5.0 ,                       i bought this as a christmas gift for my    year old son  he s just learning how to play the piano at school and wanted something for him to have at home to practice  we don t have space for an actual piano so this was perfect the perfect size for the space he does have in his room      
662,5.0 ,                       i bought it for a girl who has speech problem     
663,5.0 ,                       i ve been wanting to learn to play the piano since i was a little girl  when i use to go in my grandmother s garage and tinker with her old grand piano   well  some    some odd years later i purchased this one from the treasure truck  and what a steal    you get the piano  stand  stool and headphones  my dog s favorite part    i purchased another one for my son  who ironically requested one for christmas      
664,3.0 ,                       a little tinny but great for playing around   reasonably sturdy if the kids aren t too rough with it  the many buttons is a little intimidating for my   year old thought this would be a nice pairing with the piano but he seems so distracted with buttons he doesn t just play the keyboard  i m hoping he ll grow into it      
665,5.0 ,                       i love my new keyboard  i ve played other instruments  always wanted to learn to play the keyboards piano    the stand is a little wobbly and one of the thumb screws on the stand was stripped  but this didn t detour me giving it all   stars        
666,4.0 ,                       the only complaints i have are the sound quality is basic  and the stool is uncomfortable  other than that it is a well priced keyboard for beginning piano learners  the key range is perfect for jumping right in and taking you through basic to more professional levels without breaking the bank on something fancier  overall it is a perfect fit for beginners      
667,5.0 ,                       this is a great keyboard for beginners  i bought it for my   year old son on his kindergarten graduation and he is so excited to learn how to play  it has everything you d expect from a good quality keyboard  plus it has a teaching mode  even my wife and i fight over playing time now  great price also after having done all the research  best part of all  it comes with headphones so my son can practice all he wants  as loud as he wants without annoying the rest of us  definitely recommend      
668,2.0 ,                       if i was amazon  i wouldn t list this as amazon s choice or whatever  it sounds like crap and the functions don t always work  it is good for my   year old though  i was just hoping it would be a little nicer so i would want to use it  i will just have to buy a different one for myself      
669,5.0 ,                       exactly as advertised  niece  very happy      
670,3.0 ,                       simply piano is far from free so if you are planning on this teaching for you get one with lighted keys     
671,3.0 ,                       it depends what you are looking for in a keyboard  if you are an adult and professional then this isn t it  it was perfect for what i needed it for  which was my   year old daughter  she wants piano classes and i live in an apartment  so  this is a good way to see if she will stick with it i gave it   stars because  the chair is decent  the keyboard is cheap plastic  but has a lot of functions  the headphones are decent  my biggest issue is the stand  it is so light and cheap  the keyboard is a bit top heavy and the stand design tries to account for that but doesn t succeed  my daughter already tipped it over   times and i ve had it a day  so  i need to find a way to anchor it to the wall      
672,3.0 ,                       this product had a lot of good reviews  and i could see how someone who is unfamiliar with the piano would like this product  but the sound quality is cheap and the keys are hard to play  i know i could have spent more to get a more professional sounding keyboard  but so many of the reviews said that this was high quality for a low price  the keys are not weighted like i previously thought  and read before purchasing  and it sounds cheap  i was excited about buying this at first  but now i hardly touch it because of the low quality sound and difficulty playing unweighted keys  do not buy this product if you are a professional or experienced piano player      
673,2.0 ,                       overall really dissatisfied with this keyboard pros  cheap comes with a lot for the price it at least functions as a keyboard  wasn t dead on arrival cons  sounds horrible  the voice quality is distorted and tinny  and although there s a lot of them i could count on one hand the amount of halfway decent ones  the build quality is mediocre at best  the keys feel cheap and plastic y  and they make a louder sound than the tones themselves  i cannot overstate how bad the keys are  they feel really awful  the stand feels like it could fall over at any time  and the stool is not adjustable at all  the headphones are beyond cheap build quality  but that s too be expected  the usb midi functionality is downright abysmal  when plugged into my pc and using fl keys in fl studio     there was a whole half second delay between when i hit the key and when the sound played  this essentially made using it as a midi controller completely out of the question overall i can t recommend this keyboard for anyone other than young children who won t know the difference  will absolutely be returning this and getting something from a more trusted brand      
674,5.0 ,                       just take out of box and set it up  sound is good and well worth the money      
675,3.0 ,                       i unboxed and set this up for my    yo daughter today  the picture of the stand in the directions is not the same style of stand i received  so i had to go look online to see pictures of it assembled when the keyboard is mounted on the stand in its tallest position the keyboard is so top heavy it keeps falling forward  i had to keep my foot on the stand to keep it from falling over when i turned it on nothing worked  red is on and blue is off  when i press the buttons there is no feedback to wether it recognizes the button push  after unplugging it and plugging it back in it worked better if it was for me i would prefer the older buttons  plus i think i ll either have to turn the stand around or weight it down      
676,1.0 ,                       i was sent someone s broken return  the stickers were already on it  the music stand was broken  the keyboard didn t work at all  it never played a sound  there was a missing screw as well  i waited over   weeks to get a broken item  very disappointed      
677,4.0 ,                       a good set   chair and keyboard stand are study   the keyboard itself is working great so far   a good purchase if you want to try out k earning the keyboard without spending too much money      
678,2.0 ,                       first of all  my kids love the keyboard  it s too bad i keep having to take it away from them to ship it back  the first one i ordered came with broken keys and broken earphones  the second one has an earphone jack that does not work        
679,5.0 ,                       so far so good   this was bought for my    year old daughter s birthday   she loves it   she plays it pretty much every day   she has taught herself so many songs already   we really love that we don t hear her on it unless she is playing a  concert  for us         
680,1.0 ,                       the keys do not have a good  piano  touch   they will not vary the intensity of the sound      
681,5.0 ,                       good and my son like it   it works good       
682,2.0 ,                       unable to return keyboard thus this review will have to suffice   bought keyboard for winter holiday      however after getting thoroughly acquainted  reality set in the keystrokes were off the tonality   please forward some measure of resolve   thanks for all the assistance      
683,5.0 ,                       my   year old grandson loved it  easy for him to start playing songs great gift      
684,5.0 ,                       daughter loves it and plays it every day  good investment to intermediate stage     
685,4.0 ,                       i want to relearn the piano and this is just what i wanted      
686,2.0 ,                       obviously you get what you pay for and i didn t expect a whole lot  but it really isn t worth the money   stand is incredibly unstable   even against a wall it wobbles so much as to be unusable   no midi connection   the sound is really bad  everything sounds off on it   everything is made from the cheapest possible material   not worth the money  spend a few bucks more to get something reasonable   however   the bench is surprisingly  tough and stable      
687,3.0 ,                       my daughter loved it but the plug in and the headphones were not in the box  when you order something you expect it to all be in the box  now i have to purchase them separately      
688,5.0 ,                       easy to learn     
689,5.0 ,                       this is beautiful    so easy to put together  i just did it today and plugged it right in   so far very impressed    now i m going to teach myself to play        
690,1.0 ,                       the stand broke within   month  the chair bars bent  the keyboard is very nice but very fragile and feels cheap  maybe       worth but not what s listed     
691,4.0 ,                       got this for a six year old starting piano lessons   good sound  like the headphones and the range of synth functions   because it s a    key board it drops off on the ends of the range in ways that are a bit weird   the keys are also semi weighted   but honestly for just over       this is a pretty great deal      
692,5.0 ,                       all around great christmas gift  both kids love it  app for learning is fun and it s getting used a lot  easy setup   no tools needed   so many options we haven t even tried them all yet  arrived on time and was not damaged   i use it often myself  headphones are a very nice addition      
693,4.0 ,                       i send t it to my country  i dnt open it yet     
694,5.0 ,                       my daughter takes piano lessons do we got this for her to practice at home  she loves it  it s compact and works well in place of a real piano  the sound is good and it has a headphone jack  she enjoys using it  the stool is padded and comfortable  very nice product      
695,5.0 ,                       got for a   year old  but the whole family uses it   great sound quality and keys have a nice resistance      
696,2.0 ,                       the keyboard seems to be working well far  however the packaged arrived with missing parts  no head phones  i ve reached out to the customer support email provided on multiple occasions and have received no response      
697,4.0 ,                       went together easy all set up  now  if i can just get him to play with it      
698,1.0 ,                       i bought this keyboard  superkit  for my   year old granddaughter   i liked being able to get the  stand  stool  and headphones along with the keyboard   the reviews were so good that i thought that i d be safe to try this unfamiliar brand unfortunately  i had return the items because two keys in the middle of the keyboard had a very high pitch screeching sound   i returned it to get another one with even more keys that were screeching   because my granddaughter may take piano lessons  i feel it is important that she has better quality so  i returned two of these  but i will say that amazon was terrific to give me credit for the returned items   it was hard to take my granddaughter s christmas present away from her twice  i ordered a yamaha  at a greater expense  and it is wonderful   i should have known better to begin with   you usually get what you pay for      
699,4.0 ,                       great for beginners and fun     
700,3.0 ,                       so far so good  my boyfriend loves it  i am disappointed however as it states it comes with headphones  and i didn t not receive any      
701,5.0 ,                       i got this for my kids this past christmas and they were both       happy with it   comes with the stand  bench  and headphones which comes in handy lol  they don t use it as much as i had thought they would but hoping maybe as they grow it will spark an interest  great for kids and beginners      
702,5.0 ,                       this is the most played with thing in our house amongst   kids and the adults  my kids have literally taught themselves how to play it by using youtube videos  much better than video games      
703,2.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          probably would ve been a great item if it didn t arrive with keys that didn t function  also immediately after buying it became unavailable so i was unable to ask for a replacement which was a bummer  it was for a birthday present and she didn t even get the chance to enjoy it fully      
704,1.0 ,                       only   star because   keys dont work  bought it for my son for christmas  he was extremely excited to receive it  the whole kit fit perfectly in his room and the included headphones keep us sane while he learns to play      
705,5.0 ,                       great piano for beginners  guarantee hours of fun  stand seems like it won t hold the piano but has been holding up great      
706,3.0 ,                       i tried both the hyperx cloud pro   the rockjam headphones that come with the keyboard  these are super uncomfortable by the way   and in both cases i could hear an annoying static noise  the instrument sounds fine without using headphones  but if you re like me and can t afford to play out loud most of the time  this might be a deal breaker for you a minor note  no pun intended  to make is that the stickers started wearing out after only two days of playing  see the picture i attached for an example overall  this is a decent keyboard for beginners  if i didn t buy this during prime day at a discount  i might have been inclined to give it   stars  however  at the price that i did purchase it at  i m content with what i received      
707,5.0 ,                       my    year old daughter loves it   my    year old uses it with her   she downloaded apps to her tablet to help her learn to play   we have had it for   months so far       
708,1.0 ,                       fine to learn the basics but keys are smaller than a piano which will teach incorrect muscle memory  died after   months of use  won t turn on

710,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i m giving a   star review because the keyboard bundle in itself is great so far   but it is a flat out lie that the app with the music and teaching functions is free   you sign up for it before you find out it is only free for   week  then you are charged         for the next year   yes  you are charged the         all at once the week after you receive the keyboard and sign in on the app      
711,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i kept mulling over getting this keyboard because it was some brand i d never heard of   but the price was right  so i decided to give it a shot this keyboard didn t even last me a second i was elated to find this delivered and sitting on my porch and i couldn t wait to plug it in and try it out   the instant i hit the power button  i was blasted with feedback   i fiddled with the power plug and the feedback died down a little  but it was still buzzing and it would not go away this caused me to start to look at the keyboard a little closer and i began to notice the things i could not live without here were my issues with this keyboard  all discerned in the first   minutes     the feedback     the lcd display was not working     very heavy     the power button is very cheaply made   it felt terrible pushing   to give you an idea  this felt like i was pressing an emergency shunt to shut off gasoline pumps at your local convenience store  if you ve ever done that      the keys felt like cheap plastic     the feel of the keys was way off   it took too much force to strike a key     i could see the circuit board in between keys   this may seem insignificant  but this demonstrates that there is a direct path for your spilled drink to fry the circuitry i really should ve trusted my gut and gone with an established brand      
712,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i bought this product new not too long ago  and one of the  keys just cracked and broke while i was playing   is there anyway i can have it replaced   without this key it is completely useless   please reply asap  see photo attached      
713,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       stand  i feel the stand works quit well   once you have everything tightened and the key board actually attached to it  it all feels very sturdy   i love that it is adjustable in height   i purchased this for my   yr old   although it can be used for an adult as well   and the adjustable stand brought the keyboard down to just the right height for her    it goes pretty low to normal height seat   is not adjustable  but since the stand is  so it doesn t matter   the seat is a bit small   it s probably fine for a very small adult and children   but if you are an average to larger size person like me  then you will want to purchase the piano separately and get a larger keyboard piano bench headphones   not a very good quality   they crackle at times   i use a child s headphone set because it limits the volume output lcd screen   is nice   if you want to know what a key is  you just press the key and it shows up on the grand staff on the screen   but i use sticker notes for my daughter  and you can see them better   nice to have a built in metronome con       star  every time you turn the keyboard on  the default volume is max  and you have to adjust it   i don t see a place where i can change this to default to a lower setting   my casio turns down extremely low  and when i turn it off  the next time i use it  it is still at the volume i left it on   i wish that is how this one was keys   i find these keys are stiffer than my casio keys   i was worried about my  yr old being able to use them  but she seems to do fine with them  so they must not be that stiff overall   great set   great price for a beginner      
714,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i bought this for my    year old granddaughter for christmas  i had looked at several different keyboards   what i like about this is that it has the mic  stool  pedal  headphones  there is also an app that it recommends to learn the keyboard and you can place your smart phone or tablet right on the stand and it knows which keys you re playing  if you put the headphones in  you can play or practice and no one around you can hear anything and the volume in the headphones is a very comfortable level  considering everything i looked at i found this to be a great bargain considering everything that comes with it      
715,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       our son wanted a keyboard for his   th birthday to learn how to play piano as well as make songs for computer games he was designing  we ve purchased instruments before  it s easier and ultimately returns more value for the money if you also buy the extras  like a stand and bench  i was happy to find such an affordable kit  and surprised that it works so well     months later  all the pieces are still sturdy and functioning as intended  i d buy it again and would recommend it  however  the cord for the ac adapter isn t very long  a power strip can help  and is probably a good idea anyway       
716,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i ordered a brand new item  and i got a second hand one  everything was throw in the boxn marks on the item  so unprofessional  se the little parts in the sandwitch bag      
717,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this was purchased for my daughter for christmas  after using it for for two months the bottom right corner of the screen began to disappear  and of course this  happened after the deadline for product support and return  don t buy this      a waste of money      
718,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i am an adult piano learner and this is a great starting point for anyone just learning piano  for the price point i do not think it can be beaten  yes you do not get as sophisticated sounds as you would with a more expensive keyboard but for a beginner it is fantastic  i found that the app youcisian works much better than the one advertised with this set  piano maestro
