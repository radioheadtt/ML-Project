0,5.0,                       i love this little breakfast sandwich maker  i wish i had gotten the double maker  fast easy breakfast      
1,5.0,                       this item is awesome  if you re looking to making quick breakfast sandwiches  look no further  the only downside is that i haven t quite gotten it to mcdonald s level  they have some secret that i m unaware of this device is small  lightweight  and very easy to clean      
2,5.0,                       i was skeptical that the breakfast sandwich maker could replicate a sandwich that i would purchase   actually  these taste better and it is so easy to use   i can t believe how perfectly the sandwiches cook   i used english muffins  canadian bacon  egg and cheese for our first ones   next  i plan to try frozen pancakes  egg  and bacon or canadian bacon from a recipe that came with the sandwich maker very impressed      
3,4.0,                       this is a great little item  i never give   stars  so that is why    but  this is very good  i just received product  opens it up  and made a sandwich  that simple  no assembly   easy instructions  so simple  just plug it in  let it heat up  put half a muffin in bottom tray  layet what you want on top  meat cheese  veg etc  lower middle tray  crackers egg in it  set top muffin half on it and close top  wait about   to   minutes  time depend on what you have  i can open it an check  then  when done open top  slide rotate the middle flat tray that egg is on rotate it out and it now is all together as sandwich  lift it up and out  done  the device is very small and compact which i love  not a big bulky thing  and it fits anywhere in kitchen  great item      
4,4.0,                       this thing is a neat little appliance   makes decent tasting sandwiches however my issue is with my cheese getting completely melted and making a horrible mess   the pictures show a perfectly melted cheese slice but in my experiences that s not that case   will have to try some different cheese and see if it will fix the problem edit  as stated in the comments fold the cheese from the corners to the middle and melting out problem fixed   neat little sandwich maker      
5,5.0,                       bought for a christmas present  therefore can t give star ratings  haven t  been let down by company before  if that helps your decision     
6,5.0,                       i have quite a drive to work in the morning  so usually i pull through a drive thru and get a breakfast sandwich to eat in the way   no more   i bought this sandwich maker during the holidays and it is wonderful   i put the bottom part of a muffin  then cracked an egg  then top part of the muffin   i didn t scramble the egg   closed it and   minutes later i had breakfast   i plan to try adding cooked sausage and bacon some days  but this plain sandwich was so fast   also appliance is easy to clean   very pleased      
7,2.0,                       not worth it  i was really surprised how much i don t like it given all of the glowing reviews  our hope was to kick out a hot sandwich in   minutes or so  not including preheat time   nope  takes a lot longer  so long that by the time we make   of them it becomes a real burden in the morning  will gift this to our kids or donate  not worth the cupboard space nor cost      
8,5.0,                       oh yummy this is a miniature marvel  so many customers have already submitted pics that i won t  but this little sandwich maker is a workhorse and worth every bit of      really you are limited only by your imagination as to what you can make with this  if you re even sitting on the fence re this purchase you should just buy it   love this      
9,5.0,                       this is well made and so convenient to use easy cleanup i bought two of these one for my college bound grandson and one for my husband      
10,5.0,                       wow  my hubby says this is the best fathers day present he s ever gotten  it s easy to assemble  folks fast  the sandwich is duo crispy  steamy  and savory after less than   min  and clean up it s easy too  it s really small so it easily stashes away in a drawer  it s very simple which makes it great and worthwhile purchase that you will use  i hate clutter so i tend to stay away from kitchen gadgets  but i really like this thing  it s fun to make breakfast sandwiches  the recipe book is pretty scarce  though  but you can easily make up recipes  yesterday i made mini bagel  egg  mild green chilis  pepper jack cheese and sirloin steak sandwiches      
11,4.0,                       i bought this as a christmas present for my husband  it arrived on schedule  and on christmas we opened it up  the sandwich maker was initially smaller than i expected but that was no big deal  we followed the directions  letting it heat up until the light turns green  we used non stick cooking spray and for the sandwich we had bought english muffins and precooked sausage patties  the maker is really easy to use  we put the bottom piece of the muffin in the bottom section along with a sausage patty  then in the top sections we cracked open an egg and broke the yolk as directed and put the top part of the muffin on last  i closed the lid and the directions said to let it cook for about   minutes  after the timer was up we moved the plate that separates the top and bottom aside and then opened the maker up to reveal a nicely cooked sandwich  the muffin was not burnt it was perfectly toasted  the egg had been cooked nicely and was shaped the same size as the muffin and the sausage had been heated thoroughly  when we were done and it was cool it s as easy as just lifting the pieces out of the maker to be cleaned  overall  i really like this sandwich maker  i only give it   stars because i had bought bagels to use as well  but they were too big for the maker  also  if using frozen patties i would suggest warming them up a little first because they were heated in the maker  but could have been heated a little more      
12,3.0,                       i would have given it   stars except all of the little screws in the removable  dishwasher safe  part rusted almost immediately  they should have been made with stainless steel   otherwise  nice little machine  also  if you have more than a   person household i would recommend you consider the dual sandwich maker so you can make   in one go      
13,5.0,                       bought this as a christmas gift  this is a must have for everyone and anyone i m telling you  makes things so much easier      
14,1.0,                       big fan of this item and have had one for many years  in silver  and decided to buy another   this one in red for some reason was extremely loose in the connection for the sandwich maker and the egg continually leaked out   i tried it several times and to no avail   can t believe it is because of the color of the unit but bought another somewhere else in silver again and it is fine   maybe a bad lot  but we do love the item      
15,5.0,                       these are a great for making breakfast sandwiches   we bought the first one on amazon based on the recommendation of a friend   it didn t take long for this to become one of our favorite appliances   it cooks an egg sandwich in   minutes  cleans easily and the insert is dishwasher safe   because it uses very little electricity we bought one for our rv and we love it for camping trips   i guess you could say we went a little crazy over this little device because we have purchased them as gifts for family members also   i can t say enough good things about this product and it is very inexpensive for what you get and what it does      
16,5.0,                       works great  i would recommend that you make sure if you place ham or something in between the plates to make sure it is tucked in there and that it is not sticking out  we had the ham sticking out the first go around and the egg spilled out a little  next time fixed the ham and pushed it into the bottom and it worked great  if you use cheese too it helps mold everything together  i also used scrambled eggs and worked great too      
17,5.0,                       this is handy for my kids to cook with in the morning   online school is making work and home life hard  something should be easy      
18,4.0,                       this is a fun little gadget   it s kind of amazing how it works   plug it in  and by the time you get the english muffins and the eggs out of the fridge  it s ready to go   i tried it with regular bacon and canadian bacon  and the sandwiches are delicious   i wrapped my sandwich up in aluminum foil at home to stay warm and ate it for breakfast at work      
19,4.0,                       this product is easy to use as instructed  however  when making eggs that are scrambled they do not cook very well  it s really meant more for a sunny side egg  i find if you are doing a scrambled egg the egg gets soaked up into the bread  you have to pre cook the egg a little first and cheese gets pretty messy melting  in the future i would not add cheese to these sandwiches      
20,5.0,                       i have seen videos about this online  and decided to get one for myself   since i enjoy the egg mcmuffin  i normally use this little gem to make my own version   a little bit of experimentation with the cooking times and ingredients make sandwiches consistently and easily      
21,3.0,                       great idea in theory   it works okay but not as slick as it is made out to be      
22,1.0,                       this is absolutely the worst  it s a great idea  but the design needs some tweaking   i followed the instructions carefully  the top portion would not stay level and the entire raw egg slid out making a ridiculous mess      
23,4.0,                       this is a great little machine for making breakfast items  the only problem i have is the cheese seems to melt all over the place  it could be i m using the incorrect type of cheese  i love the taste of my johnny breakfast sandwiches     
24,5.0,                       got this gadget   days ago and already have used it several times for breakfast and lunch   having   kids and working myself  we are so rushed in the mornings  and cold cereal gets old   bought this and the kids love it  my    year old uses it herself  we bought english muffins  ham  cheddar slices  sausage patties  etc   the ingredients are endless  i can t wait to try other variations  after a few tries  you will perfect how to use it without egg spilling  cheese slipping off  etc   i ve been making breakfast sandwiches in the frying pan for years  this little machine is a super time saver  so glad i bought it and my kids can have a nutritious hot breakfast now before school   next time i need to buy someone a gift  they are getting this      
25,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my dad  who has eaten a chain restaurant mc jack bk breakfast sammie at least once a week for the last     years or so   as a recipient by proxy  my mom was pumped at the prospect of being able to combine faux eggs with a boatload of veggies and it s not even really  cheese  to make a  healthier  version   after its first use  the parents reported success via text message photos of their sammie creations   they also reported that it was easy to use and clean up after use   my dad delighted in the instruction book  which reminds you to pre cook the meats and not use it near water  like he was going to make breakfast in the shower  kramer style  and declared this  the best gift i have ever received      stars  highly recommend      
26,5.0,                       we love this  product  i bought it for my husband for christmas  it was one of those desperations gifts  he is very hard to buy for  i wasn t sure if he would use it  but it was worth a try for those mornings when he doesn t have a lot of time and won t be able to  eat for a good while if he doesn t eat before he leaves home  we ve used it far more than i would have predicted  we demonstrated it to two of our sons and they both bought on also  one even before he left for home   we buy pre cooked sausage patties  thaw them in the micro for    sec   scramble the egg and put it all together  in   minutes we have a good hot  filling breakfast sandwich  i don t care much for one use appliances  but this one is worth it and it takes up very little in the way of counter space      
27,4.0,                       really had fun making my own egg mac you know   only reason i didn t give it   stars  is because at    cents a crack  you could buy a lot of them  before you got your money back   although  i will say  the grand kids sure enjoyed this  a lot better than loading up the car and driving to that place with arches   by letting them participate  they got a huge kick out of the experience   what i especially liked about the sandwich maker  was the ability to experiment with all kinds of fillings   one word to the wise  don t try anything like peanut butter and jelly  man  that took awhile to clean up        
28,5.0,                       i ve always put off buying this for some reason and what a horrible mistake that was  this thing is pretty cool  i mean i d rather make it on the stove because i like bigger sandwich s  but if i m in a rush  this is my go to  quick easy and you re out with minimal clean up  recommend this highly      
29,5.0,                       i love this little gadget  now i can make breakfast sandwiches at home that are just as good as mcdonalds  just wished i purchased the double which i will be buying soon      
30,5.0,                       i bought this for a gift for my husband  he literally loves this thing  he uses it every single morning for breakfast sandwiches  if he was writing the review he would say it s the best invention ever made      
31,5.0,                       we are loving this  have only used it   times so far  it is not a big counter hog  really easy to use  beware of using too much cheese as it will ooz out the sides  the egg whites are cooked   not runny at all  same for the egg yolk   i wish it came with a little more recipes  i went out   bought a seperate cookbook for it  kind of a pia that it is round however  it makes a perfect egg mcmuffin in only a few minutes so you can make one   run out the door      
32,5.0,                       i love this product  it is as easy as it looks and all the great reviews are mirrored here without me having to repeat it  this product perfectly fits an english muffin    egg  a few slices of pre cooked bacon ham etc  you can add in some spinach  onion  tomato or a small amount of other veggies  the product takes about   minutes to preheat and     minutes to cook  breakfast sandwich comes out piping hot and ready to eat in just a few minutes  great for adults and kids and anyone on the go  the sandwich seems to all melt together and can be eaten while you walk or drive simple and very easy to clean  true nonstick  i just simply wipe it down with paper towel after each use my only negative about this product is that it recommends you put the cheese in as you assemble and cook the cheese with everything else  i found     minutes seemed to melt the cheese completely out of the sandwich and all the cheese burned onto the sides of the english muffin  i ve since added the cheese when the sandwich is done and it melts in perfectly  nothing major i would recommend this product to others and will add this to christmas gifts this year      
33,1.0,                       do not buy this if you want to make breakfast in a hurry   it leaked egg all over my counter  it burnt the bagel top  when it was done the egg was not cooked but the bagel was burnt   difficult to clean up   much easier to use a skillet and do it that way      
34,5.0,                       i ve had this in my wishlist for a few months so when there were some reward points in my account i ordered one for our office  we ve had it for about a week now and i have to say that everyone is loving it  it gets turned on around     am and we cook up our own breakfast sandwiches until  am  each one taking about   minutes to prepare  some bring ham  others are using precooked sausage patties or canadian bacon  we ve also used diced ham which seems to be the favorite choice as far as the machine goes  i m impressed  it preheats quickly  the egg section does not leak or stick if you give it a quick spray of cooking oil  the egg cooks well and the cheese is always melted well   the instructions say that   minutes per sandwich is needed for cooking time  that s way too much in my opinion  we ve cut back to   minutes  the eggs are always fully cooked and the sandwich is way too hot too handle   a small wood or plastic spatula is a must  could the unit be improved  if the egg section was slightly smaller in diameter the egg probably wouldn t fold over the edges of the muffin top and that would make sandwich handling a little better in my opinion  if i could find a larger muffin that wouldn t be an issue  that s just me  i can t take points away for that would i buy another  hell yes  this thing is great  everyone starts out the day happy and contented with a little breakfast at the office  everyone just picks up the ingredients they like and our cost per sandwich is less than    per  i was stopping at the c store each morning and spending       for a crappy sausage biscuit every morning  this is more satisfying  healthy and convenient in my opinion      
35,5.0,                       when i first saw this i read the reviews and was impressed   but when i first used it i loved it   i followed the advise from some of the reviews and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast sandwich   the cleanup is quick and easy and i keep it on the counter because i use it frequently   the recipes which come with the instructions also show that this can be used for more than just breakfast sandwiches   in addition i liked it so much that i ordered another to give as a christmas gift   they love theirs too   highly recommended      
36,5.0,                       we received this item last week and already love it  my husband makes a breakfast sandwich almost every morning and i will have one multiple times a week  this has streamlined the process and minimized the mess  we love it  it takes only a minute or so to heat up and     minutes to make the perfect breakfast sandwich an added plus it s compact size makes it easy to store or to leave out on the counter a few notes this works best with english muffins it will work with smaller bagels  like the regular sized lenders  but the lid does not close all the way with the thicker bread other bread items such as pancakes  crumpets etc  will have to be trimmed to fit into the       internal measurement  circular rings of the cooker  or made to fit  this device gets really hot would recommend using mitts when using this machine  just like the instructions say to do  if you like breakfast sandwiches  i would not hesitate to purchase this product      
37,5.0,                       took this to my kids house and this really was a big hit for breakfast  we used it with ham and bacon  we used regular eggs  eggs in a carton and duck eggs  i have two recommendations    use smaller eggs  don t use large or jumbo eggs  they will spill out  and once you remove your sandwich if using english muffins cover them in a bowl and let them rest for a bit before eating  the bread is crunchy when first removed from machine  covering them and letting them sit softens the bread back up  it is easy to use  easy to clean and the sandwiches we made each morning were very good      
38,2.0,                       two stars instead of one only because it technically does what it says which is make an egg sandwich  it s small so the only bread i ve found that fits is english muffins  not sure how you would find croissants or bagels that would fit in it  and not regular sandwich bread either  the top bread that goes over the egg sinks into the egg so it s just one fused blob  adding cheese makes a mess  only egg  meat  and muffin works   still takes a while between preheating and cooking  including cooling off enough to eat count on upwards of    minutes from plugging in until you have a sandwich you can eat  used it a few times  probably won t ever use it again  disappointing      
39,5.0,                       yes i ma guy and no i didn t read directions until  yup you know it  i used pancake dough that slide out plate  use it  ts there to make it all work right dough in the bottom  then the egg   now here is where it takes pratice  heat it then slide plate out  then back then dough not you put in meat and dough and wait a bit the slide back out that lets the meat and partly cooked down fall down and then cook ittime  don t know  i guess it s just practisewhen done lift both plates and plastic spatchula onto plateabout   and i m all done     
40,5.0,                       best gift for myself        i cannot stress enough how amazing this is   on weekends i make a complete sandwich in the machine  and on weekdays i just use the bottom half and make a perfect egg sunny side up  put it in a tupperware and throw an  english muffin or bagel with a slice of cheese in a ziploc and toast the bread at work  reheat the egg in the microwave and put it all together   i had a healthy  deeeelicious breakfast at work and save so much money on a daily basis  as my breakfast would average      every morning and a dozen eggs costs like           
41,5.0,                       i like this  it is so easy to use  the only thing is that the inner rings fall out when i am taking out the sandwich    it s hot  otherwise i like this and have used it several times in the last days     
42,5.0,                       this is amazing     literally makes such good breakfast sandwiches in under    min from start to finish  i wish i got the double to make   at the same time      
43,5.0,                       omg i really love this thing  i got this for my husband for fathers day but i m the one using it every day lol  it s super easy and makes perfect breakfast sandwiches  you d think there would be a big mess with cheese and egg but the non stick surface works great and i ve had to do nothing more than give it a quick wipe with a dish rag  its super small which is a plus as my kitchen is crowded with gadgets  it s also quick to heat up and very simple to use  i really can t find anything to complain about      
44,5.0,                       this looks like a ridiculous sold on tv infomercial gadget  but it s not at all   my son uses it at college and loves it   we all used it while he was home for christmas   we put the muffin in while it is warming up and this helps the muffin be a little more toasted  otherwise we follow the directions  very easy to clean  this is a ridiculously fun kitchen gadget that you won t regret buying      
45,5.0,                       i love this  i thought it was going to be complicated and since i m a senior i m used to writing easy notes for myself  but this is so easy to use i tossed my notes after the first time  it s fast   easy to put a sandwich together and that makes things great for arthritic hands  the cooking parts are all one jointed piece  so that makes cleaning easier too   i m really happy with this      
46,1.0,                       waste of money   either the egg is over cooked or under cooked  english muffins don t toast  and cooked sausage didn t even get warmed      
47,4.0,                       bought this as a white elephant gift and very disappointed that it came in just a brown box with sandwich toaster written on the side  will have to explain what it is and not be able to see their reaction after unwrapping it  i think i am going to print pictures of it and tape them to the side      
48,5.0,                       i stumbled upon this sandwich maker looking for a gift idea for my other half who is forever toasting some toast   scrambling some eggs and pan frying some sausage or bacon    just to slap it all together into a sandwich with multiple dirty dishes left to cleanup   have only tried english muffins   eggs and canadian bacon so far but the possibilities are endless   excited to try some new things   this little reasonably price sandwich maker is something i don t know if i can live without ever again and wish i had known about it earlier it is very easy to use   pre heat the unit until the green light turns on       mins    load up the bottom part of your sandwich with your bread  biscuit   english muffin or mini bagel    cheese and pre cooked meat   close first lid then drop your egg in  large eggs seem like they might be about the max    season   drop the top of your bread on top and close the lid   wait   minutes   flip the egg door open to combine the sandwich   lift the entire lid and you have a piping hot breakfast sandwich ready to go one bad is this has made it far to easy to throw together a delicious breakfast sandwich at any hour       pm and i don t feel like heating up leftovers   rev up the breakfast sandwich maker   don t feel like cooking dinner   rev up the breakfast sandwich maker     hours until brunch but   hours after breakfast and feeling a bit peckish   rev up the breakfast sandwich maker      
49,5.0,                       one of my favorite buys on amazon to date  i absolutely love this product and it still continues to amaze me every time i use it  it has helped with my morning routine and also with my diet  it makes it easier to have a healthy breakfast every morning and stick to a healthy diet  i have recommended this to many of my family members and friends      
50,5.0,                       this thing rock  so easy and it actually works my boys get there breakfast ready as they are getting ready for school    mins and done  clean up with a paper towel      
51,5.0,                       this sturdy little gadget packs tons of value into a low price tag  works very well and is easy to clean up   easy to use instructions and recipes included  compact size provides for easy storage  i like that you can make a sandwich without adding extra oils or butter   would buy it again and highly recommend it      
52,3.0,                       it s actually pretty simple  but awkward and a little dangerous  it gets very hot and only certain areas can be touched  read the directions carefully  english muffins are the right size  but any other kind of bread has to be cut to fit  after i d used it three times i decided it really isn t worth the trouble  the resulting sandwiches are good enough  but i m not that fond of eggs      
53,1.0,                       this is an awfull product  you can t make anything in this  it leaks  it takes forever to make the sandwich  and then you get a soggy sandwich  it a waste of money  they advise you to use scrambled eggs     then why did i buy it  i thought it was all in one  don t buy it  also  only miniature bagels will fit in ot tiny english muffins  nothing standard  and your bacon or ham will not cook      
54,5.0,                       i bought this for the it office where i work  i have been using this since the back end of august      and we all love this device   especially since it has gotten cold outside   i m not sure what to make of the reviews that indicate that the egg has seeped out   i have not encountered this once   one of my co workers did   but it was because he did not completely shut the swing away plate completely closed   timing has to be adjusted to everyone s likes but for the most part  having used often over the course of the last   months   this device works really well   i am giving a lot of these away as christmas gifts this year      
55,4.0,                       i ve heard mixed reviews about this  some people  like alton brown  said it was junk  but i really like it  i don t give myself enough time to cook breakfast in the morning before work because typically i m leaving the house anywhere between      and      am  so i get up  get ready and go  i like to grab my breakfast on the go or something i can put together when i get to work  a gadget like this helps  because not only are frozen breakfast sandwiches expensive  but they are honestly gross  this is cheaper and tastes better  only thing about it is that it s best to make it and then let it sit for like    minutes because it s very hot when it comes off and it s messy  letting it sit to cool down keeps it together and more manageable to eat  i ve used ham  that precooked microwavable bacon  steak ums and frozen sausage patties  which is the only one i precook in the microwave before i put it in the sandwich to cook with it   i like to make my sandwich the night before  put it in a sandwich baggie and then microwave it for like    seconds in the morning when i get to work  very convenient for me      
56,5.0,                       saves a lot of   compared getting our sausage muffins at micky d s     
57,5.0,                       so easy to use   i make an egg with a muffin every day for breakfast  i wait to put the cheese on because otherwise it melts everywhere  its so good      
58,5.0,                       in the history of my family s small appliance use  this is the only one that we all use all the time   i am gluten free and have made breakfast sandwiches using gf english muffins which are the bomb   i make several on a sunday night so kids and spouse can just grab  warm up  and go   it is small and can fit in a drawer instead of on the counter with the bigger useless appliances   this little guy saved breakfast      
59,5.0,                       extremely nice  makes perfect sandwiches   just follow the directions carefully pre heat  completely close the egg hot plate  don t push down on the top cover  and only use up to a large size egg  also it helps if you pour the egg batter in slowly to allow it to cook a little as you pour so it doesn t leak  don t add sugary items as they might burn as things cook  add that afterwards  i may have strange tastes but here s my recipe  english muffin bottom     cheddar cheese slice     cooked ham slices  or   pre cooked bacon slices  broken in halves    large egg batter       tbs peanut butter   english muffin top  i found the peanut butter burned a little so you might want to add that after it s done  yum      
60,5.0,                       we regularly spent     a weekend on panera breakfast sandwiches  which i still very much love  but in an effort to be more financially conscious  we bought this sandwich maker and it is awesome   takes a little prep work    we cook our bacon first and scramble the egg a little bit in a separate bowl  but other than that it is so easy   it literally comes out as a perfectly cooked piece of breakfast architecture   english muffin  perfectly cooked bacon  scrambled egg  little salt and pepper  and vermont white cheddar    my god  it s glorious   very easy to clean too   does it get any better       
61,1.0,                       total fail  burnt bagel  raw egg  messy waste of food  see photos      
62,5.0,                       i bought this as a white elephant gift  but my son ended up with it at the end of the game so it came home with us  i m surprised at how convenient this little sandwich maker is  i was really worried about cracking an egg into it but the plate is so hot there is no spill over  as someone who tends to skip breakfast  this is a great way to make something quick with a good amount of protein  my favorite combination  so far  is english muffin  pre cooked sausage patty  cheddar  egg  spinach leaves  not only do all the ingredients come together nicely  but the muffin gets nice and crispy on the outside  clean up is easy since the stacking segments come out so everything can be wiped down      
63,5.0,                       i have one of these and i bought a second one for my mom for christmas  i really hope she enjoys it as much as i enjoy mine    it s so quick and easy  dishwasher safe center  easy to wipe down and clean  saves so much money     i used to be obsessed with mcdonald s mcmuffins  now i can make my own and make them a lot healthier  i love it    my mom hits up the drive thru almost every morning on the way to her dental office  now she won t have too  you re welcome mom       
64,3.0,                       i needed to replace my old hamilton beach breakfast sandwich maker as the old one  very many years old  was peeling on the inside   not sure that it was safe to use with food with non stick surface peeling off   so i ordered a new one   exactly the same but seemed flimsy   the center section is very loose and the insert comes off much too easily   i m sure it will be fine and i ordered a second one for our vacation home   it s a great addition to the kitchen and has a small footprint   you can use it without a muffin and just slide the egg   bacon ham on to toast over a slice of cheese      
65,5.0,                       although i found it odd to put the egg and top of your sandwich in the same compartment  this thing is amazing  nothing sticks to it  not the egg  not cheese  nothing  super easy to clean  super easy to disassemble and reassemble    minutes is all it takes  awesome piece of kitchen i now use often      
66,5.0,                       purchased this for my husband as a christmas present  but really the entire family has benefited      as described only wish one could cook     at a time      
67,5.0,                       this thing works exactly as promoted   preheat for   minutes  add english muffins cheese and egg    minutes later a perfectly cooked breakfast sandwich  super easy to clean and store     
68,5.0,                       i bought one of these for every person in my family last christmas  i use this several times a week  i love being able to throw together a delicious breakfast sandwich with little effort  i am considering buying the double sandwich maker to speed up the process in the weekends when my kids want one  too      
69,5.0,                       love this sandwich maker  this is my second one  i use it at work to make grilled cheese sandwiches in the office  my first one was dropped and the stand cracked exposing the wires      
70,4.0,                       i like it    makes sammiches quickly  just make sure not to over fill the upper section with egg because it will overflow and kinda make a mess   maybe i m doing something wrong   the lower section is larger  wish it was the other way around  and making a second sammich  make sure to let it heat back up  because otherwise it will take longer than the first   ez to clean  if it don t overflow or leak   there is a learning curve to this   but it is well made and convenient      
71,2.0,                       this gadget is flimsy and does not work as advertised   i followed the instructions that came with it  but the egg ran over into the counter  the plate and rings are not securely fastened and slip out of the sandwich maker as soon as you touch it   it s messy and a potential fire hazard   don t buy it      
72,5.0,                       this machine became part of my morning ritual  i wake up  turn on my keurig and then plug this right in next to it the sandwiches are always amazing and now my girlfriend and i are both addicted      
73,5.0,                       ive been using this for a while now  and so far  i ve had   issues with it and excellent sandwiches in the morning   i ve used some pam on it  but i ve even stopped doing that too much   sandwiches come out perfect every time   it takes a couple minutes to warm up  and by the time i ve gotten my ingredients together on the counter the pre heat is done  then i use my watch timer for   minutes  and poof   perfect sandwich   i ve also thrown the insert into the dishwasher without issue   fair warning  the sandwiches are very hot through and through   i ve brougt extras into work with me from home and they were still hot         
74,4.0,                       overall i really like this product   my only comment is that it s a little too small to accommodate a bagel as was suggested as a possible bread choice   otherwise  the product performs as described   it s a small unit so it fits nicely  and can remain  on the counter   because of the time it takes to cook the egg  cheese does get very melted  i use thick slice  real cheese  so it can get a bit messy but it s nice to have a fairly quick option in the morning besides cereal and this provides that option      
75,5.0,                       i love this thing  i recommend it to everyone that enjoys breakfast sandwiches one suggestion for people that get this though  i dont follow the step exactly  they have you put the top piece of breading on when the egg is still raw  i cook the egg first  pull the slide so the egg drops on the sandwich  this point the egg is basically done cooking  it just stays hot   then put my top piece of bread in there  following the instructions before made the top piece soggy and it seemed the middle of the egg didnt get fully cooked      
76,5.0,                       simple and easy  and easy to clean    make sure you read the product description  this does not have a timer   i saw some complaints about that but there s nothing misleading in the product description  it s never been a problem for us   just use the timer on your phone or alexa or smartwatch or whatever and you re good to go  seriously  it s        we are surrounded by electronics      
77,5.0,                       i love this this little breakfast sandwich maker with english muffins  for the bottom half  i add cheese and a meat  place it in the bottom half  add a stirred egg to the top half and place the top half of the english muffin on to of the egg  close  wait   minutes and you have great breakfast sandwich  used it maybe a hundred times and it is still going strong  i have the middle section in the dishwasher right now and easily wiped down the upper an lower plates for tomorrow morning  i always use a not stick spray on the egg portion which seems to last for two or three sandwiches     
78,5.0,                       i eat a lot of breakfast sandwiches because they are so convenient but have always had to pay the high price of frozen sandwiches from the grocery store or had to stop at a fast food place   when i saw this product i was so excited  and it has not disappointed me   it is the only appliance i actually leave out on my counter   it feels very well made  it s super easy to clean up  but most importantly it is as easy and quick as they say it is   i feel much better about eating them now because i know exactly what is going into them   it s non stick so i don t have to use any butter at all   and can pick and choose what i put in them   my only issue is that the egg is much larger than the english muffin so it forces me to use a knife and fork but hopefully i can find larger muffins    do they sell different sized muffins    unfortunately  it has to be that big though or it wouldn t work with the other options like bagels   maybe in version   they can make different sized rings   i only paid     bucks on amazon for this and it will pay for itself really quick   love it      
79,5.0,                       it took a couple of tries to get it right but afterwards  perfect   unit makes a perfect sausage egg muffin  easy to clean      
80,5.0,                       bought for my    year old son for a christmas present  he loves it  he has been making the entire family sandwiches      
81,5.0,                       at first it was a little awkward to use  but once i figured out it works better if you scramble the egg first and then put it in the sandwich maker all worked better   it is very easy to clean      
82,5.0,                       this is the coolest kitchen gadget we have  and we have many  lol  it came in this morning and i immediately had to try it  we bought frozen breakfast sausage patties  had some cheese and english muffins  we ll never have to go to mcdonald s for breakfast again  i got it so my husband could make breakfast really quick before work and from start to finish  prepping and cooking took under   minutes      
83,1.0,                       the removable pin that keeps it together is way too easy to lose  well at least if you have teenage kids  renders the product useless once the pin goes missing  worked great prior to that      
84,5.0,                       we love our little sandwich maker  follow the instructions and then get creative  works well with bengals  english miffins  hamburger buns and sliced bread  it dose a great job cooking the egg and toasting the bread  we add our sliced cheese after the sandwich is finished in the sandwich maker tho   seems like the type of sliced cheese we buy melts a little too much when put with the sandwich in the machine  no big deal really   we just add it when we add our condements  the only regret we have is we should have bought the double sandwich maker instead of the single        
85,5.0,                       i was on the fence about buying this based on reviews but i did anyway  got it home and thought   what the heck  there are no instructions and it seems like stuff would leak out   well  there were on the box type of instructions and a fast internet search did the trick  at the time i was low carb and made a cheese bun with it that had sausage and egg  it turned out great  my husband has made a few sandwiches and they are impressive  i noticed it work really well if you use a whole egg and just barely pop the yoke  my husband whisked an egg and asked shredded cheese and it fluffed up like a mini quiche  we have had minimal leakage but for some reason only when you whisk the egg  it literally makes a hot and yummy sandwich in   minutes  as a side note  i had homemade bread and no muffins so i took a slice of bread and placed it on the bottom layer of the machine and just brought down the ring above it to punch out a round bread  of course do this when the unit is off  made a nice and toasty bread and egg sandwich please be very careful as this thing gets super hot almost immediately  definitely not for use by small children      
86,3.0,                       i ordered this because the double sandwich one wasn t available   this won t work for us  five minutes to cook one sandwich  wait   minutes more to preheat  then   minutes more for second sandwich   this would great if you only want one sandwich  no problem with the unit      
87,1.0,                       don t buy this   bought one for myself and for my parents   both have had issues with the egg holder not closing all the way  therefore  egg does not stay in the appliance and gets everywhere   see the gap that won t close in attached photo   end result  no sandwich   you do get to have a ton of fun cleaning up a huge egg mess   was given as a gift for christmas to my husband  and now we are not able to return because of time period between purchase and using it   i am now stuck with a non working piece of c  p   waste of money      
88,5.0,                       this handy dandy maker is great  i use it everymornnig to make   sandwiches  i was using bagels but it is too small to fit  english muffins are the way to go for sure  i add turkey slices and cheese when cooking  i make a sausage patty on the stove and add that after it is cooked other wise it is too thick with the sausage layer and doesn t heat and cook as well  never had the yoke undercooked   just make sure the light is on before putting it all on  i cook for   mins    secs to be safe      
89,5.0,                       this little gadget is awesome   easy to use  fast cooking  easy cleaning  and make some delicious breakfast sandwiches      
90,1.0,                       i ve used it twice today  and frankly it s probably the worst thing i ve ever purchased   i wanted it to serve a specific purpose  and it failed miserably at that   it leaks everywhere  it does nothing that i couldn t accomplish simpler with a microwave  small skillet  and a toaster  and just trying to lift the lid after spinning the egg slider according to the directions    the accursed thing falls apart mid open and resulted in burning my thumb trying to catch it by reflex   don t waste the twenty plus dollars  just get a decent small skillet if you really want to make breakfast sandwiches      
91,1.0,                       this item it very difficult to use because the internal section falls out when it is opened  there is nothing between the egg and the top english muffin  i have tried different methods to make this work but the best i can do is use it to cook the egg and toast the muffin in the toaster  this item does not perform the way it is suppose to      
92,5.0,                       granted an egg muffin sandwich can be made using stove and toaster  but the convenience of this stand alone thing makes less clean up and time worth it  i never had an issue with egg seeping under top ring  just be sure it is in full closed position  the sandwich had two levels once   minutes is up slide the egg ring clockwise  presto sandwich is now together  open the device  easy to clean      
93,3.0,                       i use mine everyday  it works great however  the non stick surface is coming off after using it almost daily for   months  somewhere along the line  i ate a considerable amount of teflon since i don t have a proper kitchen  this saves me from buying chemically full store bought frozen sandwiches i m buying another one today  it lasted from jan to oct  i will have to more careful when cleaning and wiping it      
94,4.0,                       this father s day gift was right on target for my husband s father s day gift  it is used almost daily  trouble is  when i buy a gift like this  i want to be able to use it also  alas  we have tried everything to make breadless eggwiches  but it doesn t seem to work  maybe there is a secret trick  nevertheless  husband is happy  wife is bummed      
95,5.0,                       bought for my grandson colton who likes to make his own breakfast  he is    showed him how easy it is to use he loves it and my other grandson saw this and asked one for his next bday they love the egg mcmuffins and they taste better home made but one thing it is extremely hot and need to cool off some before eating     
96,5.0,                       this is a great product and really simple to use  it takes about     mins to make a great healthy sandwich and this includes the warm up time  one thing i was concerned is that the cleaning would be pain in the butt and would drive me to eventually stop using it not the case  all i do after my sandwich is ready is wipe it off once with paper towel and it s like new  nothing ever sticks to the burners that would require some extra cleaning  also  this thing is really tiny and it doesn t take up any space  my only regret is that i wish i ve bought the one with   sandwich makers      
97,5.0,                       i am very happy with this purchase  just got it today  made   sandwiches to get it out and they were both perfect  the only thing that would make this little guy the most perfect thing ever  is two sizes of rings and a timer  it fits english muffins perfectly but if it was a bit bigger  waffles and     calorie bagels would fit too  hubby plans to take this when he travels  easy easy tool to pack and use in a hotel if it has a fridge      
98,5.0,                       my    year old daughter had this on her birthday list  i was about to cross it off    just another gimmick to use a few times   when the novelty wears off  it goes into the cupboard or off to goodwill   well  we ve had this for   months   the only time we haven t used this several times per week is when we re on vacation   it is so easy to use   we all like trying new ingredients  we use it with many different types of bread   cheeses   meats  we add variety with fresh herbs  spinach   or tomatoes from the garden   other ingredients like artichokes  sun dried tomatoes  olives  etc  we ve never had a bad sammich from this amazing gift   it has saved so much time  i also love the fact that clean up is super easy      
99,4.0,                       the only gripe i have is always trying to find food that will fit inside it especially the bread  i m not much for the powdery english muffins so ive been finding other breads like beagles and hamburger bread is too big i am currently looking for a non english muffin that i don t need to trim to fit today i tried my fist omelet and it came out terrible  the bread was burnt while the egg was still runny i know its my fault  but at this time  i don t know why  it did taste great and encouraged me to try harder over all  got to say  this sure beats what i was doing for breakfast in the past and hope to be using this gadget for a long time      
100,5.0,                       i bought this as a christmas gift for a granddaughter who has two young boys she needs to get ready for school each morning and she said this is one of the handiest things she has in her house      
101,5.0,                       purchased this as a gift for my husband bc he has always wanted one and i even love cooking with it  so easy to use and not a lot of pots and pan mess  once you get used to using it and know what products you can make it is great  btw works great if u spray a little non stick spray just in case  would highly recommend  my husband says  do you want a delicious breakfast sandwich    i think he enjoys it       
102,5.0,                       i love this sandwich maker   you can use a variety of ingredients to make a healthy sandwich great for breakfast  lunch  or snacks   it cleans up easily   i use a quick squirt of olive oil spray  drop in an english muffin half  add meat of my choice or nothing  then cheese  drop the egg chamber  add the egg  break the yolk  dash of pepper and top with the other half of muffin   in   minutes your sandwich is done   my only caution is when you slide the egg separator out to drop the egg on the cheese  lift just enough to clear the sandwich and slide back to the cook position immediately before opening all the way   the top part comes off easily for cleaning and can tip off the appliance due to the egg plate being off to the side and thus unbalanced   the technique is easy to master  took me once or twice to figure it out  and no big deal      
103,3.0,                       when i made a bagel sandwich  the egg did not cook   it leaked out   i left it in but eventually stopped because the bagel was burning   i scraped the egg off   put bagel that still had uncooked egg in pan on the stove to finish it   the machine was a mess to clean up      
104,2.0,                       well  the product was received at my home without any damage  and in a very timely manner   however  even using the appliance several times  without fail  the raw egg would leak out of the upper container where the directions and video clearly illustrate it to be placed along with the muffin on top of it   before the egg could cook  it leak out from either one side  or both sides of its designated compartment   this in itself created a mess on the appliance and on my kitchen counter   additionally  it took more than four to five minutes to cook the egg  so by the time the egg was fully cooked  both the top and bottom pieces of the english muffin were cooked as hard as a rock and nearly uneatable   i could not recommend this product to anyone  and would never give it as a gift   if you have read this review  than remember that you have been warned      
105,2.0,                       i thought this was the cutest thing   and since i love egg  cheese  ham  english muffins i ordered this right away   followed the instructions exactly and found it to be totally messy and unwieldy   even with  a hot pad it is difficult to handle if you do not have any other way to cook something  i guess it is a good deal  but if you have a toaster oven and a skillet to cook the egg in  i d say don t buy this product  however  it does a good job of cooking the  sandwich      
106,4.0,                       i worked retail on the weekends and sold a ton of these  everyone i know loves it  moms love it for them  for the kids  and to make something for hubby on the run before work  men love them because they can quickly do it in the morning and take to work or eat on the run and it takes no time and all with basically little to no clean up i  however  returned mine  i tried all sorts of things to try and duplicate mdd s sausage mcmuffin with egg and it just never quite got there  i m somewhat of an all or nothing gal  and if i can t get it just the way i want it  then i m fine with nothing at all  so  it went back i am probably the exception because as i say  i sold a ton of these and hadn t seen any returns  people love it      
107,5.0,                       i love egg mcmuffins but cost and what s in them ew  this little machine is awesome  first go are egg was under cooked so there is a learning curve but i think this will be the most used appliances in our house  i m a remote worker and after a long shift some nights i just don t want to cook for myself      
108,4.0,                       i got this back in july       things were going really well  and i was loving my breakfast sandwiches  within the last     months though  i have been having trouble with my egg seeping through the edges of the cooking chambers  this has caused a lot of trouble with the egg not cooking properly  and then having to clean the entire unit because the egg ends up within all the little crevices  i will continue to use this product  but it is very irritating with this issue      
109,1.0,                       it is much easier to just make a sandwich in a skillet      
110,5.0,                       my husband loves this machine   it provides a healthy breakfast each morning  with little fuss      
111,4.0,                       i got it to replace the frozen sandwiches it works well for the morning rush and little time to prep breakfast  it does take a good  min to cook well and not the best for multiple sandwiches quickly but does the trick for us and my husband loves it  so helpful      
112,5.0,                       i ordered this little appliance for christmas gifts this year      of them    on the recommendation of my brother who loves his sandwich maker  the family recipients gave great feedback and i also ordered the sandwich maker cookbook as well as for two family members who got the little sandwich spatulas as well  those  accessories  were featured in the section  those who purchased this also bought these      or whatever that topic is at the bottom of the page  i liked the fast shipping  even though others had a problem with the delivery companies closer to christmas  and the size of the machine  it s a good appliance for those who  have everything  and didn t know they needed it   the one drawback on gifting one of these is they do not come in the manufacturer s packaging  which would have been nice for getting the upc code off the box and sending it in for the       rebate featured at the walk in stores  otherwise  it was convenient and probably worth the      for the   i ordered    of which were sent directly out of state  so i did not have to drive to the store fight the crowds  wrap and prepare the packages for shipping  and then get to the post office      
113,5.0,                       i thought this might be a great breakfast sandwich   i decided to order it   it arrived on the specified day and was everything i could have hoped for   it was exactly as described and worked great   i am so happy with this appliance   i use this several times a week      
114,5.0,                       my boyfriend and i are obessed  great sandwich maker  it tasted better than any fast food breakfast sandwich and is user friendly  the sandwich comes together in minutes and is the perfect size to start your day  we clean it with a damp paper towel  also we recommend adding some hot sauce on the egg when cooking   it makes a big difference     
115,1.0,                       i received this item today and was so excited to open the box  unfortunately it is very obvious that this item has been used  i ve included pictures showing obvious use  i ve never had something like this happen and it s so disappointing      
116,1.0,                       do not waste your money    it makes an absolute mess and takes forever to cook an egg  a frying pan would take less time and make a quarter of the mess  i had high hopes but am extremely disappointed    please head my warning     
117,5.0,                       i purchased this as an impulse buy after seeing amazon advertise it on facebook   initially  my boyfriend laughed at me but now he uses it every morning for breakfast   it worked exactly as it said it would  providing consistently delicious breakfast sandwiches in about        minutes   we typically stick with the english muffin  egg  provolone and canadian bacon combo but it also fits bagel thins when we feel like a change   the sandwiches look and taste just like an egg mcmuffin  maybe even better   i am a graduate student and i brought one of my sandwiches to class one morning and my cohort couldn t believe it was from a home sandwich maker   they requested that i bring it in one saturday morning so we can all enjoy a breakfast in class we only use pam spray once every four or five sandwiches as nothing every really seems to stick to the heating plates   the sandwich maker is also very easy to clean   i wipe it down with a wet paper towel while it is cooling off and all the egg cheese wipes right off      
118,5.0,                       i love the simplicity of this  makes getting ready in the morning a breeze  warm it up  put the ingredients in  set a timer and good to finish getting ready  it s a breeze to clean as well      
119,5.0,                       i just got this today and right away had to make a sandwich   i didn t have anything but regular sliced bread so i took the appropriate size biscuit cutter  got a great stainless steel set here on amazon    the biggest size biscuit cutter was perfect so i cut rounds out of my square sandwich bread   i followed the instructions wash the ring assembly and grilling rounds  dry them all and reassemble plug unit in and let it warm up i sprayed the cooking surfaces with butter flavored pam and smeared it around with a paper towel so it d be evenly distributed put bread  round  in bottom place a slice of american cheese on top of bread swing in  top of unit and crack an egg into it  i broke the yolk    pinch of salt      put other bread  round  on top of egg close the unit up and set timer for   minutes in   minutes i had a very nice toasted egg and cheese sammy let unit cool take out ring assembly and soak a bit in warm sudsy water clean unit with sponge and paper towel sponge off and rinse ring assembly and dry it re assemble unit for another sammy i m in love recommended   thank you      
120,5.0,                       i have to say that i am super impressed with this product   we have talked about getting this for a couple years since it first came out  but i m not much of a gadget person in the kitchen and i stick to the basics like my food processor  mixer  bread machine  etc   however  our   year old son is a big breakfast nut  and will often eat two hot breakfasts before he leaves for school   so i m usually making him one breakfast when he gets up at      or   and then he s hungry again by the time we leave for school at      so i m always rushing out the door and then stopping to grab him a slice of breakfast pizza or sandwich   ugh   a growing boy    well  my problem has been solved   we walked through making the first sandwich this morning after just getting it last night  and then he made breakfast sandwiches for all of us   i cannot tell you what a great sandwich it made   the english muffin was perfectly toasted and tender and egg was nicely cooked and cheese melted   the combinations are endless what you could do with this  thin bagels  waffles  pancakes  croissants   don t hesitate to get this if you have kids at home or in college   wish it had a timer  but it cooked in     minutes just like the booklet said   awesome product      
121,5.0,                       my son told me about this and when i found it here i didn t think i would get it   i can make the same thing on the stove top   however  i thought as a gift for my other kids to use in their dorm rooms it might work   so i bought one and put a question mark on the gift wrapped present and everybody wondered what it would be we love it   use as has been recommended here heat for   to   min   have your eng muffin or bagel ready  cut to size if necessary  esp the bagel  you may want to thin the bagel so it s a good fit    place a precooked sausage patty on top with a slice of cheese   lower the second ring and use a spritz of vegetable spray on the warming plate  making sure it is all swung all the way to the left   crack your egg or pre scramble it and place on warming plate   top off with precooked bacon or just the remaining top of your muffin or bagel and close the lid   i cook for      min  and it s done   swing open the warming plate and lift the lid and have spatula ready to remove the food from the maker   perfecto                           we love it   easy to use   easy to clean   any moron can do it        and that includes me   ironically  my    yr  old son who originally turned me on to it will get the use of it here  and the two college bound kids do not want one for their dorm rooms  not convenient enough  what with the need for eggs and cheese to be kept in a dorm room  highly recommend   we bought the red one at the lower price and are very happy      
122,5.0,                       i don t have time to make a hot meal on weekday mornings and my    year old son was begging for egg mcmuffins every day  now  he can cook his favorite breakfast all by himself  i only wish we had bought the unit that makes   sandwiches at once  it s fast  compact  super easy to clean  and very simple to use      
123,5.0,                       i bought this to make sandwiches for my son  but i found it so easy to use that i make more for myself than for him   this thing is super fast  incredibly easy to clean even without spraying  and only takes minutes from start to finish   this is one  gadgety  thing that s got staying power      
124,3.0,                       maybe it s because i added cheese to mine and it melted all over everything   the english muffins toast up nicely on one side and the egg comes out perfectly cooked   the cheese melted all over the unit and not on the muffin   that really caused a mess to clean up and the whole process took twice as long as cooking things normally and tossing the skillet in the dishwasher   it s headed to the thrift store      
125,5.0,                       this is easily the best thing i have bought in a while  so easy to use  makes sandwiches in half the time  super easy clean      
126,5.0,                       a friend recommended this and it really is the best kitchen gadget i think we own  the sandwiches come out perfectly every time    better than an egg mcmuffin  the bread toasts  we use english muffins  perfectly  my only challenge is using a regular bagel makes things a little tight and the more meat you add  canadian bacon   sausage   the more stuffed the machine get and makes it tougher to stay completely closed    it still makes a perfect egg sandwich  it just doesn t close tightly while it cooks  i use cooking spray on the egg plate and that makes it even easier for the egg to just slide right out and down onto the rest of the sandwich  the clean up takes less than a minute  my children use this almost every day  i have seen a newer version that comes with a timer  i may buy another one of these and i ll get the one with the timer since you do need to set either   or   minutes on a timer to get the perfectly cooked egg   it would be nice not to have to use my phone or the kitchen oven timer      
127,3.0,                       i have been using this for   months multiple times a week  throughout that period it served me well and i really liked its ease of use  however  yesterday while i was washing the removable part  a small portion around the hinge started to peel off  since that part touches the food while cooking  i stopped using this and started looking for a panini maker to avoid having this type of issue again      
128,4.0,                       i was tasked with putting together some prizes for an event we were holding   i cruised through the amazon website and picked out things i would not mind winning   i did not win but this looked  interesting  the winner said she liked it      
129,4.0,                       honestly this is incredible and i had heard great reviews from other people as well  it s just too darn bad you can t use bagels in it as well      
130,5.0,                       perfect works just as promised   no sticking   fast system makes breakfast sandwiches and lots more   english muffin pizzas   yup and many more like omlette on toast  etc   great item   should have had it years ago   oh    by the way  it works great with all sorts of plain bread  too   not just english muffins      
131,5.0,                       buy this   so easy to use  easy to clean  videos on it great  makes great breakfast sandwiches  will buy again bought a second one   been used every day for last two weeks      
132,5.0,                       my husband loves mcdonalds breakfast sandwiches   we decided to try this sandwich maker to see if it would measure up to his favorite   sure enough      it works just like advertised   the only problem is finding english muffins that exactly fit the sandwich maker   usually the cheaper ones are the ones that fit   canadian bacon is perfect for this   if you want sausage patty  you need to cook it first   bacon is best if you cook it first and chop it   the egg slides right off   just be sure that the plate it sits on is closed all the way before you pour it the egg  otherwise it will leak      
133,4.0,                       it takes about   minutes to heat up  about a minute to put all the fixings in and another     minutes to cook so it is a bit of a process for one sandwich   i make a lot of eggmcmuffin type breakfasts  english muffin  canadian bacon  american cheese and egg  and i can do it with a toaster and a stove in about     minutes tops   so from a time saving standpoint this sandwich maker fails for me with that said  the great thing about it is the final product   because of the way you assemble and cook the ingredients you are left with a great tasting and unique sandwich i have been unable to replicate on the stove   what is great for me is the way the egg and the top piece of bread cook together  i e  you can t separate them once cooked    the taste and texture of this is outstanding   so is the depth of the egg   on the stove unless you use some sort of mold the egg always gets a little flat   here it comes out melted to the bread with a nice depth despite the added time  the end product is well worth the cost of this sandwich maker      
134,4.0,                       works well  easy to clean  easy to store  but it s not perfect  the sandwich does not taste the same when the english muffin is toasted on the outside and has a  raw  middle  the sandwiches are still pretty good and this sandwich maker has paid for itself several times over already     for a fast food sandwich or about      to make it yourself  make your own coffee too and start planning a weekend getaway with the money you save every year      
135,1.0,                       i was so looking forward to using this breakfast sandwich maker  so i can make my own at home   but was very disappointed when it arrived defective  a screw was missing from one of the hinges  which i eventually found among the packaging material  no problem  i thought  but when i tried to put the screw back in  it wouldn t  tighten  it just kept going around and around  and the hinge remained very floppy  i opted to return the machine  rather than having it replaced because it seemed like just another flimsy  cheaply made import from china  i might try again with another brand  and will probably pick one up at a brick and mortar store  where i can hopefully open it there to make sure it s okay before taking it home  i ve used one of these machines before at my son s house  and it worked beautifully  and made a breakfast sandwich just like the ones at mcdonald s  there should be better quality control on all imports      
136,3.0,                       i was hoping i d save time making breakfast by having a breakfast sandwich maker  unfortunately  this appliance didn t cut down on my breakfast time  though i m able to make food that s more portable than my usual breakfast meals the most annoying thing about this appliance is that the egg spills out when you crack it on the hot plate  it helps to give it more time to heat up  so that the plate is hotter and the egg starts cooking once you crack it on      
137,3.0,                       the idea seems good but the actual product has problems  e g  the picture shows an egg on the upper level and half of the english muffin above it  if you actually cook like that  the top of the muffins gets over cooked and the eggs is under cooked and oozes out of the sandwich  i am going to try putting the muffin upside down under the egg so the egg soaks into the muffin and gets cooked by the element close above it  then i can turn i turn it upside down on the bottom half after cooking  or put the egg on the bottom muffin half and the ham bacon etc  on the top half  the basic idea of this product is good but the metal shelf between the two rings should fit tighter so raw eggs does not leek out before it gets cooked  it is a fun device to experiment cooking with      
138,5.0,                       this is my   teenage boys favorite kitchen gadget and we have tons of kitchen gadgets  they love using it because it s easy and makes a delicious breakfast sandwich  totally worth the money       
139,4.0,                       i ve used it for several months now  while the concept is good  the engineering misses the mark  my biggest two issues are the hinge mechanism allows the unit to come apart too easily  and the entire unit is extremely difficult to handle because it is far too hot removing the finished product is a challenge  due to the hot metal otherwise it works as described  i like the way it gets up to temperature quickly     
140,2.0,                       this product was insanely messy extremely hard to clean the hot please come up there not even attached so when you re trying to make your sandwich they just pop off without warning  whenever i was making my sandwich the bread would burn on the bottom because i didn t have enough time to get on the top otherwise the egg wouldn t cook and be absorbed by the bread would not recommend      
141,5.0,                       i use this daily to make my breakfast egg sandwich very convenient and easy to use  much less expensive per sandwich than using the jimmy dean frozen prepared breakfast sandwiches      
142,5.0,                       i love this device  before i had it  i was spending too much money on takeout breakfast sandwiches  now i can make a healthy and delicious breakfast sandwich at home  and i can add whatever ingredients i want  i typically use an english muffin  an egg  deli turkey  and a slice of tomato  which works great the device does get really hot  so you have to be careful when touching it while it s plugged in  but it s relatively easy to clean  you will probably need to use a sponge dish brush to remove the egg residue  but the cooking surfaces are nonstick a big hit in my house      
143,5.0,                       what a great contraption  i sent this to my son who likes to make quick breakfast sandwiches with muffins  he loves it  says it s easy to take apart and clean and works really well for him      
144,3.0,                       im the type of individual who likes their breakfast sandwich made a certain way   call me picky if you want  i simply know what i like  let me explain by component  first the bread  im cool with an english muffin  bagel or croissant but it must be toasted  secondly  the cheese i prefer is cheddar and i like it because it can become melty without becoming runny  thirdly  a ham steak cut to sandwich size browned nicely enchancing flavor all around  lastly a nice firm egg patty  i occasionally add precooked turkey bacon and   mmmmm   unfortunately  this sandwich maker by hamilton beach wont toast my bread  it also wont brown my ham  my egg doesn t come out firm instead the half of bread above it sucks it all up and becomes an awful crossbreed of unsweetened french toast and soggy gunk  the cheese stays for the most part  but that is mostly due to the type cause my first attempt with american was horrid  i ended up chasing american entrails with my napkin as it leaked over the rim  onto my counter and set off on adventure  so for me   it gets the job done the way a   star yelp rated restaurant gets the job done  its  food   if your rushing out the door and want something  homemade  to munch on  it may help  however  if you have tastebuds and care about what you put in your mouth then i suggest a just making it with a toaster and pan  the old fashioned  quality tasty way      
145,2.0,                       this is a christmas gift  i am sure it works but it did not come in original box  came in a cardboard box which makes me believe its either used or not original   kinda embarrassing for the person who will be opening this for christmas  i have to spoil the surprise and let the person know what it is  just for this  i give it   stars      
146,5.0,                       my significant other spends so much time in the morning making breakfast before work  we have been working on time management lately and so this was a little gift for him on how far he s come  he used to be late to work everyday  usually making breakfast and taking too long  now  a normal person could just wake up a little earlier  but this guy doesn t know what earlier is  it takes four minutes to make a sandwich in this thing  so it takes no longer than ten minutes now to make breakfast  and the cleanup is amazing      everything just wiped right off      
147,5.0,                       i usually don t like gadgets that only do one thing but this is fun  you can pretend you have  your own fast food kitchen      
148,3.0,                       it s not really all that convenient   it s still a lot of work to make a breakfast sandwich  with or without this gadget   you still have to clean all the pieces  just as easy to use a toaster and a frying pan   bought it as a christmas gift for my husband who loves to make breakfast sandwiches on the weekends   he used it once and now it s just taking up shelf space in the pantry      
149,3.0,                       the product does what it is designed to do   and well  sandwiches come out looking and tasting excellent  i was a little leery of placing the top piece of bread on the raw egg  as instructed  but this thing makes a mean sandwich  operation is a cinch   cleanup is easy however   i am only giving three stars as it is missing some basic kitchen appliance features   such as a power switch and a timer  to use the device you have to plug it in  and when your done  unplug it  this to me is rather crude and old fashioned   why does it have a power switch like every other device in my kitchen  never mind the fact my plugs are way back and hard to get to  this leads to the other item   lack of a timer   you have to manually time   minutes and unplug the device when you think the sandwich is cooked  while i get that different sandwiches could take different times depending on ingredients  several times i have wandered off during the cook time and my sandwich has been very over cooked  why not a basic  lite medium heavy  switch like   you know  the toaster      
150,2.0,                       i kind of regret buying this because it is easier for me to make a breakfast sandwich in pieces than it is with this thing  it burnt my bagel which barely fit in it  if you use a bagel cut it to size  and the egg took so long to cook that the bagel ended up burning on the bottom because it was on there so long  i m very sad mine doesn t work like everyone else s or maybe i m just bad at using it because i did get egg everywhere  i also burnt my fingers a few times because the top gets really hot  i would rather just put my own breakfast sandwich together but i do like the concept of this      
151,1.0,                       i was super excited about buying this sandwich maker due to all of the glowing reviews  i even bought an    pack of eggs the day before it was scheduled to arrive  sadly  it looks like the machine i received is defective  there is a huge gap in the back between the plate and the top ring  see photos   where the egg goes  despite my turning the plate as far in as it would go what does that mean  it means that instead of enjoying a breakfast sandwich to start my morning yesterday  i spent ten minutes cleaning the raw egg off my counter that spilled out through the huge gap  which i hadn t noticed until it was too late amazon refunded my money and i decided to give it another shot and ordered a replacement  we ll see if this was a one off defective machine or if their quality control has just gone downhill recently      
152,5.0,                       my favorite breakfast for the weekends  easy to use  this machine has ruined fast food breakfast sandwiches for me but that s a good thing  everyone should have one of these      
153,1.0,                       this thing is a mess waiting to happen  everything sounds great until you try it  then it s downhill fast  pour eggs in it   it spills all over the counter  heat sausage patties   still cold in middle  just do it the old fashioned way and save your money      
154,5.0,                       as someone who s generally had apartments with small kitchens and thus a small amount of counter space  i m not fond of single use appliances  i remember my brother getting a breakfast sandwich maker a few years ago and wondered why someone would give so much precious counter space to a glorified toaster  i got a quesadilla maker for christmas a few years ago which gave me another reason to avoid this   the quesadilla maker is so hard to clean my recent apartment has more space  so i bought this because of the amount of high reviews and my love of breakfast sandwiches  i should have bought it as soon as it came out   it s so much more compact than the toaster kind of sandwich makers and does it s job extremely well  preheating takes a few minutes  cooking takes   minutes and the whole center part is removable for cleaning the center part stays put normally  you have to lift it up and out of the main part of it so there s little risk of burning yourself by something shifting unexpectedly  the main part of it is just two flat surfaces with only a couple small corners to have to wash stuff out of  which was my main complaint with the quesadilla maker anyway  this thing is amazing and totally worth the counter space it uses      
155,4.0,                       just received this sandwich maker a couple of days ago and used it for the first time this morning   it does what it s advertised to do   the first sandwich  i put the bottom of the english muffin in first with cheese which i tore up to fit exactly on top of the muffin  and then the bacon  second compartment i put   jumbo egg and broke the yoke with a fork and placed the english muffin top right on top of that and closed the lid making sure not to push it down  waited five to six minutes and and it was done   the second sandwich  i switched it up  and scrambled the egg with a small amount of milk and threw in the bacon chopped up in with the egg  same results  a nice hot bacon  egg and cheese sandwich  be advised  the egg puffs up quite a bit so i can t imagine having to use more than one jumbo egg  furthermore  i would like to add that i had no problem with the egg leaking out the sides of the ring as others have stated in their reviews  you must make sure the handle to the disc the egg is cooking on is all the way over to the right and you do not push down on the top cover after all your ingredients are in and ready to cook  there is one issue i did have  the cooking discs rings come out so you can wash them  be careful lifting the bottom ring to remove your sandwich because the whole thing came off too easily for my liking and landed on the counter next to the unit  luckily i had pot holders near by to grab it  all in all  i am pleased with the results and i can see this little contraption being used quite often      
156,2.0,                       i expected a better product from hamilton beach and in consideration of all the high rated reviews   i like to have options and this product is limited pros it does what it says and it is sturdystacked cooking is a great ideashort time to heat up and cookcons don t like the top bread soaking into or cooking in the raw eggbread presses down on the egg forcing it to spread out in the cooking tray and the egg ends up bigger around than the breadtop bread needs it s own space to toast and not soak into the eggno timer to know when it is cooked except an assumed light off  which is actually the device reaching it s heat temperatureno option to time or control how much the egg is cooked  i like my egg cooked a little softer on the yoke i was going to return it but the return shipping cost half as much as the cookerthis product has a lot of good potential but needs some options for egg cooking and timer   i also would think it would be improved if the top bread could be in it s own compartment for toasting and not soaking in the egg i had previously bought the westbend toaster egg cooker and loved it but the egg poaching cup started to peel   i am mentioning westbend because it was a better design but not better quality   the westbend comes with a water cup to determine the degree of softness   hardness to cook the egg  the water cup also has a piercing device at the bottom to pierce the yoke   hamilton beach used to make a similar product but i am no longer able to find it      
157,5.0,                       oh can t say i use this every morning  but i use it most mornings  makes easy  nutritious  to go breakfasts  the egg slider works great but a single shot of cooking spray makes it work flawlessly  finally clean up is a breeze in the dishwasher and the base cleans up with just just a wipe  perfect for busy mornings      
158,3.0,                       my husband loves breakfast sandwiches  so i thought this would be a swell gift  it worked great  but has so many moving parts to slide in and out and clean that it wasn t worth the effort  after a couple of uses it went in the cupboard and hasn t been seen since      
159,4.0,                       it s easy to make breakfast sandwiches using a toaster and microwave  a scrambled egg in a small dish or saucer comes out perfect for a sandwich after one minute in the microwave   but i thought this would be an alternative where i could combine all the individual steps into one simple one   i m satisfied with the result   my only minor complaint is that the unit will come apart if you aren t careful when lifting the various pieces to assemble or remove your sandwich   but if you are careful it won t happen   one complaint people have is that you can only make one at a time   but it really makes the sandwich too hot to eat right away anyway  so i think you could make a  nd one and two people could still have a quick breakfast in    minutes   the non stick surface is very good  i don t even have to spray cooking oil on it   for me  it s a keeper      
160,5.0,                       honestly  this product is in competition  with my coffee maker   i am retired and getting spoiled with my new life  i love love breakfast anytime  of the  day   the sandwich maker that  hamilton beach has made so many various  types of sandwiches  that i don the know my favorite but soon when spring arrives our garden will begin and i  and hubby   will be mincing  up fresh bits of goodness and new recipes will emerge   love my sandwich  machine    thanks hamilton  beach   for spoiling us       
161,5.0,                       i don t know how i lived without this    when i was pregnant recently  i craved breakfast sandwiches and this saved a pregnant lady from having a breakdown because she couldn t eat what she craved   i know you know what i m talking about   even though i haven t used it much since giving birth  it is still a wonderful thing to have   going to get more as christmas gifts   everyone loves a breakfast sandwich       
162,5.0,                       i love this little sandwich maker  i ve just made the basic breakfast sandwich so far  but it is truly awesome  i love to have breakfast sandwiches in the morning  but the frozen ones get so boring and never turn out right  you either don t heat them up long enough and they are cold in the middle  or you heat them up too long and the bread is as hard as a rock  this little machine makes perfect sandwiches  the bread gets toasted just right  the meat is nice and warm  and the egg is cooked to perfection  it s easy to clean up and it only takes up a small amount of space on the counter  i only wish that it had a timer on the machine  then it would be perfect  i can t wait to try out different recipes  it s a hit in my house  especially with my picky eaters      
163,3.0,                       this technically works and i wonder if i m doing something wrong since other reviewers love it   it cooks the egg really well but the bread  english muffin  does not toast well and the top piece became like a soggy part of the egg  my friend has one and only cooks the egg in this and separately toasts the bread   huh  needs some design improvements if you want it to taste good that said  it does warm and cook like it says just doesn t taste good to me      
164,3.0,                       need gadget    but it s a bit difficult to use   i m super nervous about burning myself so i m overly cautious when opening it and removing the sandwich   for some reason the hinge part easily comes off and i ve had that fall off twice when i am lifting it up   it falls onto my counter but again  nervous it will fall on the floor or myself and burn something   it cooks the eggs perfect but i do struggle with the sausage   it s hard to find sausage that fits correctly in here   either they are too big or too small      
165,1.0,                       i saw this product and i thought it is a good idea for a quick egg breakfast sandwich  the idea is very good but the implementation is very bad  the egg yolk leaks everywhere on the side and it is a mess to clean  it s true that the product is easy to clean but the leak reaches the counter top and it is not very pleasant to clean overall not a good product  i have returned it for a refund  back to the traditional pan and toaster      
166,5.0,                       i debated buying this for my husband as a gift   i wondered if this sandwich maker would wind up sitting in a cupboard  unused   not so   my husband loves this sandwich maker   he uses it   or   times a week to make a breakfast meal using english muffins  sausage  cheese  and an egg   he pronounced the finished sandwich delicious   the sandwich cooks up nice and hot   it s easy to wipe clean   the only comment i would make is that if using a bagel  they are thicker than an english muffin and may need to be trimmed a bit before putting in the sandwich maker   i would recommend this product   ps   i noticed my husband stored the sandwich maker on my roundabout kitchen shelf  because he wants it handy to use      
167,2.0,                       the concept of this machine sounded so appealing to me   but  i find that just a plain english muffin  egg  cheese and canadian bacon has absolutely no flavor   however  the machine did cook the sandwich  so there s nothing wrong there   i did find clean up a little cumbersome dealing with the ring assembly and the top bottom cooking plates   overall  i wish i hadn t purchased   i ll stick to skillets and toasters      
168,3.0,                       this is more work than is implied when using it and is also rather a pain to take apart and clean  i have since found another device that is easier to use and wash      
169,4.0,                       so  i have been looking at this for like a year  my boyfriend thought i was nuts for wanting one but i finally bit the bullet and bought it  omg best quarantine purchase so far  in your face boyfriend  it s flimsy inside and a little wonky  but i watched other user videos and just followed them to quick breakfast  i have to be to work by   am and this is so easy  i get everything in and finish getting ready then head out the door with hot breakfast  but  do not put your cheese in with the sandwich  put it on after  otherwise you get lava cheese  i don t know how it will hold up  please don t die on me miracle sandwich maker      
170,5.0,                       i have had this for many many months now and can t say enough about it  i use it almost everyday  and it does the job every time  just a little prep work as spraying it with non stick coating  getting your sandwich stuff together  when the green light comes add  put your stuff in  set the time for   minutes and walk away  everything is cooked to perfection  easiest breakfast ever      
171,4.0,                       this little breakfast sandwich maker is my new favorite kitchen gadget       is really the best time to use  as the person with the demonstration video mentioned  the egg will leak if it s not oiled enough on the slot or if the oil is not hot enough  that s probably the one downside  another thing  slowly crack the egg like let the egg white slowly drip out of the shell a little bit  which sounds tedious  but not really a dealbreaker to me because the sandwich maker is pretty fun to use      
172,5.0,                       i ve been using it for over a year and it has been working great      
173,5.0,                       i hope whoever came up with this idea got a big fat raise  what a novel concept  just drop in an english muffin  the meat  a slice of cheese  crack an egg and five minutes later  voila  works best with precooked bacon or sausage  or higher quality ham    i ve found that standard  hot dog section  sliced ham is a too wet and runny  and can leave a weird taste  of course no meat works great  too skip the fast food line and save some cash calories with this little thing      
174,4.0,                       bought on a whim  glad i did  makes a superb egg  ham  cheese  and english muffin sandwich   all the parts fit together and accommodate the ingredients as you build the sandwich   it needs to be pre warmed so the egg doesn t drip but that s simply a matter of plugging in and waiting for a light to come on telling you  okay    the top comes down and cooks a marvelous sandwich in about     minutes   clean up is a breeze   says to hand wash but cooking element is easily accommodated in the dishwasher   i ve enjoyed this dude      
175,5.0,                       this is the perfect  no fuss  no muss    minute breakfast maker   we plugged it in  waited for the  ready  light to come on      minutes   popped in our ingredients and in minutes had the perfect breakfast sandwich   i used orowheat english muffins  a vegetarian sausage patty  shredded cheese and an egg   didn t experience one issue that others have had   we looked at the pictures on how to place the items  popped them in and voila   yummy hot breakfast   btw  i ve forgotten to  pop the yolk  twice now and it still cooked through and no mess      it s important to look at the pics because if you add cheese but nothing on top of it  like my veg sausage patty   the cheese may stick to the plate above it   if you don t want to use a  meat   then i would recommend putting the cheese on top of the egg and the top muffin over it i noticed in the  how to  photo that they used shredded cheese and not sliced which is why i used that type   i pre cooked my patty since it came from the freezer  isn t that just common sense      remember to use a non stick spray for ez clean up   after your done  just pop out the plates  wash   pop them back in   easy peasy   this little baby should have   stars across the board   this was a christmas gift for my mom who gets up early and enjoys a quick hot breakfast   she loves this little thing   no more frozen breakfast sandwiches hogging space in the freezer kids could easily use this  what age is at the parents discretion    it would be a great gift for the grandparents too   it s so easy to use  just be sure to tell them to only touch the handles  the plates get hot   hot   hot   and use a spatula to remove the sandwich from the hot plate   this goes for everyone  and  very important   be sure to unplug it after use  there is no  on   off  button       the second best thing about this machine  it s small   so if you don t like cluttered countertops it nicely tucks away in a cabinet pantry paid around     for it   don t pay more than     with free shipping   if prices jump again  which they did after i bought it   go to your local wally world     ps   mine came in ez packaging   if you google hamilton beach breakfast sandwich maker you ll find the manufacturer s photos on how to layer your items  click on images at top of screen   in the event you don t want to do that   plug in and wait for the ready light  green    when it s ready  open it up  spray with non stick cooking spray  they don t show that   and with the bottom ring down  put your bottom muffin in  add shredded cheese   veg  meat   lower the next plate and place your egg and top with the other muffin slice  close the top and let it work it s magic   when the green light goes off   it s ready   lift up from the bottom handle to expose the entire sandwich   remember  it s going to be screaming hot when you add your goodies to it so be careful   be sure to use a spatula to remove it        
176,5.0,                       if you are looking for an easy way to make a healthy breakfast sandwich  look no further  i wish i knew this product existed years ago  the bread comes out toasted  the meat was warm  the egg was cooked perfectly and the unit was super easy to clean  i couldn t  be happier with how well this badboy performed from start to finish  all i used was butter to prep the hot surfaces  after  i used a wet paper towel on the nonstick surfaces and viola  a clean unit ready for another run  i love this sandwich maker        
177,5.0,                    me encant  este producto para preparar deliciosos sandwich  al usarlo por primera vez se me quemaba el pan  luego descubr  una forma f cil de hacerlo y ahora me quedan perfectos  en alg n momento har  un video para ense ar mi m todo         
178,5.0,                       mostly easy to use and clean   tried to make a double egg and it ran over but cleaned up   tried to make a single scrambled egg with spinach scrambled into it and it ran over   otherwise we like it   muffins fit better than bagel thins   we haven t tried full size bagels      
179,5.0,                       i have found this breakfast sandwich maker to be a great tool in my kitchen  the negative reviews made me a little leary  but once i got it  i had no troubles  make sure you follow the direction and it works wonderfully  i got this for my husband who always wants sausage  egg and cheese muffins for breakfast  this makes his perfectly and he can wrap it and take it to work with him for his breakfast and it is much cheaper than going through mcdonald drive thru  i even make what i call a breakfast tortilla boat with it for myself  just make sure to follow the directions and also follow some of the helpful tips from other reviews     
180,5.0,                       best thing i bought my dad  he absolutely loves it  i want to get one for myself  prevents waste  my dad cooks only what he s going to eat that meal  cook time crazy fast and meat super tender  great gift to give  very happy      
181,5.0,                       i wouldn t have bought this if my husband didn t absolutely adore sausage mack muffins  let s not violate a tm here  people    but he can t have any  because commercial ones give him migraine headaches   so i occasionally make them at home  with middling success   till now amazon tempted me with this product    i bit after reading the reviews    i m glad i did believe it or not  this makes terrific breakfast sandwiches  moist and well cooked  and they are easy breezy to make when i first opened the package  i thought this thing looked like something out of a steven spielberg movie  think the mothership in close encounters of the third kind    i bought the red one  just because i like the color   i m glad i did   i store it on my microwave cart  out in the open    it looks really sci fi  two people have already asked me  what the heck is that thing    but beyond being a conversation piece  it s  a really functional little appliance   you can learn how to use it best by reading the most popular review  it s very well spelled out the only trick i ve added   very lightly butter the outside of your muffins and use about     teaspoon of butter in the egg cup before adding your egg and breaking the yolk  then salt and pepper the egg  close the top    cook one minute before putting the top muffin on   then i open the lid  add the muffin top    cook the sandwich for precisely   more minutes   voila  a perfect sausage   egg  sammich  emerges  with a crispy moist muffin  well cooked egg  and delightfully melty cheese   yum   i usually don t eat these myself  but i ve had two in the last two days  more time on the treadmill  as well    highly recommended  this was a surprisingly good and useful purchase        
182,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is the best gift i ve ever received  i am obsessed with it  my roommates and i all use it  it s really easy to clean  super easy to use  not only can you make awesome breakfast sandwiches but you can also make lunch and dinner items  we ve been making ham and cheese sandwiches  similar to arby s ham and cheese sandwiches  it only take about five minutes to make any sandwich  it s my favorite item in the kitchen to use   roof     
183,5.0,                       i love this breakfast sandwich maker  i use it every morning  it s easy to use and clean  i m eating much healthier breakfasts now that i have this  before i would eat cereal with very little nutritional value  now i m eating breakfasts packed with protein  i love this because i can heat it up and add in all my ingredients then leave the kitchen and finish getting ready while it cooks      
184,5.0,                       i was quite skeptical of this little item   i received it as a gift and i absolutely love this little gem   as a matter of fact  i m going to order a second one because we are a family of seven and it takes too long to wait for all of us to have our sandwiches   the clean up of this machine is a breeze   it comes apart and you can wash the middle sections   i have made breakfast sandwiches and frozen them   i have made english muffin sandwiches  pancake sandwiches  using pancake batter   sandwiches with hashbrowns   the only challenge is finding the right size bagel to fit in the machine  lenders bagels work well for that   i would highly recommend this little gadget   saved us lots of money and is much healthier than buying breakfast sandwiches   i usually make them once a month to freeze for the kids to grab when they want them      
185,5.0,                       i want to give one to all my friends because i want them to have as much enjoyment as we are of home made egg sandwiches  we use regular whole wheat bread  we cut them in circles   croissants   tailored as well  and even almond bread made as a round sliced  these sandwiches are now a breakfast alternative at home  an interesting and happy one      
186,4.0,                       seriously make sure you have a can of pam in your cabinets or some type of cooking spray because if you cook on it without that spray  dear lord the mess and crust you will have to get off the device from the egg residue  when you plug it in  wait for the preheat light to come on once then shut off  then put your ingredients in and wait about     minutes before removing that egg slider other you re in for a world of mess lol  but overall does the job  dont expect it to be pretty like in the pictures  you gotta improvise      
187,5.0,                       wow      easy to use you can substitute items and make it more wholesome than the mcdonald s type  gluten free muffins  organic cheese and eggs  etc easy to clean they also sell a double maker   nice if you have a large family      
188,3.0,                       the egg leaks every time      i wait till green light comes on  but cleaning it every time is becoming extra chores i didn t know i had to do  also the oil runs down on the sides of the appliance when it heats up and when it s raised up  it s a bummer  i really wanted to like it          
189,5.0,                       we always used to buy breakfast sandwiches from the grocery store and costco b c my fiance is obsessed with having them in the morning   but they never taste as good as a fresh one   i saw a commercial for this in december and decided it would be a perfect christmas gift for him   he uses it almost every morning   it take a couple tries to get it just right  but he found you have to let it heat up all the way and spray it with a light dusting of cooking spray before adding everything for it to come out perfect   he uses sandwich thins  deli ham or turkey  any type of cheese  egg  and sometimes vegetables or mushrooms   and cleaning it is really easy   just a quick wipe down with a damp cloth   we will never buy frozen breakfast sandwiches again      
190,5.0,                       if you re a fan of mcdonald s mcmuffins but  hate driving to the store  this is for you  it works as advertised   i love the fact that i can now have two slices of canadian bacon instead of just one   but beware  there is no on or off button  you plug it in and wait for the green light which tells you the gadget is hot enough  you place a muffin on the bottom  place the canadian bacon and cheese  then you flip the first lid on top of it   you  place a egg and another muffin on top and close it  then you have to set your timer for   minutes  it s not automatic  you can t put the entire gadget in the dishwasher  but you can take the two inner plates out and put them in the dishwasher  i have not had to use any spray on coating or grease   so  great for making your own egg mcmuffin but it is not automatic and you have to be careful around kids  because it does get hot and it will burn if you touch it while in use      
191,5.0,                       i ve been using this for about two months now and it has paid for itself many times over  i use it the most for muffin breakfast sandwiches but also use it to make crispy garlic bread  it s super easy to use and clean  once you get a hang of the removable piece and how to use it  it s so quick to remove  wash  and return  love  love  love      
192,5.0,                       this was a gift for a friend  they said it s awesome and love it  they convinced me to buy the bigger double version  it makes breakfast  sandwiches  super easy and delicious  this is a must have gadget for any kitchen       
193,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband almost as a joke because really  how hard is it to make an egg sandwich  right   but seriously  this thing is great   a few things to note   english muffins work perfectly   machine recommends you use large eggs   surface is non stick  but we add a tiny bit of olive oil to the egg section before using and it makes cleanup a breeze   the insides are dishwasher safe   american cheese tends to run a bit but other cheeses seem to do a bit better seriously recommend this product     would be great for an office as well      
194,5.0,                       watched the shout video  pulled it out of the box and enjoyed a hot  fresh breakfast sandwich  couldn t be easier  and a whole lot cheaper than fast food or frozen      
195,5.0,                       i m not really a kitchen gadget person or an impulse buyer  but here we are  we eat eggs every day  because  chickens  we also all eat at different times every day  so  we ve used this daily  sometimes several times  since it arrived  it takes about       minutes for a medium egg and   minutes for     grams of egg whites pros    i don t need to clean it  yeah  the rings go in the dishwasher  but i haven t needed to do it since the first wash out of the package  even cheese wipes off with a microfiber rag and it gets hot enough to kill anything else    you can use it just to cook eggs  you don t have to out anything in the bottom or on the top    so far it works with english muffins  small prefab frozen pancakes  and ezekiel bread cut with a biscuit cutter cons    it s a bit awkward to maneuver the rings at first without accidentally wiggling them out or bumping the slider that keeps your eggs in place  so you can expect to experiment the first few times    the top is much hotter than the bottom so wait until the last    seconds to put in whatever the top bread is going to be if you don t want it blackened    not  a con for us  but if you have several people eating at once  you might want to consider the double version  it s going to take at least   minutes per sandwich      
196,5.0,                       these sandwiches are awesome and i have yet to have a problem for those with runny eggs  you have to let it heat up fully before you crack the egg steps close everything up and close the sliderheat up till green lightopen it upmove sliderload the bottomclose the sliderclose the topgive it    secondsre open the topcrack eggload toppingsclose it all  do not force the top down  if its too big let it sit on top of the bun i have yet to have any of it leak anywhere when i didn t squish it  this is great for the mornings      
197,5.0,                       works great   with some learning curve   let the unit heat up     put     of the muffin in the bottom level with some butter on it  put your favorite meat slices on it   break your egg onto the second level and break the yoke  do not mix up your egg prior or it tends to run over   put your favorite cheese on top   place the top half of the muffin on the top rack  and close it up   let it cook for around   minutes   you won t be disappointed      
198,5.0,                       best product  my son loves egg mcmuffins but going to mcdonald s everyday is not going to happen  this is the best product for that  it s sooooo simple bottom put bottom muffin then ham and cheese then close it to put the cracked egg and add top muffin and then it completely  i leave for   minutes then you take the knob and slide the middle piece out to make the sandwich whole  boom  egg mcmuffin at home  healthier too  easy to use   easy to clean and you can create different sandwiches too  recommend completly        
199,4.0,                       love this  we use it all the time and it makes perfect sandwiches  the only issue is that the middle removable part falls off really easily  it s come off several times when opened to take the sandwich out which isn t great since it s hot and fell on the counter  we ve learned to put something under it  but it would be nice if it was more secure      
200,2.0,                       i thought this would be an easy  no hassle way for my husband to make breakfast sandwiches  but upon opening the box and seeing the little piece of paper that comes with it  we both feel like it was a bait and switch  although the product listing says the removable parts are dishwasher safe  the paper said that for best results  they should be hand washed  strike one  also  it says that to avoid a mess  you should only use whole eggs or egg whites  not store bought egg whites  no egg beaters   strike two  if you can t just pour the egg whites from the carton and put the parts in the dishwasher when you re done  the convenience factor is lost  we re sending it back unused      
201,5.0,                       i got this sandwich maker as a father s day gift from my son   he sees me in the kitchen in the morning eating various things and clearly saw room for improvement in my process   when i opened the gift  to be honest   my first thought was that this was another one of those gifts that was quickly headed for a permanent home on a shelf somewhere   well  i was wrong  this is a great gift   i ve now used it several times and it really works well   it is simple and fast to make a great breakfast sandwich   plus  and this is huge  it is very easy to clean   i would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good breakfast sandwich or wants to give an appreciated gift to someone who does      
202,5.0,                       love this sandwich maker   super easy to use  my   year old uses it like a pro super easy to clean makes breakfast  lunch  or dinner super easy i kind of wish i had bought the double  because when i make myself one  everyone else comes running   we use english muffins  however we have also used pancakes and regular bread  just cut it to fit  love this product      
203,4.0,                       does what it says it will do  just be very careful when removing the hot sandwich from the device  also  it would be great if it had an auto off function to avoid overcooking      
204,5.0,                       helps make a good breakfast sandwich just like any kitchen gadget you cant just throw them in the dishwasher but who cares when you get a good sandwich out of it i will say this doesnt have a built in timer on it so that takes time to get use to      
205,5.0,                       got this for my husband but we now all use it  it takes less than   minutes to have a  homemade  breakfast sandwich instead of spending time in a long line for fast food  kids love using it and can do it themselves  my    year old    we use it almost every morning      
206,5.0,                       i bought this for my daughter to have while she lives away and may not eat a healthy breakfast   she often will not take the time to eat well but with this she can make a bacon egg and cheese sandwich in about   minutes of time and leave it cook while she finishes getting ready for work   then i bought one for our home and i bought one for my sister   we are experimenting making other types of sandwiches since the canadian bacon  egg  and cheese worked out so well   you won t be disappointed with this appliance      
207,5.0,                       the best small appliance i have ever bought   my husband buys the microwaveable egg sandwiches that are frozen and they are pretty expensive  especially when you buy enough for the month   he just grabs one and goes to work   so not only did this little gadget work as well as it said  it will save us money in the long run   the food is better since it s fresher and i just couldn t believe it took   minutes and the sandwich was done and without all that messy frying and smelling up the house   now  this is so easy  even my husband can do it without me if he had to   i want to buy one for my kids  the one at college and the newly wed   also  the one here on amazon was cheaper than the one i saw at the store and i had it in two days      
208,5.0,                       this has become a staple in our household  what did we do before we got this  restaurant style sandwiches in minutes  plus there are so many recipes out there that go beyond breakfast options      
209,5.0,                       i bought this for my boyfriend as a christmas gift and he uses it every single day  before that  he was pretty inconsistent about eating in the morning and this sandwich maker saves him from planning out breakfast  it enables him to make a quick and healthy meal everyday and the clean up is just as fast and easy  we get our eggs and english muffins in bulk and the rest he gets pretty creative with  sometimes i make my healthy pancakes    eggs  a banana  some cinnamon    so good  please try   in advance and use these instead of bread  a quick and wholesome mcgriddle  there are really endless combinations as to what you can get into this little device  at first i thought we may get sick of the same ol  same ol  but you can really make some good combos  if interested  i saw a book for sale about different combinations sold on amazon as well  it gets very  very hot and really cooks the egg thoroughly each time  i made the mistake of pressing it down when i got a little wild with the amount of veggies i crammed in there and this caused it to cook incorrectly  even if it is a little bit tilted due to over packing just let it be   the egg will cook  i debated on getting the dual sandwhich maker but the dual shipping cost turned me away   i am so glad i chose this model   even if we want to eat together  cool down time allows that  fantastic product      
210,5.0,                       if you ever thought you had a breadfast sandwich size hole in your life  here s the solution   my family uses this gadget multiple times a week  sausage patties at costco are like    for    or something and it is really easy to start a sandwich in the morning while getting ready  you come back in five minutes and there s a complete egg mcmuffin replica   note  if you use american cheese  it s better to add it after the sandwich is prepared  open the sandwich to let it cool a little first to avoid lava cheese      
211,5.0,                       it s still not fast enough for a workday breakfast but it is totally ok  the only thing i do is pre toast the english muffin  i like mine really crispy  i also used regular precooked bacon instead of canadian and have used the mini waffles  fit perfectly  instead of english muffins pretty cool kitchen toy       
212,2.0,                       i bought this product hoping for a simpler way to make the breakfast sandwiches my son enjoys but the end result was lacking  first  no matter what i do the egg leaks all over so you re only left with less than half a cooked egg  the bottom english muffin turns hard as a rock if you actually want your eggs to be cooked  another thing we didn t like was how the egg cooked into the top muffin  hoping to return it soon      
213,1.0,                       other leaving a metallic taste to the sandwich this cooker is great   had this about a month and works great and cleanup is easy   unfortunately the taste of the sandwich is not edible   i need to return for refund      
214,5.0,                       love this breakfast sandwich maker  my only disappointment is  and it has nothing to do with the product   is in my area you cannot get sausage patties that are the size of the muffins   only have those tiny ones but bacon works just as well   it is quick to use and clean up a breeze      
215,5.0,                       such a staple add to the kitchen  easy to use and clean and makes a perfect breakfast sandwich in   mins      
216,5.0,                       seriously  this is one of the best purchases that i ve ever gotten on amazon before mcdonald s started serving their sausage mcmuffin s all day  i would constantly miss the time to get one  but i always craved those sausage mcmuffin breakfast sandwiches  so i was watching tv one day and saw that they had a mcmuffin maker  i instantly hopped on amazon and ordered one definitely easy to use  theirs a tray that you can place your egg in  and once its done you just slide the tray out and the egg will fall into a bottom layer where a muffin is at  in about      minutes you ll have a fresh egg sausage mcmuffin ready to grub on easy to take apart  easy to clean  i usually just use a wet paper towel to clean it  people always ask me if i would recommend it and i always give them a stone cold  hell yeah  so if you want some sausage egg mcmuffin quality breakfast sandwiches but homemade  i would recommend this device to you as well      
217,5.0,                       i love the easy of making an english muffin with egg and sausage ham   perfect every time     
218,5.0,                       i had no desire to buy this product whatsoever  i thought it looked really silly and gimicky  i just make breakfast sandwiches in a pan  why would i need this  right  wellll my husband specifically asked for one of these for christmas  whatever  it s small  ok  he uses it all the time   annnnnd he makes me breakfast  ladies  he cannot cook  but he can use this  i love that he makes me breakfast now  totally worth it      
219,1.0,                       what i like  cooks the egg in a round shape  egg doesn t leak out of the ring what i dislike  everything elseyou can mix and match ingredients as you please  i attempted to recreate an egg mcmuffin how it works  you put the bottom half of bread in the bottom ring  you put whatever toppings you want  meat  cheese  etc  directly on top of the bread  the problem with this is as the food cooks  the juices are absorbed by the bun which makes the bread soggy in the top ring you crack an egg and lay the top half of bread directly on top of the raw egg  the bread sinks down into the egg and you re left with hardly any bread sticking out on top i don t care for the texture of the bread either after cooking  the outside that s pressed against the heating element almost gets too well done in the time it takes to ensure the egg is fully cooked  i hate runny egg  my egg has to be fully cooked  if you like your eggs over easy or medium this will be less of an issue for you i really wish the bread chambers were kept separate from the moist ingredients  would be an easy fix to most of the issues with the device the cheese  if you use sliced cheese  melts quickly  runs over the edges of the muffin and starts to burn on the bottom plate it s also hard to clean i can t see myself ever using this  it was supposed to be a quick easy way to make breakfast in the morning when i m in a hurry and save me from driving through mcdonald s all the time but i m returning it and looking for a better design      
220,4.0,                       i would give this   stars but the griddle part comes out very easy which makes it dangerous to get a burn  i don t understand why when i pull the griddle up to take my sandwich off  it falls out super easy      
221,5.0,                       after using this thing a few times  i decided that i like it a lot  reasons why    no messy kitchen from making it the old fashion way    super easy to clean  takes   seconds to wipe with a damp or dry rag    extremely easy to use  any kid old enough to cook could do it    take   mins or less to make  set a timer and walk away    it taste really good note  there is not an on and off switch  you have to unplug it      
222,5.0,                       on my quest for a healthier lifestyle i decided that a hearty breakfast every morning would do me some good  the thing is    i hate eggs   unless they re in a breakfast sandwhich  it s weird and i dont understand it either  i searched on amazon for a breakfast sandwhich maker to save myself the time and money of buying one everyday and holy guacamole    this turned out to be the best investment i ve made in my life  it only takes   minutes and with a little garlic aioli and cheese it makes a breakfast fit for the kings and picky eaters alike bottom line  saved me time  money  hangry mornings  and makes the perfect sandwhich      
223,5.0,                       i toast my muffins first for that other world crunchy taste   otherwise you just get hot tasty eggamuffin joy   peanut butter and cheese and canadian bacon and a fresh egg make for the best toasty muffins   addictive and easy to make   cleans up with a napkin   simple and ready to go after a     minute warm up   egg cooks perfectly in   minutes   i used to do the toast the muffins and fry the egg in a skillet and microwave the egg and melt then cheese and what a mess   so much to clean up   now from start to finish    minutes i have a hot fresh perfect for me breakfast meal      
224,5.0,                       i love this sandwich maker   it makes the best breakfast sandwiches   we use it up at camp for quick breakfasts  the middle is removable and easy to clean  because of the cheese and egg i recommend you clean while the unit is still warm   if you leave it to when it s much later it good he tougher but the teflon on it is really good in the beginning      
225,4.0,                       i have now cooked   breakfast sandwiches  the instructions are adequate and understandable  i have used thomas regular sized english muffins      inch sausage patties  cheddar cheese and one egg be sure to spray the racks  i used olive oil on a napkin and just wiped all of the insides of the racks  i suggest putting in the english muffin bottom  then cheese  then meat  then drop the egg rack and close the slide  crack an egg in the rack and break the yoke  if you stir  do not move the rack in any way   if you do  the egg will seep out the edges of the rack  i let mine cook for two minutes and then put in the top of the muffin on top of the egg  i then let if cook for   more minutes these are bigger and so much better than the arches version      
226,2.0,                       easy to use but a serious flaw in the design of the egg plate and the ring  clearly not a good seal at all  this has happened   times now  i won t even be using this anymore     waste     
227,5.0,                       i use this sandwich maker every morning during the week   i prefer to have a warm breakfast that i can take with me and eat   it s easy to use and the cleaning is quick   i normally wash the removable rings and run through the dishwasher once a week and wipe the whole thing down everyday   highly recommend      
228,3.0,                       you know  this was a cute idea   it s not any faster than just frying an egg in a pan and putting it on an english muffin   but it s novel   it s pretty easy to clean which is a good thing since it leaks cheese out all over the place   had i to do it all over again knowing what i know now  i probably would not but this again      
229,5.0,                       we use it all the tine and it s awesome  it s really easy to use  when you use a bagel or like cinnamon toast don t close the top lid  if you do the brass burns a little  it takes five minutes to cook with english muffins and it s easy to clean  it takes a little bit to get used to  i burnt my fingers a couple of times at first but then got used to how it works  put it in a pan out on a plate when using due to the egg sometimes spills over      
230,5.0,                       this product is everything thats claimed   in fact  you dont have to limit yourself to egg and ham breakfast sandwiches  i sometimes leave out the egg and add roast beef and or extra ham   its like a mini panini sandwich maker  if you like a complete hot meal in about five minutes with minimal clean up  you must buy this cool machine      
231,5.0,                       best purchase    words can t say enough on how much i love this handy little sandwich maker   it s easy to use   i have not had any problems with the food spilling out   burning or undercooking   i ve been quite creative with it   have come up with extraordinary sandwiches  broccoli   bits of chicken with my egg to have as a dinner sandwich  pancakes in place of the english muffin with maple sausage  the ideas are endless  happy with it        
232,5.0,                       i bought it as a gift for a family member and they were very unsure about it at first  i had to convince them to try it   once they tried they loved it and use it almost every morning for breakfast   its so easy to use  clean and small enough to store anywhere  if you love to have a hot sandwich for breakfast  buy this       bought one for my self and love it      
233,1.0,                       if you saw the images of the product you ll notice the demonstrator types in   minutes cook time  this leads you to think this is the model your buying  you like me would be totally wrong   what arrived was a version where you plug it in and wait until the light turns green  i added   egg and the lod touches the yoke burning the top and cooking it unevenly  the slide mechanism does not work and the egg sticks  the directions are not helpful and at the end only one side of your muffin gets toasted and by toasted i mean burnt to hell  i feel bad for anyone like me who thought they could save time with this device      
234,5.0,                       i love this thing  it has made breakfast so much easier for me  it s simple to clean and doesn t take up a lot of room  i ve discovered that  minutes is the perfect cooking time to make sure that the egg is cooked all the way through  i also prefer to add the cheese after the sandwich has cooled a little bit or else it melts so much that the sandwich parts slide all over the place  however  i would rather have too hot than too cold  this is one of my favorite kitchen items and i am going to get this as a gift for a few people i know      
235,5.0,                       not too hard to figure out  is it a necessity  no  but it surely is my most used impulse buy  any time i am craving a breakfast sandwich  i can make one at home for a fraction of the cost of fast food places  also  make sure to avoid using premixed liquid eggs egg whites  they will leak  also  only use pre cooked meats      
236,4.0,                       works well   the egg can leak a little  but not much glad i bought the single over the double   this way i only have one clean up is a snap       minutes cook time oh  use swiss or other non american  fake  cheese product  way better      
237,4.0,                       i love my breakfast sandwich maker  it makes the perfect egg circle  i make a bunch then freeze them for later  but also great for making a quick sandwich  i do like my english muffin toasted more  so i don t toast it in the sandwich maker  but i cook the egg and my sausage patty      
238,5.0,                       this is literally the best thing ever  i use this every morning to make a ham egg and cheese sandwich on an english muffin  it has cut my breakfast time by      and i can get other things done while it cooks on its own  take some time to visualize where you want each ingredient  breads  egg  cheese  meat  and eventually you ll be turning out sandwiches like a well oiled machine  which it is     i even used it to make my mom a sunny side up egg with flawless results  i take this on every vacation and again i use it every day  i can t even express how much i love this silly little machine  but it s the best kitchen tool i own  hamilton beach i love you      
239,5.0,                       i have used this   times now and it works  i place the cheese on the bottom bun so it does not leak out but melts into the muffin      minutes and it tastes great  the slide comes right out allowing the egg to drop down as it should  super easy to clean as t fal coating seems very thick  it works      
240,5.0,                       best money i ever spent   super easy to use and we have done a lot with it   meats used bacon  canadian bacon  various lunch meats and chicken   bread used  egg mcmuffins  bagels and croissants   i prefer for the egg to be complete before putting the bread on top  i just was not a fan of the egg cooking into the bread   i will say that if you are aiming for an egg mcmuffin be sure to spread a little butter on the egg mcmuffin first and use canadian bacon  found in every grocery store in the ham section  and it tastes like an egg mcmuffin   just think  make   of these on your way out the door and you ve already paid for it by skipping mcd s   super easy to wash and you are only limited by your imagination   this breakfast maker paid for itself in less than a week   i only wish i would have gotten the double one for only a few dollars more      
241,5.0,                       makes great breakfast sandwiches  no muss  no fuss  love it  has a very small footprint too  i do toast the muffins first because i like them crispier but the sandwich maker does toast the bread lightly      
242,4.0,                       is easy to clean and works great but you must be careful you don t put a thick muffin in as the unit will come off of pin holder at back  would buy again but they should make top ring a little deeper to hold thicker muffin half      
243,1.0,                         uncooked eggs in   attempts to use it      
244,1.0,                       i bought this as a christmas gift for my son  i arrived with a shipping label attached to the product box  there was no packaging to hide what it is  ruined the gift      
245,5.0,                       i love these  my second one  hamilton beach  is a much better one then my other one  i make like a whole package and freeze them  they are good for any meal and many variations  i use sausage   bacon and ham   depending what i feel like  easy clean up  a lot healthier then mcdonalds  i put the cheese on bottom english muffin piece      
246,3.0,                       i like this sandwich maker  just don t count on it being as easy as they say  i did everything the way the instructions say to  i preheat it and then put the bread  egg  etc on  nine times out of ten  the egg leaks out  they say it won t do that if you preheat it   wrong  it s still a good product  it just really needs refining      
247,3.0,                       this machine makes breakfast sandwiches as advertised with relative ease  but several drawbacks have me less than enthused    hb is big on advertising  breakfast sandwiches in   minutes   of course what they don t bother to tell you is that it takes   mins to preheat as well  making your   minute sandwich into    minute sandwich  not a big time saver    for some reason i can t explain this thing doesn t have an on off switch  you turn it  on  by plugging the ac cord into an outlet and  off  by unplugging the a c cord  if your kitchen plugs are hard to access  like mine  it s a pain in the ass  truly bizarre  imagine having to do that with your coffee maker or microwave    the compartment where you put the raw egg doesn t seal properly  so some raw egg will run out all over the machine  creating a sticky cleaning nightmare    the large middle portion of the machine  the rings where the egg and top bread go  is not locked into the hinge system  it just sits in there  i suppose this is to make it easily removable for cleaning  the problem is that when your sandwich is done and you lift up all the rings to remove it  this part of the machine breaks free from the hinge system  slips off the base and goes flying across your kitchen counter  making for yet another fun cleanup make no mistake  it will make you a tasty breakfast sandwich  if you don t mind the machine and your countertop looking like the chernobyl disaster after    mins      
248,5.0,                       since the first time i saw an ad on television for this sandwich maker  i wanted one  but i was a little hesitant after i read some of the negative reviews  there seemed to be a lot of complaints about the egg leaking out and making a huge mess  and then almost as many complaints that it doesn t cook the egg all the way or it burns the bread  however  given that the major percentage of reviews were favorable  i decided to give it a try  and this little gadget is fabulous   if you follow the directions that come with it  the sandwiches turn out perfect  and it is so simple to clean  the ring assembly comes right off and cleans up easily with soap and water or in the dishwasher  cleaning the top and bottom plates is as simple as wiping them with paper towel i am guessing that those folks who complained of the egg leaking didn t have the cooking plate for the egg slid in all the way  and as far as burning the bread  well  i suppose if you left in there longer than the     minutes it takes to cook   if you are like me and love breakfast sandwiches  but don t have the time in the morning to cook everything separately  or just don t want to deal with the dishes   then this is a must have      
249,5.0,                       i am an oversleeper so the fact that i could still make myself an entire breakfasts sandwich while trying to get out the door is a miracle  also a great housewarming gift  i make it with sausage and it s delish      
250,5.0,                       i was always a frozen breakfast sandwich person  but no more  these will take about six or seven minutes to make from pre heating to completion  but the end result is perfect  english muffin  sausage patty  egg and cheese works for us  but you can put whatever you want in the machine  assuming it fits   highly recommend      
251,1.0,                       i didn t like it because that part where you put the egg didn t get hot enough so went you put the bread on top spill all over     
252,5.0,                       i am trying to eat better  usually i skip breakfast  with this  i can through my peppers and other ingredients in my eggs  put it in here  walk away to get ready for work and then grab and go  if you decide you just want the eggs  no bread  use just the top  pour your egg mixture  in and instant omelet  works great for just a crack it open and cook egg too      
253,5.0,                       my kitchen appliances are all my toys   i love this one   i was going to the arches        mornings a week for breakfast  at    a day   i don t want to make any inferences on quality  but i m pretty sure that that place that has served billions isn t using organic free range eggs  organic cheese  or even actual cheese for that matter  and humanely raised pigs for canadian bacon   if they are  i certainly missed that ad campaign   now my breakfast sammy runs about    and it s not slowly killing me   i ve read the other tips    yes preheat it   yes use spray  common sense really   put the cheese on the bottom of the muffin and take the time to make sure it s not running over  that way you can eat the cheese not clean it off the plate   p s   your sandwich is screaming hot when it comes off the machine  don t blindly bite into it      
254,1.0,                       my egg leaked right out  didn t stay in at all  i guess if your eggs are frozen or something it might work better  also i don t like that you put the bread in the raw egg  it s a little strage     
255,4.0,                       it s a great device   be careful to make sure the sliding egg hot plate is fully closed  and only use one egg      
256,5.0,                       we use this allllllll the time  you don t necessarily have to make a sandwich each time  we use it to make a scrambled egg patty then stick it on some bread with a slice of cheese we crack one egg in a cup and mix it up while the thing heats up  once at temp  pour the mixed egg in the top portion of the cooker and close the lid  cook for   minutes  when the time is up  slide the thing to the side so the egg patty falls to the bottom  slide it back  then open the lid  use a fork to flick it out onto the bread on your plate      
257,5.0,                       did i need this  no  no one needs another specialty appliance  they take up space and you never use them     but  wait  what  this thing  it s magical compact  so easy to clean  so easy to use  it s a game changer in our foodie household the day we received it  i followed the instructions to a  t  and they worked beautifully  what an awesome breakfast sandwich  so easy and delicious  since then  i ve become more adventurous  keto friendly  yes  i make  sandwiches  with no bread  gluten free  of course  you can do that   it s just so user friendly and predictable  cook time wise i plan on ordering more as gifts      
258,2.0,                       the egg tray will become heavily scratched from standard usage update  i dont know how this thing has a rating above   stars  the major flaw is the egg tray leaks all over the counter  cleaning as much egg as it cooks  worthless      
259,5.0,                       after reading all the reviews i decided totry it out  i am not disappointed i played around with different cooking times   ingredients   settled into a fab i place half a muffin  slice of cheese   pre cooked sausage on bottom  top layer is     yes   eggs   i have no problems w  eggs spilling out     let cook  after cooking i flip it over w bread side up   spread jam or syrup on top  yup  can t eat as a sandwich but in my opinion makes a quick sit down breakfast    fyi  eggs are size large  to prevent spillage  i crack  st egg  break yolk  let cook for    secs   repeat w  nd egg  by cooking  st egg  it forms a  seal  around the metal ring  which prevents any liquid from leaking out      
260,5.0,                       i don t know about you  but almost every time i ve ordered a breakfast sandwich at a fast food emporium  they screw it up somehow   wrong meat  no meat  no cheese  wrong bread   once i was served one that was ice cold  they actually forgot to heat it up for me so  it s often true that if you want something done right  you have to do it yourself   but if it s too complicated to do  you won t bother doing it   that s where this nifty little gadget comes in   it s so easy to use  even my culinarily challenged husband can do it   yes  if you use meat in this thing  it needs to be pre cooked   sure  you can buy pre cooked bacon and sausage at the store  but you can save money by buying it raw and cooking up enough for the whole week all at once over the weekend  to save time on weekday mornings   canadian bacon is sold already cooked and works well  as does ham   you re not limited to the usual  egg mcmuffin  thing  the possibilities are endless   if you buy this gadget  you should also consider getting at least one of the cookbooks that were written for it   i especially like      crazy for breakfast sandwiches     delicious  handheld meals hot out of your sandwich maker                          you can even recycle dinner leftovers for breakfast this thing will also save you time and money   just plug it in to pre heat while you re getting ready for work or school  then put the ingredients in  and five minutes later  you have a yummy sandwich   no more waiting in line at the fast food drive through for a sandwich that they may or may not screw up  and it will cost less  too   you control exactly what goes into it i took the advice of other reviewers here and sprayed the cooking surfaces lightly with cooking spray   the food did not stick and make a goopy mess  and that made the thing easy to clean   the removable inside part can be put in the dishwasher  but it s easy enough to just wipe it clean highly recommended      
261,1.0,                       i find it surprising to stumble upon this item again and see how good the reviews are  i ve had this product for quite some time now  it makes a decent sandwich at best  the egg will always spill over  you can t fit that many ingredients at all  and when you do the top won t close down all of the way  the egg takes longer to cook on the center part than the english muffins themselves take  which always leads to over crispy hard english muffins  just my take on this product      
262,5.0,                       love this sandwich maker  have already recommended it to others  love to make traditional egg mcmuffin style as well as experimenting with sausage crumbles  bacon  different cheeses  even pizza themed sandwiches  very easy to use  easy to clean  and cooks evenly  i find that       minutes is perfect amount of time for a hard cooked yolk  i would buy it again      
263,3.0,                       i got this for my husband as a christmas gift because he loves to make breakfast sandwiches  unfortunately  it s a bit of a hassle and finicky  the egg always seems to leak out while it s cooking and makes a mess and the bread get burnt before the egg is even done cooking   might be best just to get an egg cooker      
264,5.0,                       so i bought this a couple weeks ago and am definitely happy about the purchase  it s so easy to do everything  after some trials and errors i have finally got it down to a tee  it s super easy to use and clean which was my biggest concern  everything is detachable which is great cause i just rinse it off and pop it in the dish washer  definitely would recommend watching one of the videos to see how long it should cook for and definitely pre warm it before using  but definitely a good buy and something everyone should have in their home  tips   pre warm it  wait for the green light to come on  them assemble sandwich and then set a time between     minutes to throughly cook the egg      
265,4.0,                       great low cost gift for my parents  although it can only fit small bagels and is not able to cook the eggs while having the yolk a little runny for flavour  it does cook all the way and is very easy and convenient      
266,5.0,                       this was very useful in making a variety of breakfast sandwiches   it is used weekly      
267,5.0,                       i thought this looked like the perfect morning breakfast helper and it is  i got one for me and loved it so much i bought at least a dozen to give as gifts  everyone loves it  we even used it to make a quick christmas breakfast for our large family  if i m adding something to the sandwich like bacon and mushrooms  i ve found it works best to use precooked bacon  cut the additions into small pieces and add them right to the egg   i bought several from amazon but watch the price as it varies depending on the shipper      
268,5.0,                       i love egg mcmuffins but buying several each week can get pricey  i live in nyc where everything is more expensive   this makes a great substitute at a fraction of the cost  it also gives great range of choice as to ingredients  i use different types of english muffins  different types of cheese and regular or canadian bacon  i ve even scrambled the egg and that also works  it s easy to use and the non stick surface is easy to clean  it is also fast  i preheat while gathering the ingredients and let it cook for   minutes  i found that the   minutes in the instructions tends to overcook the egg but that s a matter of taste    that s faster than when i buy an egg mcmuffin at mcdonald s and i don t have to make the trip  i use it two to three times a week and am very satisfied with it      
269,5.0,                       i have been watching this for years but i just didn t think it would work that well   i finally pulled the trigger and i love it   for     bucks delivered via prime  it s an amazingly good deal too   i have not tried bagel sandwiches yet or done anything super fancy but for the basic english muffin sandwiches  this gadget is the best   they come out perfect every time if you do a quick spritz of olive oil spray   i have no spill over and if you are careful  cleaning the contraption is very easy   it has a very small footprint in the cupboard and on the counter  i found that if you time the cooking to   minutes instead of    you will get an egg yolk that is barely set but cooked through   very nice     minutes gives you one that s firm but not seared brown   i also learned quickly that there is a lot of steam generated so i will set a timer for   minutes more on my plate or paper towel before i attempt to eat it   comes out steaming hot      
270,5.0,                       i got one of these for my office so i can easily make breakfast or lunch sandwiches at work   it has not disappointed   works great  is easy to clean   warms up in     minutes   can cook an egg sandwich easily in     minutes   i love it   i highly recommend      
271,5.0,                       this is our second one of these and i love it  breakfast sandwiches are a staple around here and this helps keep them affordable     
272,5.0,                       works perfectly and as expected  enough room for muffins   cheese     sausage patty     egg  just always be careful the surface could be hot after cooking i find   minutes after preheating do not cook the egg well enough  it could only be me  i usually let it cook for     minutes so i get perfectly cooked eggs      
273,1.0,                       man oh man  where to begin  there is serious room for improvement with the design of this thing  first of all  the egg compartment is a joke  the whole thing is wobbly  loose and cheap feeling  the part where you put the egg doesn t seal so the egg leaks out everywhere and all over everything  secondly  the plates that are supposed to toast the bread get way too hot  there is no temperature control  and burn the s    out of the bread while barely warming the middle of the sandwich  the only type of bread that fits in this thing is a smaller english muffin  don t bother with bagels or toast  it won t fit  if it s too thick  it won t close and if it s too wide it won t fit  the quality of this thing sucks over all  for    bucks plus tax i expected it to be sturdy at the very least but it feels like it going to fall apart in my hands  very wobbly like the screws that hold the pieces together are loose or something  i want to return this crap honestly  i ve only used it once and it was an awful experience so i hope i m still able to after using this pos  talk about a design flaw  yikes  save your money and buy something else  oh and one more thing   there is no timer on this model like they falsely advertise in the video  you just have to guess when your sandwich is done      
274,2.0,                       have been using the double sandwich maker for months now with no problems  decided to get the single and pass the double to my parents  the single leaks eggs terribly where the double never leaked  doesn t cook egg as thoroughly in the same amount of time as the double does either  mess to clean up every morning  disappointed in the difference between the two      
275,5.0,                       i was poking around for white elephant gifts around christmas  i came across this thing and first thought was okay that is amazing  second thought was no way it is going to work well  third thought was eh  it s worth a shot  at the end of the gift swap i ended up with the breakfast sandwich maker  it came in a plain cardboard box without a product image on it  so it didn t jump out from the rest of the gifts  walked away content  but couldn t help but wonder if i d bought myself a flop  fired it up the next morning and can honestly say it made a believer out of me from the first sandwich  english muffins  meat  and cheese get warmed appropriately  not burnt  eggs cook to a nice breakfast sandwich worthy patty  after several months i have not had a bad looking sandwich come out of it  nothing has been undercooked or burnt  i follow the instructions and make sure i spray it with pam before each use  cleaning it is not a   second task and yes  you have to cook one sandwich at a time  but they take   minutes each  i don t take offense if my wife has gobbled hers down already by the time mine comes out  the egg part is really what seals the deal for me  rather get the full sandwich going on here than cook the egg separately on a pan  plus it comes out in a nice neat stack if you re careful  definitely recommend  it s a nice little novelty to have around in the morning      
276,4.0,                       love the product   takes a few times to make sure you don t burn yourself   make sure your swing lid for the egg is back to closed position when lifting up for taking food out   other wise it pulls out of the holder and you will get burned other than that we are loving it and my husband and i are up at   and   am for our jobs so it makes it hard to cook that early  this has made things quick and easy   only wish i knew i had to pay an additional     for the timer   the same video is used on both products with and with out timer      
277,3.0,                       definitely not what i expected  very difficult to clean afterwards  if you are not super careful  you can burn yourself very bad  if i can return it i would  but i just used it two days ago  it was definitely a waste of money  i wouldn t allow my children to use it  it s too dangerous      
278,3.0,                       i received one of the many emails from amazon and saw this product  i was hoping it would fill a need for a quick and healthy breakfast  i like   grain sprouted muffins and egg substitute  those muffins are too thick  using regular muffins it seems to work better for me to put the first muffin in  then pour a little egg on top of it  then slide close the lid and put the  nd muffin in the top section  but doing it that way the egg doesn t get done before the muffin starts to burn  putting the egg on the sliding lid then putting the muffin on top of that  there doesn t seem to be enough room in the top section  this may sound confusing unless you have one of these  it would work better i think if you could flip the hinged section over   but it is made in away that  you can t  it does heat up quickly and is very well made  i had no problem with sticking  the non stick surface is durable   i am going to continue to cook the egg in it but go back to my sprouted muffins in the toaster      
279,5.0,                       love this product   it is what it showed on the video and more   love love lovebeing able to create my own sandwiches in such a short time   would be greatfor students or military persons as well   amazon   you rock      
280,5.0,                       i bought this to surprise my husband   he likes make sandwiches breakfast style on the weekend so i thought this would be helpful  it was   it s so easy to add the food and a quick clean up      
281,1.0,                       this is the biggest piece of crap  it s so bad that i have decided to not buy any hamilton beach product ever again simply because the advertising on this is so dishonest   a complete lie  it doesn t do what the video shows   all  the egg literally leaks out the sides  i threw it away the first time i used it    complete mess   disaster        
282,4.0,                       i am glad that i bought this simple appliance   once i learned what ingredients that i like in my sandwich  it s easy to have my ingredients ready to pop in the machine in the morning   i found that i don t like the raw egg cooked into the bread top  so i put the scrambled egg on the top area of the cooker and shut the lid for     of the cooking time   then i add the cheese and bread top for the last minute or minute and       my husband liked the whole egg and bread cooking  together    which is the way the instructions say you must have your meat pre cooked  but that really isn t a problem i prepare the scrambled egg and leave it in a small bowl in the fridge overnite  then put my choice of meat and a small slice of cheese in a small plastic bag along side the egg in the fridge  it becomes a quick process in the morning   i plug in the until about   minutes before i am ready to leave for the day   when the ready lite comes on all i need is to put the ingredients in the preheated sandwich in the manner i described  about   minutes later i am going out the door with a warm sandwich tightly wrapped in a napkin and ready to enjoy on my ride to work   better quality and faster than going thru a fast food drive through my choice of bread    small bagels   watch the size before you buy   the average size bagel won t fit regular sized english muffins do fit   thank you hamilton beach for this good idea      
283,5.0,                       i love my breakfast sandwich maker   it is so easy to use and it makes delicious sandwiches very quickly   it only takes a couple of minutes to heat up and only five minutes to cook the sandwich   the choices are endless as to what ingredients you want to use   easy cleanup as well   as for the durability  i ve only had it for a month so i can t attest to that      
284,5.0,                       i wasn t      sure when i ordered this but i figured at this price       it was low risk  well i have to say it does everything they said and if you follow some of the many tips that people have posted  it s pretty much foolproof  i use it several times a week and even with my hectic morning routine  i prefer to spend the time sleeping if i can  it is easily accomodated specific  muffins definitely work best  but also flatbread sandwich buns  thin bagels and  to a degree  croissants  all work  larger bagels don t work so well   you have to trim and they are still really too thick for everything to work my normal breakast is pre cooked sausage patties  usually have to trim and use two if they are store bought precooked   or canadian bacon  i like prcoessed american cheese slices  tip  fold the corners in so they are contained within the muffin or cheese may melt all out the sides   i use a spray olive oil for the egg section  don t skip this   it really keeps everything cleaner and helps stop egg leaks  with a little cracked pepper my routine is heat up  often for longer that required but i get better results if i don t immediately use it when the green light comes   bottom muffin  cheese  meat  close that section  crack the egg  season  drop the lid and set timer for       i find that s enough if you really let it warm up first   i prefer to leave the top muffin off till there s a minute to go  so it doesn t soak up the egg  unplug  open  slide out the egg pan  and just lift the whole ring section off  leaving the muffin behind  then slide off with a spatula  since time is at a premium for me in the mornings  i just leave the ring section in the sink and clean up in the evening  a quick wipe is all it needs other hints   i ve tried using avocado  made everything too slippery   tuna and cheese  trying to make a eggy tuna melt   jury is out on that one    i sometimes add a little chopped onion with the egg   that works  just don t overdo the cheese   it can get messy all in all   well worth the cost   and still healthier that a mcmuffin      
285,1.0,                       this worked great for about a month  then what should take  mins to cook the sandwich turned in to much longer and it does not have an all around cook now  after  mins now the egg is runny and undercooked  which didn t used to be the case  this all happened within a week of the return date and i submitted an inquiry for a replacement item through hamilton beach and have yet to hear back since their phone lines are down due to the pandemic  i would happily change my review once hamilton beach follows up as amazon stated they should due to it being under warranty  it was a great product until it started working inefficiently      
286,5.0,                       this thing is a life saver  i m a mother of   young kids  so i have resorted to eating cereal  poptarts  anything fast in the mornings because i have lots of little people to take care of too  for as little as   minute of prep time and   minutes to cook  i have a delicious and much healthier breakfast  i bought the single  but i am considering ordering a double as well  my typical sandwich is as follows  english muffin  precooked turkey sausage  cheese slice with corners removed to fit circular shape    scrambled egg   check the photos for the process      
287,5.0,                       this unit does all it says and more  it is quicker than any other type cooking method i have used  it is quick  efficient and easy to clean up  what is really nice is a heated smaller sandwich that has a toasted type crusty taste  you don t need a recipe book  just let your imagination be your guide  the meat heats up  the cheese melts and the bun toasts and if you want an egg just put it in  i have used it about    times so far with no issues  even heating a half burrito and sort of a folded type quesadilla  it takes no time to load it up with goodies  it sort of has been dietetic for me as i make a smaller sandwich without butter and mayo and the heat and toasted bun just make the sand  yummy  i have used this thing to cook and use all sorts of left overs as sandwich fillers  i also have found the cheaper buns at like vons or safeway  you know the   for       fit it perfectly  so do the economy english muffins  by the time you put everything with it you have a toasted hot sandwich for under a quarter  i do find you are better of in regards to keeping the cleaning to a minimum by keeping you sandwich fillers  meat  cheese  etc  to the size of the bun  and if you want tomatoes peppers or whatever  add them towards the end so the juice doesn t run all over  another positive  no dirty egg pans  no splatters in the microwave covers  it is a cool speedy kitchen tool  one warning though  do not touch any metal part of it until it cools as she does get hot      
288,5.0,                       i am the healthy eating healthy life person  i love this machine because i am able to make my   mcd s egg mcmuffin   like sandwich  and with this machine  the version you make tastes so much better  i like to use organic ingredients homemade stuff as much as i can  organic english muffin  spinach  turkey bacon  mozarella cheese  egg  it is gooooooooooood  for the amount i paid for hamilton beach sandwich machine and the number of times i have used it so far  it really is worth every penny  great for quick mornings save time eat in car not feel guilty with breakfast don t feel sluggish      
289,5.0,                       this little sandwich maker is one of the best kitchen appliances to own  we all buy the latest and greatest gadgets   juice makers  waffle irons  sandwich makers   remember bread makers   etc  only to stuff them in the cupboard after the novelty wears off  i don t see that happening with this  it s functional  small  simple to use  and makes great sandwiches  there is a bit of a learning curve to find the right size bread  not all bagels are created equal   and the right meat  but that s to be expected  we mostly use thomas english muffins because we like them and they are the perfect fit and just get ham  canadian bacon and precooked bacon and sausage for the meat  what i like most is because it is so simple to use it actually gets used      
290,1.0,                       worst kitchen appliance i have ever purchased   i found it difficult to use   extremely hot and must be very careful when removing finished product   did not add a lot to it and yet it still spilled on counter and the unit itself   when swinging out the center part so the muffin can fall down on other items  the steam was way too hot   also the top muffin did not fall down onto the rest of the sandwich  had to remove manually  and the unit is extremely hot   thought too easily to get burned   not worth it   sorry i bought it      
291,2.0,                       while a clever idea  it s surprising that hamilton beach would sell such poorly designed device  the moving part that separates the egg is way too loose and promises to leak egg everywhere  directions warn about misusing the sandwich maker and getting eggs in the  joints   returning  bought another as a gift  returning that also      
292,5.0,                       i typically do not write reviews  however this little gem is that good   i have owned it for a week now and just this week alone it has paid for itself   a typical egg white delight and sweet tea at the yellow arches typically runs just under      i purchased a   pack of thomas muffins from sams club for        along with eggs  cheese and my usual lunch meat   long story short  this thing makes excellent breakfast sandwiches   hands down try it  you will not be disappointed      
293,5.0,                       i got this for my husband as a gift and it works great he loves it  it is quick and easy and now he can make his breakfast sandwhich while getting ready for work and not have to stop for fast food       
294,5.0,                       makes a perfect sandwich everytime  tastes great  it s easy to clean the main parts but a little tough around the hinge to get all residue from the cooking spray  if you spray the top  it will drip down off the back and onto the counter but it s not that bad      
295,5.0,                       you do have to have your ingredients prepared ahead of time  that means precooked meat  thawed muffins  etc  i started the heat on the sandwich maker  then i got everything out of the frig  by the time that the machine was heated  my ingredients were optimum for the machine  i used thomas muffin  canadian bacon  shredded cheddar cheese and an egg when the machine was heated  i put in everything but the top of the muffin  i let the egg cook for about three minutes  then put the muffin top in  i then let it cook for about another three minutes  i took the sandwich out of the machine  and there was very little sticking  i did not spray or use any oils on the machine first and then  deliciousness  this makes a really tasty sandwich  due to the protein ingredients  it is also very filling  all i can say is  yum yum       
296,4.0,                       i was surprised by how small the packaging was but it arrived safe and on time  this is a fun little gadget that is easy to use  the directions were well written and easy to understand  i have made dozens of breakfast meals using bagels  english muffins and even toaster waffles  the heating surfaces and the rings are easy to clean  too  i have not had any sticking problems my only suggestion would be to increas the diameter of the cooking rings about a quarter if an inch to make the waffles fit better      
297,5.0,                       use it all the time  lots of naysayers i m sure but this thing bangs out great sandwiches in   minutes without getting a single pan or dish dirty  nothing sticks to it  simply wipe off any crumbs with a paper towel if needed  love this thing and have bought as gifts for family and friends      
298,5.0,                       i bought this as one gift for my grandson for christmas and thought to myself  you are going to get one of those  is my grandmother out of her mind      looks   instead he was almost happy       i included a cookbook and further thought that he would  freak out    instead his mom said that he loves it and makes a sandwich in it every few days   a n d  uses the recipes in the book   lest you think that he is not appreciative enough  he is just a thought filled kid and keeps himself to himself            
299,5.0,                       very easy to use and cleans up great  it is limited to what you can add to the sandwich because it will overflow  best to use small eggs if you want something other than ham and cheese on the sandwich  also works great with bagel thins instead of english muffins   very satisfied with this and use it  often      
300,5.0,                       this was a valentine s present for my girlfriend  she had been wanting this for a while  she uses it every chance she gets  every time she uses it  she yells   i love this thing   from the kitchen  it is very easy to clean  and soooo easy to use  great gift for anyone who enjoys breakfast sandwiches i recommend this product      
301,5.0,                       this little gadget is the greatest thing since sliced bread  really it truly is    i purchased this to use in the office as so many of us here are slaves to macdonalds  pretty pricey   not all that good for you   the deli around the corner  horrible  horrible sandwiches and really effing expensive  or the roach coach truck that wheels into the parking lot every now and then  when you re hungry  he never shows up    so this seemed like the answer and guess what it is  perfect  and i mean perfect sandwiches   from the first one made this morning to the next seven   and there s only three of us here today    we each had two  well tf had three   the sandwiches were are that good   in hindsight i really should have purchased the two sandwich at a time maker  maybe next year   i feel like i can go into business with this contraption   if you re on the fence as to buying   jump off and buy   it s really worth it      
302,1.0,                       don t waste your time  this takes forever and doesn t fully cook the egg  it was messy and took twice as long to make a sandwich as what it took me to make three sandwiches in a large pan on the stovetop  i tried twice with equally disappointing results before sending it back      
303,4.0,                       i love this thing  quick breakfast sandwich in the morning and i m out the door  only issue is that the feet come off to easy and i lost one  now it wobbles  or should i say it use to wobble  i took off the remaining little rubber feet  works great though  great size for storing and real easy to clean      
304,2.0,                       i had high hopes after reading the other comments and was super disappointed  first off  you can only cook   egg at a time and scrambled or not  it seeps thru the seams and makes a mess all over your counter top  yes  i preheated it and read all the directions and followed them  also  who wants raw egg cooked into their sandwich top  gross  i tried this a few x and still bad results  its a great idea but the egg section is really the issue  doesn t seal all the way and you can only cook   egg at a time and i m sorry my child even eats   eggs on his sandwiches  very disappointed      
305,2.0,                       the device works well but there is a gap between the sliding plate and upper ring where the egg goes  it is a large enough gap the egg pours out of the side until the egg cooks enough to block the egg whites from making it through the opening  i have to put a paper towel on the counter then the sandwich maker on that so that i do not get egg whites all over the counter  a little disappointed in this part of the egg maker but it works fine besides that  i would like to see if i can get another insert that does not have the gap in it      
306,5.0,                       normally i avoid cooking gadgets like the plague   with most of them the hype and promises far exceed the actual results but not in this cases   i am i admit a breakfast person and now and then like just a breakfast sandwich and not go thru all the fuss of a full blown meal   this fills that need to a t   well worth the price and the hype is well justified   the only reason it only got   stars on flavor is both sides of the muffin doesn t get toasted     
307,5.0,                       we love this sandwich maker   we just used if for the first time to make breakfast sandwiches for lunch today   it worked perfect    read the instructions first so that you know what to pre wash and what to spray with non stick cooking spray here s what we did  we put the bottom half of an english muffin in the bottom  topped that with grated cheddar cheese  and topped the cheese with some deli honey ham   on the egg plate  which you make sure is pushed in all the way  we cracked an egg and poked the yoke with a toothpick  kind of moving the yoke around so it would spread out a little   we closed the lid and set a timer for   minute   we then opened it and added the top of the english muffin  closed it and set time for   minutes   when done  the egg plate slid out easily  looking completely clean   our breakfast sandwich was perfect   i wish i would have taken a picture   we then made a  nd one  but had a slight issue   this time we added a just little too much cheese   the instructions clearly say not to overfill   maybe we overfilled a bit too much with cheese   the cheese oozed out a little bit and made just a few slightly burned areas under the bottom muffin   if you are using the single unit to make more than one  keep in mind that by the time you make the second one the unit is much hotter and maybe won t require the full   minutes   this is so simple to use  and super easy to clean up  both of which is what i wanted so my daughter could make a sandwich for breakfast or lunch all by herself   we are very happy with this and would highly recommend it one more thing i want to mention is that i read a review that said the instructions say not to use egg whites   it says not to use store bought egg whites  like a carton of egg beaters     take an actual egg  use an egg separator  and use those egg whites   just wanted to clear that up that egg whites can be used      
308,5.0,                       love this machine this is a truly fantastically useful appliance in a nut shell  a great breakfast of english  muffins or bagels with combinations of spinach eggs onions tomatoes cheese and even salmon patty veggie burgers  canadian bacon or sausage patty is ready to eat in about   minutes with no cleanup required afterward i can have a satisfying breakfast and invest the same amount of time it takes to make coffee simultaneously this really makes a difference on a day where breakfast could be ignored due to a tight schedule i have used this machine every other day since  it arrived definitely improves the quality of my life by making breakfast always available in  minutes the non stick surface really works well  you just drop it into some warm soapy water and wipe it off and you are good to go you can even make a kind of  tiny quiche or souffle on this device by just adding a bit of ice cold water to the eggs when you whip them       
309,5.0,                       i purchased the hamilton beach breakfast sandwich maker for my son in law as i had already purchased one for my husband and when my son in law saw how easy it was to use  and better yet  how delicious the sandwich was  and made in   minutes  he immediately wanted one  therefore  i ordered him one for christmas   my husband absolutely loves his   his breakfast sandwich is ready in   minutes and it looks beautiful when finished   i eat yogurt  however  i must say  it makes me hungry just to look at it   it is so nifty   the egg cooks beautifully and sizes up with the remainder of the sandwich  he uses egg  sausage  he cooks and freezes  and trader joe english muffins   it is so easy   i really impressed me and it impressed my son in law  daughter  and me      
310,5.0,                       would you believe   my twelve year old grandson told me about this product after he found out i loved mcdonaldsmcmuffins   his family has one and i bought one on his recommendation   i love it and use it all the time   i have experimented with it and make all kinds of hot sandwiches  including ham and cheese  feta and spinach  sausage and spaghetti sauce on the bread with parmesan cheese   it s so easy to clean too which means a lot to me   otherwise i would not use it   neat little device        
311,5.0,                       this is the best  i used regular bread and threw in some pre cooked sausage and egg  this cooled a beautiful breakfast sandwich in about   min  never buying the frozen kind again  easy to clean too      
312,3.0,                       i ordered this little breakfast maker since i hoped it would help my hubby make an easier breakfast for himself   it works  but it does not seem to have a timer on it or change light colors when the sandwich is done   my hubby said that he needs to keep opening it to see if the egg is done   i guess it does what it should  but it seems that a light or timer would make it even better and easier to use      
313,5.0,                       i absolutely love this sandwich maker   so good tasting  and very easy to use and clean up   i ve used it every morning since i got it   also  i don t care for eggs the way they picture them   i scramble the eggs thoroughly before adding to the sandwich maker   i also wait about    seconds into the cooking process before adding the top english muffin   buy this thing   it s awesome      
314,5.0,                       this works great   have tried it using english muffins  biscuits and today  bread cut into rounds   it is easy to use  cleans up with a paper towel and makes very tasty sandwiches i think there is a potential that you couldt  get a burn off of the sides of it when your lifting the top  but i was just very careful and had no issues  i probably would not let a child lift the top in case you wonder  it cooks the egg perfectly and i used large eggs    the machine cooke them well  and toasts the breads well   if you have to thick of a piece of bread  bun or muffin   it can burn so i sitck to slightly flatter muffins or today i used bread cut into a round and it came out perfect     i tried a home made biscuit the other day but it was to thick and the top got a little burned   but all in all i am completely satisfied with the product      
315,5.0,                       i purchased this for a family member and they love it  i don t know how it is personally but they use it almost everyday for easy breakfast prep      
316,5.0,                       i looked at a few videos before assembling and the key take away is to pre heat the machine before loading   muffin bottom  cheese  sandwich meat  bring down egg layer  pour in my scrambled egg  muffin top  close lid  and wait     min   voila   super simple   love it      
317,5.0,                       a year ago i lived in a hotel room without a kitchen and used this daily for   months  now i use it once a week when i need my mcmuffin fix  and it has definitely paid for itself for this reason  it works today just like it did when i got it and the non stick coating has t worn off  i have washed pieces that come off with hot water and a little bit of dawn over the year  and just wiped down the rest of it with a rag  during dishwashing there hasn t been a need to scrub anything off  unless i burn cheese on it  because of the non stick coating  the food cooks quickly enough that it doesn t take too long to cook two or three at a time for a warm up lunch for later  i would recommend this to someone who likes fast food but wants to budget better or make healthier choices  as well as someone who doesn t have a conventional kitchen to cook in and wants something hot that isn t a microwaved meal      
318,5.0,                       my daughter won this item  that we bought  as a white elephant gift   this machine is very easy to you and makes great breakfast sandwiches   i had   concerns before using        would the eggs leak       how difficult would it be to clean up   i m happy to report that the eggs cook wonderfully  and don t leak  and that it s a breeze to clean   the inside ring detaches to sink cleanup and you can simply wipe off the two other elements   for the price  this is great      
319,4.0,                       this gadget is totally worth      it basically pays for itself with less than about a dozen sandwiches and  so far everything has come out delicious   enjoy the pro tips below pro tip     do not add anything besides salt and pepper to the egg   the images show the egg  placed directly on the cookie tray but i ve had much better results with scrambling the eggs first in a separate bowl  do not  add milk or anything else to the egg as it will overflow the cooking tray and make a mess pro tip     plug the unit in to preheat while prepping your ingredients and when the green light turns on you are ready to add your ingredients to the cooker    the instructions are not very clear about this  after you add all your ingredients close the lid and set a separate timer for five minutes   after five minutes slide out the egg cooking tray  open the top and use a spatula to hold down the top part while also pulling up the remaining part of the machine    this can be a little tricky but you will figure it out  be careful not to burn yourself prp tip     i have found english muffins seem to work the best   experiment with different types like double protein  extra fiber  blueberry or cranberry      
320,5.0,                       well  isn t this little thing impressive for what it does   made my first breakfast in it  at my desk at work   i m sure this is illegal at work  but many things are   i ve been spending    at starbucks every morning for a year     and switched to jimmy dean delights at over    each  without a coupon    this lets me make exactly what i want for breakfast with just an egg  english muffin and whatever protein we have in the fridge in just  few minutes at my desk i m a much happier person when i get breakfast and have tried cold breakfasts  but it s not the same as a warm  crunchy bec muffin   i think it s a keeper and at     it s sold   the model with the timer would be nice  but i m cheep and i can manage to set a timer on my watch if it s that critical     the sandwich maker      
321,5.0,                       easy to use  even my kids can do it  it easily disconnects for cleaning so you don t get areas with buildup  love it      
322,5.0,                       this has been the best purchase for my   year old  he is obsessed with breakfast sandwiches but i never want to make them  now he can do it himself and he wants to make it for everyone  it does take quite a bit of time to make more than one with just the single though we ve learned to let the egg cook a few minutes before putting the top bread on or it will be soggy      
323,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband for christmas  he absolutely loves it and uses it for breakfast everything morning  definitely worth the money ect     
324,5.0,                       funny how a simple product that provides tasty food gets so much hype  and this device deserves all of that hype  easy to use  easy to clean up afterwards without all the bowls and pans needed otherwise  and the breakfast sandwich was better than any restaurant version because i put exactly what i wanted in it  and finally all the positive and   star reviews on this product are legit imo      
325,5.0,                       love it  very easy to use and clean  it is very small appliance but it cooks you the perfect breakfast sandwich  i would recommend get the double one      
326,5.0,                       i was dubious  for    bucks  works great get some pastrami slices at the deli  get some baked ham slices  same place  get some cheese singles  get a biscuit cutter just smaller than the diameter of the cooking chamber  cut yourself some rounds  make a stack  ham  swiss  or whatever cheese you like  pastrami  cheese  split your english muffin   place the stack on the bottom one  plug in your sandwich maker  get the egg out  some salt  pepper  parmesan  cheese  beat with a fork  when the light turns green  give it about another    seconds or a minute   open up  put the meat cheese stack in the bottom  close center section  pour in egg  put top english on  close up  say  hey google  set a timer for four and one half minutes  perfect breakfast sandwich   i precut the cheese and meet stacks and keep them in a container in the fridge  a       
327,5.0,                       takes approximately   minutes after everything is prepared  egg  cheese  bacon  sausage etc  cooks thoroughly  i use the unit   times per week and absolutely love it  no more sodium enhanced frozen breakfast sandwiches      
328,5.0,                       made my first sandwich today and it was wonderful   only problem was me  i forgot to put the muffin top on the bottom  but it still tasted great  just was not perfect     last nght i plugged it  along with my single serve coffee maker  into an alexa controlled smart plug  preloaded everything but the egg  and in the morning said  alexa  turn on breakfast   by the time i got in there it was nearly preheated  the coffee was ready  i took out the top muffin  broke in the egg  replaced the top and said  alexa  set a timer for       minutes    breakfast is served      
329,5.0,                       let me just say that i had high expectations with the kind of ratings this thing is getting   i m happy to say everyone else who rates this as a   star is making the same delicious sandwiches i am  and am eating now as i type this review  look at this sandwhich   milton s english muffins nicely toasted and cruchy with just the tiniest amount of pam spray   some deli ham with half a cheese slice and some jalapenos on top   an egg cracked on the plate with the yoke intact someone is outside of my office door right now  what s that    i smell it right here        it s    breakfast    yes i brought this bad boy to work and i am so glad i did   i will buy another for the home   i can t say this any other way   you will love this product if it doesn t work or makes a mess  you are probably doing it wrong           i don t have any issues whatsoever   ok just ate the last bite   wow   the only things i cansee about this product that can be improved on is    timer and    on off switch so that s it   buy this now   oh and put the thinner half of the muffin on the bottom      
330,1.0,                       it burns the bread and doesnt cook the meat  worst buy ever  oh and u better stick with english muffins or small buns because a because a bagel or croissant doesnt fit      
331,1.0,                       this thing can barely fit half a regular sized bagel  the workflow they suggest has you sitting the top bread in uncooked egg  it should really have a top compartment for the bread to cook separately that then drops onto the cooked egg  that drops onto the cooked lower piece of bread  it s also very shallow  a small sausage pattie on top of the lower bagel makes this thing bulge and not work right  now i m just using this to cook the egg into a nice shape  i ll cook the other ingredients separately     
332,5.0,                       i got this yesterday and i ve already made three delicious sandwiches  i made one for my neighbor  she liked it so much that she ordered one yesterday  it is so easy to use and clean up  i was hesitant at first because i didn t understand how dropping the muffin top on top of the raw egg would work  but is worked great every time  the product is small and easy to store  it takes about   minutes to preheat which gives you enough time to get your ingredients ready and about   minutes to cook  use very little cooking spray  be careful  the sandwich will be very hot      
333,5.0,                       love everything about it  do you want to send your honey or yourself off with a nice hot sandwich  it cooks in four minutes wrap it in foil and go  it is very hot initially and keep it hot for a while      
334,5.0,                       i am absolutely thrilled with this machine   i read a lot of the reviews first  and took their recommendation to let the egg cook a little bit before adding the top muffin bagel etc  usually     minutes without the muffin  then another   with the muffin   cooks perfectly   and it is so easy   if you re using sliced cheese you have to  fold  in the corners to make them fit  but that s no big deal   haven t tried it with shredded cheese yet  but i feel like that might be a little messy   i cook up a pound of bacon in the oven on the weekends so it s always available  so with this machine i just grab a piece of bacon and split it in   pieces and put it on the sammich and voila  a perfect bacon  egg and cheese sammich that blows mcdonald s away   it s very easy to clean   i spray pam butter spray on the egg plate only   nothing sticks at all   usually i just wipe the whole thing down with a damp paper towel once it s cooled  but i ve also removed the  innards  and washed them in the sink with no problems   the only negative is that there s no on off switch and no timer     you plug it in to turn it on and vice versa to turn it off  and i have to use my phone to time it   other than that     absolutely thrilled with this purchase      
335,5.0,                       great product  makes breakfast easy  bought for my boyfriend as a gift   he loves it  fun way to make breakfast and easy cleanup  highly recommend for any breakfast lover   great product to use and then eat on the go      
336,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                         i ve been using this breakfast sandwich maker for over a year  and i really do love it  whenever family or friends visit and happen to spend the night  they all ask me for breakfast sandwiches the next morning because they know how great they are i will say  however  that there are some tricks to really getting the ultimate experience with this maker  lucky for you  i ve made a video to share all i ve learned from my trial and errors  so you can go straight from unboxing to impressing yourself and your friends with the perfect breakfast sandwich hope you re able to enjoy this little maker as much as my family does ps  if you d like to learn how to make the perfect breakfast burrito  visit this link  https   www amazon com review r rpb  qezn   ref cm cr rdp perm     
337,5.0,                       this is a must have  i love this thing  super easy to use    minutes for the best egg sandwich  longer if you use onions  made that mistake      
338,3.0,                       not bad  but seemes small to me  i bought mine through amazon and came with no box or instructions   i went to the manufacturer website and printed the owners manual the only problem i had was with the first egg i cooked  the whites stuck to the slide plate a little  i learned to use a little nonstick spray first works with canadian bacon well  this morning i used sliced sandwich ham and cheddar  a little messy  but turned out well  let the egg cook all the way before you top with cheese  i added mine a little early preheat time isnt too long      min  this cooker is good for on the run and dont want to make a big production  i plan on trying a bagel  pre toast  and pre cooked sausage patties      
339,4.0,                       this is a reasonably neat little kitchen gadget  i put my english muffins in the toaster and while those are toasting i lay   half slices of turkey bacon or a sausage patty on the bottom plate  it s hot as a skillet and acts like one  the only real flaw is the egg comes out wider than the muffin  but it s still delicious      
340,5.0,                       make a variety  experiment with canadian bacon  ham  bacon crumbles  etc  also different cheeses  recommend delay putting cheese in until near the end of cooking time  as the sandwich maker gets very hot and cheese can become completely melted into unrecognizable substance       
341,5.0,                       this product is totally worth every cent of it s price of          my wife and i could not believe how incredible the sandwiches are that come out of this machine   using fresh ingredients  as opposed to what you might get in some fast food place  makes all the difference in the world   the sandwiches are awesome   clean up is also very easy and quick   the only drawback is that each sandwich takes about   minutes to cook and so if you have a crowd of people waiting for sandwiches  you might want to buy several of these machines      
342,5.0,                       i like the fact that it works as advertised  there are no downsides to its operations  and the instructions are very clear  it is well worth the cost note of caution  try to find the minimum amount of time to fry the egg      minutes   do not use the     minute recommendation  because the muffin will get crunchy      
343,5.0,                       this product is absolutely everywhere  amazon  target  walmart  marshall s and it is an absolute joy to own when i purchased my first one for the dorm room it was a gimmick and a joke  little did i know i was going to be running my very own short order diner when it came to playing fifa with the boys or having late night netflix and bec s it has been stolen countless times and i have replaced it twice  during the periods of when the glorious hamilton beach breakfast sandwich maker was stolen it was some of my lowest times  i moved out of the state of new jersey because if i couldn t represent my home with its state sandwich then what else could the great nj offer to me  i rented an apartment in bushwick to try and forget my troubles eventually the stolen machines made it back and i now have the firepower to feed a room of    in about    minutes i couldn t be happier many people say you don t know how many friends you have until you win the lottery i don t think people know what its like in college when you are known as the guy with the bec  bacon egg and cheese for the uninitiated  maker and inflatable hot tubi also purchased a few of these for white elephant christmas and they were the absolute most stolen items during those get togethers      
344,5.0,                       alton brown might hate your existence  little breakfast sandwich maker  but i adore you i use mine a lot  especially to make a quick breakfast to go for me and for the one other person leaving the house  to eat in the car on the way to work   but i can see how this could easily end up in a cabinet next to the waffle maker  juicer  tortilla warmer  banana slicer  cat food crisper  water dryer  lettuce shaper  if i had to make sandwiches for a family or for a gaggle of whiny kids i d say no way  now  maybe if i had the two at a time version   it also can be a bit unwieldy and it s easy to burn oneself  but not only am i willing to suffer a little bit for my breakfast  i have developed a system so i don t get burned or make a mess with escaping ingredients  i also love egg and cheese sandwiches on english muffins  so as long as that holds true i m loyal to my maker      
345,5.0,                       frustrating  because i didn t know how long to cook my egg   came out yummy   thank you for posting directions   really enjoy my sandwich maker   you can even use it to make sandwiches at lunch and dinner      
346,5.0,                       bought this for my husband as he likes mcdonald s sausage mcmuffin with egg  he precooks a sausage patty and then will place in sandwich maker which takes approx   minutes to warm up  add   large egg to cook along with an english muffin  when the light comes back on  the sandwich usually is done      
347,1.0,                       bought this because i love me some breakfast sandwiches and being able to cook it all at once seemed awesome  bought it and tried it out   times  first of all it s super flimsy  so the slightest touch knocks the hot ass plates off and onto you or your counter  second i use egg whites because i am dieting and they re super low calorie  apparently the instructions tell you not to use egg whites     i tried it anyway and it leaked everywhere  in the troubleshooting portion it says if it leaks use a different brand of egg whites  same issue  used a regular egg  same issue  third you can only use small english muffins or mini bagels  which is ok for me but alot of people want a bigger sandwich  it s also a bitch to clean  really disappointed  will be returning      
348,5.0,                       so i got an email about this maker from amazon so i decided to check it out  the reviews are great so i figured i would give it a try and made my daughter in law try it as well  bought hers in red   i love this thing  thanks to a lot of the reviews we already new what to do and not do  so off to the store i went and bought pork sausage  bacon  bagels  small hamburger buns  cheese and eggs  went home and broke out the griddle and fried all of the bacon and sliced up the whole roll of the sausage  made very thin    circles to fit the whole sandwich   plugged in the machine and waited for it to heat up  sprayed it down once heated  put the bottom bagel  cheese and bacon in the bottom well  closed the first section down and put the egg  salt and peppered it then took a tooth pick and semi scrambled the egg  put the top bagel in and closed the lid  well the bagel was what to big and the egg over flowed  even though i din t press it down  so my very first sandwich was a mess  a very delicious mess and so worth it  so by now my son has woken up and wants to try one so he made his with the small hamburger buns and they were the perfect size  no over flow so to make everything easier i went and shaved a little off of each bagel to kill the over flow  works perfect now since we are a busy household i have created individual meals that are frozen so that no matter how many people are there eating we can all have home cooked meals  so i thought why should breakfast be any different  so i got my baggies out and put   bread  bagel  cut down  or hamburger bun    meat  my precooked bacon or sausage that i just fried    piece of cheese  sliced cheese that i have cut into  ths  and put them in the freezer  these work perfectly frozen just take them out and put them into the machine once preheated  so now i have    ready to go sandwiches in the freezer that anyone can just take out and have a hot sandwich in    minutes  i see that people freeze eggs all of the time but i just can t do it  besides eggs last for a month or so so we just keep those in the fridge one other thing i have learned is the top heating element is very hot  so i wait   minutes to put the top bread in  so once i salt and pepper the egg and scramble the egg i close the lid and wait   minutes then put the top bread in otherwise it was coming out a little burnt my daughter in law and son also love theirs i am here to buy another one because the first one was supposed to be for work but i took it home to practice with and my youngest son has claimed it and makes sandwiches every morning      
349,5.0,                       i thought i was through buying kitchen gadgets until i saw this  i used to love grabbing a breakfast muffin when i was out but was often frustrated that i could only have them at certain hours  now i can have one anytime i want  made any way i want it and it is fresh just heat it up  and put your desired ingredients in the maker and minutes later you are eating a wonderful sandwich  no having to cook things separately and with a turn of a handle  the sandwich is assembled for you it is easy to clean  easy to use  and fun for the whole family  it also comes with great ideas for different sandwiches this was my christmas present to myself and i couldn t be happier      
350,5.0,                       i bought this as a christmas present for my boyfriend  we love to get breakfast sandwiches on saturday mornings  but the cost adds up fast  this machine is a life saver  we use it at least twice a week  you only need to spray it with oil or butter every couple of times you use it  the best results with     minutes  mini bagels  crossants  english muffins  bread  sausage   it can use it all  i always make sure to break the yolk and mix it with the whites  best purchase and i would highly recommend   easy and fast breakfast sandwich      
351,5.0,                       got this a few weeks ago and i love it  works just as advertised  very simple to use too  makes sandwiches within minutes   only drawback is i wish the  handles  were cool to the touch   depending on the thickness of your potholders  it take a little coordination to open after cooking  the cooking plates rest on a hinge  sometimes when i have lifted up on the plates to remove the sandwich  they plates fall off the hinge and onto the counter or floor  lift up slowly and you will be fine  otherwise  a great product          update  this is one of the best things i ve ever bought   i use it a lot  this makes great sandwiches   i also bought the single sandwich maker to take to our cabin  i highly recommend in purchasing this product note   another reviewer said it was not good at cooking sausages  i disagree   reviewer didn t go into detail but i never had an issue   now any meat you use must be precooked  it will not cook raw meat  when i used precooked frozen sausage patties  i did put it in the microwave for about    seconds to thaw it out  when i then used it for the sandwich the sausage came out hot      
352,4.0,                       i don t have any real reason why i m giving this   stars instead of    the product is fantastic  was a little confusing to use at first  but it makes breakfast much quicker except for the fact that you have to cook the meat first  i was hoping to throw a piece of pre cooked refrigerated canadian bacon on there but it says you have to cook it first     the egg however is placed in raw  if only it was capable of cooking the meat too that would be great      
353,5.0,                       came right on time  looks great  no broken peices or scuffs either and was packaged with care  the cookbook came with it and was in perfect condition as well  will update when my husband uses this as it is an early fathers day present         
354,5.0,                       this is an amazing kitchen gadget that simply works every time the first one went to college with my son  he used to eat frozen breakfast sandwiches  which were none too healthy  he love this and uses it regularly for a healthier breakfast  the beauty of this device for a college student is it comes apart easily  see photo  and simply wipes clean after using his several times i received one for my birthday  i ve used it for breakfast and lunch tip     be sure to spray with a cooking oil at least the first few times you use it  your egg will stick if you don t do this  it seems to get  seasoned  after a while so that cooking oil is not needed all of the time tip     use english muffins  yes  biscuits will work  but english muffins fit perfectly and honestly seem to taste the best when warmed in this device tip     use any leftover meat you have  i ve sliced up grilled pork  beef and baked chicken  ham is especially delicious      
355,5.0,                       my wife won t let me buy kitchen uni taskers but this is a good one  i ve been using this two to three times per week for the past three months and i am very happy with it  if you follow the instructions you will get a perfect egg sandwich  an english muffin is the perfect size for it  will also work nicely with a bagel   it is also very easy to clean      
356,5.0,                       so easy to use and our breakfast sandwiches came out great the first time we used it   we know this will be something we use quite a bit  highly recommend      
357,5.0,                       ok this thing is simply amazing    throw a english muffin inside little salt  pepper  cheddar cheese and an egg and you think your eating an eggmcmuffin from mcdonald s   if your on the fence don t be    this thing rocks        
358,5.0,                       my husband flipping loves this thing  he won t stop talking about it to his co workers  family and friends  he even brought it out on xmas morning at my parents house and made sandwiches for everyone  they were amazing breakfast sandwiches and now everyone talks about them  worth it      
359,5.0,                       bought this for my husband so i can make him breakfast sandwiches before he goes to work  it is some of the best money i spent on here i did see that a big issue was the egg oozing out of the sides    there is a simple solution for that  dont press down on the top of the maker and the pressure wont ooze the egg out  i do wish it had an on and off switch though rather than ha ing to plug and un plug it      
360,5.0,                       i feel like my breakfast world has been revolutionized with this gadget  i read a lot of the reviews about this product before i purchased it and decided to just go for it  my husband and i sometimes spend      on breakfast sandwiches a week on our drive into work  i got this around thanksgiving and i was soooo excited to try it out that i could not wait until the next morning to try it  that night we had breakfast sandwiches for dinner    they were amazing  i put turkey and italian truffle cheese in mine and i felt like i was the first person in history who invented breakfast for all of mankind other reviewers reported issues with the eggs leaking out and i did find that if i tried to make my sandwich too magical the eggs would leak a tiny bit  for example i put the muffin on the bottom with thicker sliced cheese    slices of canadian bacon and a small  unfrozen  turkey sausage patty  i then put the egg in the egg circle with more cheese with the muffin top and when i closed the top a little bit spilled out  no big deal  it cooked to the outside rim and i just wiped it off when i was done cooking my sandwich  only   egg is needed to the sandwich    could make it leak as well  i keep a shot glass of toothpicks near the maker so i can poke the yolk and just put in the compost with the shells i loved this product so much that i bought one for my sister for her birthday and one for my secret santa at work  on day   of secret santa i wrapped up a can of pam olive oil spray and left it on this desk  day   i drew a smiley face and put a mini santa hat on an egg   i realized in knick of time that secret santa should tell him the egg wasn t hard boiled  i heard he was planning to crack it on his desk and eat it as a snack  that would have been messy   but pretty funny  on day   i gave him   english muffin in a ziplock bag with a fancy bow  on reveal day he came in to find the beautiful sandwich maker with a big bow on his desk  he was so excited and once he found out i was the gift giver i gave the office a demo on how to use it like i was on an infomercial  and when i said  clean up is a snap   i really meant it  he loved the gift the only thing i would change is that it does not have an automatic shut off   on my hour commute to work i couldn t remember if i had shut off the device and visions of burning down my new house were dancing in my head  i went home a little later to find that i did unplug it  but now i do something out of the ordinary when unplugging it so i remember that i unplugged it  sometimes it is touching my nose   times or doing a shimmey while saying  i am the goddess of breakfast      
361,5.0,                       this thing works great  i had been microwaving my morning egg and shoving it between an english muffin toasted in my toaster  unfortunately though  sometimes the egg explodes and leaves egg white sparkles all over my microwave  this takes some time to clean up   i went to amazon and came across this product  and such a low price  i ordered this morning i cooked my first egg sandwich  it turned out perfectly  no learning curve  it is better than the microwaved egg and super easy to use  bonus  it is very small  takes up little counter space      
362,5.0,                       this is one fine machine  my wife love it  it does an amazing job in making sandwich       
363,2.0,                       no  on  buttonleaks eggegg  english muffin is hardly enough room overcooks the english muffins  top is hard before the egg is cooked they can do much better        
364,2.0,                       fun to use once in awhile  but too much trouble with all the moving parts      
365,5.0,                       so happy i bought this  now i just wish i bought the one that makes   at a time because i made one for a few coworkers now everyone wants one of my breakfast sandwiches  can definitely be made healthy or unhealthy nice and crunchy on the outside  turns out perfect every time      
366,4.0,                       it works great  the sandwiches are quick  easy  and delicious  cleaning is easy  i shorted it one star however because the way the product is presented in the illustrations lead me to believe you could use it with pancakes and what not  that s slightly true but you must use store bought  pre made pancakes that might fit  i haven t tried this yet and may be a little over critical in this case but i don t feel it s quite as versatile as they would have you believe  that said it seems to be a great product and if you re in the market i assume you ll be very happy with this item  money well spent english muffin    egg  generous cheddar cheese  and   slice of canadian bacon          ymmv     
367,2.0,                       this item is not worth the cost  it is cheaply made  i suggest you do not buy this item        
368,5.0,                       this device is great   makes a very nice breakfast sandwich with absolutely minimal effort   i use this every weekend  it s oatmeal   days per week   hey  i m old         gets the egg cooked to my liking   as noted elsewhere  american cheese tends to turn to slippery goo  so we use grated cheddar or swiss and it comes out better   the machine does not leave any kind of after taste   cleaning is         excellent choice      
369,3.0,                       i ordered this breakfast sandwich maker for my boyfriend as an early christmas present after he mentioned wanting one earlier in the year  it is a great  small kitchen gadget that is easy to use  and it takes up very little kitchen and cupboard space  the heated plates on the gadget get extremely hot  and the top plastic on my product ended up getting melted  that is the only reason for my   star review  for something that gets super super hot  you would think they would make it from a material that withstands the heat a little better  as to not become a fire hazard  overall  i am satisfied with the product  but i will be returning it  to get a new one      
370,3.0,                       this works as described  this is the second one i have purchased  the first got lost in my move  anyway this one has an odd smell to it  i thought that smell would go away overtime but it hasn t    so that is a bummer     
371,5.0,                       lol i m not sure why it gives the option to put stars for flavor       however it does what it says and works like a charm only thing negative is it takes a long time to actually make the sandwich   but it does work in the kids like to use it     
372,5.0,                       this sandwich maker works just as described   makes delicious hot sandwiches fast with very easy cleanup   it also does not take up a lot of counter space   great for older teens to make their own breakfasts quickly before school in the morning   it s fun too to come up with new and different sandwich varieties      
373,5.0,                       i have used this breakfast sandwich maker many times now  it is easy to clean and use  if you use bagels be sure to buy mini or little bigger as the larger bagels won t fit  one word of caution  be careful opening it after your sandwich is done because it is hot and when you pull the middle tray out it can be a tad wobbly  handle with care      
374,5.0,                       layout your egg sandwich and close the lid    minutes later you have a complete breakfast      
375,3.0,                       it works fine but  an english muffin is just a bit too small so the egg runs over a little  a thin bagel is pretty good   a little tight squeeze and it fits in  bread is square so that s out  and  it s a pain to clean  the egg gets stuck in the little cracks and you ll need a toothbrush to get it all out  i do like how you can quickly assemble your sandwich and walk away for     minutes until it s done  you don t have to stand over it but be sure to set your timer      
376,4.0,                       i m not sure why they didn t put a timer on this that beeps when the sandwich is ready   other than that it is a fun appliance   you can throw together a breakfast sandwich very quickly   i ve made them with pancakes  english muffins  and even frozen waffles   i ve used regular sausage  veggie sausage  eggs  and egg beaters  and all versions have turned out well   my personal preference is to wait a minute or so before putting the top bun on so that the egg cooks a bit before  otherwise the egg will cook into the bun    i also like to put the cheese on about a minute before the sandwich is done  otherwise i find that the cheese makes a mess      
377,5.0,                       i love breakfast but hate oatmeal and cereal so quick breakfasts are hard to find  this little sandwich maker is super easy to pop together while i get ready for work so i can grab it on my way out  really easy to clean and very easy to use  it seems to burn every time i use a bagel so i would recommend just sticking to english muffins     
378,1.0,                       the sandwich maker literally fell apart the first time it was used on its first sandwich  followed directions diligently  loading it required using mitts due to the very hot handles  and removing the sandwich was mightily difficult  the plates were extremely hot and i had to lift each one independently in order to get the sandwich out  my guess is that the item was broken to start with and springs were missing that would ease the process of loading and removing  what a waste of money      
379,5.0,                       good unit   a little tricky getting the finished sandwich out without burning your fingers   the unit gets pretty hot  i found a pair if grill mitts worked well      
380,5.0,                       probably my favorite gadget in my kitchen   makes the most perfect breakfast sandwich in less than   minutes   easy to clean too   highly recommend      
381,4.0,                       it makes sandwiches really well  but for some reason i notice a strange almost artificial taste to the finished product  maybe the non stick coating   dunno      
382,5.0,                       bought this for the wife for her birthday  had been eyeing it the past few years just never pulled the trigger   my wife routinely grabs a fast food breakfast on her way to work so i thought this might help her break the habit the unit couldn t be easier to work  no tricky buttons  no flashing clocks  simply plug it in and it heats up follow the directions  put your breakfast materials in the sandwich maker in the proper order  finish getting dressed  and in   minutes you ve got a fresh breakfast sandwich   wife was skeptical about what kind of hellish concoction would be produced  but alas she tried it and all was right with the world has saved us money over the past few months by limiting trips to the golden arches  kids have enjoyed the sandwiches as well all in all a pretty good buy  super easy to clean which was my big concern when buying  if this sucker ever dies i would definitely get another      
383,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend  i also bought a breakfast sandwich maker cookbook  we have enjoyed using the sandwich maker and the cookbook to make different kinds of hot sandwiches  the appliance is easy to use and easy to clean  it only takes a few minutes to make sandwiches with this appliance  we love it  i will be purchasing more of these appliances as gifts for friends and family who also enjoy kitchen gadgets and warm sandwiches      
384,5.0,                       seriously i think i went through an entire pack of english muffins the  st day i had this device  breakfast sandwiches for all the meals       significantly reduces the amount of effort required to make a breakfast sandwich  esp if you cook your bacon in bulk  epic meal time style  and keep a bag of cooked bacon in the fridge  significantly less mess time effort cooking ability required vs making them manually  this device has significantly improved my quality of life now there is no impediment to me getting drunk and deciding at   am i want a bacon egg and cheese sandwich      
385,5.0,                       excellent for making sandwiches  i use this for my daily breakfast and can be used in a variety of other ways  cooks an egg very quickly and is very easy to clean if you follow the directions  a handy device to keep in any kitchen      
386,2.0,                       i wanted to try this because of the appeal of a quick breakfast with a quarter of the fat of a drive thru  i plugged it in on a saturday and waited for it to preheat  and waited  and waited  and waited  waited about    minutes for the green light to flip on  never happened  so i just made a sandwich the conventional way and took about    minutes i may try it again but right now it seems like a ridiculously slow way to do something that is pretty fast and easy  the design also seems problematic  i didn t get to the part where you put anything in the machine but i can totally see how it could leak may try it again but probably just going to chuck it  i wouldn t buy it  these reviews don t match the products     
387,5.0,                       honestly  i bought this for a gift and was blown away at the ease of use and cleaning  makes a delicious sandwich everytime  egg and meat always fully cooked after recommended time baking  the egg plate is removable and easy to clean  it practically all wipes off with a damp towel after use      
388,5.0,                       this makes really good sandwiches put anything you want in them we use it just about every morning the kids love it it s easy to take apart and clean      
389,5.0,                       it is small and comes packaged in a small box  but it s huge in possibilities for quick and easy breakfast sandwiches  we first bought one for our daughter and son in law  but they liked it so much we bought one for ourselves  it s easy to store  actually does what it says it will do  and comes in very handy for any meal of the day  especially a late dinner when we don t want a big meal i think someone else commented on not being able to fit a bagel into the unit  if not  i ll say it    bagels don t fit  that has been the only disappointment and easily gotten over with the great variety of english muffins available      
390,3.0,                       my kids love this little thing  we ve only had it a few days  but they ve used it a lot already  trying out different combinations  it toasts really well  doesn t get so hot that we worry about severe burns  and it cooks well  only complaint is that a bit of the raw egg oozes out every single time because of how it s made  we put a little metal tray beneath it to keep that of the counter  but i wish they d improve the design to fix this      
391,5.0,                       love  love  love it   so easy to spray   plug in to heat  get english muffin  cheese  canadian bacon and egg ready   put it all in   set timer for four and one half minutes   and it comes out perfect every time   even saves calories because i don t have to butter my bread anymore   i ve used bacon  sausage  cooked thin    and canadian bacon and they all came out yummy   it s so easy to clean   also  buy it   already     
392,5.0,                       if i could give this eight stars i would  i recently started making mcdonald s egg mcmuffin  s  and then i found this and i was so excited because it makes it so much easier than making them in a pan  clean up as easy just wipe it off literally with a paper towel  i bought one for my son for christmas and even he can work it      
393,5.0,                       this is seriously my favorite thing in my kitchen  considering i purchased this a year ago and i still feel this way  is saying something about this must have kitchen appliance  i love it so much  i even gifted it to   others and they mention how much they love it as well  this allows for me to make a yummy egg sandwich especially on my many rush mornings  i ll get up in a hurry and plug it in  which automatically turns it on   i ll then only need maybe   sec until the green light turns on which allows me to quickly grab an egg  and the basics for the sandwich es i plan to make  place the bottom bread cheese meat options  drop top part of sandwich maker where i crack the egg and place top bread  close lid and wait maybe     min  if i can lift the top bread and the egg releases easy than i know it s done  all in all  i average  min per sandwich  this has saved me so much time on last min meal options like late work shifts or when you just want to go home and eat something decent but not spend   min preparing  highly recommend for those on the go  busy households  singles or couples  or simply just egg lovers  let s just say  i recommend every kitchen should have one haha   i would seriously shake the first person s hand who came up w this invention if i had the option haha  clearly i m a fan of this device       
394,5.0,                       why i like my amazing sandwich makerit s easy   if you are struggling to get out the door this is you go to breakfast   i  turn it on  grab my coffee mug make myself a cup of coffee with my other favorite device in my kitchen  my keurig  then i grab all the ingredients i need for my sammy  english muffin bread choice here is critical  you can t use trader joes bc it s too thick  i was using thomas which was great until i banned thomas since they put  azodicarbonamide in their bread  now finally found sprouts organic english muffins toast crispy and are awesome  food for thought  that s also in mcdonalds egg mcmuffin  which of course would be why you need to take the five minutes to make your own sandwich with ingredients you put together   clean up is simple  my only room for improvement would be an auto off feature as i accidentally forgot to unplug it and left it on all day  like i said i m not always on my a game first thing in the morning     haha  anyways i highly recommend the product bc of its ease and the way i get a perfectly cooked egg every time and the muffin is always perfectly toasted and the sandwich is steaming hot  so it s still warm by the time i get to the car to take my first bite   enjoy      
395,2.0,                       it takes getting used to it that s for sure  i have been burned a couple times and will be burned again  it is difficult to tell when the sandwich is done  the green light is confusing      
396,5.0,                       this thing is super fun and handy  my kids and i  and my girlfriend  love starbucks breakfast sandwiches like the bacon gouda  you can replicate this at home  made   of these day     used english muffins instead of sb ciabatta bread  but otherwise it was great    minutes per sandwich of course you can do this with your existing equipment   panini press  or being careful with a griddle or pan  but if you know what you want  this thing makes it super easy      
397,5.0,                       breakfast has never been so friggen easy   i now have a morning routine  first thing  plug it in to turn it on  i defrost my sausage patty in the microwave for    seconds   cut english muffin in half  pull an egg out of the fridge  and pour my cup of coffee   click  the light goes green  time to throw in the goods  english muffin on the bottom  sprinkle some feta on it  place the sausage patty on top of the feta  close the middle section down  crack an egg in the egg section  toss the top of the english muffin on top of the egg  close the lid  turn timer for   and a half minutes  go and start my car to let it warm up  and by the time i m back my breakfast is ready  pop my delicious and perfectly cooked breakfast sandwich out  unplug the machine          ohh yeahhhh all done  from start to finish i have warmed my car made my breakfast and am out the door in less than ten minutes  best of all nothing really to clean before i go  the center section is very easily and quickly cleaned with dinners dishes and ready to go for my next morning   i like this thing so much i purchased two more of these units for my brother and my father  their feed back is the same as mine   i  would call this a kitchen necessity       
398,5.0,                       bought as a gift for my step dad  he uses it every morning and absolutely loves it  i have received no complaints      
399,1.0,                       returned mine before using   too many moving parts and hot surfaces to burn myself first thing in the morning   don t want to have to be be an engineer to get a sandwich   i don t see how the egg would not leak everywhere  as discussed in other reviews      
400,4.0,                       makes easy and excellent breakfast sandwiches  i drop everything in right after starting my morning coffee and they are both ready at the same time  wish they had an option to buy larger cylinder sizes for other breads bagels  one of my favorite recipes is to make a sort of frittata sandwich  i cook the muffin top alone for a few minutes because the egg compartment will be too full  set the muffin top aside  place the buttered muffin bottom and cheese like you normally would and then place beaten egg mixture and anything else you want in the top and close the unit  cook for       to   minutes  the egg will have a nice baked looking crust on top  remove and place the muffin top back on  you can throw more cheese  or spread on at this point if you want it  delicious  and something you won t get at any fast food joint      
401,4.0,                       i m not a cook  but i have to say  so far  it s been working great for me   it really can t be much easier   i haven t gone fancy yet   i thought it was somewhat strange to throw on the egg  which i just use the shell to poke the yoke with and it works just fine   but throwing on the top of the muffin onto the egg that hasn t cooked seemed strange      but you know what  it cooks the egg great   it s king of cooked into the muffin  which holds them together better   i ve used canadian bacon which works great because it s about the right size   i ve also used sausage patty s  both already cooked of course  but the patty s are tiny   maybe next time i ll have to use a few of them and cut them to fill the whole bottom of the muffin it heats up fast  so it s not exactly   minutes   that doesn t count the warm up time   it takes     minutes to do it s thing once it is warmed up   the first time  the egg was just a bit runny  not fully cooked and you know what  it was still great   no need to go to mcdonald s to get your fix the one negative is there s no on off switch   so it s plug in  pull the cord when done   why that is   when i have more time  i can start trying other things with it      
402,3.0,                       wasn t thrilled with the results   it s ok but i wouldn t buy again   will try other sandwich ideas tho      
403,5.0,                       love this sandwich maker   my sister has one and introduced me to it when we were on vacation   i immediately ordered one and use it all the times   it s so easy to use and easy to clean up      
404,5.0,                       bought this while drinking  best decision ever     
405,4.0,                       this is a handy little sandwich maker   it is definitely best with english muffins   i tried bagels  but they are too big and burned   you do have to wait for it to warm up  and for such a small surface it seems like it takes a long time   clean up is easyit works just as advertised   throw in the ingredients  let it cook  slide out a fun easy breakfast sandwich   my teenage son loves to use this for his breakfast and if it takes a gadget to get him to eat something i ll take it   also saving me money on the frozen breakfast sandwiches he used to have me buy  he likes these better      
406,1.0,                       requires specific size eggs and prep of meat and veggies prior to using in sandwich maker  just as easy to make on stove with fewer steps  plan to return      
407,5.0,                       good innovative product  makes a nice quick breakfast sandwich that saves time and it s very easy to clean      
408,5.0,                       you can honestly make thr sandwich faster using the stove  you also need to use oven mitts  which is hard because the cooker is small and mitts are bulky   but it gets super hot so its a must  it works as intended but its not very efficient when all is said and done     
409,5.0,                       if you re a breakfast sandwich fan this thing is awesome  it s saving me so much money     
410,3.0,                       my only problem is the egg and top price of bread cook together so the bread is under cooked      
411,5.0,                       this is my third purchase of this sandwich maker   i wore out the the inside egg holder in the first two   probably from the dishwasher and non stick spray   i now wash by hand and just use a small amount of butter on each plate   ordering new plates from hamilton beach  plus the shipping is as much as this a new sandwich maker   makes great breakfast sandwiches with any ingredients you want   i even poor egg beaters in it for a healthier sandwich   just don t use to much or it will overflow and run out   love the machine      
412,5.0,                       i want to be clear  i m not a bot or anyone who was paid to write a review  i bought this and really liked it so i wanted to let others know  i just used this and made   breakfast sandwiches for me and my dad and it was delicious   i can t emphasize how important it is to read the instructions carefully and follow them before use in order to get the sandwiches to turn out good  also  you have to preheat the device for a while for quality outcome  in my experience   if you don t like reading instructions  bc they can be boring  confusing  and annoying sometimes  i get it  watching the  how to use    on youtube is also really helpful  there was a reviewer on here that uploaded a video that was excellent too      
413,5.0,                       this breakfast sandwich maker has been well loved since taking it out of the package  my fianc  gave it to me as a gift after hearing raves about it from a coworker  and now we see why   if you have prepared meat  like a frozen sausage patty or bacon cooked earlier in the week   then this makes a    minute gourmet breakfast from start to finish  all you have to do is cut the bread  add meat   cheese  crack an egg and wait  the quality for us that really brings this product up from a  four star breakfast maker  the likes of waffle irons and griddles to a  five star essential first meal tool  is the quick cleanup  the removable section is dishwasher safe and the non stick outer cooking areas need only a quick wipe  too often had i chosen a bowl of cereal over the hassle of scrubbing a larger cooking utensil  but now i break my fast in style      
414,5.0,                       this is a great product   we have made sandwiches everyday since i got it  very easy to use and the sandwiches are delicious   easy to clean as well      
415,3.0,                       not sure the thought process here  but there is nothing to separate the egg from the bread above it  it needs a plate above the egg like it has right below it  it is very limiting to use bread that doesn t get ruined by soaking up all the egg but honestly  it is still really cool  very compact  easy to use and easy to clean      
416,5.0,                       this thing is fantastic  toasts the english muffins perfectly  the only challenge i ve faced is finding think sliced canadian bacon for the sandwiches  if you use the thicker sliced stuff  warm it up a little before you start the sandwich otherwise the egg cooks too slow      
417,5.0,                       i think alton brown dissed this as a single tasker  love him     but i disagree   we use this regularly and it works great   our last one eventually died after    years of regular use  but for the cost  it was a great investment      
418,3.0,                       worked great for the first     uses  but now  the liquid egg spills everywhere down the sides and onto the countertop  disappointing as i otherwise love making breakfast sandwiches with this kitchen gadget      
419,5.0,                       i bought this as a gag gift at first but then read all the reviews and felt like maybe it has potential for more than gag gift   this thing is sweeeet  i love making sandwiches with this thing  here s the tip though my wife started doing   wait a little bit to put the top muffin in there  that will get the egg cooked faster and not make the muffin as soggy floating in the egg      
420,4.0,                       i have one on my boat which is about   years old and a newer one at home   the teflon coating on the older one began coming off after the first year   i hope i didn t eat that stuff   ugh   otherwise  i love this invention      
421,5.0,                       i love this   i had to go through a package of english muffins to get this just right for me    i don t cook much   now i microwave my meat pattie for    seconds and cut it into chunks prior to putting it into the sandwich maker   i use less than a half slice of cheese and i set a timer for   minutes and    seconds   i put some butter on the muffin  too   sometimes i add hot sauce to the egg   boy  it is fast and yummy  yes  i would recommend this to anyone who loves an egg sandwich   i am very glad i bought this product      
422,5.0,                       wow   this sandwich maker is a game changer   my morning breakfast routine is so much more sane than before   instead of having to use the toaster for bread  the skillet for eggs  and another skillet for meat  this sandwich maker combines all of the elements in a single appliance   moreover  it is reliable   no surprises  my breakfast sandwiches always come out perfect in   minutes   definitely one of the best purchases i made in           
423,5.0,                       there is a learning curve to this use pam spray just a little bit in between slats  and if you like toasted buns  put them in with no refrigeration  if you want them slightly soft  put them in before you use this  however  bacon doesn t go well with this    makes it a bit chewy  other then that  keep notes what you bake  i e what you like when you make it  the book is more of a guide  sometimes you should try your own end of line     
424,5.0,                       the only downfall is the first few times we used it  the hinged triple ring that you put the sandwich  egg etc  in went flying on the counter   i m sure you will learn  as we did  how to do it without that happening   otherwise  it is super easy to clean and makes great english muffin breakfast sandwiches   i found most bagels are too large and they need to be trimmed in order to work in this breakfast sandwich maker   the english muffins are the perfect size      
425,5.0,                       this was a gift for my boyfriend for christmas   and me    and it was a good idea  makes sandwiches so quick  which is especially helpful when getting ready for work in the morning  the only reason i put   stars for  easy to use  is because i at first didn t realize it came apart so easily  i thought the parts were clipped in and not just sitting  so at one point when i lifted it  it started to come apart  thankfully i was wearing an oven mitt  but that was more operator error  so remember to open it pretty slow when taking the sandwich out  other than that i love that it s so easily taken apart to wash though  makes for a quick clean up once it s cooled down and it s small enough to just be placed in the cabinet until next use      
426,1.0,                       most poorly designed kitchen gadget ever made   egg spills out almost every time   i have chickens   and sell eggs   i am using the smallest eggs my hens produce   the rings   that lay inside the machine are not stable enough to stay in place when lifting top piece   i see that with a little work this could be a great product  for now on a one to ten scale   i give it a minus     regret i bought it      
427,5.0,                       it s so easy to use  i love it a lot  i bought it for my father but he doesn t get to use it often but i use it all the time and i love it      
428,3.0,                       the egg plate you slide gets stuck on the handles in the front   the plate handle gets stuck on the front handles  i have to open the top half so the plate will slide and complete the sandwich  i had one of these in the past and never needed to do this it does make a sandwich though      
429,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband last christmas because he likes to have good breakfast before he goes to work  it s really easy to use and you can even do something else while your food is  cooking   it does t take up so much space and can easily be stored away  clean up is a breeze as well  definitely recommended      
430,5.0,                       this thing is fantastic it works great  but i will admit it works better with english muffins over anything else  super easy to clean i keep it next to my toaster      
431,5.0,                       washed it up out of the box   applied cooking spray on cold maker since that directive was not clear   after reading other reviews i let it set   min  after green light went on   used classic english muffin  canadian bacon  egg  and american cheese   allowed to cook for   min   the product turned out perfect  better then my local fast food joint  freshness was probably the most likely reason   the only thing i ll change is to add pepper to my egg   the only problem may be limiting myself to only one sandwich      
432,5.0,                       nice  not as small as i thought it would be but not huge  still good  came in a velvet soft bag      
433,5.0,                       there is nothing i can say about this item that others have not already written   this product is awesome   i originally bought this because i was tired of eating steel cut oats with a scoop of protein powder in the morning   it does so much for your morale to eat something that taste good   it will keep you moving and working harder if you feel good   finally i warm up the machine  put everything in the machine and it s finished by the time i finished brushing my teeth also since i changed my workout up a little i ve also cut my calories too by using this   i also i don t buy as much syntha   now  so that saves me a little bit of money      
434,4.0,                       the egg sandwich maker does it s job but it takes too long  you have to pre heat it first  about   minutes  then make it which takes another      minutes    not good when you re in a hurry  it ll take less time to actually just cook on the stove  it s good for kids to use and making an egg sandwich at work  it does it s job but just takes a bit too long      
435,5.0,                       this lil sandwich maker brought me life it s easy and it s really ready in   minutes    i bought this lil sandwich maker whenever i realized we would be spending more time at home  instead of using a toaster for your bread  a pan for your egg and ham you have a lil thing that does it all for you  energy efficient  fast and easy    mouths fed in less than    minutes for breakfast  so easy my    year old knows how to use it   big pointer follow the directions on the book  and use a timer      
436,4.0,                       english muffins yes  bagels to big but can trim them  when using bagels bottom half fits ok  but found not to use top half until after egg cooks first  otherwise egg slides out until cooked  thickness of sandwich does matter when cooking  so overstuffing not recommended  why bagels don t work well   otherwise works really well with sausage patties  porkroll and small strips of bacon  scramble egg  no milk  works also      
437,5.0,                       i bought some english muffins  they fit perfectly into the space available  canadian bacon slices work great  i also used some jimmy dean sausage patties  they re a little tall for this cooker  but if you smash them down a little bit first they fit pretty well  clean up is super easy  it takes about    minutes total if you do your prep while it pre heats  i ve only used it a few times  we ll see how things hold up in the long term      
438,2.0,                       loved it at first and it makes great sandwiches but after a while the food started to taste like the metal in the maker or something  can t stand the taste  i don t use it anymore
