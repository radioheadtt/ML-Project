0,1.0,                       i have been very dissatisfied with this watch  the first one i was sent didn t work straight out of the box  amazon sent me a replacement without any hassle  but i have worn it since november    months ago  and it is already losing battery power in one day  far cry from the     day battery life promised by the advertisement      
1,2.0,                       this is pretty disappointing  doesn t detect my heart beat  doesn t track my sleep  doesn t recognize when i m asleep  and i ve tried everything they suggest in their website  i ve placed it loosely  tight  above the wrist bone  below it  i ve even placed the sensor on the back of my wrist hoping it d detect my pulse but no  only here and there it catches it  on top of that  their app doesn t sync with apple health  and if you want it to  you have to buy third party apps that cost crazy amounts i will be returning unless they offer me a better solution      
2,5.0,                       just got my new fitbit charge   about a week ago   so far  so good   a little bit of a learning curve i had a charge   for the last   years   the charge   is a little different   one of the reasons i got this was because of the gps built into to the watch w o having to use your phone   i also love that it is water resistant so you can swim  shower etc w o having to remove it   so i am very happy with these updated features   everything else is pretty good too   but  i will update my review after i have had it a bit longer      
3,3.0,                       this device works well some days and then is highly inaccurate other days   today  says i did seven flights of stairs when i have actually done none   the reminder doesn t work consistently  especially when i m working on the computer   seems to think i m sleeping even though it s the middle of the day   steps seem to be quite accurate   heart rate is not very accurate  although  i m in atrial fibrillation a great deal of the time so it seems to have trouble counting my heart beat   i have a pulse oximeter  so i know it s recording my heart rate sometimes    beats per minute lower than it really is   good luck with daylight savings time changes   it s now telling me my heart rate and steps an hour in the future even though the time on the watch is correct   if you re looking to this device to monitor your health you might want to rethink getting this device      
4,1.0,                       don t buy the fitbit charge    the gps accuracy is terrible  the attached screenshots show my tracks in strava based on the fitbit charge   and the google pixel   phone  as you can see  when i used the pixel   phone the gps accuracy is much higher resulting in a more consistent and more true track  the fitbit charge   produces incorrect results  just spend another couple hundred and get a garmin instead  the gps will actually be accurate      
5,2.0,                       worked pretty good  every now and then it would stop sending me my notifications from my phone  i d have to unpair it and add it again  then last week it just fell off my wrist  one side of the band disconnected from the screen part  now today it has done the same thing  but a piece of it broke off with it and cant be fixed  i m out      now  thanks fitbit      
6,2.0,                       wildly inaccurate   i bought the charge   because it made it in a lot of the  best of  lists  on sites that   surprise   get paid if you click the links  but was immediately disappointed   if you just want something cheap to wear on your wrist to possibly motivate you to exercise  it s fine   if you want something to give you an accurate picture of the things you re tracking  go with a polar or garmin or apple watch i compared the charge   against a good chest strap hrm and caught the charge off by as much as    bpm   often times i would check it and it wouldn t even be reading my heart rate   and yes  i tried adjusting position and tightness the touchscreen and the  back  button on the charge   are both clumsy and unresponsive  especially if your fingers are wet from  you know  sweat   the interface is  imo  ugly and not intuitive the app is polished and shiny  which is why people like it  but there s not a whole lot of substance to it   data sync to apps like myfitnesspal is dismal the one thing the charge   has going for it is that it s relatively cheap  but for another       bucks you can get a tracker from better brands that is way more accurate and packed with way more useful features      
7,3.0,                       i formerly had a charge   which was simple to use  after it wore out  my decision to replace it with a charge   was motivated by the  activity minutes  feature  i do not use the gps function on the watch as i always have my cel phone with me   the charge   is very awkward to use  it requires swiping left right  up down and tapping the face and tapping the side  some activities  such as weight lifting no longer show up  the application does not seem to allow the user to find out how many activity minutes they have logged during each day  only the amount for the current day  their may be ways to access this information but who wants to spend hours trying to figure out counter intuitive controls and application  this is frustrating to the point i am considering to replace this new monitor with a different brand      
8,2.0,                       i am updating my review to downgrade from   to   stars   the reminder to move seems buggy   for example  it worked just fine until i changed the notification setting for only weekdays   now i get no notifications   the o  levels while sleeping worked just fine until i was outside my return window   now it doesn t work   not a huge deal but now i don t know if my charge   has a defective sensor or if there s another reason   i find the fitbit troubleshooting to be lacking for this specific issue but appears that maybe only now available with premium   i am going to try the free premium to see if this corrects the issue but honestly  i am not thrilled that something worked and now doesn t   overall  i can t recommend until these buggy issues are resolved my original review i wanted an upgrade from my fitbit zip and bought the charge   after some research   first  i got it on sale for about    less than the current list price   i like the reminders to move every hour  this can be shut off but i think it helps to not remain desk bound for too long   i really like the sleep tracking if for no other reason than to remind myself to go to bed on time   i have some work to do in this area  step tracking is ok and seems consistent for my normal dog walk routes but random steps get added just by moving my arm i like that it comes with two band sizes   although i think for me the large has too much extra and the small feels like it could have another notch or two to be perfect while i like that it has gps tracking  i don t find it to be all that accurate   for example  when using the bicycling mode  distances that i know through other tracking such as mapmyride or my car odometer are just way off through this app  it even randomly stops tracking in portions of my ride    my mph are off too  it is not easy to pause the activity which is why it seems i ve gone much slower than i actually have   gps also drains the battery like crazy   i don t think this feature is a significant advantage over my current mapmyride app so i probably won t use it much speaking of the battery   i like that it can charge in my usb port on computer   it doesn t charge when plugged in a wall charger apparently  which i find strange    and because this fitbit charge   has made me ocd  it really bugs me that the battery never seems to reach      charged   it stays at     forever   i am overall happy with it and might even go for the free trial of the fitbit premium app just to see what i m missing   i hope the battery lasts a good long time      
9,3.0,                       there are reviews you read about tech and you re like  that s      user error  but battery life  across this many reviews  is      not user error  a   hour run or walk regularly drains my battery       i cannot count the number of times i ve gone out with a battery about half full and the fitbit is dead before i m even    minutes in  this is probably the  th fitbit i ve purchased for the family  my  rd  and this is also the worst  i m tempted to go back to my charge    so disappointing      
10,1.0,                       i was so excited to get my charge    i bought it in may      and loved it  the free trial of premium was helpful and i ended up purchasing a year s membership  then just one month after owning my fitbit  the male end of the device broke off so it could not longer connect to the female end of the band  thus making it impossible to wear and use  the fitbit customer service was terrible  i had to call   times before they processed my request to get the fitbit fixed and then it took one month for me to get the new one in the mail  then just   months later the same issue happened again  now  i am without the device for a second time   not only am i unable to use the device but i m unable to use it with my premium membership  again customer service was so unhelpful  i contacted them again and they wanted the same process of returning it  i asked for a full refund of both the device and the membership however they refused on both  i will never buy from this company again which is so sad because i loved the actual data it provided me  i strongly recommend against this company unfortunately      
11,3.0,                       i had problems with setup  at first  it didn t work at all  but after several hours of trial and research  i finally managed to get it working      
12,1.0,                       this is the third fitbit i ve bought  but the initial experience of getting it set up was so bad that i wouldn t recommend buying one  the problem is that it ships with out of date firmware  so the first couple days on the device you just get a message saying you need to update the firmware or the app on your phone  the problem is that on previous versions they had a problem with downloading large updates on day one  so they chose to trickle in the update over a couple of days  without telling what is happening  so for the first two days you just have the frustration of nothing you try working  and having to spend time searching the forums  where i finally found the answer   i almost sent it back  but it finally started working after a few days  basically  no respect for the customer s time or experience  what a joke      
13,2.0,                       overall  the watch functions as one would expect  the big issue i have is that the display is too dim to see outdoors  there are   settings for brightness   dim  normal and auto  the dim setting is actually too dim for indoor use  normal is just too dim to see outdoors  auto doesn t make any difference  this is my second fitbit watch i ve owned  my first was an ionic   absolutely loved it and the screen function was great  so  i expected the same from the charge    big disappointment      
14,3.0,                       i used this product daily to track by cycling and swimming as well as sleep patterns   one thing that bothered me is the swimming  auto detect  frequently didn t work and i had to manually start and stop my swimming   i swim for about     hours every day  fresh water pool  and expected  after a while  it would automatically detect but it still frequently misses the exercise   but the biggest issue i have is it died after     months   luckily it was still under warranty and the fitbit technical staff was very helpful and mailed me a replacement which i received in   days   while i like the service  and the product   disturbed it stopped working after only a few weeks      
15,1.0,                       check out the community board on their website to see     pages of complaints about this charge    and most importantly how the gps tracking does not work  main issue being that it just stops working half way through a run or bike ride  i ve had calls with their customer support over last month or so and they acknowledge its a problem that they are aware of with apple ios  but say they have no solution for now  and wont offer refund  very disappointed      
16,2.0,                       arrived november            the  special edition  band broke today  december             days later  as my husband was walking  thank goodness he felt it slip  it loses the bluetooth connectivity regularly  his     fitpro was way  way better i would not recommend this product to a friend  or even an enemy      
17,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this replaced my prior charge   and worked well for a month   helps track your exercise and sleeping etc  as others have probably noted unfortunately  it started to freak out   it keeps turning on and off rapidly by itself   here is a video of it doing the same while i m not even wearing it other research suggests this is a known defect that requires replacement amazon says that the return window expired yesterday   so for the record  this worked until   day before the return window expired   talk about planned obsolescence      
18,4.0,                       i really like my new fitbit charge   special edition for the most part  it synced very easily  maybe because i already had a charge   connected to my iphone  it looks really nice and came with   sets of bands  i have had it for a couple of months now and am still trying to figure out some of the functions as there are more to this one than my old charge    i really like the gps feature and have it set to only when using the exercise function so the charge battery lasts     days before i have to recharge it  the sleep tracking seems to work great and the gps is good too as long as i have set it up correctly before i go for a walk since i don t have that totally right yet   i gave it   stars only because i still have functions to figure out  i would recommend it if you don t mind being patient about figuring it all out      
19,1.0,                       really loved the fitbit charge   at first   used to have a fitbit alt hr for years and was excited about the new features of the charge    including gps   early on i had to turn blue tooth on and off daily to get the charge   to sync to my phone   this was annoying  but not a deal breaker   however  about one month after first using  the device stopped syncing with my phone completely   i tried every suggestion the fitbit website gives to fix this problem but none of them worked   apparently  there are many people experiencing this problem from reading the help forums online which made me ultimately decide to return the product rather than exchange it for a new one      
20,5.0,                       so far so good  got it as a gift for my bf  i ve got a charge    it works well with his iphone se      and he likes the sleep tracking  though it isnt always too accurate  if he gets up for more than an hour in the night it counts as two different naps rather than a night of sleep  not sure how they could fix that  but        
21,2.0,                       well  if you absolutely need a device to track your sleep  then this is it  other than that  the accuracy is way off from the step counting to calories burned  if you do more than basic cardio and it s important for you to know how many calories you ve burned  don t count on this device for accuracy  calories burned involving hiit  gym workouts  weightlifting  etc  will not be accurately evaluated  but if you need a general idea for calories in and calories out  then this can be helpful for a little while      
22,1.0,                       i purchased this fitbit because it is cheaper than an apple watch  and all i wanted was a fitness tracking band with an extended battery life  when it first came  i was pleased with the product  it fit well  the bands were easily adjustable  and they provided you with many different bands with the pack  the battery life was not what i expected however  and the screen is extremely unresponsive this fitness tracker does not hold up to anything over moderate use  for my profession  i am a firefighter  i am consistently doing physical fitness activity  as well and performing job related fitness on emergency calls  the watch face initially broke and cracked within   weeks of purchase  i purchased a screen protector pack  which simply patched the face that had broke  then  after about   months of use  the cheap plastic they used on the  pebble   the actual tracking device  completely broke off and the tracker fell off my wrist  which caused me to almost lose my device  it took about   weeks to have the warranty claim through fitbit processed to replace it then  the new  pebble  came  i re attached the band that i had been using  and hoped it was just a fluke device that i initially bought  i put a screen protector on it immediately  but within two weeks again  the device screen cracked  i called fitbit and sent in the picture that i have attached to this review  the screen protector was removed to reduce glare and show the magnitude of the crack   fitbit denied my claim and the device is now cracked  the screen is hard to use  and the battery life is extremely reduced  do not buy this  spend the money on a better tracker  not fitbit branded  you won t regret it tldr the device is fragile and does not hold up well to fitness activities the screen is unresponsive  and the battery life is substandardthe customer service is awful  they will most likely not cover any warranty claim in regards to how fragile the device is      
23,5.0,                       i had an older fitbit that i wore for a year before it stopped working  i switched to an apple watch for a bit and when that stopped working correctly  i purchased this  the main things i use it for is the sleep tracker and the activity tracker  the sleep tracker itself blows away anything the apple watch currently offers i find that it really does encourage me to exercise      
24,1.0,                       it started off occasionally not reading my heart accurately   i read every forum and recommendation on how to wear the tracker and have tried multiple options  a little higher on my wrist  a little lower  a little tighter  a little looser nothing worked   not the piece of crap never reads my heart rate accurately   i can be running on a treadmill completely out of breath  the monitor on the treadmill says my hr is     and the fitbit reads           i d send it back if i could and get my money back      
25,4.0,                       this is great if you want to make a change in your lifestyle  with the companion app you can track calorie intake  water intake  see how well you sleep  all kinds of stuff  it tracks your steps  calories burned  floors climbed  a variety of different exercises  i highly recommend it if you re looking to become more active and healthy  there s challenges you can compete in if you want with friends and family  it encourages you to get up and move and reach milestones  it s a great little device  my one big  huge  complaint is that the bands to not connect properly to the fitbit  the band it comes with has a huge gap and it looks trashy for something you re paying a lot of money for  it also looks like it can get caught on something and snap off  i ve bought some third party bands that connect better  but come on  i expect the third party stuff to be janky  not the stuff you get from fitbit themselves  hopefully they fix this issue and issue a recall  but otherwise  the charge   is a wonderful device      
26,3.0,                       this is my first  fitness  watch and i ve had it for one week  overall i like it and i m glad i got it   i enjoy the sleep and heartrate data  except as noted below   on the    minute mark it prompts me to get up and move which helps in the sedentary job i have my disappointment is the poor heartrate accuracy when i exercise  i have    year old polar chest strap monitor that is much more accurate  in the photo i attached  it shows the watch and chest strap readings after sprinting on an attack bike  i did a manual reading and the cheststrap was correct  the watch was    bpm below  of course  this means the calories burned is inaccurate as well unless i manually override it  but i don t want to do that my sense is that this inaccuracy is inherent in measuring using light on the wrist  i have tried the different straps and changing wrists as suggested online but the problem persists  honestly  i wish they would just include a chest strap that will connect with the watch app that i can wear during cardio      
27,5.0,                       if you are looking for a device to keep track of your activities  you can t do better than fitbit   i have been using their devices for years and have never been dissatisfied   i can t say for sure that fitbit is the best on the market  but their devices are hard to beat      
28,1.0,                       the battery in this is garbage  i ve had it less than    days and the battery doesn t last more than    hours  i have turned off all notifications and don t use the gps  and still no good  what happened to   to   days of battery life  i ve never had more than    hours the whole time i ve owned  and i talked to the fitbit help line and they are no help      
29,5.0,                       likes   the way the band attaches to the fitbit   very easy on and off  like the features  like the gps  love the battery life  love the sleep analysis dislikes   not easy to learn how to use  had to watch youtube videos  they need to put videos on the fitbit website  text messages are tiny  but readable  not easy to read outside   need to be bold text      
30,3.0,                       i bought a charge   two weeks ago  the  special edition  with the woven strap and the regular strap  and have had a fair amount of problems with it   the heart rate is reliably off by    or    beats per minute if i m doing any kind of motion intense lifting  i work out with a sandbag and it s absolutely useless if you are doing something like cleans  i wear it two finger widths up and relatively tight and it takes about    seconds to a full minute to catch my heart rate after a set  even doing something like pushups  in fact i ve even had it happen with unweighted body squats  the only exercise where it is almost perfectly accurate seems to be riding a stationary bike  sweat doesn t seem to be a huge factor as i sweat buckets on that bike and it works great  this is definitely the biggest issue   the standalone gps on the charge   takes a long time    or   minutes  to initialize  and it s gotten to the point where not using phone gps is actually a real pain since the app requires always on location services on the phone for  bluetooth low energy scans  to sync  which seems like sort of a non sequitur anyway  i take my phone on walks so standalone gps is not an upsell  especially when it s considerably worse than phone gps   paywalling the advanced sleep reporting features on an already expensive device  i just can t support this as a business practice   the additional  premium  feature is access to workout videos  the app  on a samsung galaxy s     has entirely different offerings than the coach app  but only the coach app is able to cast to my tv  i did the fitness test on the coach earlier today  which says at the beginning that it will be a series of exercises with corresponding ratings  and the video shows someone setting rep counts on a slider  the actual video is a monolithic   minutes with no breaks between segments followed by a series of smiley faces to self assess how you did  i probably didn t do super well doing pike presses because i did pushups    seconds before  is that a sad face  was i supposed to pause it  even as a bundled feature this was pretty disappointing  especially figuring out i was either supposed to watch fitbit app discover programs on my phone or pick something totally different from the coach   minor stuff  the app is fairly comprehensive but you don t seem to be able to zoom in on graphs or even rotate them to landscape  the watch tends to vibrate too much with various numbers during exercise  some are starred  some are active minutes which confusingly pop only in intervals of     and i get about   or   buzzes during an individual workout  notifications from my phone never worked  the  relax  app consistently tells me i m doing a terrible job even when i m synced to its rhythm  lastly the only real differences between the charge   and the inspire hr are standalone gps  active zone minutes which is a made up concept anyway  payments  which are cool   spotify controls and a slightly larger form factor  up to you whether that s worth    extra dollars my watch failed to sync for   hours tonight and that was the final straw  i m sure it s great for specific use cases but overall it s not quite there  i had a microsoft band   in      and the charge   is    better than my fitness tracker from   years ago aside from aesthetics and construction  might be good for someone who wants one app for everything  doesn t care a huge amount about the fine details  and only does spinning classes or runs without their phone      
31,1.0,                       before i purchased a charge   i read many of the reviews but did not uncover that fitbit refuses to support windows     the charge    inspire    inspire hr  inspire  sense  versa    and versa   can only be set up with a smartphone or tablet   per my work with an support agent at fitbit   i was also informed that fitbit will be pushing an update to the charge   that will make it incompatible with windows      since i have found that the smartphone installation seem to be a huge drain on my battery  i do not wish to sync with my smartphone and i do not own a tablet   i purchased the charge   for my wife and i ve owned a charge   for my use for a couple of years   fitbit has just destroyed their relationship with me   not making it clear that a new product will not work for windows    is bad enough but to break the product that i already own ought to be criminal   i will make no review regarding the the tracker in relation to smartphones or tablets other than what i said   other reviews can speak to that   i will caution those who want to use windows    to sync their tracker   fitbit will not support you and the fact that they are ready to break my tracker with the update tells me that they have nothing but contempt for window    users and they do not want our business      
32,4.0,                       the sleep tracking sounds cool  right  and when it works  it is interesting to see your sleep stages and levels of sleep  but  in the two weeks i ve worn it  it has only worked correctly twice for sleep  if you look at the fitbit forums you ll see this is an ongoing problem  i ll sleep all night  but it will only track for a bit here and there  not the over three straight hours it needs for tracking full info  doesn t matter where on my arm  how tightly  if i ve re synced it the app or whatever other suggestions they have  it is an ongoing problem that the company admits to counting steps and most everything else have been great with the watch  i enjoy the gps feature that syncs your exercise to the app  and shows your time in each cardio fat burn etc zone  i did have the gps stop a half mile before the end of my walk yesterday  but the battery had gotten down to     at that point  not sure if that was the issue overall i like it and i m glad i purchased it  it was on sale for     at the time      
33,1.0,                       i ve had the fitbit charge   for over a month and have not had any luck syncing it to my home computer  running windows     or my cell phone  samsung galaxy s  e   a support person from the fitbit website said to buy the fitbit dongle and then i could sync it to my home computer  i purchased the dongle  still wouldn t sync  when i inquired again about this issue  i was told the fitbit charge   would only work with my cell phone  then why did you tell me to purchase the     dongle  by the way  it won t sync with my cell phone  either  fitbit  this shouldn t be so hard  i will be returning the device      
34,1.0,                       just take the time and get yours in person  on arrival the band only turned on for a moment  and then after more than several hours of charging  still didnt come on  i couldnt initiate the setup for it  or interact with it at all  my boyfriend also has a fitbit so we switched chargers to make sure it wasnt just a charger issue and it wasnt  the charger that came with mine powered his just fine  so  our only conclusion was that the one i was sent was already defective  not sure if it was maybe repackaged and resold or something  but honestly it was so much easier  and the same price  to just go out and get it in store  i should have just done that in the first place      
35,5.0,                       it fits great i like how that it syncs up with my health insurance it s a great tracker for steps and sleeping and you can track your food it s very handy i actually was considering this against the watch and ended up with the fitbit and i m happy i did     
36,5.0,                       i had the fitbit charge   and upgraded to the charge    overall i really like it  it has all the same features as the   with a few additional features  i really appreciate the option to turn of the screen wake for sleeping  now it doesn t light up in the middle of the night waking my husband like it used too  the touch button on the side  o did have to get used to  but once you get the finess of it it works really well one thing i want to share is how to get the  workout  option back for your exercise options  initially i thought they just took it away  but all you have to do is go to the app  tap on charge   to get to the apps  scroll down and tap on the exercises options  you ll have to remove one  then tap the add option  the workout option will be there  just scroll through to find      
37,1.0,                       it s great for counting steps  but whenever i run the gps stops or doesn t start correctly  the fitbit exits the exercise before i m done  or it doesn t record it at all even though i m watching the pace counter throughout the run  after only a month of use  the fitbit only occasionally syncs with my iphone and the app rarely works when i want to make changes to the device after one month of extensive use  i m returning this device because it s not what was described by the company and none of the features work consistently outside of using this for a wristwatch and pace counter  the charge   is useless      
38,1.0,                       the charge   has what seems to be an old problem it freezes at a setup screen on the tracker  even if you managed to connect the device  this seems to have been an issue since the charge   and its still here  i have purchased two charge   s both unable to get past the go to fitbit setup screen  i also have an ionic and it had with the same issue but worked on the second try  i really like the look and size of the ionic  but am so disappointed in the charge   that i might have to send them all back  really save yourself the potential hassle and get something else till they fix this  which doesn t seem likely since its something that has happened from the get go this line  i also have two cheap off brand trackers that connected with zero issues  and since the charge   refuses to work that is what my wife is using      
39,2.0,                       my unit was glitchy out of the box  likewise with the app  band failed to display weather data  didn t respond to tapping the settings icon  and was generally difficult to navigate  sure looks nice though  couple stars for that the app wouldn t allow me to change watch faces  wouldn t let me upload a profile image  and dropped me from support chat in the middle of trying to figure out how to the update the device   the price tag and brand create high expectations  this experience wasn t even medium      
40,3.0,                       the product keeps track of steps and other items well enough  custom heart rates and heart rate zones was not functional on the app  i contacted the support group and received one decent reply before the completely ignored me without the issues being resolved  i was able with the help of an online forum user to make these adjustments through the online dashboard  this does make me concerned about how well other functions are actually working      
41,2.0,                       it is difficult to have the syncing  it keeps disconnecting when exercising walking and not able to track correctly  for example  the last update i had as of          is on          since syncing is different for this device  it takes away a lot to stay focused on exercise and diet goals  even the manual syncing from the setup doesn t work often times  i have had this fitbit for over   months but not getting better  also i do update the software when update is available but doesn t resolve the syncing issue  sleep tracking is not syncing  what a difference  i purchased a different brand and have had it for a month and working great so far  no syncing issue with the different brand      
42,4.0,                       my charge    which was a great fitness tracker and so easy to set up and use   won t sync any more and needed replacing  i made the mistake of buying a charge    i had to use fitbit chat to get the device to work  that was a horrible experience  is there some reason customer service chat people don t bother to read what the customer types i tried to set a clock face  and there s no way to do that  i would like to set an alarm  but there s no information on how to do that  i d like to set specific exercises  but i can t do that either this isn t an upgrade  this is a nightmare  there are supposed to be all these great features  but to access them requires pure dumb luck  there s nothing intuitive  and the instructions   assuming you can accidentally find them   aren t any help update  i finally got the fitbit up and running  i bought this fitbit because my charge   stopped syncing and the charge   was on sale  it took a few days to get everything set up on the fitbit  i m slowly learning how to use the exercise function  i don t need the gps so i can t comment on that feature  yes  buy this fitbit  but   it will take a bit of time to learn how to use this fitbit      
43,1.0,                           of the time you will not get notifications about texts on your fitbit  after going through all the troubleshooting tips over and over  i m just gonna go back to using a charge    upgraded to a   because of the spotify control but when you have to go in and reset it to recognize your fitbit and make your fitbit recognize your spotify  it s not even worth the trouble  going with the charge   was the worst fitbit decision i ve ever made      
44,5.0,                       i went back and forth between a fitbit and an apple watch for months    i was     going to go with the apple watch  then the pandemic hit  i realized a lot of my friends and coworkers had apple watches and they constantly would look at it  i felt it was no different than looking at your actual phone   i stepped back and asked what was the main reason i wanted either of these and it was for step counting  calorie counting  and increasing healthy habits  i m not really a watch person  and i finally pulled the trigger on the fitbit and i couldn t be happier  it covers exactly what i need it for    and it was hundreds of dollars cheaper  let alone any cell phone plan additions you might need       
45,2.0,                       i bought this as a gift for a person without a smart phone  there is no way to set it up without a smart phone  i tried setting it up using my phone as a favor and am unable to get past the device telling me to upgrade the software  way too expensive to not work out of the box  been trying to get this functioning since christmas      
46,1.0,                       i liked this one better then the charge   until it broke  i was taking off my glove when the post that holds on the band broke  i have contacted fitbit and i have to send it in so they can decide if this will be covered  and get this  they told me that once they receive it i have to contact them otherwise they won t do anything about it  seriously  i have to wait weeks for the usps to deliver it to you then have to remind you that you have it before you ll do anything about it  last time i had a fitbit break years ago they just sent me a new one right away  plus the chat person disconnected with me before i was done asking questions and then never sent me an email with instructions on what to send  only an email with a link to a usps label that says i will get a separate email with instructions  poor work fitbit      
47,5.0,                       got this for my son who has a heart condition  it monitors his heart rate very accurately and gives him the peace of mind knowing its tracking him all hours of every day  it s a nice sleek design  and we like the textured band  it s large enough to fit his    wrist with room for larger wrists  we ve had for a couple months now  he showers with it  and so far it s holding up perfectly  we love that it records the data in his phone app to see all the variations      
48,5.0,                       i debated for awhile on which fitbit to get  my daughter has an apple watch and my son has the fitbit versa     i had an hr and it was old  i loved all the detail with the versa   but decided i didn t need all of that and while i hesitated  i got the charge    i love it   it stays charged for days  i love the zone minutes and reminders  i made the right choice      
49,3.0,                       it does the same thing as the charge    except it has gps  i opted for the special addition  why  i have no idea  don t waste your money  there s nothing different except an exceptionally ugly band that you ll want to replace in a few weeks      
50,1.0,                       i am very disappointed and frustrated with fitbit charge    it looses bluetooth sync with my iphone too many times a day   even after a no of reboots of the charge    it does not sync with my iphone  now these are known problems and fitbit tech people have not been able to fix it  this product should be recalled and money should be refunded i have hard time reaching customer service support even after attempting multiple times as no one is answering the phone i had been using the charge   for over     years and never once did i have a problem   it always synced with my iphone right away all the time  unfortunately i lost it as it had a defective belt and fell off my wrist      
51,3.0,                       pros   very easy and intuitive set up    i like that it shows the different heart zones and tracks your workout with it  thus  letting you know the intensity of your workout  this is great for people who enjoy hiit training or orangetheory fitness    if you are a data geek  the app offers plenty of ways to see your calories burned  heart rate  and sleep statistics  very interesting cons   the battery does not last   days  i charged it to      and lasted     days  after the recharge  it is at     right now  which is two days later    the touch screen does not work with sweaty fingers during a workout or if you want to stop a workout     starting a workout is not very quick  it goes through a  connecting  process which can last a couple minutes other   charge the fitbit before starting  make sure it clasps on correctly  i thought i had done it right  but only to find out it wasn t charging    the only difference between the charge   and charge   special edition is the extra band  i like the band  from what i could tell the band bought separately usually costs more than      but if you like one that is less than      recommend buying the charge   and band separately final thoughti m still on the fence this is the right wearable for me  will continue to try it out and see how continues to work  the charging is a big issue partly because advertising   days of charged capacity is a huge variance with reality of      fundamentally  to me  that is false advertising      
52,2.0,                       the sleep tracking function of the fitbit is unreliable  it shows the score on some days  including rem and deep sleep  and some days it does not  although i did everything the same way       
53,1.0,                       after a week of installing and deleting the app too many times and restarting the fitbit over and over i returned it   i  talked to fitbit support and was told if any other bluetooth devices were near it may cause problems   my husband kept getting notifications on his phone to download the app   even though i had the app downloaded on my phone  i continued to receive the same notification   i woke up with     steps before i was out of bed  even though i reset my sleep sensitivity from normal to sensitive and back again more than once   way too many issues to enjoy the charge        
54,5.0,                       i love my fitbit  its my first and i m glad for it   helps me realize i needed to start moving more  having said the fitbit i got was had a black screen issue off thr bat  i got a new replacement right away and this second one worked perfectly      
55,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love this fitbit  i didn t know all of the features at first but it s great  i use it to set alarms and timers  plus change my music  look at my calendar for the day and see texts  it also has a calm option for   or   minutes to help focus your breathing and heart rate  i usually do it when i m about to go to bed since i get off work really late and have classes early and usually have trouble sleeping  i was also able to connect it to my apple health so it s can see things like my weight  height  period  etc  its way more accurate than using my phone for my steps  from a day of work      on phone vs       on fitbit   i really love it and has made my life way easier the only negative was i had to wait a few days for the watch to be sent the update so i could access my calendar  spotify and fitpay  all the other features still worked before and after the update also  fitpay requires a passcode to use so if you re skeptical about that  it can t be accessed without it so your money is safe  lastly  it still works great on your ankle  i bought an extender or you can make one  see video  but it still picks up heartbeat  obviously it s just harder to use the other features when it s on your ankle but doesn t mean it won t work  just harder to reach haha  hope this is helpful       
56,5.0,                       this is my  rd fitbit since      coming to about       month to motivate movement  track sleep and provide time   date w o pulling out phone   good value   fast and easy setup   but if it doesn t work properly  that value drops  big time am here changing my review from   star to five   a perceived problem with displaying sleep details was resolved by one or all of the following  changing sleep setting to sensitive  doing the update  turning on heartbeat setting and wearing watch further up on the wrist   now it works as reliably as my charge   and i m a happy camper      
57,5.0,                       really gives motivation for walking  working out  etc  purchased one for myself and another for my    year old son  he loves the hourly reminder if he still needs to complete steps  he likes to compare our stats  too  it s great for these quarantine times where we have become more immobile and gained weight  we take more walks now and work out together every day since getting them  this is remarkable since he is autistic and struggles with issues on a more sensitive level      
58,2.0,                       i ve had multiple fitbit  devices and this the worst for sleep tracking   within the first week  i got the first signs there may be an issue with the sleep tracking function   by the time a month had passed  i would awake several more mornings with no sleep tracked     so disappointed with charge          
59,3.0,                       my jury is still out   i love everything about this except that it does not consistently vibrate to remind me to get my steps in each hour   it does vibrate for every text  call etc which makes me crazy but not for the most important part  to remind me to move other than that i love it   it s waterproof  i wore it to swim and had no issues   the sleep tracker is great   i love th color of the band too if customer service can figure out the issue with my reminders to move i will write an addendum to this review with a   start rating     
60,5.0,                       i bought this after i gave up wearing an apple watch because of rashes it gave me  i figured fitbit charge is indeed a better choice for me i do miss siri and some extra features on the apple watch  but charge   is much lighter and has a much better battery life  i sometimes even forget that i m wearing one  which didn t happen with the apple watch  those two merits are good enough reasons for me to make the switch plus  i like sleep tracking  which is a must feature for me  on charge   than the default one on apple watch  charge   seems more accurate and fitbit s data presentation  especially the sleep score  is easier to digest for      during the holiday sale   i don t have to worry too much about damaging it like i did with the apple watch      
61,3.0,                       i have never been so upset and disappointed with fitbit  my first advice to you is buy the protection plan  i ve never had a fitbit last over   years  my last charge   stopped working abruptly  so i used my protection plan to upgrade to a charge    worst decision  the charge   seems like it s super fancy and worth the upgrade  false  the last   times i ve charged it  it stops counting my steps  i ve followed all of the necessary steps to get my charge   to send me text notifications  and it still won t work  i get phone call notifications just fine  so why not texts  it seems like a lot of people are having this same issue if you go to fitbit s help website  why sell a product with so many bugs  so disappointed  if i wasn t so dependent on knowing what time it is and wanting my step count  i would throw in the towel with fitbit altogether  i will be contacting customer support about these issues      
62,2.0,                       what i realized by purchasing and trying this out for a few months is that i don t like knowing how many steps i m taking  what my heart rate is  constantly having to charge it  ensuring the app on my phone is synced  etc i m an active person  i run      miles per week  and i m on my feet most of the day  i fell into the trap of thinking that this device would somehow give me an edge or advantage in my every day life  it doesn t i run with my phone  so there s my gps tracking mapping music  i keep a log of my sleep on my nightstand  so there s the sleep tracking   i also participated in a sleep study which yielded completely different and conflicting results than what this device was reporting to me every morning  i have an assortment of wrist watches for most occasions  which all look better than this item   overall it just slowly became irrelevant in my everyday life over the course of   months of  use  it was a mistake   not impressed with fitbit   why didn t i just get an apple watch i could see it being fun for kids who need encouragement to get up  get out  and get active in the form of tech gimmicks        
63,2.0,                       the only reason that i bought this was because my fitbit charge   died after only   years  the   has no updates worth mentioning over the    it is still impossible to see in the sunlight  the legacy charge   clock face still does not work  nothing new here folks   move on   fitbit is going down the tubes   oh     and as an added bonus  they changed the form factor just slightly enough that none of the charge   accessories will work with it  throw away all of your charge   charging cables and be prepared to buy new ones          
64,1.0,                       i received my fitbit charge   and followed the startup instructions   after the setup and a firmware update  i am completely unable to get a response from the device   i let it charge for over two hours  received the smily face  setup mu iphone  registered and started the premium service  and the device never came back to life   according to the fitbit forums  this is a known problem with this model   my advice is to stay away from this device until this significant problem is resolved   fitbit help      
65,1.0,                       i was really excited about the charge   when it came out  specifically the internal gps feature and ability to control spotify from the tracker within like   months the gps stopped working   i ve called fitbit   times troubleshooting and they re finally sending me a replacement  but who knows if that will actually work the spotify app is not accessible while you re tracking a workout   that means  you can either record a run or control music   what s the point of that really regret this purchase and wish i had gotten a garmin instead      
66,3.0,                       my husband had a smart watch but i didn t see the need  i finally got one so i could manage music without getting my phone   turns out you have to have a paid spotify or pandora  why  i can t afford extra bill s  also  a lot of features require a paid fitbit subscription   i don t even like the bulkiness feel or the button placement or the general use  the menu just isn t streamlined enough for me in the app      
67,1.0,                       i have been a fitbit customer for at least the last    years and my fitbit   purchase last month was my  th fitbit device   the new fitbit   charge is awful   the user interface is cumbersome when i head out on a run   if you use the gps the charge last about   days  and will quit on you in the middle of a run   can t check battery level on the device  must use app but don t think you need to check when you pulled it off charger yesterday      so i quit using gps  in daylight the device is almost impossible to read on normal brightness   today i ran and my device reported my over       steps and heartrate   the app didnt update my data and stuck at    steps   reboot iphone   same     i have rebooted the watch as well   really stupid steps to activate and finish the tracker and confusing  play  icon   they lost me on this  shipping it back and will lose years of data     i bought stock in this company when i first started using the original    really a huge disappointment and fail   so disappointed   the one thing i did like  the heart rate monitor is better than the prior charge     other than that    pos     
68,5.0,                       i bought the charge   mainly for the step and sleep tracking the sleep tracking is great  the step  not so great  in fact horrible  it randomly adds steps while sitting still or while sleeping  even driving this seems to be a huge complaint of fitbit users and after searching all day  have not found any type answer i bought it for the main purpose of step tracking and with that not working properly  i feel a bit jipped      
69,5.0,                       i previously gave this product a   star rating because the charge   that i recieved was defective  however  amazon traded my previous watch for another one and this one works fine  the battery life is better  mine will last about   days and when the battery gets low  the watch will let you know  if you want to save battery life  just don t use the gps feature when you go outdoors like on your hike  walk  bike  or run  it will still give you all the vital information that you ll want like average heart rate  calories burned  altitude change  mileage  and how long you stayed in fat burn  cardio  or peak heart rate  you can change the watch face to suit your taste  or adjust how bright or dark you want to set the screen  it comes with spotify which i have no need for  but it does just about anything else that you want  it s not as advanced as an apple watch  but after all  this is a fitness tracker and not a smart watch  you can buy additional watch band to suit your taste  its light weight  and durable  its also water proof so you can swim with it  i previously wrote that i won t get another fitbit  but i was wrong      
70,2.0,                       after a couple of weeks  i got a notice to update the firmware   the update crashed the fitbit   customer support said they d do me the  favor  of giving me a fedex smartpost  ha   ground shipping label   it took fedex and usps more than two weeks to get the fitbit to them  then fitbit tells me it ll take up to    days to ship out a replacement   when the do send it out  it ll probably take another two weeks to get to me   so  aside from the charge   dying after two weeks  fitbit needs to find a better way to replace their defective stuff in a more timely manner      
71,1.0,                       as many other posters have noted  i  too  received this item in non working condition the device would not turn on and  also as another poster has noted  it really appeared as though this box had been received and opened by another purchaser at one point or another disappointed  as i really wanted to love this device  will not be purchasing again      
72,5.0,                        nd update  buy the insurance  my watch snagged the other day and broke the hinge that connects the band  i filed a claim and once the reviewed it  it shipped a new one    hours later  excellent accident warranty  very satisfied update  i ve had this watch for a few months now  and it has grown on me more  it does still  shock  me every now and then but i ve noticed if i switch it to my other wrist or just take it off for a little it stops or sometimes i just have it too tight  i figured out how to connect my messages which is a big plus for me  another bonus i want to add is it s very durable  i ve accidentally scratched my watch against the wall while walking more times than i can count  super clumsy  and there s not a scratch on it  i m still not a huge fan of the choices for clock faces and wish it was more customizable but thats eh  the speckled  fabric  wrist band does need to be washed constantly as it does absorb odors easily so i end up using the standard band more often i did end up buying the same fitbit for my mil for this christmas  as she has been wanting one as well and they were on sale  so there s that  it still lasts a few days which i like and shows the battery life is still good  for what i use it for  i like it please give this a thumbs up if this helps  i m trying to improve how helpful my reviews are original it s an okay watch  but there s definitely better out there pros  i like the sleek look  not a fan of the circular faces of smart watches sleep tracker is useful for keeping track of my sleep schedule without me even thinking about it heart rate is pretty accurate super easy to switch out the bands step counts are more accurate than my phone battery seems to last at least   days at a time charges fast cons  leaves electrical burns on my wrist  i don t wear it it water at all   distance is not accurate if you run  unless you turn on workout and only have it on when running which is a pain since i do interval running a bit pricey for what it is doesn t always turn on when i turn my wrist  especially laying down don t like the home button because you have to tap it just right to work it have to have spotify premium to use it with fitbit  doesn t connect with my messages overall  it s okay  if the distance was more accurate i d be more satisfied with it but it just doesn t meet all my needs  i wish i did more research  hope this helps      
73,5.0,                       the fitbit charge   is wonderful   i love the front face and the ability to customize it for my usage   the sleep tracking has helped me learn about my sleep patterns   the special addition came with extra wrist bands   which i seem to wear out before i want to buy a new tracker   love the interchangeable bands that are included      
74,2.0,                       i had an ionic  which i loved   sadly  it died after       years  so i was loathe to buy another ionic   the charge   seemed to have the features i was most looking for  so i decided to give it a try   i have a small wrist  and really like how sleek the charge   is   today i took the charge   out on a bike ride for the first time   one of the reasons i bought the charge    and one of the reasons i loved the ionic  is that it has built in gps for things like biking and running outside   i biked a route that i have often done  so i know the distance and my general average mph for the route   the first bad thing about the charge   is that the display is completely unreadable in bright sunshine   i had to go inside to start my bike session  because i couldn t see anything on the display in bright sunshine   what were they thinking when they engineered this display   i often like to pause my bike session when i m stuck at a long light  and then start it back up again when the light turns green   since i couldn t see the display outside  i couldn t do this   the second bad thing was how inaccurate the gps and average mileage were for this ride   it seemed to drop out for quite some time  even though it was open road  not forested   and  when i downloaded the session  it had me going at a diagonal direction that didn t even exist irl  that is  it was not on a road    as a result  the mileage that it showed was not only several miles off  it caused the average mph to be much lower than it really was   i m not expecting perfection from a fitness tracker  but this was way too off to be useful to me   and not being able to read the display outside was a deal breaker   i am returning the charge     guess i have to find an alternative to fitbit  sad  because i ve been a fitbit user for many years      
75,5.0,                       this is my  rd fitbit  my last   each lasted   years  this charge   is identical to the charge    so if you already have wrist bands  then you can use them with this  it also has similar features to the charge     with a few more bells and whistles  the charge on it has lasted me about a week on average  i have no complaints      
76,2.0,                       i was so excited to get the charge   since i had the charge   but to my disappointment it did not work  could not get it to sync properly even with fitbit customer service on the line so i had to send it back to them and   weeks later i am just now getting an email that my new fitbit is in the mail  i got the new one because i was part of a fitness challenge and everyone was using their fitbit to keep track  i couldn t use my charge   because the replacement bands don t fit  so sad      
77,1.0,                       should be allowed to give   stars   syncs and that is all it did   can t get past the setup message   called fitbit and they would replace but have to send the defective unit back and have it received before they will send out the replacement   looked like a long turnaround so i just returned it to amazon updatei really liked the specs and size of this unit so i gave it another chance and exchanged it instead of returning it   what a waste of time   i should have googled this problem before i got the second unit   lots of people are having the same problem   so the new unit came and worked  or didn t work  in exactly the the same way as the first   at least this proves that their quality control is consistent   i will be returning the second one as well but not getting a replacement this time   what a shame that a company with such a good reputation can t provide working  products      
78,5.0,                       some reviews are a bit tough on this device  but i really like this tracker   i was an early adopter with the microsoft band fitness tracker which is still way better than most today  but the fitbit charge   is really good for the   especially when gps is included   i ve had the charge   for   weeks and i m really happy with it   it doesn t have so many bells and whistles which gives it a really good battery life   setup and updates were easy   way too many people complaining about this pros light and easy to wearspecial edition   granite band is awesome   cloth like band means no sweaty wrist      days between charges with using the gps several times and wearing for sleep sleep tracking seems to work well easy to navigate the screens   especially for a small screenvery good syncing with my andriod phone   better than my fitbit ionic spotify control was surprisingly easy to setup and works well sleep mode works well in auto but i like to enable it myself so that do not disturb is on too cons its monochrome   but that s really ok and why the battery lasts longer my last   fitness trackers never made it past   years  so i got the extra warranty   just being cautious the screen can be a little dim  even at normal setting    again to save battery      
79,5.0,                       love my fitbit  i can wear it swimming too  love the graphics in the app  battery lasts several days if you don t keep the gps function on  if it is on  about   days max  i like that i also can view my texts and emails without having to bring my phone along on my walks  at least i can see what s coming in  i haven t used the spotify function  it does integrate with noom and other apps  great buy       
80,2.0,                       this is my third fitbit moving up as updated  i m sorry i bought this one because it tries to do too much and you re five or six button pushes and left  right  up down swipes and taps to get to everyday useful information  i m not saying it s not all there it s just too damn hard to get to and impossible when you re moving or it s dark  i should have bought the charge   again  also i resent being housed about upgrading to premium i know where it is   i don t want it  stop badgering me  and i m done with fitbits after five plus years     
81,3.0,                       i like the fit of the watch  i ve only been wearing it for about   days now and everything seems to work great except the calories burned reading  i noticed yesterday that it said i had burned       calories which i thought was extremely high even with the amount of activity i had done  fast for its only  am and since midnight my tracker claims i have burned     calories  mind you i ve only taken     steps since midnight and i have been sitting down at work since about      am  i would really like like function to work correctly  is there any solution before i send it back      
82,5.0,                       i love this fitbit  i bought it after my  very old  rather basic  flex fitbit finally stopped working  this has a watch  gps  sleep tracking  steps  pulse  and so much more  i love the app that it syncs to  it keeps me accountable for what i eat  motivates me to exercise  and i feel overall healthier since wearing  i love the color and the sleekness of it  it has a long battery life and is quick to charge when it s time  another bonus is you can link your cell phone to alert you to incoming calls if your phone is not with you  the friend option allows me and my sister to hold each other accountable for our daily steps too      
83,1.0,                       a piece of garbage   i owned a fitbit chatge   for over   years with no problems  had to replace with a    battery goes dead everyday  i have cancelled all apps except steps  and heart rate still goes dead  switching to a different smart watch  piece of junk oh i have only owned for a few weeks useless piece of garbage  good bye fitbit     
84,4.0,                       i like that this item has motivated me to track more of what goes in and how much effort i expend daily  seeing nutritional values in little charts helps me be more aware of what i m eating and how much  it also helps me to realize when i haven t really moved around too much in a day  so it motivates me to go out and get some steps in and my heart rate going  it even keeps me aware of how much rest i get too  along with the quality of that rest  my main issue with this however  is that i find it a bit inaccurate  when i know all i ve done today was sit at my desk  i am sometimes surprised that it thinks i ve walked      steps and i know it s not true  i work an office job and tap a lot of buttons on a keyboard  so i m assuming it s picking up on those taps rather than my actual stepping activity  aside from having to take it off and put it back on when i know i ll be at the computer  it s pretty great      
85,1.0,                       the display outside  rainy or cloudy  is so dim it s unreadable   the gps tracking worked most of the time but for the price it should work all the time      
86,2.0,                       i skipped the charge   because i didn t need an upgrade at the time  now i do  i thought i d try charge   it s trash  don t waste your time the touch screen barely responds  how do you screw up a one button user interface from the previous model  charge     press the button to cycle through a menu and hold the button to start an exercise  it was simple and easy  now i have to swipe every direction to get to menus  i swipe and the menu slightly moves and then the screen turns off  i can t get the screen to stay on more than two seconds  i can t restart the watch either because of the touch sensitive area on the side not working properly even if this is a dud  a consumer product should not have this many issues  this is ridiculous      
87,4.0,                       i ve had   of the fitbit charges starting with the original generation and this latest doesn t seem to compare to the quality of the previous generations  the band looks to be splitting from the screen on both top and bottom and the control button is not as responsive      
88,3.0,                       the connecting and updating to start with is a bit of a pain  and then once it is connected and  working  it then says  download or update app to continue after a google it turns out that is not actually the issue  and the problem is that the device ships with out of date firmware  that needs an update  which doesn t just happen as part of the original set up and updates  this is electronic device      make the set up have the full process  my daughters took   hrs to complete the process of updating firmware properly  with attempting every hour or so to connect them again reading on forums it appears some people have as long as   days before it actually completes the process mostly a warning for other purchasers  the device works great once this is complete  but is a pain during it      
89,1.0,                       i should have waited and bought an apple watch   this fitbit is not very reliable   it keeps losing the bluetooth connection with my iphone   i m constantly  forgetting the device  and having the iphone and fit bit communicate again   i e literally spent hours and hours trying to get my iphones  ipads etc bluetooth to talk w  the fitbit another thing i don t like is that if you have this replace a watch for time keeping  the dials are very hard to read and you have to get it to light up   so several times  a day i have to tap on the screen   squint my eye  and read the clock feature in short  apple products are expensive but now i realize they are worth it and pretty much optimized and trouble free if this is a google product  which i believe google bought at least part of fitbit   they need to step up their game bottom line   i would look for a more robust product  this is bordering on junk      
90,4.0,                       this is my second fitbit i have had this year   the first was a gift and after    months the armband broke off from the watch    i bought a replacement in september and upgraded to a more expensive version thinking it might be constructed better   and the same thing has happened    i am a    year old woman and am not doing any hard physical labor that would damage the watch    it actually fell apart while sleeping    i love the concept but this seems to be a poor quality product       
91,1.0,                       piece of junk  imagine spending this much on a fitness tracker that doesn t track fitness  there are multiple posts on the tracker message boards about this issue and the company does nothing  myself and others have tried all the usual fixes such as deleting and re downloading the app and checking all the available exercise suggestions but to no avail  i really miss my charge   fitbit which always worked  too bad it completely died after   years  don t waste your money on this one  the company doesn t care      
92,2.0,                       i guess you get what you pay for   it is nice to have this available for the price but it is just hard to believe anything it says   the pedometer is way off   if i go for a bike ride and i tell it that i am riding my bike i still get       steps   the auto exercise programs are worthless   i workout outside in one   x   ft spot and it auto recognizes an outdoor bike   this makes me not believe calories burned either   i think many people get this for the pedometer primarily and if you do  don t   invest in a better pedometer   heart rate seems to be okay and sleep monitoring seems to be decent      
93,4.0,                       fitbit s app let me start by saying  the fitbit app is unparalleled for sleep  diet and water tracking  i have tried to move away from fitbit due to my propensity for longer runs  but the features covered in their one app bring me back every time  simply stated  it presents the most holistic picture you re going to get of your health inside one app as a result of wearing one fitness tracker charge   as an upgrade  i e  gps  specific to the charge    with a note that  all other things are equal caliber to the charge     the gps  which is really the only major new feature of the charge    is good  the gps takes seconds  maybe    to     to connect and then you touch the screen and off you go  i wore the charge   and my garmin for the first few runs to compare tracking  my garmin is a triathlon model  not a fitness tracker model    used more for races and longer distance running due to battery life  and the gps paired fairly well across both units  the fitbit found its satellites far quicker than garmin  but seemingly gives extra distance when going around corners  i have one corner i hit on my out and back   miles runs and the gps maps indicate this is where the magic happened  but that being said i would usually hit the   mile mark on the charge   around two or three strides ahead of my garmin  no biggie for the shorter daily training runs  i would say the fitbit charge   stops being your optimal choice if    you are fine with carrying your phone constantly and therefore do not need gps or    you are going to be out doing your activity for        hours  that s where the battery use for gps expenditure becomes cumbersome  at a moderately paced half marathon  you re into garmin coros suunto etc special edition or base specific to the charge    the special edition boils down to a unique band  that happens to be absolute junk  with reflective fabric    the super special band looks a bit awkward with the unit  won t survive sweat for very long without needing to be washed or soaked  and felt   looked like it didn t fully connect into the unit at the clip ins and might randomly separate it tugged on the wrong way   could have been mine was defective  i don t know  my recommendation either way  save the     bucks  get the basic charge    and if you re into colored specialty bands  any band that is marketed for the charge   or   will work with the charge    i am currently using the charge   special edition band  white rubber with black clasps  on my charge    it works perfectly out of the box  i had no issues with any part of charging it  pairing it  or the firmware updates needed at launch to bring it to current  no black screens of death either battery life and the battery does die faster when using gps  but that actually happens to all fitness trackers not expressly made for gps monitoring  you can t have built in gps tracking on a unit this size  with all the fitness tracking features it has  and expect battery to last a full week  with active gps use for an activity a day plus all day   night wear fitness tracking  i d estimate you ll get   to   days out of each charge      
94,3.0,                       for the most part  an ok tracker  so far has done a good job with steps  connectivity and reminders  heartrate is for the most part accurate as well the stairs floors data is a mess  begining it seemed pretty good  only off by a floor or two each day  over time this has changed to wildly innacurate  floors are being counted at     times actual number  fitbit solution is to tell the tracker you are driving and it will not count floors  they blame it on opening doors and breezes      
95,2.0,                       i m really disappointed  the features of the fitbit are great  but   there are problems    it s only been over a week  and the fitbit is scratched up  i m very worried now that a month into it  i can t wear this out on a normal day as it ll look terrible  it ll only be used for working out    so  i bought the fitbit for two main reasons  to track my calories expenditure and to track my sleep  i m very disappointed that apparently i d have to pay for a monthly subscription after    days  which is the amount of time for their free trail     this is a bit minor  but it seems you cannot log your food calories for previous days  also  it does not estimate your body fat    you have to add that in yourself      
96,3.0,                       in a few words  i am disappointed by the quality  don t believe me  just google  fitbit charge   gap  it s not that the product is totally garbage  it s just that i expected for better quality    this is the   rd generation  of fitbits running in my family  this time i bought     this is the first time that i wish i had chosen differently   the strap is not tightly connected to the watch  there is an ugly gap    reading tons of other s complaints i am lucky that it s remaining connected all other parameters are as expected  but as the watch is sitting on your hand all day  it turns out that a good fit between the parts is quite important   btw  so far fitbit takes responsibility and replaces faulty watches for other faulty watches  but i would suggest to wait until they actually solve the problem  and hopefully initiate a recall   or order the fitbit charge        
97,4.0,                       love this fitbit  one thing to be aware of  i didn t notice in the picture that the center piece of the watch is the same color as the band   i chose plum thinking the center was all black like the other fitbit i had   it s fine with the original band but if i switch to a other color than i ll have a two tone watch  which i don t love   in hindsight i would have ordered the black one so the bands match better   i m also one of the small percentage of people who can feel tbe heart rate sensor on their arm   feels like a slight sting   this device is better than one i ve had in the past and only feel the sting intermittently   overall i love this fitbit      
98,4.0,                       got this charge   set up and excited to use   we also have a charge   so now  i thought we could compete   but they sync together so each one reads each others info so you never get your accurate reading   customer chat said to set up seperate accounts not to put them on the same fit bit app on your phone  even though directions are to add a device  haven t tried that yet as the phone will only let you put the app on the phone once   haven t had time or patience to check out the other features   may update later on that once i get the thing to work right     
99,3.0,                       product has promise   for now it is not suitable for my needs started with battery charge of       went on    hour quick hike  battery was drained to half   in outdoor daylight  display is really difficult to read setup program needs maturation and was frustrating   there are several comments on fitbit online boards about setup issues not working   fitbit windows store app does not support charge   it takes a while to get used to their proprietary charging holster which does not always click into place for me this is an okay product if you working out indoors and are doing short activitys      
100,1.0,                       the app system for fitbit is not working  the device resets your steps multiple times a day on top of not properly calculating other portions  been on with customer service multiple days in a row and was told they are aware of it and working on it  a little research on the forums say this has been going on for some time with no end in sight  do not spend the money on this      
101,4.0,                       i love my charge   fitbit but what i don t like is that the battery life isn t really   days  i ve had it for about   weeks now and the funny thing is the  nd day i misplaced the charger  that morning i went running and came home it was gone and my fitbit was at      i was confused because that morning it was       i just knew it would go dead  after hours of looking for the charger  i decided to order a new charger but in the meantime  the battery life was decreasing by the hour  i couldn t find a retailer online that had any so i went into walmart  i was able to buy a replacement which is great because if not it would have been dead  overall i love it but beware the battery life      
102,1.0,                       it is frustrating and confusing to use this device  i would ride      miles on my bike in the morning and it would record     of the ride  i would on another day do the same ride and it would record the ride  but at the same time give me  steps  and also give me credit for going up  stairs   since i was on a bike i don t know how either of those things were possible   though i did do   hill climbs which might have been  counted  as stairs  the touch screen was frustrating to use  i would push and swipe forever to get to the exercise i wanted  set up to start  but then have to repeat that all at the end when i d already finished  but the clock was still running    it also would not match the distances to my bike computer which matches my car distances and that s just confusing while distances are inaccurate it does count steps so if you want to use it as a step counter on your walks that might be the one thing you can do with it the sleep information seemed interesting and potentially useful but the timeline that shows your sleep is very small and not readable  when you click for info it just gives you the break down in general percentages  as opposed to being able to see what you were doing at each moment of the time line also the device sets the bar for  reward  very low one exercise session got all the  zone minutes  suggested for the week      and when i had a bad week of late nights not getting to bed until   a m  i got a higher sleep score and was congratulated on establishing a healthy        bedtime also the type on all the screens is very small and difficult to read if you need reading glasses but don t always have them on  and the screen is always turning off just when you focus to read it and the interface with the computer and the iphone isn t great  i had to go onto the computer and search all around and look on the community boards for over an hour to not find an answer to how to add the elliptical counter on my watch  i finally found it buried in one of the menus because of a second trip to the community board and seeing something that gave me an idea of where i might look  though it was unrelated   badly organized i can t recommend this device to anyone  for anything  it will count steps and if that s what you want don t get this but get a pedometer  everything else this device  can do  other devices can already do it  like apps for your phone  or a simply physical count of your heart beat       
103,1.0,                       this device arrived   weeks late and clearly previously used or refurbished   it was missing it s protective plastic film  arrived with a dead battery and had someone else s text messages on the device   not sure if fitbit or amazon is to blame  but either way it s going back        
104,5.0,                       i upgraded from my charge  when the screen stopped displaying lines   the battery life is comparable   i haven t used the gps yet  but may in the future   for now the watch works it is listed as being compatible with the charge  charger  but i haven t had luck using that   it may also require a specific amperage output as some of my battery backup charges don t charge it  but that s on me and not an issue with the watch      
105,1.0,                       edited  do not buy this product unless you want to lose it within    days  the band is a piece of junk     the purpose of a band is to keep it safely on your arm  my band is not on my arm and is now lost original review  this purchase replaces my alta hr which lasted for three or more years  i do love this new charge    it s technically a wonderful piece of equipment  however  mechanically the basic wrist band is designed for low tech irritation  every  dang  time  i attempt to remove it properly the band releases from the top of the device  what the heck  today i was doing sit ups and the band released from the exact same place  imagine that frustration  i take it off the shower  to change clothes and i m annoyed by the faulty disconnect   how can such a great product be attached to such a piece of garbage band  am i supposed to buy a second band after having this for less than a month i am going to try to be compensated for my lost watch due to the defective band  i will post my results  if i am not treated fairly  i ll also post the fitness tracker that best replaces the fitbit band   the seller offered me a     credit towards a new band  my february  st purchase is lost because of the original band  why would i want another band  i have no tracker to use it with  i will never buy frothis seller   am questioning my trust in amazon who allows such lousy customer service conclusion  this seller is subpar to say the least  amazon excelled by resolving my issue with speed and fairness  thank you amazon and your great customer service  i had to spend a lot of time to resolve this moral of the story  the seller stinks  amazon is trustworthy  sainath was the outstanding employee at amazon who took care of my problem  thank you  sainath      
106,2.0,                       after a week of using this  fitbits flagship tracker  i can definitely say i m extremely disappointed with its performance  i purchased this specifically to map my routes via gps and track my daily runs walks  the gps is constantly mis mapping my route and also about     of the time it just randomly stops recording my exercise  about a quarter of the time the entire exercise stops recording  gps  distance tracking  everything  the only part of this that seems to work with any consistency or accuracy is the daily pedometer  heart rate monitoring  and sleep monitoring  i got this model specifically because it has built in gps and is supposed to be able to record routes  and in that regard it has failed      
107,3.0,                       gps feature is virtually useless and i don t use it  when i have it turned on it grossly underestimates distance  you cannot turn gps on off using mobile app  you must wait until you have access to a pc  invest in another tracker if that feature is important as you will drain the battery quickly  you can tether to your phone  but that defeats the purpose others have complained about issues with setup   i had no problems  although it took a few days for the software update to take effect it seems less sensitive than the charge   that i had and liked  it frequently undercounts the number of steps or flights of stairs a lot more than the   i like that i can customize the display  i also like that i can read texts after they come in if i don t glance at them right away  i prefer the previous method of calculating exercise  number of minutes vs  minutes in zone  all in all it s a good tracker for the money  i wish they had done more beta testing before releasing it  if you need a good gps  i suggest you go for a bulkier watch that is designed for that purpose      
108,1.0,                       i ve had the fitbit charge   for   months now  almost nothing about it actually works the good   sleep tracking seems to work decently  it rarely records me as awake when i m asleep and vice versa the bad   heart rate is off very often  at rest it will sometimes display twice my heart rate  e g  it will show     bpm when my pulse is    as measured by hand or an arm cuff   while exercising it will sometimes show a value half my heart rate  might show    when my pulse is clearly     bmp   and sometimes it s off by some other factor  generally much higher than my actual pulse    heart rate is used to calculate calories burned and  active zone minutes   so neither of those values are meaningful since they are based on bad data   steps  not very accurate  i ve tried walking    steps in a straight line and seeing how many steps are counted  sometimes it counts    sometimes it counts more than     sometimes after i stop and look at the steps  i ll watch the number continue to increment up to half a dozen additional steps while i stand motionless   the android app is really bad  the  home  screen that shows overviews of the main stats and the sub screens for specific stats often disagree  sometimes the home screen will show up to date data while the sub screens have outdated data  but more often the subscreens have updated data that the home screen does not show  for example    the  steps  sub screen usually shows hours where i hit the steps goal that are not shown in the home screen unless i kill and restart the app  the home screen might say i hit my goal for   hour while the steps sub screen will say i hit it for   hours  killing and restarting the app  which will quickly become habit if you buy one of these   often fixes that    the heart rate sub screen shows little sparklines  one for each day  but those plots don t actually update unless you go into the sub sub screen by tapping the sparkline  once you ve gone to the full screen plot for a specific day  the sparkline will show correctly in the heart rate sub screen  but not always   until i do that  i just see blank space where the heart rate plots should be    the weight tracking feature is buggy and sometimes changes values i ve entered  if i enter      it usually changes to       when i hit save  if i try entering it repeatedly  eventually it will keep the correct value   spam  i get spam friend requests weekly from the  community  features of that app that i do not use  these cannot be disabled  i block and report the profiles  but it doesn t stop the next spam request that is sure to come along  how are they even finding me if i don t use any of those community features overall i am very disappointed and strongly recommend against buying one of these      
109,5.0,                       i got this as a replacement for my charge    i like the additional features and the customizable faces that have been added  it s nice to be able to scroll back and look at past texts on my fitbit that i haven t cleared out  my only negative is that it occasionally disconnects from my phone and won t notify me if someone called texted  it will randomly just pick up notifying me again  despite me not changing dnd or any other feature      
110,1.0,                       this watch didn t last   months  i purchased the charge   on april           i always took care of it  charging it when the battery got to      i never had it near water  even though it says you can swim with it on  september          i put it on the charger  and it never worked after  it s not worth the money i paid for it i owned the charge   prior to this watch  and it lasted for   years   don t waste your time or money on this watch  its not worth it      
111,2.0,                       not impressed  the good  gps is definitely better than the fitbit charge    the bad  battery life is horrible  you need to be re charging every other day  with my fitbit charge    i d go days without having to worry about re charging my charge    with the charge   you have check daily because i always find myself with only     or so amount left  everything else is the same  same limited exercises as favorites  same list of exercises to choose from  eg  here in florida  many of us paddleboard  however you d either have select  walking  or  kayaking  as an exercise of choice  overall  it s a very average  adequate for exercise tracking  if you already own a fitbit charge   and it s working  keep that one   there is no real benefit or upgrade going to the fitbit charge        
112,1.0,                       this is the second fit bit that i bought new   the charge   lasted almost   years and then the sleep tracking went   i bought the charge   in late november on sale   not worth even the sale  price   worked one day with the sleep tracking the rest of the time since late november i was calling and writing fitbit support to help   they did try  but it worked maybe two or three times with partial tracking   then   weeks ago  they sent me another  fitbit  just the tracker  no band  no charger nothing   again  worked one day and then nothing    i have had it with this fitbit charge     returned   waste of money     
113,5.0,                       love my fitbit charge     it is like my personal trainer and motivator   it s accurate and helpful with keeping accurate track of my fitness activity and goals   the sleep tracking part is very very helpful  to me   i m a huge fan and would highly recommend to anyone wanting to up their own fitness level   it s a very good tool      
114,1.0,                       this was my  st fitbit and it will be my last  the setup process will make you want to throw your own mother out of a window  like  it should not be that hard to connect and set up  you should not have to constantly go to youtube just to find out how you can try to get this to work  and that is try  it does not  i have had for almost a week now and what is the point of sleep  tracker  and so much more if it will not sync the problem is you have the company that created the fitbit and then you have another company that created the app for the fitbit and they do not work together in which the product does not work  like seriously   so now i not only wasted my money and time  i am going to waste more time and money taking this thing back   i would rather stay a fat a   s then go through all this crap  lol zero stars              
115,1.0,                       this item never gets past the icon with a scrolling web address for setup  i successfully set up the app  charged the fitbit  and got it connected but the display screen only showed the setup web address  so i reversed all that and set it up on my computer  same issue  fitbit is fully charged  connected to an app  and everything should be kosher but it won t display anything  in researching solutions i see this is a very common problem with the new charge    i tried many suggested work arounds but with no success  additionally many of the work arounds recommend turning the item on and off but this fitbit won t respond to me holding the button  it gives intermittent vibrations but doesn t do anything  for two days after i charged it i could only get a black screen  it wouldn t turn on or scroll or anything  even when on the charger  then  randomly after two days  it came on but still only showed the setup screen i m pretty good with technology and can figure it out but nothing i tried with this worked  plus i grew resentful that it was even necessary for me to spend my time trying to find fixes  especially after spending this much money on a new product  seems like there should have been attention paid to all these bugs before they released this version      
116,4.0,                       i have been using a fb one for several years and upgraded to this one for the heartbeat function   i m not sure how accurate it is as the rate doesn t always seem to fit my activity   however  i take a beta blocker and i think that might influence heart rate the silver band that comes with it would only fit a child   i do not have a large wrist   i am able to use the black rubber band but it is a bit of a struggle to take it on and off plus it is ugly   just wondering if the small nice looking silver band is deliberately small so i will buy one of their larger ones      
117,1.0,                       not sure why i gave it a start for fitness tracking   it froze up the first time i used it   gps is always shutting off   it shut off completely when i took on a run   no activity shows up for three days and i wore it the whole time     
118,1.0,                       my   yo son used his own  hard earned money to make his first  big  purchase  and he might as well have burned it  there exists a gap between the band and the charge  itself which makes the band detach too easily  we now know that this has been reported all over the web  unfortunately  the fitbit fell off his wrist while swimming in a lake  not only is it advertised as a useful swimming device  it has a swimming app  i do not recommend it  especially if you plan to swim      
119,2.0,                       the screen is next to impossible to see in direct sunlight  do not buy this if you plan to use it for outdoor activities one of the main reasons i purchased this watch was so i could check my heart rate and pace while running  even when shielding the watch with one hand or getting under shade  it is extremely difficult to see because the screen is too dim  the only options for brightness level are  dim    normal   and  auto   all of which are not bright enough to actually see the screen in direct sunlight  apparently this is a big issue with fitbit charge     as a lot of people have complained about it on their forums the other features of the watch are decent  sleep tracking  calorie counting  step counting  and the gps all have worked well for me  however  the watch is pretty much useless outdoors  so i cannot recommend purchasing it and i regret buying it      
120,3.0,                       wore out my second charge   so i thought i would upgrade  it made it easier that it was still compatible to my three bands which i had invested in a few of i would not buy this color again  it didn t match as well my other bands  like my previous black or rose gold had i don t use spotify so that feature was a pass  and i m not a runner so the built in gps isn t much use for me the bands don t seem to fit as snugly as my previous charge   s  not sure if its the material of this purple one specifically but i scrapped it up real bad while rock climbing  hadn t have any issues with my others besides minor wear on my others      
121,4.0,                       i hate wearing any kind of watch to bed  so i honestly don t know about the sleep tracker  what i can tell you is that i love the fitbit app  which is why i came back to it after several failed attempts with other trackers  the step and heart rate monitors seem to be accurate  and the screen is bright enough to see without squinting  one of the major flaws of other trackers i used   it s not a smart watch  so if you re buying a watch for all the bells and whistles  this isn t the one you want  still  for my purposes  it s exactly what i wanted  an accurate tracker with an outstanding app  the band seems a little flimsy at the points of connection to the watch  but otherwise the band itself is sturdy  as far as the watch itself is concerned  i only wish that you could customize activities or that a larger variety of activities were available  but still for the amount i paid  i super happy with the purchase      
122,5.0,                       this is very good tracker  for those who wanted a gps on the tracker  coming from a charge   it is a big upgrade  the battery life is good i got about   days  the bands are easy to remove and replace  the charge   has most of features this one has except the gps feature and it is cheaper  with the gps on during an activity drains the battery alot  until a recent firmware update the display  would turn on at night when i am trying to sleep  but with this update you can turn the twist the wrist to display off when you sleep  the latest update gives the to use the built in gps or your phone s gps or none  also you change the screen off time too      
123,3.0,                       this fitbit was giving me a fit  found it challenging to get answers  looked at lots of u tube  finally chatted with support  best to do upgrades and psych often  this is my second fit bit  i wanted the tracker  still have some quirks when disconnecting an excercise     
124,4.0,                       thought this would be a good upgrade for my recently deceased charge   good things i loved the rosewood color  it paired relatively quickly and i tested all the features honest review i discovered that the nfc for fitbit pay wouldn t take all the cards i wanted to use so it was relatively useless  i also had to manually enter each card and wait to see what the app said  no thanks   i discovered i still had to turn spotify on on something else      before i could work with it on my wrist  no ability to cycle the music or pick anything   so that feature wasn t useful either i don t run  so gps means little to me as well   clock faces     meh  those weren t going to change that much so i returned it and got another charge    im ok with no upgrade conclusion   you might like it   i turned out not to need the upgrades   i m sad tho   i loved the rosewood color a whole lot   but it s not worth it for just a color change      
125,1.0,                       simple put  skip buying this fitbit and find a better product from another company  this device cannot connect to a computer via usb or bluetooth  nor any modern phone or mobile device  we tried connecting it to a range of devices and os  nothing worked   we tried a brand new iphone     a  year one samsung  a two year old samsung and event an old android phone  plus we tried   macbook pros  a macbook air and an ipad  not one would make a bluetooth connection   so i cant rate the fitbit  but i can tell you that the product is flawed when it is this difficult to get it to work   if this experience has taught me anything  fitbit is not producing a quality product  go buy something else  i will      
126,4.0,                       i loved how light and compact my old inspire hr was  and it worked just fine for what it was  battery life was great and using connected gps with the app was very accurate  except    when setup as using  running  in app map was accurate  but no heart rate info  when using app to track run had non stop issues with screen freezing and not able to pause stop finish run without rebooting phone    and the time it took to realize you had a problem  reboot  get back into the app and finally hit stop was all added up as the time kept going  made it look like your last split was done crawling on your stomach  now my runs are gps tracked started finished right from charge   and it works perfectly as long as you wipe the sweat off your fingertip  so much nicer and cleaner than fumbling with the phone to hit the finish button  and didn t think the sleep tracking on the charge   would be a big deal but wow it works  i honestly didn t fully realize how bad my sleep hygiene was until i saw how little actual sleep i was getting  thanks fitbit  gave me the push i needed to turn off the devices and get to bed on time  the estimated o  variation could be a life saver if it gives you a heads up that you might be developing sleep apnea  they aren t allowed to say that just yet  and was happy to see only little variation for myself  very happy with the charge   and am very glad i upgraded  the one elephant in the room of the way too short battery life on device gps has been worked around on the latest firmware update allowing connected gps  so now the best of both worlds  however seems to be small bug somewhere as connected gps map is showing a straight   mile line instead of the real route but that s for another time        
127,3.0,                       i m returning this because multiple sites said it tracks oxygen levels but failed to mention you have to pay for a premium subscription in order to do this  also  during sleep tracking it doesn t track depth of sleep  otherwise seemed to work well as a fitness tracker in the two days i used it      
128,1.0,                       i loved fitbit for years  passing on garmin  apple and whoop devices  but i ve had two      faulty charge   devices in a row  and i m losing it  this device replaced a brand new one that didn t register exercise  a couple months later this one stopped too  i know my workouts  and i can almost tell my zones  this device  from dec        barely registers any exercise  i m not wearing this for show  i need the data  get your act together  fitbit      
129,1.0,                       i got the charge   as a replacement for my flex which was slowly losing its ability to hold a charge  i m not really interested in all the bells and whistles  but wanted something that would offer a watch face and count stairs because stair climbing in my condo has become my winter time activity  the first thing i noticed is that it doesn t track my steps accurately  so my step count went down slightly  i can live with that  but then i climbed    flights of stairs and it tracked    the next day i climbed no stairs and it tracked    i checked to see if this was a known problem  and apparently this has been an issue for quite some time  the final nail in the coffin for me was the morning it showed my resting heart rate at      i felt my pulse and it felt quite normal to me  not the galloping     it was registering  so i got out the bp cuff and it read my heart rate as     which is pretty normal for me so if i can t rely on the accuracy of the step count or the flight count or even my heart rate  why would i think that any of the other data is reliable  the only thing that has worked reliably has been the clock  given that  i d rather just wear a wristwatch  i can find one of those that s a lot more stylish the charge   is going back and i won t be getting another      
130,3.0,                       i wanted something that would both track my activity and give me phone alerts  while this touts that it does phone alerts  it absolutely does not  a quick google search will reveal hundreds of forums of people who have the same problem of not being able to get the charge   to give them phone alerts  calls  texts  emails  etc  there s no instruction book on how to use it  which is particularly annoying that they re too cool for a quick slip of paper that shows you what the different gestures do  instead directing the user to the app  which also contains no directions  to rectify this  a number of youtube videos have been made by users to help other users  why couldn t fitbit just do this it s fine for an activity tracker  but it does not deliver on what it promises in being more than that      
131,1.0,                       i have owned   fitbits  my first one worked great for awhile but the notifications suddenly stopped  it seemed to be just outdated technology compatibility  i bought this one less than a year ago  while using an iphone   pro  the notifications have never worked i contacted customer service everything said that an update was coming and it was a known issue   months later  no resolution or updated fitbit keeps saying they re working on it  they also claim it doesn t fall under warranty and i can t return now i wouldn t buy this product  i d invest in an apple watch or another product instead     
132,3.0,                       after initially rating this product a one star  i m upgrading it to three stars   today  unlike initially  the exercise specifications seemed more realistic   doing essentially the same distance and terrain i used earlier  today  my average heart rate was     bpm  and my maximum was      which seems reasonable for my age       perhaps  the unit takes time to adjust to the user   if this continues  i ll upgrade this to four stars initial review  i used this fitbit charge   to record a hike the day after i received it   according to the fitbit  my average heart rate over roughly an hour of hiking was     bpm  and my maximum heart rate was     bpm   in two months  i ll be    years old   according to the average of six heart rate estimating formulas  my maxim heart rate would be roughly     bpm     below that on the fitbit   something is very wrong with the fitbit s heart rate mechanism      
133,2.0,                          update             i noticed shortly after writing this review that the wristbands do not attach snugly to the face of the watch   my wife has a charge   and hers fit snugly on hers and mine   mine are loose on hers     something is wrong with the wristbands   i also noticed there is an exceptionally long thread on fitbit s community site regarding this exact issue  some like mine  and some worse   contacting fitbit  i got the response that many on that thread got   you have to ship in your device to us  then when we receive it  we ll ship you a replacement    some users reported getting used devices in return   that ends up being     days turnaround time   more serious though is that fitbit makes a crap ton of money by convincing health providers to get employers to use these things  in order to save on health premiums   they should be cross shipping  at a minimum  or shipping you a new device first  so that you don t have down time with no device also in the thread were comments that third party wristbands were better  but no one specified an exact item that i could see  so i ordered at random    we ll see   it s not flat out broken  but if it s loose  there s room for it to catch on a shirt or other object  and ripping it apart inadvertently   this is not up to fitbit s own standards   bad form  fitbit    i have a usb bluetooth adapter for my windows    computer   the fitbit app refuses to acknowledge it exists and won t even attempt setup my wife has a fitbit usb dongle from her old fitbit hr that she uses on her windows    computer for her charge   and it works fine   using it in my computer lets the setup get a little further  but still errors out  suggesting i turn on bluetooth   my other bluetooth enabled devices see it on  and it is enabled in windows      i should also point out that all the error messages are tailored for an android device    so windows is apparently an afterthought i have a smartphone  but i don t like to drain my battery all day letting it check in repeatedly  when i can just do it at my leisure on my pc when it s charging   i am really disappointed that i can t use my windows pc or a generic bluetooth adapter otherwise  it s a fitbit   got to have use one to qualify for cheaper insurance at work      
134,5.0,                       i purchased the charge   originally to track my runs  enable interval training without having to take my phone with me  and just as a general watch me and my spouse were so into all the features and tracking the app provided that i got him his own charge   and an aria   smart scale for us both our experience so far has been fantastic  with the exception of one small miss step of a tracker that wouldnt pair to anything  but was handled well by fitbit support and rapidly replaced by amazon the gps on the exercise feature can take some time to begin tracking  so keep that in mind before turning it on  and starting a run to find out afterward it missed the first half mile      
135,1.0,                       this product was delivered with a     battery  i recharged it to       every   hours it had to be recharged  i had to call fitbit to find out if there was issues with this product  they said they have received complaints about the battery draining  hopefully this will be rectified     
136,3.0,                       syncing problems are constant  every single day when i try to sync it has issues but it does it eventually  battery life doesn t last as long as i d like  and i have noticed a couple times that it ll miss steps  i ve always loved fitbit and i had an alta hr before this      
137,5.0,                       easy to use and very easy to look at heart rate  steps  sleep  and even tracking my cycle  i had charge   and after little more than a year it died so i got charge   and so glad it fits special band i had ordered for my charge    also nice that uses same charger so now i have two  i do wish fitbit would fix the quick reply feature to work with iphones  i like to see texts and sometimes would be great to reply from fitbit but it doesn t work      
138,1.0,                       i bought this watch as a birthday present for my wife  in less than   months  the plastic wrist band mounting bracket on the side of the watch snapped off   making the watch useless unless you just wanted to carry it around in your pocket as a timepiece   my wife said the watch just fell off her wrist   she doesn t remember snagging it or banging it against anything   upon closer inspection  the broken plastic appears to have been previously glued  which is what i did since it s beyond the time limit for returning it to amazon  maybe it ll last a couple more months  that was         not well spent      
139,4.0,                       love my fit bit  small and efficient but down side is every time a new  one comes out  the product itself starts to die like   n a half   years in of everyday use   im disabled to so i don t like thrash it around   i baught the fake one   the app sucks  fr  i also like the interfaces u can choose from and how efficient it us  id say buy a wareanty always   i lve gone through    and had to repurchase them sadley cuz they start to burn out right when the   year line finishes     
140,3.0,                       overall i like the fitbit  however  it needs some work  i often question the accuracy of the heart rate and caloric burn trackers  they tend to either not capture my exercise at all  or they are well over what i performed  i also notice that if my wrist is sweaty  which is often when i am exercising  the accuracy of my heart rate precipitously declines  also a few times i have had to just let it die completely because it had frozen on one screen  not to mention the fact that i have never been able to receive text message notifications  everything else i get fine      
141,1.0,                       i really like the features this watch has to offer  i had a charge   for   years  and finally had to part ways with it because i absolutely wore it out  i bought the charge    and really loved all the new features and upgrades over the charge    however  this is a poorly designed watch  i bought this watch in july       and it broke on christmas  the piece that snaps into the band has two screws that hold the  catch snap  into the watch  well  the piece with the screws sheared off inside the band  i flipped my wrist to look at the time  and the watch fell off  no pulling  snatching  etc  i ve seen where several other people have had the same thing happen to them  i ve worn my watch every day for the past   months  and i guess the constant turning to look at time just kept pulling on the plastic piece until it snapped  my charge   was all one piece and metal  the charge   actual watch is separate from the snap and is plastic  my daughter got a charge   for christmas  before i knew mine was going to break  so we ll wait and see what happens with hers  i would not encourage you to buy this watch though  i m very disappointed in this watch design    i will update after speaking to fitbit customer service       
142,3.0,                       the device itself is surprisingly mediocre  in terms of gps it s a complete dud  so much so  they did an update to use your phone gps when available in addition  the battery is rather bad  it promises   days on the box  but i m getting approximately   to    not a huge deal while working from home everything else is pretty much expected for a tracker  general step tracking  notifications  reminders  etc for       it probably is not worth it  but i get reimbursed by my company  so at free it s ok      
143,4.0,                       i like this fitbit although haven t used the gps feature or for running   i have only had another fitbit which was an old fitbit charge hr   this new model is ok   i don t like that often when i raise my hand to look at it the display does not show   i have to shake my hand or tap the display   also the notifications for my text messages do not show   i have an iphone   finally sometimes i do long workouts but they do not get automatically detected by the app so it lacks accuracy   overall is an ok product but i feel it could work better for the price and compared to other old models      
144,3.0,                       i ve had this device for   months and the band has a visible gap and looseness at the top of the device  this is apparently a known issue with fitbit but their resolution is to make you pay to ship the device back and then they will replace it with another defective device after leaving you device less for an extended period of time  horrible resolution and the back and forth with customer service has been exhausting  last time i walked away from fitbit was for a similar concern  might be walking away again  some things clearly never change     
145,1.0,                       waste of money  i was excited to finally buy a fitbit and start my fitness journey    coming out of the box it looked perfect  prestine  i downloaded the app  and started following the steps given to me  i plugged the charge   correctly into a tested working charger  got the initial smiley face  thought everything was going smoothly as i tried to set up the app on my phone  ran into a slight problem when i tried to connect my device via bluetooth but thought nothing of it  after all i just purchased it and maybe it needs time to charge before it comes on  waited for it to charge  started this process within    minutes of it s delivery    hours have passed  pressed the button on the side while it was plugged  and it vibrated twice but the screen didn t come on  attempted this again  tried to set up the device again via the app  didn t work  after awhile of pressing the button  the watch continued to vibrate even when i removed my finger  the screen is still blank  the watch i purchased was defective  i m not sure if it s the seller s or manufacturer s fault but i m highly disappointed  i don t want a refund  i want a working watch on another note  the app is great      
146,1.0,                       wife and i bought matching fitbits at the same time   paired to the same model phones   and hiked the same trails at the same time   numbers for everything category very different   positively surprised this company only provided support thru twitter dm   stop right here   any technology company that makes support impossible and or hard to access is peddling a known faulty product   take it from a long time tech support manager    once we did reach  of course they were absolutely no help whatsoever   canned bs responses that didn t match up to the circumstance or issues   they absolutely refused to acknowledge and consider the fact of   devices paired to same model phones walking the same trail at the same time produced wildy different numbers in the end  these are just estimating activity values based on suspected body movements  yea  the device once told me i walked a quarter mile while eating a bowl of soup   the arm up an down movements mimic d walking motion   and that s not the only thing producing bad data      there s absolutely no way to validate or prove the numbers   and that s how they like it   and that s why they don t compare results if you re looking for apps that don t work as advertised from companies that don t or can t support their products   you could probably get a better deal somewhere else   if you re looking for an app to make data up and send you messages throughout the day  i can write you one at a fraction of the cost   i ll also provide an email address you can use to send messages too      
147,2.0,                       i tried to add a photo  but i guess it s not working today  i ordered this fitbit on june           i received it a few days later  i think it works great  but my problem is that the spot on the fitbit that allows you to change the band to other bands broke off and the fitbit is not wearable anymore after less than   months  the fitbit still works  but you can t connect a band to it  i tried to superglue the part back on  but it didn t work  i am a older woman in my late   s  i walk for exercise  i was not hard on this product  i think that something that is as expensive as this should last longer than   months thank you for your time      
148,1.0,                       i ordered the fitbit   in nov  because my previous older version stopped alerting me to get up every hr  to move   i did not start using the new fitbit until yesterday   the hourly activity get up and move does not work on this one at all  unfortunately for me  i am unable to return it  i wish i hadn t waited so long to start using it  i went on line to look for a solution to my problem it seems this fitbit   has a problem with with setting up the  hourly activity  to alert you to get up and move  don t buy this one or make sure you check that feature to make sure it works before your window to return it closes  so disappointed and angry at myself for waiting so long to set this up      
149,3.0,                       i had a different one of these but it didn t seem accurate so i wasted my money to buy this one and it s the same as the other   it ll say i was  asleep  at a certain time but i was awake posting stuff on facebook at that time   happens every night   then they make you pay extra for features that were free on my other watch      complete waste of money     
150,1.0,                       replaced my first order  the screen would not turn on and all the fitbit support could not get it to work  the replacement worked great until         when the display kept turning off and on and vibrating like crazy randomly  eventually  the side button stopped responding  the face lights up to charge only  but the side button does not work  i can tell it is still tracking from the app  support said it is faulty and to contact the seller to return  the return date ended         for me  i do not recommend fitbit and am encouraging others to not purchase or risk wasting money like i did      
151,2.0,                       fitbit charge   fitness and activity trackerthe good  product works great  liked it for a while  kept me motivated until  the bad   fitbit refunded me so i m happy the bad  the material it s made out of is total garbage  unfortunately i was unaware that many people are allergic to the material that this tracker is made from  very bad for a wearable  i can no longer wear this  ever  it give me a horrible rash  the first rash took about a month to appear  now i can t even wear it for a day without getting the rash back  from what i have read it s unclear if the issue is the chemicals used for the rubber in the watch or if it s the nickel in the band but it is for many a unwearable wearable  my skin is not sensitive at all  but i wasted      on this  great tech  horrible materials      
152,5.0,                       this is my first health tracker  the device is pretty good  it needs to be charged about every three or four days so that is easily achieved without losing too much data  it charges quickly normally when i take a shower and that is good enough for days i always had a problem wearing watches because of a rash developing under the band but i don t seem to have that problem with the charge   the phone  android  app is very good i have had sleep problems for decades since i was a teenager  not sleep apnea but just trouble getting a good night s sleep every night  this device does appear to accurately measure my sleep patterns based on how i feel the next day my only major complaint is the fitbit website and them trying to jam advertising into my face all the time  when i get automatically logged out every day so  i click the login link and login  it takes me right back to the homepage and i need to click the link for the dashboard which is buried on a drop down menu my ublock origin stops about   or    tracking links every time i refresh the dashboard page i don t know how long there was a big banner ad for the charge   when they knew i had one already because it is configured into the application       
153,5.0,                       i love this   it is water proof  for swimming and shower   tracks calories in and out  by logging food   easy scan barcodes for dietary data  buzzes to remind you to move  notifies you of messages on cell or incoming call  heart rate  weight  and other awesome features   so happy with my purchase  if you re trying to focus more on being healthy  or lose weight   this is for you      
154,5.0,                       i got this because i wanted a fitness tracker and had bad experiences with other fitness smart watches  i m a bit clumsy and this has been smacked around a bit but has held up pretty darn great  tracking is relatively accurate and gives me a great snapshot of my workouts and activity level with a few taps  nice and easy to use      
155,1.0,                       i am extremely disappointed  it will not connect to anything  i tried all the troubleshooting  and even looked on forums  and i am not the only one with this issue  i cannot recommend this to anyone since it s brand new and does not work  i just received it today and will be returning it  i spent   hours trying to get it to do something      
156,2.0,                       i ve been looking forward to getting a fitbit  but i m so disappointed in this  it s incredibly accurate  outside  it misses anywhere between        of my steps  in my house it misses        of them  i ve adjusted my stride length to try to help and it s still way off  on top of that  the heart rate is so far off as to be ridiculous while working out  i stopped several times to check my heart rate and while my heart rate will be between          the fitbit will mostly read between          occasionally jumping to     for a minute  but those higher intervals never show up in the app  so i don t get credit for them in my stats the sleep tracking is great though  so it s got that going for it      
157,5.0,                       i finally upgraded my fitness watch from a cheap branded one to a fitbit charge    i really like how accurate this watch is compared to the other one i have  because it can do so many more things  it s taking me longer to learn how to use the different features  but i love it so far  the fitbit app tracks so many things  exercise  including walks  runs  swim  bike  treadmill  and outdoor workouts   heart rate  sleep patterns  womens monthly  some manually  some it predicts   calories burnedand manually  you can also track   daily water intake  meals and carbsalso  the watch has   current temperature outside  based on location   gps tracking  spotify  timer alarms  that actually wake you up  up   fitbit pay  so you dont need to haul your wallet around also  they have encouraging videos  breathing exercises and more that you can also use i really like that this watch is water proof  i never take it off except to charge or change the bands to match my outfit  it came with   color of bands in   sizes  but i chose to buy a multi pack of other colorful bands so far  i think this watch and the fitbit app deserve   star reviews      
158,5.0,                       mobile app is a little difficult and the sleep accuracy is off by a few hours  the band broke in my sleep into the actual watch  very disappointed with the actual fitbit   never had this problem with previous fitbit or cheaper versions for that matter     
159,1.0,                       i got my fitbit charge   on monday  went through the whole charging and set up process only to find out that the screen was unresponsive   defective  hence  after hours of trouble shooting  working very hard to find customer support  i had to waste time returning it  got the second one by today wednesday  nice    after hourse of setting it up and looking trough forums to try and find my way around similar issues  because customer support isn t responding or hangs up  i disovered that numerous other clients complain of the exact same things having tried with more than one device  as well  just figure the man hours fitbit is making it s customers waste  check the forums for yourself before you waste time and money   really not worth it      
160,2.0,                       i liked the fitbit for the purposes of tracking my fitness activity and sleep cycles  what i did not like was that the band attachment completely broke off on one side of the watch face  i m not able to place another band because there is nothing to attach it to  i have only had it for   months  i took good care of it and was never rough with it  my husband had the same exact fitbit and the same thing happened to his band after   months  fitbit customer service told him that they could not replace it  not buying it again  two stars for doing its job of activity tracking but i can t wear it anymore now  feels like i wasted my money      
161,1.0,                       my wife doesn t have an apple device or watch so she asked for a fitbit charge   for mothers day  i ordered it and within four days it arrived  she is extremely knowlageble when it comes to electronics   has never had any issues setting up any other electronic devices but the fitbit took her    days and finally took another one hour with a factory representative to get it functional  the  issue was with the android app in communicating with the watch   save your time   frustrations      
162,3.0,                       this watch is overpriced for the quality of what you get  a versa   is     more  the screen it glitchy and the  touch  button on the side hardly works  i d rather have a charge   where my button actually works      
163,4.0,                       hr monitor is accurate  distance measurement seems to be overestimating how much i walk  display not very good  screen resolution is poor and touch sensitivity can be finicky  light  confortable to wear for long periods even at night  battery life seems to be as advertised  app functionality seems good so far  considering current options  this is a good choice  but there s a lot of room for improvement with all smartwatches in general      
164,1.0,                       do not buy this from amazon  buy from fitbit  i purchased this product and it never turned on  i charged it and did everything possoble to turn it on and the screen was always black  i called fitbit support which helped walk me through the process and the tech notified me that the product was broken  instead of dealing with amazon s impossible to navigate return policy  fitbit offered me an easier return and replacement option  amazon typically will buy damaged goods and sell them because they get a bulk deal  this isn t the first time i have ordered something through amazon that arrived defected or broken  it is infuriating and wastes my time  rule of thumb  try to get things from the company for large purchses or tech gadgets  this way you can ensure the product works properly and you can deal directly with the manufacturer instead of amazon      
165,1.0,                       want to know how long your workout took you  how long it took to run eight miles or hike five  compete with yourself to see how quickly you can accomplish an activity  basic info anyone who works out would want  right  there is no where on this app where you can see that info  they changed the active minutes to  active zone  minutes  a completely useless metric that tells you how many minutes fitbit thinks you deserve based on your heart rate  this change is so disruptive  counter intuitive  and plain ridiculous that i m sending it back  i depend on real time active minutes  the amount of time i spend active in my    hour day  not some flaky hypothetical interpretation  i can get the intensity of my workout through heart rate and calories burned  i don t need inflated numbers  if you must coddle people  add the active zone feature somewhere  but don t replace the actual active minutes that let people know how much real time they ve spent exercising  shouldn t i be able to see that somewhere  what if i only have an hour and want to know which of my workouts i can do in that time  guess i m out of luck  oh  and if you re very active  disable the gps feature or your battery won t make it through the day  like i said  i m sending this back  which is a shame because i ve used fitbit for years  it s insane that i can t see my real active minutes without adding up four categories of numbers  i m looking at garmins  which i didn t want to do  but here we are      
166,1.0,                       i had this for under a week and though it did a great job of tracking sleep and steps   it was causing a very noticeable numbness in my arm  i shifted the watch on my wrist a few days ago and it sent a shock so powerful i almost passed out and had a seizure in public  i have had seizures before  but have not had one in over a year so it was alarming to be triggered so violently just wanted to write this here as i spent quite some time looking at reviews before i purchased this other cons  you cannot properly log exercise so it guestimates calories burned and over exaggerates potential calories burned whilst idle  so if you want a pedometer or sleep tracker   ok   but i would not recommend sleeping with this  the emf waves are powerful and may impact you      
167,1.0,                       the size of the font  and not  you can adjust the font  and the brightness of the screen make it impossible to see anything on the screen if you need reading glasses or want to read it when you are outside   it seems that fitbit only had    year olds with good eyesight with good eyesight test it out  because i can t read it without my reading glasses   and the brightness at normal is so weak  i can t see anything on the screen when i am in the sunshine  or even partly sunny    really disappointed and am deciding if i want to return it      
168,1.0,                       if you are looking for a device to consistently let you down  to perform poorly  and to in accurately record your fitness activity  fitbit is the device for you  i ve had several fitbit devices before this one and the quality has lowered with each new device  fitbit four claims to have an independent gps however its spotty at best and you ll still need to lean on your own phone gps more often than not to get any kind of recordings  at times it will report an increase in the number of your steps beyond what is physically possible while at other times it will fail to record large sections of your exercise route  in two weeks it s not needed to be reset several times consider a different fitness tracker      
169,1.0,                       it stopped syncing after exactly one month  when i saw other reviews stating there were syncing issues i thought it most likely user error so i went ahead and ordered this  sure enough it worked great and then suddenly stopped syncing  i did everything suggested by fitbit and still couldn t get it to work  it still works great for tracking steps  zone minutes  sleep  etc but i can no longer use it with the app which is disappointing      
170,1.0,                       i should ve kept the charge    the fitbit   that i ve had now for a week or two has already frozen  the battery life sucks too  i ve kept it on the charger for   days and it never went past      save your money update            so my fitbit   was replaced and   months later its acting up again  it doesn t come on when you turn your wrist or when you tap it  it stopped syncing my messages no matter how many times i reboot it  the band literally broke off while i was wearing it as if it was rusty and it constantly says no score  no data    or     when it s supposed to monitor everything  i wish i could give it   stars     
171,5.0,                       pretty basic  it does what it promises  i really don t care for it  i bought this to sleep in  i already have an ionic which i wear in the day  fitbit changed something in their app so i can only have one unit synced  i actually have to delete one and reinstall the other one to switch  i huge pain  i use my ionic and just leave this sit  not knocking the product it is fine  just prefer my ionic      
172,3.0,                       the charge   is a tracking device that i have been looking for  with the features that allow me to swim and pay  without the phone on me  besides  it is a bit sleeker than the charge   i have had for years  however  the bluetooth pairing with my iphone    is very unstable  i need to re pair almost every time i turn on the app  very annoying    this happened twice with two separate   s   one being the replacement   now i am switching back to my charge     i hate to return both units  i am still waiting my refund  after    weeks  i really hope fitbit could get theirs acts together  otherwise  i won t be a loyal customer much longer  since applewatch   is lurking closely now      
173,4.0,                       hurts my wrist when sleeping with  which causes me not to wear    i smoke anyways  so who cares see visable bump   digs into skin if side sleeper    woke up with obvious anterior pain in wrist   great when hiking and want to impress fitbit wearing wife        
174,5.0,                       i bought this to replace my fitbit charge  which i loved  i only took it off for charging or for formal occasions where it wouldn t look right   i used it for over   years when if finally stopped keeping good time  now i m in love with my charge     it has many more features and i thoroughly enjoy each of them   i also think the fitbit app  is great   it really gives me good feedback in my activities  sleep  food tracking and motivation  i m in the process of reducing my weight and using the calorie counter helps immensely  the gps is very cool  you can see your walking running path and i can see on my heart rate tracker exactly where and when i m in cardio and fat burning  i can determine where on my path i get the best cardio   so now i am able to decide which walking running trail works best for me   so happy and this is well worth the price      
175,1.0,                       i eagerly awaited receipt of the charge   as an upgrade to my alta hr which i have enjoyed wearing for   years unfortunately  like many reviews here  the device would not setup after taking it fresh out of the box   this was a real disappointment   specifically  after connecting with the microsoft store app on my laptop  the watch itself would never show anything on its face past the setup screen and the scrolling website  www fitbit com setup    taps or pressing on the face did not progress or scroll to any other screen   the button on the side would cycle the watch through an apparent reset with no visible results other than the useless setup screen  or worse  it would just go dark  customer service  located in columbia  answered my call quickly enough  and after a few iterations quickly decided to rma the product so kudos for off shore support   yet  here i am now having to wait for another week for the replacement   obviously  there is a production issue with the device and i wonder if i will get a working product   like i said  i am a happy customer of fitbit alta hr  i am familiar with the tap interface for fitbit watches i will review again on receipt of the replacement charge        
176,1.0,                       my fitbit charge   broke and i was very excited to upgrade to a charge    i am having a horrible time trying to figure out how to use this  i have no idea what the icons on the watch mean and i can not figure out how to set anything up  this is not user friendly and i pretty much wish i never bought it      
177,3.0,                       i got this when it was first released to replace an ionic that has stopped recording   this feels  much  cheaper than the ionic  and the band didn t fit together with the electronics correctly  seems to be a known problem  and fitbit support sent a replacement  but i don t know that it is any better   i m going back to an ionic      
178,1.0,                       stopped working   days after    day return period  amazon not standing behind its products  don t buy anything electronic from them  you could be stuck with no returns      
179,1.0,                       this is my  rd fitbit in   years   not very accurate and didnt hold a charge      
180,2.0,                       i was really looking forward to using the charge    i purchased it as a replacement for my charge   that stopped synching with my phone  however  i ve tried it out for a couple days and it just doesn t work well  at first i couldn t get it to track flights of stairs at all  that was fixed after i reset the device  then i realized i wasn t getting alerts for text messages and i haven t been able to solve that problem  i m really frustrated because those are two of the main features i liked about the charge    i will be returning this item      
181,1.0,                       this model has thin plastic connectors for the bands   one broke off and there is no way to fix it and maintain functionality  i super glued it to the tracker but there is a button that needs to be pressed and now it is permanently stuck  my only option now is to super glue a band to that side  i had an alta for years  less functionality but better quality and durability  i do not recommend this product      
182,5.0,                       this product does everything that it says it does and is very easy to use  the sleep tracking has been extremely beneficial  as have the customizable alarms that wake you up from light sleep so that it s easier to get up in the morning  the alarms are also nice because they work by vibrating  so there isn t a loud noise that would wake anyone you re living with  the heart rate monitor is fairly accurate  as is the pedometer and altimeter  the active zone tracking system was a great idea  and it makes it easy to tell how much quality exercise i m getting in a week  the sedentary reminders are also really nice as someone who spends a lot of time at a desk  so far  everything has worked really well and with great accuracy  and it has helped me start getting in shape and start becoming healthier all around using the breathing and mindfulness exercises  i would strongly recommend this watch to anyone who is looking to be healthier and doesn t know where to start  or who wants to track their current health  or who wants to track how they re responding to a new medication  etc  i love this watch  and it does a lot for the price  i almost bought the inspire    but i m glad i paid the extra money for all of the extra features on this watch      
183,3.0,                       inaccurate  counts steps when i m not walking like when driving or playing video games  played video games for a few hours and next thing i knew i somehow walked      steps  same with driving  i also have   flights of stairs in my house that i use numerous times a day  it does not track my stairs correctly  in a normal day it says i did     flights of stairs when i ve done and easy        also when i m driving up the mountain from town it counts my altitude climb in my vehicle as doing stairs  went driving other day and got home and said i did    flights of stairs when i didn t even do    sleep tracking is best part but with other simple inaccuracies with steps and stairs  no telling what else is wrong      
184,2.0,                       there are certain things that are very good about this watch and then there are certain things that are simply a failure  if it is charged less than     it does not register stairs  i consider that a failure  it does not register my heart rate for a long period of time and i start exercising   to   minutes still on a low heart rate when my heart monitor strap tells me that i m at       when it finally does start to work it just goes right to the peak it does not show up correct during exercise  it does keep track of my steps most of the time  it does not give an accurate heart rate during exercise  that s its biggest failing      
185,5.0,                       to change something  you have to be able to measure it first  that s what the charge   excels at  be aware that a subscription to fitbit premium      month  is pretty much required in order to unlock all of the advanced features you ll want to use  overall  an outstanding investment that has me climbing more stairs every day      
186,1.0,                       just got my fitbit charge       months ago  within a month it already started having glitches and problems  it periodically fails to connect to my phone  and therefore cannot sinc or update  so i have to go through the process of turning bluetooth off on  restarting my phone  rebooting my fitbit  and then deleting and readding my fitbit to bluetooth and to the fitbit app  it also has died multiple times during an hour long workout with approx      battery left  or freezes up to the point i have to let the batter die then recharge it before i can use it again  i had a fitbit blaze before the charge   that did similar things but after about a year or   of use  i m convinced fitbit puts defective products on the market  unfortunately  i m outside of the return period  so i ll be sending my charge   back to be replaced  after   negative experiences with   different fitbits  i ll be switching to garmin in the future  do not buy this product and consider a different brand of fitness trackers in general      
187,2.0,                       i bought this for my wife for her birthday  but after only a few weeks with it  it has been failing reminders  which was a favorite feature of hers  used to work but now have stopped   she troubleshooted  went through and turned on all the location settings  rebooted the fitbit multiple times  turned options on and off  still nothing   the software seems glitchy text sync never worked  no matter how many times she s tried to get it working she says  it s comfortable but makes me disappointed  because it promised so much  and it also cost a lot too        
188,1.0,                       measures steps accurately   pulse monitor is very inaccurate   when ride bike  swim  lift weights  etc the pulse monitor does not accurately measure  being much lower than my actual pulse as measured by two different other pulse monitors worn at same time   resting sleeping pulse is also inconsistent on the fitbit   try to wear as directed as to position   since pulse rate is tied to most features other than step counting  then this makes the watch not worth wearing   certainly not worth the premium price   also  the app consistently loses pairing with the watch so that i have togo to setting  forget device and then pair it again   i was excited about the potential features of this watch but really if you can t trust the accuracy then why bother   needs improvement      
189,1.0,                       do your research before you buy it  you will find that so many people complaining about that gps takes time to connect or wont connect  or will loose connection during exercise  i have been a fitbit customer last few years  i was so excited to get built in gps option on charge    i do lots of biking  unfortunately  when you go biking on your charge    you wait   to    min for it to find gps signal and connect  and sometimes disconnects after connecting which means your exercise is not being tracked  i have latest updates  i have done hard reset  i have even chatted with a support but no solution      
190,1.0,                       i am so disappointed in this product   after three months of near constant wear  i went to take it off to charge and the casing disconnected from the band   i contacted customer service and waited forever  i left a message and waited well over two days   i wanted to keep using the device so i glued it back together so i could continue to use it  they finally got back to me and said that because i glued it  the warranty was invalid   i fully appreciate that modifying a working device invalidates a warranty but that s not what happened  i m super disappointed and will not repurchase a fitbit   there are enough competitors with better customer service and higher quality products      
191,1.0,                       i had the charge   which i liked a lot  a few weeks ago it died  i decided to upgrade to the charge   and i am very disappointed  there is no functionality to link your phone gps to the watch  what this means is that if you would like to do an all day adventure  like a long hike or kayak trip  you cannot track your effort  if you try to use your charge   s built in gps  it will run out of batteries and you will be no longer tracking anything until you get it recharged  the charge   had the functionality to link to your phone s gps allowing for tracking of long adventures  why get rid of that function  poor design and a poor purchase on my part      
192,1.0,                       i wanted to switch from my apple watch and be able to track my exercise and sleep routine w o having to charge it daily  this fitbit was very uncomfortable  it kept burning my wrist and waking me up at night  sleep tracker is not accurate   i slept my   hrs and it only tracked   hrs    min  mobile app is great but it just shows what the watch tracks  i was not satisfied  really not worth the          
193,2.0,                       i have recently upgraded from a charge   to a charge    however  i m extremely disappointed with the charge    i am an avid hiker that wishes to use this device for tracking lengthy day hikes  i also bicycle and  again  take long rides  it does not work well for these activities  there are two major issues of which i wish to warn buyers    gps is spotty and drains the battery  i primarily upgraded to the charge   because i wanted the  onboard gps  i have found the gps to be very unreliable  it shuts off with the slightest tree cover   my iphone has no problem establishing gps in the same conditions   also  with the gps running the battery life of the charge   is drastically reduced  it will not last more than an hour or two   not nearly long enough for a lengthy hike or bike ride the fitbit has  dynamic gps  which allows the charge   to use the phone and it s bigger battery for gps tracking instead of the onboard gps  that seems like a solution to this problem however it is not because of problem      bluetooth connection is unreliable  the bluetooth connection between the device and the phone is horribly unreliable  without a bluetooth connection the dynamic gps does not work and when the connection is dropped the activity is stopped  unknown to the user the activity is no longer tracking   i m having to re establish bluetooth pairing several times a day  i ve missed out on data for several hikes and bike rides  this is extremely frustrating  re establishing bluetooth is a long battle  i ve had it take up to    minutes  and i sometimes have to go to extreme measures to get the device to pair such as rebooting the fitbit and or phone  and even then  if it does pair  it will not stay paired i ve communicated with fitbit and they were not able to assist me  they offer suggestions such as turning bluetooth on off  or rebooting  reinstalling etc  these remedies will allow the fitbit to establish a connection leading the service representative to believe they have fixed the problem  but bluetooth just goes out again later after i ve ended the service call a search of the fitbit community group shows that these are ongoing issues for which fitbit  apparently  has no solution  i see similar posts here on amazon  i also see reviews from people that like the charge    perhaps it depends on how one uses it i ve had reasonable results with the gps for walks in urban settings  i do like the updated user interface  the sleep tracking  and that it is waterproof  but i warn day hikers bikers to beware  based on my experience the quality of the charge   gps  battery  and bluetooth are not adequate for these activities      
194,5.0,                       the charge   is an excellent motivator  in the beginning  i was expecting a good tracker for my sport activities and a way to monitor my sleep  the charge   has delivered that  and much  much more  it has become an essential companion that is always there to nudge me to do better and provides amazing and detailed feedback on my progress at all levels the cardiac activity tracker is simply amazing  the calorie counter very helpful to keep on top of a healthy diet  and the sleep analyzer provides great insight on quality of sleep  from which i have derived better sleep habits sport tracker is great  with multiple sports to choose from and automatic detection of activity  the gps is a nice feature  but does consume quite a bit of battery life  about     per hour   without using the gps  i have been to up to   days between charges  i highly recommend using the  sleep mode  at night to conserve battery life the charge   is light  unobtrusive  comfortable to wear  verifiably waterproof  best of all  it does not burden you with all the technical complexity of what is does  behind the scenes   but instead presents you with simple and easy to understand reports  and great advice   recommendations too  i was never a big fan of  meditation   but i have to confess  i used the various sessions provided  and it does feel good  i am using the premium feature  free for   months  i have not yet set up the touchless payment option  but will set it up  this sounds like a very attractive feature  especially if needing to purchase something when full wallet is left home gripes    the app is nice  but could be made a little more intuitive  it looks like it s been evolved over a long period of time by different teams with slightly different  well  quite different  ideas about user interface  does the job  though if sometimes a little confusing    the spotify feature is kinda useless  because it requires you to carry your phone with you  so it s just a spotify remote control  i have removed it entirely to clean up the menus    it would be nice to be able to re arrange the menus on the device despite a few glitches  i think fitbit has a home run with this product      
195,3.0,                       the device is pretty good  a bit big on the wrist  but like many other users  i ve had problems snycing with my phone and ipad  i like the sleep tracking and movement  but maybe i ll delete one of the apps so it might work better      
196,2.0,                       i bought my fit bit new i really loved the fit bit with tracking steps  sleep  etc   but after only one month it stopped workingand would not charge contacted customer service  and of course it was  still under warranty  but  instead of replacing myfitbit they are sending me a  refurbished  replacement  i have had to call several times has taken over    days so far   still no replacement received  i am very disappointed      
197,1.0,                       the charge   has a terrible screen  can t read it during the day at all  asked if i could brighten the screen and charge   customer service said  no that s not an option  so if you don t mind not knowing your step count during the day      or being able to read anything else on the screen during daylight i guess this will work for you  i regret not getting another charge  after it died  the   isn t that great      
198,1.0,                       right out of the box it worked for literally    seconds then blank took it out of the box and put it on the charger as directed  got the smiley face that lasted for about   seconds then came the fitbit logo for about   seconds then blackness  tried the    second reset  it vibrated and nothing changed on the screen  tried multiple times  phone couldn t sync up with it and the screen never came back on   returning      
199,5.0,                       i am pretty happy with this fitbit  it tracks more than my previous inspire and the face and watch band area seems stronger than my inspire  which broke  rendering that useless as a wrist tracker   i also like the look and feel of  the tweed band  i also like the size of this verses some of the others that are larger and competing with apple and other higher tech products so far tracking of steps and heart rate is accurate  i ve checked the heart rate with my blood pressure monitor  charge lasts a week  which is understandable given all the notifications it is capable of receiving giving   very happy with it and the customer service from fitbit      
200,5.0,                       when i first got it i was able to track my hourly activity because it would give me a reminder to move if i wasn t active  within   week after i received an app update   it just stopped giving me a reminder  i tried everything in the settings and it just don t work  this was one of the main reason that i bought this item for this feature   i am upset and disappointed     
201,4.0,                       doing thus quick  first off the app looks amazing but is very pushy  premium is a rip off watch is light  responsive enough and has great battery missing features like find my phone and missing watch widgets like water caffeine will annoy you if you re like me no physical buttons and no way to force update your watch are two stupid decisions the company is willing to die one for some reason final verdict is best     or less smart watch including the app experience  but only by a little      
202,5.0,                       it was as described   love the sleep tracking which is why i purchased  i found out get restless throughout the night  i wake up a few times probably after nightmares easy to understand   only thing i didn t like is that i didn t like it  i know eye roll  i couldn t handle it  i don t like sleeping with jewelry on specially a watch i have problems with my wrists at night  so i returned it with much regret      
203,5.0,                       i think i m a bit of a fitbit fanatic  i ve had just about everyone of them over the last   years due to being a personal trainer and group ex instructor  i ve loved everyone i ve had  anytime i ve had a problem i ve called customer support and they have helped me fix it and if they couldn t  they have sent me a new one  thank you fitbit for creating a great product and supporting it with a great staff to back it up  i m one of your biggest fans         
204,2.0,                       recently upgraded from a charge   to a charge     very disappointed   as soon as i removed from the packaged it appeared to be cheaper construction   the heart rate accuracy on the charge   was very good   the charge   is just awful   it is fine while resting but completely inaccurate while exercising   it is low by       bpm   if you are interested in monitoring heart rate  do not buy this   you would expect better performance on a new version but not the case      
205,2.0,                       misleading  need app for it to function the app that they recommend cost   sorry i bought it  wasted   s     
206,1.0,                       after i described my an issue with my fitbit charge   purchased    days ago  where the device logged hundreds of miles as i sat in a moving car  fitbit customer service let me know that extra steps might be logged when pushing a stroller or shopping cart       and while working or cooking  and told me  extra steps added when riding a car isn t significant when compared to your overall stats  this would not happen with another manufacturer  and the customer service would likely be better also  be warned  fitbit refuses to refund devices that were not purchased directly through them  so no refund for the company s malfunctioning device if purchased here through amazon      
207,1.0,                       very disappointed with the charge    was really looking forward to all the features but it s difficult to navigate  spent at least a minute trying to stop a run session  set up took an hour   started it at night and had to put it down until the morning to try again  screen was blank for the longest time  the reset wouldn t work  finally got it to work but ended in disappointment  returning for the inspire hr      
208,4.0,                       honestly this isn t full of bells and whistles  and that s good for me  don t trust spotify working on it  it just pairs to your phone  only actual complaint is it winds up losing heartrate a lot  i wind up having to retighten and loosen the band multiple times a day to get it to read  most annoying when it does it right before you re going to go to sleep  or before a workout  by the way  no  this still doesn t work with google fit  fit to fit app helps   and barely works with myfitnesspal  can t send workouts  can receive calories       
209,5.0,                       i love fitbits products  my first fitbit was the charge hr almost   years ago  after that i switched over to an apple watch and absolutely hated it because i didn t feel like it was an accurate fitness tracker  the fitbit is the perfect fitness tracker  i love being able to see my pace  distance  calories burned  and heart rate as i m running  i also love looking at the gps map after my run to see my heart zones and pace  its very accurate and the interface is easy to use  i would definitely recommend this product for someone looking for a good fitness tracker  that being said  this is not a good option for someone looking for a smart watch with all the apps      
210,2.0,                       i am so frustrated with the quality of the watch   i bought this less than a year ago and while pleased with some features  especially it being waterproof  it is made cheaply   the connectors where the band attaches is made with plastic  the other day i slipped on the ice and the plastic snapped making the entire watch unusable      
211,1.0,                       my device stopped working just a few days of using it  i ve tried all the trouble shooting suggested by fitbit but still useless  i guess the device is faulty from the start  and customer service from adorama is hard to get in touch with  this has been a very disappointing experience  i hope to hear from them as soon as possible      
212,4.0,                       i have had fitbits for years  they generally last for   years and then something inevitably goes wrong and you need a new tracker  i loved my ionic and i still highly recommend the tracker  but i wanted something a bit thinner this device is comparable  it s harder for me to read only because i m at the age where i need cheaters to see small lettering  but with this said  the words and symbols are fairly clear  i do miss the colorful screen of the ionic and i hope fitbit adds color to this tracker in the future  but i really do like the device the only thing i m not as fond of and the ionic does much better  is tracking the sleep cycle  the app works with the data but the tracker is slow to update   and then i forget about it      
213,2.0,                       i switched to the fitbit charge   from a xiaomi mi band   and i am not sure it is worth the money  i have tons of problems with this device first of all fitbit s community moderators are incompetent  i submitted a feature request for this device and the request was flagged as already implemented and linked to a feature request for a different device  my followups just led to my request being linked to a different request that was once again for a different device my next complaint is the spotify functionality  when working out in the gym it is great  you can choose what device to control  choose recent playlists  skip tracks  and like songs  with my old watch i really wanted to be able to like a song while i m on a run while my phone was tucked away in my fanny pack  welp  come to find out  i can t do it with this device either  spotify and workouts are separate standalone  apps  and they cannot run concurrently  so  if i want to map my run with my watch  i can t control spotify at all one of the worst parts of fitbit is the companion app  when it works  it is great  but it is full of bugs and often does not work  i will go to log water intake and it does not appear as having been logged for hours  i will log my food and it will add it to the wrong day fitbit s engineers have proven themselves to be horrible at their jobs  they are in the process of being acquired by google  though  so i am going to hold out and hope things get better      
214,1.0,                       i was excited to see the fitbits have come down in price   unfortunately they have come way down in quality also  i dont usually leave product reviews  but i am so disappointed with this one  i felt i needed to i ordered the charge   in april  as soon as it came out  to replace my charge   that i had had for   years and was no longer tracking my heartrate   i liked the design  led light  and the way i could see my heartrate  steps and time all on the same screen   i dont think it ever kept an accurate heart rate during workouts   my heart rate was noticeably lower then the charge   when doing the same workout i had the charge   for   months and the plastic end on the device that holds the band on broke off   all other fitbits i have owned had metal tabs holding the band on  charge   they are plastic   customer service did finally replace the charge   and band after sending mine in and multiple emails   replacement took a little over a month   it was the middle of september when i got my replacement   after a week  it stopped tracking anything  but kept the time   i had to do a factory reset on the fitbit   once i got it going again  it never tracked my floors  but everything else worked so i kept it   i have had the second one just   months  and the plastic tab on the end broke off the same way the first one did   please keep in mind  this is normal wear and tear  nothing out of the ordinary  i have an office job  so it is not like it is getting banged around   very unhappy   i would give the charge   negative stars if it was an option   i hoped the first one breaking was a fluke  but it is clearly a design flaw      
215,1.0,                       i m really disappointed in how cheaply made the fitbits are made  i have my previous one for several years with no issues  i ve had this fit bit about   months and it it broke  not really sure what they have changed  but if you use your fitbit often then you might consider saving your money and going with a better brand that is more durable      
216,2.0,                       this as a really clean  elegant design  the screen is easy to read  and i found it to be comfortable to wear  the charge cable is very  very short  the sleep timing doesn t work for periods of less than   hours  which made it useless for me  and the step counter wasn t nearly as accurate as the cheap huawei honor band   i bought for comparison other people may need other features more than sleep analysis and step counting  so it may work better for them      
217,4.0,                       the new charge   is in many ways an improvement over my previous alta hr  one thing i notice is that i notice it  i catch the wristband on more things than in the past  like  right now  it s catching on the edge of my desk  however  losing the ability to set multiple alarms via the apps is a dev crime  meaning  don t developers wear the product  now  it could be that developers don t  need  alarms  but many normal folks do  i use several for different days  etc  and rather than resetting them all the time  i could keep a bevy of bells in my fitbit app no more  the charge hr allows for only    two   alarms  and they must be set  aka fiddled with endlessly  right on the watch with its wonky and at times oversensitive watch face not sure i d trade it in for a charge    which i hear retains the in app alarms   but i might    i just migh      
218,5.0,                       went from the fitbit versa to the charge   because i don t need all the extra stuff the versa offers  i mainly wanted the charge for activity tracking and it does a great job  it s a great size  comfy  easy to use  and doesn t get in the way as much as the versa did while i m working out  i have not had any problems with being able to see the screen in the sun like some other reviewers had  i love my charge        
219,5.0,                       i am big fan of fitbit ever since they came our with the first charge hr   i prefer to wear a watch so i didn t want to have something that was too big  like the firbit versa    the charge hr is the perfect one for me as i want to keep track of my heartbeat and give me alerts when i get a text call   i had charge hr   and was waiting until they came out with the pay option which  they now have  the new pay option is really easy to use   i will be using it more often now because of corona virus pandemic   i wanted to provide directions on how how use as it was not noted in the manual that came withe the fitbit     you add the credit cards on the app and need to set a pin  not all cards are accepted   there is a list on the fitbit site of the cards that are accepted     when you want to pay  you have to hold the fitbit button  on left side      then you need to enter the pin  just scroll up down to find the number and tap the fitbit to select a number      after that you can tap the fitbit until you find the card you want to use    then bring your fitbit near the pay station and it would accept within a few seconds   i used at market basket a few times already and it works like a charge the battery is about     days depending on your use  i have not use the gps which i heard will drain the battery faster   i wore it in the shower a couple of days to test if it was indeed waterproof and i can comfortable say that it is   overall i would definitely recommend this fitbit charge        
220,4.0,                       so far so good  great motivational tool and tracker  didn t need all the bells and whistles of the apple watch  i m loving the sleep tracker because i m discovering sleep patterns i didn t know existed    stars because the fitbit box itself arrived saturated in a soapy like liquid  big oversight on amazon s part  luckily it didn t effect the watch  glad i wasn t gifting this      
221,1.0,                       i bought this specifically for sleeping and it has not tracked my sleep once on it s own  i have zero sleep data no matter what i try  i ve read all of the help sections and have spoken to their customer service and still doesn t track sleep  the customer service is in another country and is very slow to troubleshoot and troubleshoots the same things over and over  even when i ve told them i ve tried certain things without luck  this was a waste of my money      
222,3.0,                       loved this tracker so much  i unfortunately had to return it though after having issues with the bands with the original as well as a replacement that was sent to me  really hoping fitbit can construct a stronger band because i loved the tracker  but if my band is starting to wear after one week of normal use  then i m not confident in a long term use of it  looking forward to repurchasing once better engineering has come in place for the band itself      
223,1.0,                       the charge   stops accurately tracking fitness metrics after about   month     unless you want to reboot restart  disconnect reconnect  clear user data every single week  and irritatingly troubleshoot issues with unhelpful customer service go on google earth and use the measure path feature to track a run  compare it to your charge   s readings  then reconcile what the purpose of the built in gps on this model is if it cannot even complete its primary function    it s just a battery drain      
224,3.0,                       replaced a charge   which i had used and abused   wish i had kept it because the charge   seems to be a step backward   steps often don t count correctly   heart rate is often wrong     on the machines at the gym  but    on the fitbit     stairs  our home office and our bedroom is on the second floor so we go up down a lot   charge   under counts those all the time   and the charge   does not accurately measure sleep  at least     of the time  it  misses  the first     hours of sleep   and  now that google owns fitbit  really don t like that   i am not impressed      
225,2.0,                       apparently fitbit has been actively removing hardware features  including spo  and almost all of the rest of the sleep tracking features    heck  the heart rate monitor shuts itself off when you re asleep if you don t pay the monthly charge to keep it on   so they no longer function without a     mo subscription   this invalidates most of the good reviews from critics in my mind  since they never call out the subscription requirement   no wonder fitbit is losing market share  google it  to all of their major competitors app setup is super flaky as well  had to delete and repair because the watch refused to believe it had already been paired to the app   the app has a pretty color scheme but very little useful info without the subscription fee  reflective  band is only reflective in that it s not pitch black   it s gray  so it apparently reflects  some  light   not worth the extra     by any stretch though edit   to add insult to injury  you can t unsubscribe from the spam they send you  the unsubscribe link is conveniently broken      
226,3.0,                       based on a lot of reviews  i really wanted to like this devise and gave it the benefit of the doubt for a while  unfortunately  i found the fitbit charge   to have inconsistent performance  at times it was nearly impossible access the devise with a touch or a swipe  in the daylight  the screen was very difficult to read  often  the fb seemed to get stuck on one  window  or another  oddly the do not disturb window was a common sticking point  several  reboots  did not remedy anything  it s       for the price  i expected a little more refinement  when it was working  it appeared to be fairly accurate with heart rate  sleep  etc   although at times it and or gps would confuse biking and walking   i recently walked    miles in about    minutes  quite the pace   syncing the device and the app is clunky      
227,5.0,                       i wanted to start tracking my running as well as other activities throughout the day without having to carry my phone around   this fitbit has not disappointed me  it was easy to set up and seems to be pretty accurate   i love the alarm and i think it s a less stressful way to wake up  the bonus is the sleep monitoring  i didn t think i would care about that  but it has been really interesting  i definitely see a difference in my energy level and focus on the days when i have had a better sleep score   so now i m starting to go to bed earlier and really pay attention to that and i feel better   i do not use it to log my meals and water  but i love all of the  detailed information about my workouts  i wish i could add rowing to the list of exercises  maybe you can  but i haven t figured that out yet  battery lasts a week for me  i only turn gps on when i m running  overall  very nice and exactly what i needed      
228,3.0,                       it does not get stairs correctly no matter what i do   if you use the hand rails it doesn t seem to register   also doesn t get steps if you put your hand on a stroller  walker  or cart  impossible to get it to charge   the charger is also only about  ft long so it s a pain to bend down to reach it  you then have to set it on the floor because cable is not long enough to reach up to set it on a table   it s also impossible to get the charging prongs to line up with the charger   it does not work with the  charger i purchased separately for my charge   even though it fits the only reason i upgraded my charge  was because my screen failed   it has nothing over the charge  except that it monitors during swimming hate the cheap plastic watch band   rediculas for a      watch   not many nice bands available   i paid another     for my metal band but after only a few days its showing wear but  compared to everything else out there this may still be my best bet   the fitbit app is the only one that links with my other apps      
229,5.0,                       i had to replace the first one  it wasn t working right  in all fairness  this could happen to anything you buy  so i bought another  the replacement works beautifully   it does everything described it would do  i m very happy with it  amazon s return policy is to me the best and easiest in the business      
230,5.0,                       my charge   gave up on sunday   i was lost without it   i am on ww and it tracked everything for me automatically   i ordered the charge   and was shocked when it said it would be delivered the next day   it was   my old  bling  band fit the charge    too and i have it all set up and it has more features than my     i highly recommend it      
231,1.0,                       i have been without my brand new fitbit   for more than   months since both my new fitbit   and its replacement could not download the operating system   i am still waiting for the  nd replacement to see if it works   based on the shipping notice i just received  it looks like they are not replacing my  special edition  band   if that turns out to be true  i will have more to complain about   i only purchased the new fitbit   because my fitbit   failed twice in    months   i wish i could get my money back to try another manufacturer   fitbit used to make quality products that i enjoyed for many years      
232,2.0,                       i ve only had the watch for around    hours  i bought it because it says it has      heart rate monitoring  what it doesn t say is that if you want to see the data that it already collected using the device you purchased   you need to pay an additional        on a yearly subscription to be clear  this is to see your heart rate while sleeping  i can t be bothered enough to look for other things that are paywalled      
233,2.0,                       upgrade from charge    wore it three days with no spo  reporting in app  contacted fitbit support  and they gave me instructions to add a  clockface  that could not be completed due to steps not matching product  two days later they sent email with additional steps that did not match the product  one day the spo  report appeared  but the time asleep  deep and rem  and restoration panels were all missing  the next day  no reporting  looked back to previous day and spo  report that was there had disappeared  but the time asleep  deep and rem  and restoration panels were back  apart from some cosmetic features that do not appeal to me  i see no reason to keep this  going back to the charge    when it stops working  or becomes unusable due to app updates  i will not be buying fitbit brand again      
234,4.0,                       doesn t sync well with weather  keeps telling me i have to have my phone open to the app to sync which defeats the purpose of having the weather on my fitbit  if i have to have my phone by me i might as well look up the weather there  haven t used the spotify option yet but love the look and love having a clock face  i do wish i could program the order which steps  stair levels  etc show up when tapping      
235,1.0,                       i finally received my fitbit and unfortunately it just has a black screen  i followed all directions  which is charging it and pairing it up to my phone  but as it was paring  the screen just turned black and when my phone tries to finish the set up and asks me for a   number pin  i can t type them in because i can t see them  i tried a reset by placing the fitbit on a charger  and nothing happened  there is a vibration when i press the button  but nothing more  i really needed this to work by tomorrow and now this happens  it s a great disappointment      
236,2.0,                       this is the second fitbit charger   i m needing to return because of freezing issues unfortunately i am unable to contact successfully with support to try to return this item i was very excited to use the fitbit but very disappointed when it craps out on me not very happy     
237,1.0,                       i am a huge fan of fitbit  i am on my   band and i specifically bought this new fitbit charge   because of the gps tracker  i was tired of running with my phone and trusted this would be good  but i have to say i am extremely disappointed   the gps tracking is horrible    when i turn it on it say connecting  i waited a few mornings ago for   mins to make a connection  this is not an exaggeration as i waited to see when it would start  someone might ask well maybe the area you live in has a bad connection  listen  i live in northern virginia    miles from the capital we have strong everything and i have had gps watches in the past that did not have any issue so i know it s the fitbit the only thing i can hope for now after spending this money is a software update that improves the gps tracking  come on fitbit i know you can do better      
238,5.0,                       it s a fitbit and does everything a health tracker does  best in class sleep tracking unfortunately  it s not meant to be used by me  i get burning sensations on the skin after a few hours of wearing the device  i don t think it is a device fault since i had the same experience a few weeks prior with the inspire    it s a  my skin  problem and i m disappointing on missing out an adding this piece of tech to my life  really enjoyed the data it gave in the limited time i used it      
239,1.0,                       horrible  it synced with a device for a little   a few days  then it stopped  i returned replaced them item  that one would not sync at all  i tried to sync it with different devices too  customer service could not help either  it s ashame because   years ago when i got the charge    it was great  i was trying to upgrade to a waterproof one because of all the extra hand washing needed today  very disappointed  i am now returning the replacement one  it s not worth the money or the time  fitbit does not seem to care about their customers  because looking even more into it  many people have this issue and the device not syncing and they still have not fixed the problem  it will not even count steps if it is not connected to a device  it just keeps saying to download the app  spend your money on products and sellers who care  do not get the charge   unless they fix the problem      
240,1.0,                       after years and years of using fitbit  i ve had it   the trackers are very delicate  read   break at the slightest tap against something solid   the android apps work with a limited list of phones  and sometimes  not even then   problematic updates that cause more problems than they solved  and a very silent customer support   i will not recommend any fitbit tracker to anybody   this charge   is the latest casualty  along with my backup charge   and inspire    none of which have workedl for   days due to the sadly flawed      update fb released this week   and not a word from them  despite consumer messages asking for help   this is typical  in my experience      
241,5.0,                       i had a charge   that seemed to have issues synching with my app after about a year and half  so i decided to upgrade to the charge    i loved the charge   so was not really in need of any new features  i don t think the charge   is much different as far as capabilities  but what i loved most is it uses the same charge and the same band size which was good since i had purchased new bands and charges  for the charge   as i like to have chargers in my travel bag as well as home  and prefer a specific bit more dressy wrist band as opposed to the standard one that the fit bits come with and would have been disappointed if i had to buy new accessories again  overall   i ve been happy with my fit bits      
242,4.0,                       i have had this since early may   until august   it would not come on when i turned my wrist   then suddenly it started working   i have no idea how well it tracks my sleep   however   it seems to say i haven t slept well on nights i thought i did   who knows   it says i slept     hours of the   i was in bed last night   and i thought i had a restless night   i wish it tracked my gym activity  it s updating now   so we ll see what they ve added   good  battery life  i use the timer a lot at the gym  i like it tracks my heart rate  i need to get back to tracking food and water  also   steps     
243,1.0,                       this is my third fitbit device  and my last  i went minimalistic this time after having the blaze and versa se and i am amazed at how shoddy the products have become within a few months  this device just stopped working  let alone that this had a clunky user interface that would seldomly register a tap when trying to start an activity  but it never stayed connected to my android and quality just seemed  meh  at best      
244,5.0,                       this is my third fitbit charge  it s very similar to previous versions  the major upgrade is the gps tracking  so i don t have to take my phone with me but can still see a map of my route  i like that i can swim with it  i haven t yet  but i have showered with it with no problems and i know it waterproof to a reasonable depth  i think the charge   was waterproof  but i know the charge   was only water resistant the only issue i had was sleep tracking  i had to change the settings from the default to  sensitive  otherwise it thinks i slept way more than i actually did  i go to bed an hour or two before i fall asleep and usually read  but on the default setting  it marks the reading time as sleep time even though my hands are often moving around  once i changed the setting  the new tracking is much more accurate two things to clarify if you are considering this  the spotify control feature on your watch just controls pausing  next song  previous song  shuffle  and what devices to play the music on if you have multiple bluetooth devices linked to your phone  the watch itself cannot link to or store spotify songs  you have to bring your phone on runs if you want to listen to spotify the second thing is if you are going to use fitbit pay  not all credit debit cards will work  the primary credit card i use was not supported  but the second card i tried did work  if you only have one or two cards and you plan on using this feature  i would look at the list of supported banks on the fitbit website before you buy  i only added this feature so i can buy water at convenience stores on long runs if i leave my phone at home the app dashboard is still great  overall  i m happy with it      
245,1.0,                       worked less than   day  trying to return but says need serial number and order number  i can t find either so i m feeling stuck right now      
246,1.0,                       i rarely do reviews in amazon  but this deserved one  the main reason why i chose this product is the sleep tracking which overall was ok and the smart wake worked well  however  my first watch broke at the base of the band after less than   months of wearing it and i do not even work out that much  after discussing with customer support they sent me a replacement that broke in the same spot   months after i received it  i do not exercise often  i have mainly an office job and i wore it for sleep  i again reached out to customer service and they offered again a replacement  why would i want this piece of trash replaced the design of the base of the band is flawed  this device should be discontinued  my husband has a polar that has lasted more than   years without any issues  do not buy this      
247,1.0,                       this model of fitbit has a terrible battery life when the gps is on  i went on a walk for an hour  and tried to turn off the workout  but the fitbit was non responsive  i noticed the battery was low  but i decided to look into it more when i returned home  it lasted only two hours for me even on a full charge  when i returned home and charged it fully  i saw that with gps on the fitbit will only last for five hours  this kind of defeats the purpose of having a fitness tracker  but  fine  i decided i would not use the gps function anymore  so i then go into setting to turn it off  now the fitbit is stuck on a screen advising me to go to the fitbit website to know more about gps  i don t want to know more about gps  i want it off  but it is stuck on this screen and i can not turn off the device or select something else  please do not buy this  buy a different fitness tracker that works      
248,4.0,                       i really like this fitbit charge   i want to love it but     it doesn t send me notifications from other apps as advertised  i have a too do list that i would like to recieve reminders for but the only way i can get a reminder is if i connected it to my calendar which then clutters up my calander  i have my to do list marked as something i want to get notifications from in my settings for the watch but i don t recieve notifications for it  i consider this false advertising  if it is suppose to send notifications from other apps on your phone and even shows the app you want to be notified about then you should get the notification  otherwise they shouldn t say it gives notifications from other apps  actually i dont get notifications from any of the other apps that i have checked off in my settings  if there is any way to fix this i would give it   stars     update i did find an agenda app that syncs with the watch  it s called my daily planner i found it in the google app store  i tried several out till i finally found one that i didn t have to sync with my calendar      
249,1.0,                       what a  disappointment after enjoying the fitbit   til i scratched the display   the   is barely worth wearing  the displa  can t be seen in the sunlight  it freezes if i try to track anything  i can onl  see the screen if i manuall  press the on switch     wish i had not bought it      
250,4.0,                       i ended up buying this for       it s a great product so far and i ve used it since october  the app is great for tracking food calories  etc  i like the calorie tracking  it does seem to think i m walking when i m not though which is a tad frustrating  so i m not sure how super accurate it is  battery lasts about a week  however  i think      is a bit steep for the quality and materials used      
251,3.0,                       i ve had a charge  for close to   years and it doesn t hold a charge as well as it used to   i could go a whole week before charging that one and i ve loved it   so  bought this charge   on sale   i can t tell you how disappointing this thing is   i m in my    s but am relatively comfortable w technology   there is no way that this tracker needs all these features   it s ridiculous   i don t need spotify on my wrist   emails   weather  etc   and i certainly don t need to see my weight on there either   there s no way to take it off though   there s a swipe up  a swipe down  a swipe left and a swipe right   on that little face of the watch  really   no thanks   this one is going back   i m going to look at a garmin  oh and by the way  the charge on this lasted   days   and i did not use the gps  fitbit  if you re open to suggestions   why not market a scaled down model w basic features   time  steps  heartrate  sleep   reduce the price accordingly and i think you d get quite a few takers   this one you can keep though         
252,5.0,                       got this after my charge   died and wow is it and upgrade i really love it so far  fair warning though on some things i didn t realize  you need spotify premium to use any of the spotify features at all which was kind of a bummer  and according to their website if you use the gps feature the fitbit battery only lasts   hours  so you have to be careful to turn gps only on and off when you need it when you re exercising and not just leave it on to auto recognize which is a little annoying but not a huge deal  also a few features require that you allow them to run in the background for them to  work properly  i don t like to have things do that to try and preserve my phone battery so i turned off those permissions but left the others on and so far i haven t had any other problems because my fitbit still syncs throughout the day and i think can still get data that way  my boyfriend loves the sleep mode feature that turns off notifications and screen wake so when i toss and turn at night i don t accidentally blind him with my watch screen if it goes off      
253,4.0,                       i like the new features that give more info like the heart rate variability etc but i had an older charge   and its battery lasted longer  even though i have turned all the notifications off the battery does not last quite as long  don t care for the new charging dongle either  hard to verify it is charging the face i picked does not always give me what i want to see one the first arm swing  i asked for the time  date   steps and heart rate in the digital format  there is some glitch which makes it show stairs and movement then i  we d to use myother hand to find the info i want  hope they fix that one soon      
254,2.0,                       this charge   is larger than my previous one  i prefer the smaller size  it is very inaccurate for my heart rate and rarely if at all informs me of my messages  functions do not work right  i would not buy it again and do not recommend it  the inspire was much better to say the least  i ll return it if it s not too late      
255,1.0,                       i had a fitbit hr and when the strap broke  i purchased the charge    after multiple broken straps and replacement straps being unavailable  i purchased the charge    this is completely unlike other fitbits that i have had for more than   years   i could not be configured with my windows    computer  running the windows fitbit connect program   the charge   can not be setup with my android phone as it is running android version   and can not be upgraded to minimum android version     with my windows    laptop and the fitbit connect app  i have been able to run the setup utility to attach the charge   to my fitbit account  however i continue to have issues   i still can not replace the message on the screen  to download the latest fitbit app  and have the time displayed    also when resetting the device as the directed by multiple help articles it briefly display the time on restart but the time is incorrect   i have had this unit for over a month to no avail   the time has come to return      
256,1.0,                       i love that it has more features than the charge    and that s about the only good thing i can say about it the battery didn t stay charged for   days  you go to look at your fit bit  and the battery is dead   it doesn t matter if you just charged it  or not  i couldn t get the watch to connect to the app on my phone  so i basically had a expensive watch  that had alot of features that just didn t work  i don t wear it to track my fitness  it s just nice to be able to see what is going on in your life at times  so i was willing to deal with all of this   then  while doing some gardening  my fit bit  that i have had for    days  screen shatters      so  i contact fit bit  and i am basically told  they won t help me in any way    this response came from   different people at fit bit as soon as i said i purchased it from amazon   then they say that i can buy a new fit bit from them   i contacted them   days in a row  the first day was by computer chat  very rude  i had to beg for any info  to be told  sucks to be you  buy another one   the second day was by phone  also very rude  same response  but  they would give me a     discount on a new charge     i asked them to email that info to me   when i received the email  not only did they tell me to buy another one  but they can t give me the     off   i never should have upgraded  my charge   had no problems in the   years i wore it   i even wore it to the beach  with no problems   save yourself some money  buy an off brand or    if they break  it s no big deal to get another one      
257,1.0,                       there is no way to customize font sizes or any of the visuals that matter for a person with vision that is less than perfect  fitbit has acknowledged the issue in their forums  but has taken no action on the concerns of customers  avoid fitbit products      
258,5.0,                       my fitbit   failed and i decided to get the fitbit     it was a great decision   it works better than the   did and has some cool features   the screen is bright and easy to see at all times      
259,3.0,                       i really enjoyed my fitbit but recently the strap connector broke after   months of continuous use  the battery life and the sleep tracker was excellent  the app was very easy to use too  i m now in the market for a new smart tracker but unfortunately i m not sure if i ll get another fitbit      
260,1.0,                       i was  ok  with the performance of this product    and then  without making any changes  the battery performance plummeted to such an extent that it needs charging once or twice a day  instead of once or twice a week  a degree of attention that i am certainly not willing to entertain  i am certainly not novice in terms of tech  and after tons of research i reached the conclusion that   it s a common problem   there s no way around it and   customer service will be as effective in fixing your problem as praying to your favorite ancient egyptian deity honestly and fairly  stay clear of fitbit      
261,5.0,                       this product worked as expected out the box  no problem syncing with my multiple year old lg v   phone using the fitbit app  there is no other fitness tracker on the planet that offers gps tracking and touch free payment for this price point  the sleep tracking seems to work great so far  and i love being able to see my heart rate information on strava  battery life is not the best when using gps  maybe   hours total with full charge   however it is very good when used normally  if you re looking for a gps tracker with longer battery life it will certainly be more bulky and you will probably not want to wear it all day  or night  i would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a full time fitness tracker with gps capabilities      
262,2.0,                       i had been using the charge   for about     years  recently  i started having some issues with it  one  the battery drains much more quickly  which is to be expected  i went from having to charge it once a week to once every       hours  two  the heart rate monitor just didn t seem to be working as well  there was a lag in the sensor which i compared with another heart rate monitor device  this is an important feature as i want to know what my heart rate is in real time while i m doing intense cardio i began looking for a replacement  i wasn t interested in apps that the more expensive smart watches offer  i don t need those as my phone is always in my pocket   i mostly just wanted more stats and analytics  i liked that the charge   had an oxygen monitor  additionally  i assumed after     years the heart rate monitor technology would have gotten at least a bit better and more precise  and hopefully fixed the lag  also  i was tired of charging the charge   every day  so i decided to upgrade to the charge   big mistake    the heart rate monitor seems to have gotten worse  the heart rate lag while exercising was up to an entire minute  i know that sounds trivial  but if my other heart rate monitor can give me a real time reading  why can t fitbit do the same  when i m approaching peak mode this information is vital  knowing how far i can safely push myself is important  and was the biggest reason i purchased this item  it failed    the spo  feature is junk  first  it only monitors your oxygen in your sleep  so basically you only need to see that result once  two  this feature doesn t give you actual values  just a tiny non clickable graph which is the same every night  complete disappointment    the battery  surprisingly  started draining very quickly  while i liked being able to see the battery level on the watch  i couldn t believe how often i would get low battery warnings during my exercises  many times i would leave the home for a       minute walk or run with the battery at        charged  i got this so i wouldn t have to charge the watch every day  but i found myself having to do it every day or every other day  another fail    comfort wise  the charge   is bulkier and a bit less comfortable three features on the charge   i liked    the precise gps tracking is a nice feature  with the charge   i would often get some missing stretches of a run  the charge   always gave a very accurate location path    i liked being able to see text messages on the watch  but again  it s hardly useful when my phone is always right there    i liked the oxygen monitor  well  for that first night  it was nice seeing that i didn t have any issues like sleep apnea or copd  but again  this isn t something that s going to rapidly change overnight and is therefore mostly useless    i liked being able to see my resting heart rate on my watch  this was a nice feature  but again  not worth the money    the charge   app is a little bit shiner and sleeker  but the information is all mostly the same in conclusion  the charge   is actually better than the charge   in terms of heart rate monitoring  the little upgrades are kind of neat  but they aren t very useful and definitely aren t worth the money  hopefully  fitbit fixes these issues and has a bit more to offer on the next version      
263,1.0,                       i have only had this tracker for   months and it has already broken   the watch came off my arm during my hiit class and i reattached the band to the tracker   i removed to charge and when i placed it back on my wrist the plastic attaching piece broke off   very  very disappointed      
264,1.0,                       i ve worn a fitbit on my wrist for several years now   when my charge    which i loved  failed  i upgraded to the charge     big mistake   the fitbit functions fine   just like my charge     however if you allow gps  it must be charged multiple times daily   even with gps turned off in every exercise  it needs to be recharged every day   i ve scoured the internet for fixes  downloaded the update  reset the device  asked for help on the forums     but to no avail   don t buy this unless you want to recharge it once a day   and let s face it a gps feature that drains the battery in a few hours is worthless for hiking or biking   i ll use my trusty    year old garmin for that   quite disappointing fitbit      
265,5.0,                       i upgraded to the charge   after using the inspire hr for a year  overall i liked in inspire hr but as i used it more and more i noticed problems that i don t have with the charge    let s start by saying i workout     days a week  usually weights  spin and the occasional general cardio workout  along with this i bike to and from work   days a week  for me the heart rate monitor helps figure out where i m at in my workout and how much more i should push  with the inspire hr  during heavy workout days i d find when i glanced at it  it would fail to read from time to time  i haven t had this problem since my charge   arrived  the built in gps in the charge   comes in handy but it does drain the battery a bit  on a day when i have a workout  gps turned on for an hour total  to and from work  and throughout the workday    that s about a       hour day    it gets down to about     battery  it syncs better to the app than the inspire hr  sometimes i d have to refresh a half dozen times for the app to find the inspire but most of the time the charge   syncs immediately or at least after only one refresh  there s additions to the app with the charge   including zone minutes  elevation  and a few more badges you can gain  i suppose if you re more athletic and do more outdoor activities the charge   s built in gps might be more of a problem than a good thing but for the intermediate fitness person  it s a step up from the inspire hr      
266,1.0,                       i upgraded from the fitbit charge   to the charge   hoping for better accuracy and reliability   i have to say that after about six weeks of use  i ve been disappointed   while the step counting and floor counting got a little better  the  heart rate monitor is still suspect   the problem with the heart rate might be that i cannot get the fitbit device to stay two finger widths above my wrist bone without stapling it in place or using duct tape to hold it there   does anyone else have this problem   the most annoying issue i have with this model of fitbit is that the gps tracking keeps dropping off in the middle of a run or walk   it simply loses the gps signal and stops tracking your progress   as a result  it does not map your route  gives inaccurate time  pace and distance information and basically makes the gps feature worthless   and now the app is about as annoying as the tracker shortly after setting up my fitbit tracker the company pushed a software upgrade to the app that works with it   now  every time i open the app i get a prompt asking me to turn on location services   well  i had the app set to allow location access only when using  but apparently that s not good enough   fitbit wants to track my every movement   i did allow full access allowed for a short time and after a few days my iphone prompted me with a message stating that fitbit was gathering access on where i went even if i wasn t using the app   seems like privacy is a foreign concept to this company bottom line  find something else that works and won t invade your privacy      
267,1.0,                       screen wouldn t come on just stayed black  i ve returned it for another one  talked with fitbit and they didn t have the answer for what was going on with it  i did not return to fitbit  figured since i bought it from amazon that s where i would return it and i m getting a replacement the next day  another review will be given when i have a product that works     
268,5.0,                       i m overweight and couldn t stay motivated  this awesome thing helps me with that extra nudge to do a little more  it has helped with realize i had horrible sleep habits  ie  none   gotten me to do extra house chores  that i usually ignore as long as possible  just to get  credit  for the extra steps or active minutes  the workout tracking had been good to also keep me motivated  i share a screenshot of it with my family almost every week and that keeps me honest to actually worki out  overall this seems to have been what i needed to get going with life changes instead of whining about my size  now i feel better both mentally and physically  and have started to lose a little weight  overall i recommend this to anyone who is stuck in that rut i was  this thing won t make you workout  but it might just give you an extra push to be more active  it did for me  and i couldn t be happier for it     
269,1.0,                       this is a warning about using the charge   fitbit  the fitbit mobile app only works with android system   or above  the computer app  fibit connect will not work with the charge     my phone is not android system   and although my computer is new  it will not setup the charge    the fitbit support person told me they did not write the charge   into the computer application  the support told me to buy a new cellphone or use someone else s  really  unfortunately  this information is not in the amazon description or on their product website  very disappointed and had to send the charge   back      
270,4.0,                       i have had th fitbit charge   about two weeks   this is my first tracker of any kind   it has several features that i wanted such as the step counter  gps  sleep tracker  heart rate  i find that they all work well except the step counting     at first i thought wasn t wearing it properly but from what i read it s pretty much worn like a watch so how could i do that wrong   i am considering replacing it because i can watch it while walking and nothing changes   i have also looked at it then walked around d the house and look again and it s the same   what am i doing wrong      
271,2.0,                       as the novelty of the tracker gimmicks fade over time  you will come to hate this product  passing thru indifference  to annoyance  to levels of white hot rage seen only in the oval office since arizona was called by fox news you ll come to realize your life is no better for knowing you spent    mins in rem sleep instead of     you ll stop caring about the sleep monitoring  but you ll stop wearing it at night entirely when your partner complains to you that s the  rd night in a row that the green sensor light woke her up when you shifted in bed  and threatens separate bedrooms  that sensor light at the back may seem innocent enough in the daytime  but at night it s strong enough to summon batman  and apparently nobody thought to dim it when the tracker figures out you are asleep you ll discover that connecting to gps can take   seconds    minutes or   hours  randomly  even in areas of strong signal coverage  you ll have to decide whether to stand by your bike watching that jerky triangle symbol  or just take off and have the thing act as a glorified stopwatch  somewhere  in the continental usa  there s a skeleton lying next to a bike  all that remains of a fitbit wearer who decided to wait for a gps connection  eventually you ll come to the realization that tracking your exercise geographically isn t a right  it s a privilege that fitbit  in its munificence  bestows on you occasionally  perhaps on hindu holy days don t expect to be able to see the display outside  in natural light  you can t  the pale  greyish text on a black background is designed to cause eyestrain  my exercise mode of choice is cycling  and i ve concluded that either the fitbit engineers don t actual cycle at all  or they all have recessed vole genes and cycle at midnight on cloudy days during power outages  it s one or the other and even if you can see it  in a dark alley  the thing flashes constantly between cardio and fat burn or congratulates you on     steps an hour or doing a washing load or baking a cake  basically anything it can think of to stop you seeing useful information at the flick of a wrist  like how far or how long you ve been exercising and your tracker wants to thwart you from turning gps off afterwards  there s no option to keep it on only for the duration of the exercise  you ll have to swipe left  right  up and down    times to find it again afterwards  or more likely  you ll forget entirely and it will need recharging within the hour again  btw  don t even think about exercising with anything less that     charge  you ll see the drained battery symbol in no time fitbit is about to be acquired by google  and google  like v ger in star trek  the motion picture  exist to know all that is knowable  now i m not saying nasa needs to shoot google executives into deep space  but it would spare us having to watch them lie to house and senate committees every three months perhaps you can reconcile yourself not to mind that google are collecting your biometric data and tracking your every waking movement so they can show you ads for preparation h or congratulate you on your pregnancy before you are even aware you are pregnant  this is not a joke  this is a thing   read the nyt article about target stores and data mining   but we are surely only   firmware updates from the tracker playing   second commercials for burger king every   minutes  just like the abomination youtube has become      
272,1.0,                       this is actually the replacement of the first fitbit i ordered a year ago  this one is from july but is now totally busted  the strap won t stay on the monitor  i even bought a new band to try  the clasp is just broken   months after replacing  in addition  you can no longer tap the screen to wake the device up  it just doesn t respond any more  you have to click the side button to see the home screen  it s so frustrating  in addition  it s just stopped being accurate counting steps  i ll be walking and it just won t be counting  it s just cheap junk  two gone busted in less than    months  i wish i had saved my money and gone with the apple watch      
273,1.0,                       anyone buying a fitbit through amazon needs to know there is only a    day warranty unless you buy the warranty offered through amazon  my fitbit stopped working at    days after purchase   if you buy the device directly through fitbit  you get a one year warranty  big difference    however  amazon customer service was very kind and allowed me to return and be reimbursed  but this was not until after i expressed my severe disappointment and a manager approved the refund      
274,1.0,                       so this is my  rd smart wearable device i have owned  i have had the original moto     and i currently have the very old  in electronic years  huawei watch  i will start off by saying that this fitbit charge   is way more comfortable than the previous two device  once on your wrist you will forget that it is there except when it buzzes on your wrist for notifications  speaking of notifications  they work very nicely without being over bearing  you can choose and select from which apps you want to get notifications on  for example all i care about is notifications from whatsapp  messenger and my emails so that is all i have it set to  you also will get notifications about you activities which you can also change if you feel your getting too many  i left all settings at their defaults and i do not find i get to many notifications  i walk   days a weeks and workout   days a week and the charge   automatically tracks my walks perfectly  as for my workouts it doesn t seem to know when i am doing pushups or pullups and of course it will not pick up the fact i am doing planks but that is ok as i doubt i am burning a lot of calories from my   day a week workouts as it is more for muscle toning and trying to keep a flat stomach in my old age sleep tracking on the charge   is very nice   i have had a sleep study done about   years ago and they said i stopped breathing   times during the night of the test but that it was not severe enough to warrant a cpap  this tracker has a sp   sensor so in the morning i can check to see how many times my blood oxygen dropped low during the night and so far it has only been a couple times over the    days since it has started tracking my sleep  so that makes me feel a bit better knowing i really do not have a sleep apnea problem  it would be nice if charge   gave you more detailed blood oxygen information  like percentages during the night  but that might something to due with the fact that this is not a medical grade device and they do not want people thinking that or they don t want to have to go through the process of getting certification for it which would cost a lot and effect the cost of the device  also it does not have ondemand for sp   reading  it only checks it at night  it would be nice if they added ondemand sp   checking  from reading over on the fitbit forums it might be added in the future so that would be a big plus  especially for runners the charge has      heart rate monitoring and they use this along with movements to track your sleep and give you a really detailed sleep score  it will show you rem  light  deep sleep and time awake during the night  from what i can tell it is mostly accurate as it seems to match up perfectly to when i have gotten up to go to the bathroom or let the cat in or out etc  and the rem seems to match up to when i was dreaming the times that i woke from my dreams for what ever reason and checked the time  if i ever do another sleep study it would be neat to check the results verses the charge   but i feel it gives you a very good idea of how your nights sleep was  when my score is high like in the   s i feel refreshed in the morning but when it was low a few times      i felt tired and needed a long nap in the afternoon to recharge  speaking of naps  it will track your nap so long as it is over   hours but will not give you any detailed info about your nap like it does for night time sleeping functionality wise  i like how the charge   wakes when you lift you arm  my huawei watch is hit and miss when i raise my arm but the charge   seems to be about     of the time  the touch to wake screen i wish was a bit more sensitive  it works fine after it has been woken from lift to wake but if the charge   has been a sleep for a while and you try and tap to wake i find i have to tap it a few times  this effect me when i am using the stop watch feature to time my planks  i can not lift my arm to wake it during planks and trying to tap it to wake it to see if i have hit my time on the stop watch can be a pain scrolling on the watch is smooth and fast but they need to fix the firmware so that once you leave the main menu  say to go into settings  you can not swipe right to go back  you are forces to press the haptic button to go back which is a pain  i started a feature suggestion to get it added over on the fitbit forum so feel free to up vote it the display is crisp and bright and easy to read even outside  with my huawei watch i could not see anything on the screen while outside  the font is large enough that i can see most of the information without my glasses on so that is really nice as i only put them on for reading and of course take them off when i am exercising about the only i miss from my huawei watch is music control  you should be able to pause   play and skip tracks of whatever app is playing music on your phone  not sure why they didn t add this in yet as the charge   is always connected to the phone via bluetooth so it should be able to do it with a simple firmware update  even cheap bands out there have this simple feature the other feature missing but i do not miss is a mic for google voice command and a speaker to take calls on your wrist  while it is cool to do this to show off who really want to talk to your wrist to ask google something or worse to try and have a conversation with someone that everyone around you would be able to listen in on as far as battery life  they claim   days and i am seeing that  i think even   days are possible  there is an option to have the screen stay on longer when it wakes but that seems to take a day off the battery life  there is also a feature suggestion to add a always on display aod over on the fitbit forum to the charge   but i think the battery would take too much of a hit if they added it  i think fitbit did a good job with features and battery life with the charge   as it stands now  maybe in the charge   with a larger capacity battery they could then add a aod and maybe a color display that is even bigger but with the current battery technology i think they did a good job with the charge    i like only having to charge mine once a week  note  i have my charge   set to gps mode dynamic as i have my phone with me when i take my walks  if you leave your phone at home the charge   will automatically use its built in gps which will drain your battery faster  so keep that in mind if you like to take your walks and runs without taking your phone  one week soon i will try a complete week without taking my phone with me and will update this review with how long the battery lasts so you can get an idea the other thing i  really like about the charge   over others out there  i was looking at the garmin vivoactive    is that the band is changeable  as you can see in my photos i have   different bands  two came with the fitbit charge   special edition and i purchased the fitlink stainless to give it a  classy  look when you get the charge   it will be on an older version of firmware  which just means it needs to be updated  you can not force it to update and so you have to wait for it to update  mine took    hours to finally say there was an update available  i have read it can take two days  so be patient  i know that this sucks but i think they do it that way as to not drain the battery on the charge    i kept the fitbit app open and manual synced the charge     in the app  as often as could while on the charger to get it to show the  update available  in the app on the phone  so if you are impatient like i am you could give it a try well that about wraps up my review of the fitbit charge   se  i hope this review helps others out there  i will update the review as i use the charge   more and will adjust the ratings up or down as needed note  i was not given this product to evaluate  i paid for it with my own money so my review is not bias in anyway updated march  th       i can see why everyone is leaving fitbit and heading to anyone else but fitbit    they have very bad tech support  firmware updates take forever to roll out  and to this date they have not turned on features that they advertise on their very own website  shame really as i really like the charge   but without support and timely updates to be it is not much use      
275,4.0,                       i have always liked fitbit  i had a charge   for   years  it s very accurate for exercise  heart rate etc  i really really like it  but  i recently bought a charge    again  it works great  the only thing that irritates me beyond measure is that i can t get my text messages on it  not on the charge   or the charge        
276,4.0,                       overall it s a great little tracker  sleep  step  and heart rate tracking is fairly accurate for the everyday person  silent alarms that wake you in your light sleep cycle are very convient  timely text and phonecall notifications are great and the simple replies are very convient  using the gps to track your runs walks drains the battery so i don t suggest it unless you start your run at full power and end at the charging station  the spotify control is nifty but only works when you re not tracking an exercise  not all credit and debit cards are supported for fitbit pay     check your cards compatiblity before purchasing  more options could be done with the main screen face such as showing weather  unread notifications  or upcoming events      
277,1.0,                       stopped working after a month  i tried rebooting and all that jazz and it just no longer wanted to sync  the fibit community kind of collectively agree that this specific model just stops syncing after a period and is trashi literally threw it in the trash  i ve had several modelssome were lost and others i felt just needed an upgrade which brought me to this one love fitbit  it helps me such an incredible amount but they need to discontinue this one      
278,5.0,                       love it     
279,1.0,                       i had a fitbit   and i loved it  upgrade to fitbit   and i am totally disappointed with it   looses connection with mywifi every day  does not auto sync  selected the clock face i wanted everyday and it never selected the one i wanted was going in to return when i noticed that it was too late to return   very  very disappointed in the product and the service      
280,2.0,                       was looking forward to my first fitness tracker and the ability to track steps  heart rate and sleep  the charge   is generally ok doing these things but with a lot frustrating issues first  it does not really track steps    it racks arm movements  so if you move your arms a lot when talking or pet a cat  you get step credit  but if you keep your hands on the grip on a treadmill  elliptical or exercise bike  you get little or no credit for movement  the health app on my iphone does a better job in my pocket heart rate tracking can also be a problem  i noticed that the charge   showed a heart rate   bpm less than that on my exercise bike  manually taking my pulse confirmed that the bike was correct  it took the fitbit almost    minutes to be accurate using the  exercise  feature on the charge   seems to reduce this problem but there is still a lag  plus  starting this feature requires you to press the side button  swipe to exercise mode  scroll to the exercise type  tap  start   and tap  let s go  to begin tracking  that s at least one more step than necessary  start should mean start  and sometimes you miss that last step and nothing is tracked  stopping is also a little more complicated than necessary i thought the gps function would be nice to track all day hikes or moving around a city  the map showing your movements is cool  unfortunately  using gps consumes the battery at the rate of about     per hour so all daytracking is not possible i don t use spotify but in poking around trying to resolve some of these other issues i found out that the feature on the charge   is only a controller and not a music player  so anyone thinking of using it for music must still carry their phone or other device finally  the fitbit app is both great and the most frustrating aspect of using this thing  graphics and information are really nice  but  it is very glitchy  took two chats with support to get it to pair and work properly with my iphone and ipad  then  after a firmware update  the charge   was no longer paired with my phone  in fact  the phone could not even see the fitbit in the bluetooth menu  it still could be synced on my ipad  so ok after a second firmware update a few weeks later  my phone asked if i wanted to pair with the fitbit  which i did  but then it didnt work with the ipad  and the next day it lost the pairing with the phone  every time i paired it again  it eventually lost the pairing until i restarted the fitbit  now it stays paired with the ipad  so far  but is once again invisible to my phone  so we are back where we started after a frustrating few days i considered sending it back and would have if this last app episode occurred before that window closed  overall  there are things i really like about the charge   and things i really detest about it  if i had to do it over again  i would have sacrificed the gps and spotify    which are pretty much useless to me anyway    and gotten the charge    it costs less and might even be less glitchy since its been around awhile      
281,5.0,                       i ve owned the fitbit for several months now  i love my fitbit  unfortunately  i am not allowed to wear it during my work for security reasons  however  i primarily use it for keeping track of my after work exercise and heart rate monitor  the heart rate is as accurate as my chest strap on  as for as sleep monitoring i don t have anything to compare it to for accuracy  but it does record an average of    nearly ever night  i purchased a band that would keep the watch adjusted perfectly to my wrist for optimum performance because the factory band was either too loose to record hr or too tight for comfort  i do not use the text option so i can not rate      
282,1.0,                       i set my treadmill for      miles and walk the distance   the charger   fit bit device only recorded      steps and only     miles   my previous fit bit zip would record      steps   my daily workout on the zip was      steps on charger   were only      steps   the new charger   device is not accurate   the     fit bit zip is a better device  the charge   is a piece of junk   i wise they hadn t stop making the zip      
283,1.0,                           this is the product for you   as a bonus  you get the privilege of paying    month for a decidedly underachieving mainstream web service that other workout apps provide for free watching the agony my wife went through connecting hers  she required professional help and an hour to connect   i arrogantly decided that i could buy and figure this out  given that i am in tech literally     minutes to connect  lots of google searches on permissions  and i got a heart rate and the time  and   once   if recognized i took a walk no sleep data  no exercise data  steps were way off  no spotify control  no call or text notification    all features that made my purchase decision   not one worked   my phone is a google  runs the latest reference android i could spend hours working this  but it is a better use of time to work more hours for pay  and buy a real solution spend the money  buy an ecosystem  samsung phone and watch  apple phone and watch wait for the google version or save money and buy a cheaper  yet adequate  clone    you will have a better experience so disappoint      
284,5.0,                       i previously had the charge     and that couldn t take being immersed in water according to it s dos   don ts   this one can go in the pool with me just fine   also  this has onboard gps tracking so no more having to have my phone with me on my local walks to track my route   i like it     not a big fan of the casing colors around the face of the charge     looks like cheap plastic  but that s a minor issue at this point        
285,2.0,                       fitbit has the worst customer service ever  brand new charge   the phone app or my computer link to fitbit will not show friends from contacts  facebook  email or user names  if i try to add an email it just gives me error     or error      looked on the community page and a few people have this problem  i get the same answer from customer service  live text chat  phone chat or mail  hi richard thanks for letting us know about this issue we d like to share with you that our team are now aware of it  but may not be able to provide a fix in the immediate future  we ll continue to monitor the situation  and keep our team informed of the impact to you and other customers we understand that this isn t the resolution you re hoping for  but rest assured we re always working to improve our products we re sorry for any trouble  we appreciate your patience and look forward to getting you back on track this does me no good for this expensive item  the add friend option is why i got it because ecompetition makes working out more fun  get a different bracelet with good customer service     
286,3.0,                       i upgraded because my charge   wasn t working well  i m finding the charge   more difficult to navigate through  even though it s synced to my phone and it says notifications are on  i don t receive any  also  scrolling through options isn t as smooth as the charge        
287,1.0,                       a waste of money   the fitbit charge   won t sync with my iphone  and when i called fitbit for help  one of the  advocates  confided to me that he had an xr iphone like mine  and fitbit charge   was having a problem with that phone and a  fitbit team  was  working on it    when i asked if i could expect a solution soon  he switched to the company line of pablum about how they were doing their best  etc  which meant  we re keeping your money  dude   pound sand       
288,1.0,                       we spent hours setting it up and then it was a complete disappointment   when going to a screen you couldn t get off that screen   we returned it  sorry that it didn t come close to doing anything that was claimed   maybe this was a faulty one but i won t buy another   i m using my old garmin and it doesn t have all the bells and whistles but it does everything it s supposed to do and i only change the battery about once a year   no charging every     days      
289,5.0,                       i love the fitbit charge    i owned the fitbit charge   for a long time it was somewhat accurate so i thought i try the charge    well let s just say it has so much more but it does take a little while to get use to the more funtions on the charge    so been trying to use youtube videos to help me understand the funtions better  and that s okay      
290,5.0,                       easy to set up on the app  disappointed that it doesn t track so  percentage  but all the graphs are helpful and the explanations of the measurements are very clear  i am glad that i purchased it      
291,2.0,                       the readings on this are just too inaccurate to be considered a reliable fitness tracker  everything is very general readings  like the step counter is far off    maybe its accurate for someone who has a shorter stride   i have tracked my walks with a gps and the fitbit   is far from close  i would say daily it tracks about     accurate to what i actually walk  so if you want to rely on this for accuracy i highly recommend buying a different brand      
292,5.0,                       i upgraded from a fitbit inspire   to the charge   so i could use the builtin gps function and not have to carry my phone every time i want to take a walk   so far i m very happy with it and all my actual exercises seem to be tracked accurately every once in a while the pulse monitor will display double what my actual pulse is   for instance i was watching tv one morning and i felt a buzz on my wrist from the charge     i glanced at it and it showed my heart rate at     bpm and that i was in the cardio zone   i took my pulse manually with my fingers and a clock and it was actually    bpm   i moved the tracker higher and lower on my wrist and even put it on the bottom side but it stayed double my actual pulse for several minutes   then it went back to normal   sometimes it will do it when i m at work and other times when i m driving   it s only once a week at the most and only for maybe   or   minutes at a time   i took one star off the accuracy for that since it screws up my active minutes and calories burned in the app other than the pulse thing  the gps and step counter are very accurate when i compared them to actually counting my steps while doing laps on a high school running track the battery charge lasts more than   days  i charge it on mondays and fridays when i first get to work  and it s at about        on fridays  i could probably get another day out of it but i m sitting at my desk doing nothing so it s a good time to charge it   it charges up in around an hour my wife now has my inspire   and it works well for her   she does most of her cardio workouts on an elliptical machine so doesn t need a built in gps function the fitbit charge   is a good little unit and i m happy with my purchase      
293,5.0,                       i ve had the charge   for about   years   i don t need all the bells   whistles that my son loves with his  i think  versa   my charge   was wearing out  meaning the lights were fading   i love the charge      it has a few things i m still getting used to  but i was able to get my retro clock face  and so much more   the only thing i don t really care for is that i can t really set my heart rate zones   they re a bit higher than i like  but i ll work with that as well   it has the gps tracker that once the virus and texas heart abate i ll try out   looking forward to that   help is readily available and there are all kinds of healthy options offered as well   i also like the  slimness  of the charge     i never have cared for bigger watch faces so this is fantastic to me   plus  i get to use all the charge   bands i have          
294,3.0,                       i love pretty much everything about my new charge   fitbit   except for the fact that i was only able to charge it twice  amazon doesn t exactly have the most user friendly customer service   i really didn t want to return the fitbit  just see if i could get a replacement charger  especially when  exchange replace  is for anything except what you originally purchased  so  if you have the same issues with an original charger that doesn t work  the nanw charger cable compatible with fitbit charge   works beautifully  it connects up to my fitbit better than the original and charges much faster  and it stays charged longer  i charged my very dead fitbit when the nanw charger arrived dec     it was down to     today  dec      on the original charger it lasted   days   for      https   www amazon com gp product b  b kkv   ref ppx yo dt b asin title o   s   ie utf  psc       
295,4.0,                       changed to   stars from    all of a sudden the notifications are working  what the actual    it s talking to the iphone now  all is pretty good this tracker doesn t give me any vibrations to get my steps at     on the hour  it doesn t let me know that i got        steps  it cant talk to my iphone x  on the plus side the gps works and i like the tougher heartbeat zones   having said that  unless this gets fixed i m returning it when my time limit runs out  i m sure it will be heck transitioning back to my charge   but i m so disgusted by this beta version that was sold as a finished product  i even half tempted to say f it and buy an apple watch      
296,4.0,                       this is my first fitbit and i love it  i have had it for about   months now  the only draw back is i keep having to restart it or reset heart rate as it stops reading frequently when exercising  i have large wrists so the original band does not work out to well so i had to get an adjustable elastic band that works pretty good most of the time but it s already time for a new band  the best part of this product is being able to see how many calories you burn vs what you actually take in  when i got this band i was     and now i m down to      it helps me stay motivated to eat better and exercise more even though i have a sedentary job  very happy with the progress  i only wish fitbit made better bands for guys with large wrists  the app is great and helps you track your progress      
297,3.0,                       at first i was very excited for this  it is sleek and easy to use  but unfit natrly im just disappointed  it came to me with     battery  i had it on for   hours and it went to     after minimal activity  i went for a walk around the neighborhood  total of about a mile  and it had dropped to     within the half hour i was exercising  i placed it on charge and within    minutes it was back up to      i want to like this but with such a poor battery  i m not sure i will be able to  i m gonna stick with it for a few weeks and see if this corrects itself somehow  if not  back to amazon it will be sent      
298,1.0,                       update   wish i could give it less than a  star review   it doesn t hold a charge for long and sometimes just zones out and doesn t record any steps for long periods  for no obvious reason had the fitbit one forever and since i can t replace that  i thought i would try one of the better new fitbits   very disappointed  they haven t improved much and many features are actually worse   takes many taps sometimes just to get the display to show and the battery life is so  so poor  it went from     yesterday to    this morning   really not impressed      
299,5.0,                       i bought this product for my wife for christmas she was very excited  she used a fitbit before many years ago but when it broke her mother bought her another product which looks similar  let s say this product that her mother bought for her kind of worked  now that she switch back to the fact that she is very happy with all aspects including the tracking and battery life  highly recommendthis fitbit product     
300,1.0,                       over counts any action you do  wearing it on my non dominate hand  against my skin  still way over counts steps taken  and it counts elevator rides as floors   i took   flights of stairs today     but i went up and down in the elevator several times  i earned the skydivers badge with over     floors in one day  what   doesn t this thing have a gps built into it for more accuracy      on top of being blue toothed to my phone  which btw drains your battery life constantly  dont by this for a step counter or caloric counter  heart rate is accurate as far as i can tell     but who knows      
301,4.0,                       this is a pretty good watch it has some bugs i believe need to be worked out the sleep tracking seems to be off a bit and the floor tracker but other then some small things i think this is a great watch for helping keep you motivated  it has a reminder setting for if you been idle to long  and helps keep track of weight i would recommend it     
302,4.0,                       disappointed    when using the gps on hiking and biking it does not last but   to   hours  if i had read this prior to purchasing it  i would have not done so   reasons be    i like to hike     miles and bike     miles when i do adventure out  i can t even use the gps to track an entire trip without my charge  dying  all other features are good       
303,1.0,                       have had two fitbit charge   devices   both were reliable  worked fine   screen cracked so i thought i d upgrade to a charge   based on the great reviews   it is an absolute piece of crap   it is cumbersome on the wrist and the device itself is not nearly as easy to use and responsive   sleep tracking has me in deep sleep when i am up and walking around  and in terms of tracking exercise  i turned it on for a stationary bike workout  and now it literally will not stop   i took the device off an hour ago  and have pushed every button  scrolled every scroll  and it will not turn off   it s been off my wrist for    minutes  and i guess i can still work out with no pulse at all   do not buy this      
304,1.0,                       i have worn a fitbit since        this is the second charge   i have had in   days   i have reset and reinstalled the app and the charge itself so many times i ve lost count   the heart rate monitor on either device  the one i bought directly from fitbit   days ago  and now this new one from amazon also a charge     still no heart rate monitor   very unhappy    probably going to return this one as well    maybe try an apple watch instead      
305,3.0,                       fitbit pay is poorly implemented as it is first thing on the  hold side button  meu   which i use often so i don t want to go through fitbit pay screen and i don t want pay on  i want to turn on pay function when i need it and then turn it off  the pay option should be the second left swipe after holding side button at which point you should be able to use pin or not  the  n main functionality problem i have is that you can t adjust font so i can t see my steps count without glasses and there is really one one face that has what i want  they have not fixed this in years probably focusing on their bigger ticket items  i don t know   if another company had a similar style that looked as good i would probably switch  too bad otherwise i like almost everything else but these are key features that are just so poorly implemented         
306,1.0,                       i don t know why after the connectivity problems i had with the charge     failed to sync all the time  that i bought the charge     i set up the device in the app on my laptop   everything went fine but the device wouldn t work   it kept displaying the web site address as if it was not set up   took it off the charger  removed it from the app  waited     hr and tried again with the same results   if it doesn t work after the next try it goes back   how on earth this company can be making these for so long and still  have this problem i don t know when the charge   worked and synced it was great but it would fail to sync about   out of   days   i expect that if this device worked it would be great  but it is glitchy  in other words not reliable   i would not recommend it to others      
307,2.0,                       ugh  i read what others wrote and hoped the software wouldn t twitch out like others have said  unfortunately  not the case  i ve had my fitbit charge   for a month now  and for the first three weeks i loved it  really helpful information  and a key part of getting me inspired for every workout  then  last week  not sure what happened  but it stopped recording my exercise  or  it would record the walk with my dog as exercise but the run or brisk paced walk won t show up  i did some research and fitbit knows about this  happened in the earlier versions too  ugh  fitbit i am not a fan      
308,4.0,                       i would have given it   stars if the app shared data with the apple health app on the iphone and ipad   i tried a much cheaper fitness tracker and the app for that one shared with the apple health app   why doesn t the fitbit app   the tracker seems pretty accurate for what i use it for   primarily heart beat and sleep tracking   the heart beat monitor seems very accurate compared to other monitors i have   while i haven t had this fitbit long  what little sleep data i ve collected appears to underestimate the total length of sleep i m getting   that said the analysis of light  deep  and rem sleep seems far more accurate than the cheap lintelek tracker i tried   the lintelek tracker was garbage that faked heartbeat data during periods i wasn t even wearing the thing   i wish the fitbit came with better instructions in the package   i had to go looking for instructions   turns out there is a pretty detailed manual in the phone app   glad i found that because for all the various exercise activities the fitbit claims to track  before you get into deeper settings  the device only offers to track a few   was also surprised that the tracker does not track rowing   rowing machines are pretty common in gyms and for home fitness equipment   instead  i have to select a general fitness routine  and for the     miles i row  the fitbit gives me credit for about      miles traveled   overall i m happy with it and the app  but there is still room for improvement      
309,5.0,                       i purchased this to replace my old flex   that finally died on me   i almost got the charge   but it looks like fitbit is phasing out that model so i paid the extra for the   even though   was available through other distributers including amazon   this is a bulkier than my flex   but has a readable face   it s not feminine at all but i purchased a thinner  girlie  wrist band   i like the real time hr and zones  steps  activities right on the device as well as clock face   i like the additional sleep info that this provides through the app as well  very happy with this purchase      
310,1.0,                       so disappointed   would not track sleep or oxygen  saturation   called tech support   times  i would have to uninstall the app  reinstall  resync the device  then it would work for a day or    they told me my lg  thinq wasn t supported  they suggested i by a samsung galaxy s   so i did  still the same problem  what a piece of crap and i bought a new phone i didn t need      
311,1.0,                       not happy with the accuracy at all  finally figured out after my husband wore this for a few weeks that it counts steps when he uses his arms a lot  not really happy as that is very inaccurate      
312,5.0,                       this is the prefect weigh loss helper  i love how it vibrates to coach you into movement  like a cheerleader on your arm  i have taken on covid like hey   who do i want to be when this is done  a skinnier me   i can look at the calories i have burned and eat under the amount in food calories and lose weight  i was amazed how many calories i burned playing pickle ball        steps    it makes everything i do more fun  i went from a size    to a   and this has been my coach the whole time  the one draw back  no instructions in the box  what  i had to look stuff up on line and get the ap   i am still not sure what some of the little signs mean  did not stop me from using the ones i needed to lose weight    bought one from my daughter  buy others for friends for christmas        
313,3.0,                       for a basic fitness tracker this does its job  great for tracking heart rate and steps  with some caveats  pros  good sleep metrics  good heart metrics  good options for setting various personal goals  decent tracker for calories burned  many exercises available  app has good graphs for tracking stuff over weeks  months  or even years  gps provides good metrics  when it manages to work cons  app is slow to sync with watch  often takes a minute or two  and sometimes multiple tries   gps rarely works  i run a couple of times a week under open sky  it still fails to connect most of the time  probably less than   in   attempts  this is probably the biggest issue with this watch   watch face is too dim under sunlight  none of the face styles offer pure white while including the health metrics  some things are always gray colored  which is too dim  and you have to cup your hand over the watch to read them   run timer is also unreadable under sunlight  so it s nearly impossible to check your time while you re running  screen will occasionally freeze  only way to fix seems to be connecting it to the power cord   sticks out from your wrist more than a regular watch  so it s easy to catch on edges   when tracking steps  it counts extra arm movements as steps  such as washing dishes or other chores  so unless you purely walking running it s not that accurate over the course of the day   no swimming option for open water  water sweat will sometimes interfere with heart rate monitoring     
314,4.0,                       it s not much different from the one my   year old had and doesn t even wear it  and this one feels the same to me  but i got her a few nice     bucks   straps that match the clock piece  but it does have way more options and features  so on that note it s not as expensive as an apple watch  which i have  gen    and its night and day  to me  not her  she loves it  she loves that it s small  and the straps i got are jewelry looking  so it looks like a bangle bracelet smartwatch for     its got all the tech the apple watch has except the ecg and color screen and basically its a watchphone  i use my right air pod to take a call  i mean its nowhere near as  cool as  the apple watch is  but if she s not looking for another thing to break  which you can easily break an apple watch  then this is it  its got it all if she s looking for real health info  the app is really nice and shows a lot and is useful  unlike the apple watch health app  kinda sucks  so that s it  try to get a different band if that your taste  the stock ones are just like the apple watch ones  i understand its better for water and intense workouts  i guess  but my lady doesn t need to workout like that  she aging like wine  thank god       
315,4.0,                       i bought this to replace a charge   which worked great but was getting old and the band broke   the charge   has a lot more bells and whistles but it won t always sync to the app  which is frustrating  it says it s syncing but it doesn t  then i have to go through the whole process of telling fitbit to forget the device and then set it up again  bother      
316,5.0,                       i like the information it provides  the sleekness of the design  and the longevity of the battery   i stopped using my apple watch for this fitbit as the apple watch battery would not last even a full day and it is only several months old i like the app of the fitbit and highly recommend the device and the app   i purchased the premium level of the app      
317,1.0,                       let me start off by saying i have never felt compelled to write a review before  but this product warrants one  i bought this tracker to help motivate me and stay accountable for my fitness goals  the heart monitor and the app were also big factors that helped me decide on this particular model  what a disaster  right out of the box  it was nothing but a pain  setup was complicated  the screen wasn t responsive about half of the time  i couldn t get the device to charge no matter how hard or many times i tried  the way you charge this and the proprietary charger itself is a nightmare  you don t even get to see the charging status  if you can get it to start charging at all  the short time i was able to wear the device  it said i had over       steps in about    minutes  without leaving my house  apparently my heart rate also fluctuated between about    and     in that time as well  basically impossible  returning immediately  will pay the same amount or just a bit more for a garmin      
318,3.0,                       very disappointed in fitbit in general at this point  but this product especially   i have had trouble in the past with fitbit not tracking my heart rate during workouts   i decided to go all out and buy the charge   because of the reviews   it ended up having the same issues as my previous fitbit  which was the charge    where once i started sweating  it seemed like it just couldn t accurately track my heart rate  if i looked to check where my heart rate was it was either blank or super low   you can see in the picture i added  it did fine at first but then dropped off even though my workout didn t change  i would compare my heart rate on the treadmill and it was usually way off   but if i was just sitting or walking it would do just fine  i tried wearing it in different positions and adjusting it s tightness and nothing seemed to help  once i started sweating it just struggled  i m disappointed that a  th generation of this model of fitbit selling for      could still struggle so much   not sure if it s because i have hairy arms  or i sweat too much  either way i feel like there really shouldn t be any excuse   that being said  the gps  sleep tracker  step counter  and other features are great   just not worth the price      
319,4.0,                       the charge   seems to work perfectly and is fun to track all the information it provides  but  how to handle thefitbit seem to be a bit of a mystery and hit or miss  the display message for various setting status is vague  does theindication  sleep mode on  mean selected this to activate sleep mode or is it the status that sleep mode is on  and the response to selection is also vague  no immediate indication of new status  guess i ll have to do more research since the manual is nearly worthless      
320,5.0,                       this is my  nd fitbit  i love that i can change the bands on the fitbit charge   and that it isn t attached to the fitbit like my charge hr was  i also love the new sleep stages  new to me anyway  as compared to what it looked like with my old charge hr  i have used the relax feature for helping me go to sleep at night  i look forward to using the rest of the features when i m able to go to the gym again because i will get points from aarp just for exercising with this fitbit      
321,5.0,                       loving my fitbit charge     i ve been using this for about   months now   lost    lbs   i use the app to track my food and calories which seems to work well for me   good motivation to get my steps in every day   i only have to charge it for about an hour and it lasts for     days      
322,5.0,                       has many more apps than i will use   example the pay feature    i just needed basic tracking   time   sleep   steps cal  burned   weight lost   it is kind of nice to have the heart rate feature  it seems to be very accurate when i check my pulse   i do notice i m not getting call notifications or text messages on it   i haven t figured out what i m not setting correctly to get the notifications for them   other than that i m happy with the product      
323,5.0,                       at    i need all the encouragement that i can get and the fitbit products allow me to stay motivated and build my exercise tolerance  the tracker reminds me when to move and when to rest  i need reminding  since i was given my first tracker in       i have been better able to manage my weight and health  i have lost almost    pounds and the accountability keeps me on track      
324,1.0,                       my charge   did not work from day    the bluetooth connection randomly fails  so then it won t synch and i lose all my data  if the company had just stepped up and replaced it or something  i wouldn t be writing this review  but over many many conversations and emails they repeatedly told me to do the same things i had done    times already and that didn t work  my most recent email from them says they are  currently working on  the issue  my warranty is completely useless  because according to them it is a software issue  and therefore not covered  seriously pissed off with the company at this point      
325,1.0,                       this item came out in april      i got it right away one of the hooks from the actual screen to the strap came loose finally breaking   i probably had it for   weeks  i sent it back i just receive a new one i fully charged it last night i took it off the charger and the screen goes black  side button vibrates but nothing coming on the screen i have it all ready to send it back tomorrow      
326,4.0,                       i ve been  basically happy with it   i was diagnosed as diabetic a few months ago so i got it to help with monitoring my activity level   week to week  i get a report comparing this week to the previous week   i don t know how realistic it is  but i feel it it relatively tells me how i am doing   frequently i notice   i ll be very active doing some work around the house and look at it and it will have my heart rate is at     or something very low when i know it is well over       if i an exercising  and tell it that i am am  if seems better at keeping my heart rate accurate   sometimes it does not monitor my sleep very well   i will spend a couple of hours in the evening watching tv and frequently calls that sleep  four months into it  i m still trying to figure out why that happens   i feel somewhat like an experiment for them  knowing damn well whatever they learn from me  they will turn around and charge me for the upgrade otherwise  battery life is great  i plug it in every few weeks while i am sitting at the computer working and it charges quickly   i haven t used it much  but the gps has been very good at showing where i have hiked  i wish i could tie that gps with my lumix camera      
327,5.0,                       bought this for my husband because his job is doing a challenge  this fitbit tracks better than his samsung gear fit  which was twice the price  he s also able to wear this one comfortably while working and was not able to do so with the samsung  i should have went with a fitbit to begin with      
328,1.0,                       it s been a few days and still i cannot get this fitbit to connect to the app  this is f    ing ridiculous  it should not be this difficult  especially as a millennial  to connect a device via bluetooth  i m ready to throw this thing in the garbage      
329,3.0,                       i purchased the fitbit charge   to replace an aging withings activit  pop   while rich in features  i will be returning the charge   due to poor battery life and other drawbacks   battery life   the advertised  up to   day  battery life is a fantasy  perhaps achievable if you leave the fitbit unused in a drawer all week   in normal use  the battery only lasts about two days   tracking a    minute jog brings a full charge down to     and a three hour hike from full to       compared to the withings  which uses a watch battery that must only be replaced annually  the constant need to charge the fitbit is disappointing   activity tracking is hit or miss   in several instances the fitbit did not automatically recognize and track jogs or long walks   in other instances tracking has stopped part way through an activity and then restarted recording as a new activity   in the app  i end up with multiple entries for a single activity  with no way to merge the data   fitbit pay interface is slow   the ability to pay wirelessly from the fitbit seems useful   i have not been able to test the feature in real life due to covid related closures and restrictions   however  the interface to input the   digit pin is complicated and would likely be slow and annoying in a real word setting   hopefully fitbit updates the interface      
330,3.0,                       i am happy with the overall product  but the advertising of the watch connecting with spotify and providing text messages from your phone is a bit misleading   the update allows you to connect to spotify eventually  but mine eventually always drops the blue tooth connection   it does inform me of phone calls  but not text messages   however  for exercising purposes  i am happy with the product      
331,3.0,                       so just like another review on here     my fitbit will not turn on during the setup     it will slightly vibrate when i press the side button but the screen will not turn on at all   so disappointed     will try more but i think i will be returning it tomorrow     update    i got it working and now it seems to be good     steps are accurate and also the gps is great   originally marked it as a   star but bumped it up to   since it is working well now      
332,1.0,                       the watch looks good and is comfortable  but beyond that it is basically worthless there are days when i have hardly moved at all and the device is telling me that i ve got up    flights of stairs and walked  k steps i get   hours of sleep and sometimes only     hours are registered i m on an exercise bike going hard and it says my bpm is at    i pick the watch up off the counter to put it on and it reads     bpm even never having come into contact with my skin sometimes the menu only shows the first two options and i can t access the other three pages by swiping it tells time but i have absolutely zero confidence in the exercise metrics      
333,1.0,                       was wearing while working out this morning and the black piece on the side that connects the device to the band broke off and cannot be repaired   reached out to amazon to see if there was anything i could do  and they said the window for return exchange closed in august        purchased in july        a lot of money wasted for an item used for   months   if this device can t withstand moderate exercise  then i m going to have to look at other brands that might be better suited for any kind of movement           
334,3.0,                       i tried this device for   weeks   most of the time i felt it was reasonably accurate  for steps  floors  and heart rates in resting and  fat burn  zones   however  the main reason i bought this thing was to measure my heart rate at the top of my exercise capacity   it was erratic and inaccurate with this specific task   i would be working hard  and by taking my pulse estimate    s  and it would show       sometimes it would freeze then stutter back   i might just spring for a chest strap   for more context  i am a very petite female  wrist barely the     inches they said it would fit  doing hiit   i am certain i was wearing snugly with proper placement      
335,4.0,                       i love the new fitbit with all then updated features  i only wish it was more customizable like my charge   was  i have apps on things on it that i will not use  so i had to uninstall them  no way to reorder the apps  you have to scroll through everything  i wish there were more fun looking clock faces with the date  i did settle on one i like  the clock  doesn t always turn on when you flip your wrist over  also no setting to enable or disable this feature  i like that it has a sleep mode and do not disturb mode  i love that it has the weather   that s awesome overall i am very happy  i hope they update their app so some of my issues are resolved      
336,2.0,                       i like the fitbit charge   in many ways  but the main reason i got it was for the built in gps  sadly  its performance was very poor  i have a     mile run that i do several times a week  and generally track it with mapmyrun  for the same route  the fitbit charge   logged     or     miles  this makes a big difference for the pace  what really was a       pace was only reported as a pace of         for example  once the distance is wrong  all the the other measurements are compromised as well  when i looked at the map of the route as recorded by fitbit  i could see what the problem was   it cut corners all over the place  and even reported me as having gone through yards and houses  it was so far off  i also tried gps tracking with glonass  on  in the settings  and it didn t help  if you are looking for a fitness tracker or smart watch with a good built in gps  i suggest you look elsewhere      
337,1.0,                       this product is complete trash  i bought one to replace my aging charge   and thought it might be easy to setup and sync but i was wrong  tried several things to try to get it to work  i finally got it to connect to my account but it didn t want to sync to apps  count steps  register sleep  or anything else  i returned it because of these issues and received a replacement two weeks later  exact same issues happened but this time  the display shut off after i connected it to my account  did the initial troubleshooting that i ve seen on some of the comments on the   star reviews but nothing works  looks like i will be returning another one and never buying another fitbit product  trash      
338,3.0,                       as a device this is a great tracker watch  i really like it  the problem  and it seems to be a charge   and not a charge   thing  is that there is a noticable gap between the device and the band it came with  i haven t found any solutions to the issue aside from going through warranty  and looking at fitbit s customer forums that describe the same problem there s no resolution even with device replacement  so know that going in  still a decent device      
339,5.0,                       i liked this watch better then the versa because i feel the screen is more durable and it is a little less bulkier then the versa  it has the same features as well that i use  i feel the accuracy of its data is great  it really is a great edition for my workouts and i like to see how i am sleeping through the nights      
340,1.0,                       i find the charge   cannot be used without a smartphone  the fitbit interface software for windows implies that the charge   is fully compatible with windows and provides interface software to install and sync with the charge    after installing the fitbit software i was unable to setup or sync my charge   with my laptop  fitbit specifically states that the software will sync fitbit trackers to computers  but i ve found this not to be the case      
341,2.0,                       for me the screen would only displace once i started charging it and then when i tried to pair it with my phone it wouldn t  the screen would go black  the vibration would still work but couldn t see anything  very disappointing  probably a manufacturer issue because i tried pairing and connecting a few times and gave up because the screen kept going out      
342,1.0,                       i have been wearing a fitbit for several years   my charge   has finally worn out  so i thought i would replace it with brand  new technology in the charge     the charge   did not recognize my first night of sleep  my burn was significantly lower than it has ever been  it didn t auto recognize my walks that my charge   always recognized  and my number of hours with     steps for the first day said    of    on my device but recorded on the app as   of      no matter how many steps i took from the fitbit troubleshooting website  nothing would work to give me my hours with     steps  back   so  after    hours  i sent it back and bought a fitbit charge    which i love   fitbit should do way more testing before launching a product with so many issues      
343,5.0,                       i bought is as a present to my wife  it looks good  choice of colors  unexpectedly it replaces an apple watch to some extent and she likes it  using it every day  she has not tried sleep feature yet  easy to recharge using usb port  overall it is an excellent product      
344,2.0,                       i bought this in june  and it barely made it to november  i don t do any kind of super aggressive or hard impact sports  and i never swam in it  but the strap broke in such a way that i can t even order a replacement strap   it took part of the fitbit with it  less than   months   really    aside from that  it was working pretty well  sometimes there would be connectivity issues with the phone app  but those were usually a pretty simple fix  steps  sleep tracking  etc   were all pretty accurate  i m just so disappointed that it broke so fast      
345,5.0,                       got this for hubby to track his steps at work but he works in a prison  so it was difficult finding one that was not against policy and procedure  this one is perfect  it s small  professional looking  and not a smartwatch  which is specifically against policy and procedure  lol  it has bluetooth that can be activated but no cell signal to receive messages  etc  he absolutely loves it  i bought him a second band to go with it that is  dressier  looking and when he has to wear class a s  he puts the fancy band on  otherwise  the band it comes on is perfect for everyday wear      
346,2.0,                       overall i am very disappointed  i did a lot of research on which fitness tracker i wanted  i specifically looked for sleep tracking as a large component  i was very excited to get the charge   because it wasn t so clunky looking and it was supposed to do everything i wanted if you re looking for anything more than a step counter  don t waste your money  this thing looses my hear rate constantly  all other forms of tracking rely on an accurate hr  it tracks my sleep maybe once a week if i am lucky  i always check to make sure it is tracking my heart rate before i go to sleep and my the time i wake up there is no data  the active minutes for weightloss  don t track because it never knows what my heart rate it  basically every time i look at my watch it is not tracking my hr  i have to take it off and put it on several times for it to pick up i have tried all the things fitbit suggest to do to help the problem and none of them work  they know it is an issue and have no fix for it  veey disappointing  its basically a very expensive step counter  at least it can integrate with other fitness and food tracking apps      
347,3.0,                       the device was stylish and functional  until it wasn t  just a couple weeks after purchasing  it stopped displaying anything even when fully charged  none of the fixes i read about did the trick  so i sent it back to fitbit for service  haven t heard a peep back since shipping it off over a week ago  but we ll see      
348,5.0,                       although it doesn t hold a charge well if you use gps without your phone on long walks  i love this watch   i love that it maps where you ve walked  even if your path takes you off streets  as well as reflecting elevation and pulse during the walk so you can figure out how well you re working out   i also like the sleep program  although i don t like that it won t chart naps under   hour   i don t know how truly accurate the numbers are in the exercise figures and sleep program  there seem to be slight discrepancies   but it gives me great enough feedback  and keeps me well motivated      
349,1.0,                       actually  the headline is a little generous  because i had a lot of difficulty with setup  eventually  after restarting my phone a couple of times  though  i was able to set up the device  it s as comfortable as any fitbit wearable  nice features and i was happy with it this morning i plugged it into the charger while getting in the shower and when i went to put it back on  it was unresponsive  the button appeared stuck in the  depressed  position  no vibration in the cradle  screen was unresponsive and the app could not find it  the support rep at fitbit did make a solid effort to help but my device appeared to be bricked  after a week of normal use my experience may not be typical based on the number of favorable reviews  but be aware that it s at least a possibility      
350,1.0,                       i purchased this on january          it will no longer wake up when i turn my wrist to view it  and it will also no longer show notifications for text messages  it  was  working perfectly at one point but then just stopped  i may randomly get a rogue text notification every once in a while  but it ll be hours after the fact  unsure if that is related to the fitbit itself or google just sucking at making a decent texting app  or maybe it s because google owns fitbit and google always ends up trashing everything it touches  the fitbit will also say that i ve climbed dozens of floors when that s not even close to accurate  pure garbage  give me my money back      
351,1.0,                       junki finally received my fitbit and unfortunately it just has a black screen  i followed all directions  which is charging it and pairing it up to my phone  but as it was paring  the screen just turned black and when my phone tries to finish the set up and asks me for a   number pin  i can t type them in because i can t see them  i tried a reset by placing the fitbit on a charger  and nothing happened  there is a vibration when i press the button  but nothing more  i really needed this to work by tomorrow and now this happens  it s a great disappointment      
352,3.0,                       i was pretty disappointed  battery life is nowhere near the   days they say  the clarify it depends on the use  but when using the gps  it consumes approx     of the battery per hour  it wouldn t be a problem if there was the option of using the gps from the phone instead  i guess i ll charge it every day which is not a problem but battery wouldn t last for a long walk run also  i took the straps off   times tops  to wash them and dry them   and the clipping mechanism is already loose i was very happy withy my charge   until it suddenly died and now i m stuck with this one  and it wasn t cheap        
353,1.0,                       i had to return the charge   because it didn t track swimming to any degree of accuracy  i gave the charge   a chance  the gps is absolutely worthless unless you believe i can walk on water  one chance  that s all i m giving them  i wouldn t trust my times here forward  save the money  i do love their app  however      
354,5.0,                       wow  i was debating between apple watch   and this little thing  and chose this for the price and the simplicity  i now think i definitely made the right decision  this is such an amazing device that does exactly what you want   steps workout calorie sleep tracking  and none of the bs you don t need  emails  text messages  etc   best investment i made to myself during quarantine time  love it      
355,1.0,                       not even a month in having this watch and the wrist band broke on the watch its self amazon said they couldn t take it back and fit bit is giving me the run around and won t make it right i called them they said give us your email and we will email you instructions on what to do it said to send pics of watch where it was broke and a picture of the fit bit marking on the watch put in the case number and some other info that they wanted the first rely back was you did not tell us what country you live in well that was not in the instructions  sent to so i said ok and told them i live in america they sent another reply saying the pictures did not show where it said fitbit on the watch i told them it most certainly does and they sent me another reply saying i did not give them a case number i replied that i sent all the info they requested even the case number and i have not received a reply back in a couple days i had rather buy a horse turd than another fitbit product     
356,1.0,                       the charge   has horrible band gap  if you go on the fitbit forum everyones complaining about the charge    very few selected people had their issues fixed  quality control is horrible on these  the band connection is super loose to the point where it feels like it ll fall off  aftermarket bands didn t fix this issue  i would stick with the charge   and only get this if you really care about the horrible gps tracking   spotify      
357,1.0,                       ordered the fitbit charge   on amazon  gps tracking was ridiculously slow  sometimes several minutes before satellite detection  the display is not readable in outdoor sunshine  especially while running  worst of all  the watch died after less than   weeks of use  all efforts to reset  etc  failed  fortunately  i bought the watch at amazon com and received a prompt credit refund      
358,2.0,                       this is more of a review on the seller  heart rate monitors  than the charge    i bought it more for the pulse oxygen and vo  max readings  however  there is no actual data provided for either of these values  just a point on a graph  of ranges  so i returned the item and got hit with a restocking fee  i could not see anywhere either on the main page or after clicking the seller s  heart rate monitors  link there was no indication of a restocking fee  even used the  find  function on the browser and nothing  so if you like the charge   don t buy it form heart rate monitors      
359,1.0,                       it s amazing  but only when it works it is so hard to get this to charge  i have to clean the contacts constantly and i have to check on it frequently to make sure it is charging  more than half the time it isn t   after a little over two months of daily use  i cannot get it to charge anymore not matter how much i try  i wouldn t spend     on this  let along      i am so disappointed  i was using this to track my steps and report to my fitness coach  i can t afford to buy another tracker      
360,4.0,                       the replacement product of fitbit charge   was set up easily with my iphone without any issues  the first one i purchased was not working and could not pair with my phone  however  as happy as i am with this new one  i am disappointed that it does not hold charge like it is proclaiming  as an example  in a    hour period the charge drops to     which is odd for a product claiming   day charge  i also do not like the different bit of information being promoted  but i am somewhat happy with the charge        
361,2.0,                       i have been using fitbit devices for about   years  i have always used the charge and always been very happy  i love the app  i don t care about bells and whistles  i like the heart rate monitor and tracking exercise steps a few reasons why this device feels like a huge disappointment   enough that i m going to try to either return it or sell it    something changed with the screen or light on this device and you can no longer read it when using polarized sunglasses  wtf  i have it on the brightest setting so it s not that    i absolutely hate the new user interface  it s difficult to use and not intuitive whatsoever  i hate how you have to swipe across to find things and the touch screen and side touch button is a bad upgrade and finicky  what was wrong with the regular button  i just find myself frustrated everytime i need to track something and often  accidentally  am ending workouts early or they turn off on their own bc someone s brushed up against it  there are so many stupid pointless screens  how could this design even fly  did they even test it  crazy    the screen scratched up basically within days of using  i didn t  do  anything to cause this like falling or impact so i m guessing it was so minor bump up but now is a giant scratch  these screens should be more resilient    why is there no  exercise  function for yoga or really any basic  stationary  exercise like weight training etc  the closes thing is called  outdoor exercise   kind of weird    the battery feels worse than the prior version i m trying to think of a single reason i like this but frankly the charge   was leaps and bounds better  i only upgraded bc it was no longer working  frustrated by this product and wanted to share an honest review      
362,5.0,                       my wife has destroyed   fitbits in the past  i don t blame fitbit because i have gifted two others to nieces who still have the original fitbit charge working well  hopefully  this one will survive      
363,1.0,                       liked the product  but did not approve the use of my time to block text everyday   why can t we just enjoy a product without being harassed everyday about weight lose programs   i just returned the one i purchased for my wife  i would like to return this one but can not   so now it is up for sale on craig s list      
364,3.0,                       i had a charge   four four years and recently purchased a charge    i like the different features  but it simply will not stay synced with the app  some days it loses its bluetooth connection   or   times  which means you have to delete the device and then sync it again with the app  it s just annoying and a pain  from an internet search  i found this is a common problem with the charge    fitbit needs to correct this flaw      
365,1.0,                       bottom line  although it has some fun and useful features  the fitbit charge   fails in its essential mission of actually tracking heartrate during exercise the fitbit charge   could have been a great mid range fitness tracker   it has gps capabilities and a suit of cool apps that track everything from calories burned to quality of sleep   and fitbit s  zone minutes  are an elegantly simple way to capture exercise time   but most of these features are made useless by the charge   s failure to consistently read my heartrate during exercise   and the more intense the exercise  the worse the charge   performs   i ve tried repositioning the charge   on my wrist  tightening  and then loosening  the band  and cleaning the pulse sensor    all to no avail   rather than display my pulse accurately during exercise  the charge   often just shows two dashes  indicating that it cannot read my pulse   according to fitbit s own message boards  this is a common problem for which there is fix  other than what i ve described above   that should be a deal breaker for anyone who wants a fitness tracker that actually  you know  tracks exercise      
366,1.0,                       i ve been in a frustrating back and forth with fitbit customer service for longer than the device functioned  it died almost exactly a month after purchase  it simply stopped accepting a charge  once the battery died it was just a bracelet  let me be clear  the product itself was frustrating from the start  when i was able to use it  the gps was very inaccurate and the activity tracker would stop unexpectedly mid exercise  this is such a bummer  i ve been using some kind of a fitbit since january of       it s cool to have all that data in once place  i guess i need to look into migrating it elsewhere  i don t usually spend the time to write a review  but if i can help others avoid this lousy device and the even worse customer service  i figured it was worth taking a few minutes to document      
367,3.0,                       i ve used a fitbit for   years and all of the have been true to holding a charge for the amount of hours stated in the product manual  the fitbit   however did not   it only lasted half of the days  only   out of the   that the product was advertised to last  after speaking with customer service i was informed that the tracker would last   days only if the gps   always connect   and other features were not used  i m disappointed because those are the features that i wanted the tracker for   it s not as advertised    so disappointed  i was also told to let the battery run completely out and then recharge the tracker using it without using gps  also frequently checking the fitbit app  which syncs your tracker   frequently receiving notifications   frequently checking your stats using quick view use without these things and then call back and let support know how many days the tracker lasted i just don t want to use my tracker without the advertised features very disappointed      
368,1.0,                       this tracker is the worst  when the steps try to sync with the app  more than a thousand steps can be lost at a time  and fitbit then minuses the step count and is completely unreliable  i contacted fitbit today and got zero help after being on hold for over    minutes  basically was told that all their devices are glitching  and they have their team working on it  but no refund or replacement would be sent because it wasn t bought on their site  our family has purchased nearly    fit bits over the years  and this will be our last  extremely poor customer service and willingness to help in a situation they rightly admitted was their issue  the fitbit had been used less than two weeks  absolute junk     
369,1.0,                       i was very excited to get my fitbit charge   yesterday  got it set up  wore it all evening  all night  all day today   it was great i m returning it for a full refund    it does not allow me to respond to gmail or to texts  because it does not support textra  it is wayyy more frustrating to get text notifications on my watch  then have to pick up my phone to respond     same with gmail   there is no reply option   only delete  clear  or open   clicking open takes me back to the clockface frustrating   i d rather not have this than to have to live with this frustraction every day   i need textra so when clients text me at   pm i can program my response to go to them at      am sorely disappointed   what a complete oversight this is for fitbit not to foresee this with avid android users who do not use stock apps      
370,3.0,                       i sent this back  i ve had a charge   for a long time and like it a lot  but  the charge   doesn t work with my desktop computer  it must pair with one s smart phone   i don t have a smart phone and don t want one  so  this device  however well intended  did not work for me  so  i opted for another charge   instead      
371,4.0,                       i ve had this for nearly   months now and have worn it just about all but   of those days pros very comfortable  i don t even notice i m wearing it even when sleeping  the band is a nice rubbery plastic as is the casing  they both feel nice in your hand and on your wrist easy to usecustomizable  not great but good enough  different options for digital watch faces  and a small list of activities you can add to it to track   example you can tell it your doing weight lifting or swimming and it adjusts what it tracks accordingly   you can also buy new bands if yours breaks or you want a different color app support  is well done  easy to navigate  not ugly  does a fairly good job of explaining what you re looking at and whats important  although the communities while good in theory are not that great  its a lot of people trying to promote themselves or post pictures that clearly aren t them  it doesn t do much for the motivation guided workouts and goals  you get them through the app but sadly are only available if you subscribe to the premium service  if you do that i think they re worth it  they certainly dont hurt cons scratch resistance  watch face is can be easily scratched  i scratched mine a few weeks ago while indoor climbing  also climbing is not a sport fitbit has an option to track        its probably a price issue but it would be much better if it were covered in some scratch resistant glass rather than plastic  it is an activity tracker and in sports or outdoor activities there s always the possibility of something getting knocked around  the casing is also plastic and it would be nice to see a more durable plastic or other material used there as well wake display  on movement detection isn t the best  often times i lift my hand or turn my wrist to look at the time and the watch doesn t wake up  i have to press the side of it to activate the display features behind subscription service  some of the features of the charge   are only usable if you re subscribed to their fitbit premium service other accuracy  not so much of a con  but i just wonder how accurate it is especially when it comes to sleep tracking  i suppose at the worst its an estimate to give you a better idea of whats going on      
372,4.0,                       i had the altahr before this for   yeassband decided it was time to upgrade  i waited for the black friday sale and got mine for about     cheaper than usual  i ve had it for just over two months now and really love it  heart rate tracking is important to me since it motivates me when i see calories burned from a work out  i know it may not be      accurate but i know it s within the ballpark and that makes me happy just like the previous fitbits it sets reminders for you to get up and walk  working from home  i can forgot easily to get up and stretch my legs so this really helps me stay on track i really love fitbit products and i say maybe wait for the next sale  i think they have them often  if you are on the fence      
373,2.0,                       i bought this  excited for it to work  it works about     of the time if i line it up with the clearest part of my tattooed arm  this is a known issue however they do not advertise it and will not refund you for it  so basically i have a defunct heart rate monitor that is only frustrating to use as it will not track at the times you want it most  also the sleep function is comically bad  the only solution i was suggested was putting an epoxy sticker over the led light that measures heart rate  this produces a value but not remotely close to the same value when i do catch my heartrate for a few moments without it   so who is to say what is accurate  do not recommend fitbit is a scam  peace      
374,3.0,                       i won t be like everyone who gives a bad review because they clearly got a dud  or user error as it often is   i ll give it an honest assessment the app is amazing  that goes without saying  the quality of the band is nice  but it s a bit hefty  made bulkier by the textured diamond pattern in the band  the clasp is a bit cumbersome as well  and feels a bit like cheap plastic  i ll reserve my judgments on that until it breaks  doesn t inspire confidence though the watch itself seems to be very accurate  it s comfortable  and has some nice options  the pressure button on the side is a little hard to press  i wish you could change the settings for the sensitivity  when pressing  it requires you to stabilize the other side with your thumb or else you ll just push the watch causing it to slide toward your hand  the ui on the app is clean and simple  although i wish it allowed to customization  i don t need all the settings and stats it comes with  and many you cannot remove from the ui  this makes you scroll more than you ll probably want to to get to the features you like  if we could at least re order them  that d allow for quicker navigation my final note is battery life  fitbit claims   days of battery life  today is thursday at     pm  i m at      i gave it a full charge all night tuesday into wednesday morning  within an hour of pulling it off the charger it was down by     at the current rate  it ll likely be dead by sunday which is closer to   days  keep in mind  since i charged it fully  i have not exercised  it s quarantine and i m lazy  i can imagine the battery would only last     days with moderate to heavy frequent exercise that s my review  don t got much else to say  it s a decent watch  but i d wait for it to go on sale      
375,1.0,                       this is the worst fitbit  battery last leas than a day  it froze continuously  highly disappointed     
376,5.0,                       bought this as replacement from my samsung gear    at first i preferred the more advanced features of the samsung  but after a week i fell in love with the charge    it has much better calorie tracking and steps tracking  my favorite though is the app functions and the sleep tracking  it breaks it down to a much deeper level  my only main issue is having connectivity issues with my android in regards to receiving notifications  although  my husband s charge   works fine with his android  overall i love the fit  look  and simple yet complex features      
377,2.0,                       i purchased a charge   in september       to  replace my charge     after   months  it has stopped working   it stopped recording my sleep patterns  most important to me  properly about a month ago   over the weekend  the battery started going dead within     hours after being fully charged   i am livid   my charge   lasted several years   i purchased the charge   based on the reviews   i liked that it is supposed to be waterproof   what i have now is an expensive piece of junk and can t find a customer service number to voice my concerns      
378,1.0,                       the charge   does not work accurately or reliably  i upgraded to this after my charge   wore out  had it for   years  daily use   it does not consistently track my exercises or sleep stages  it also does not work with phone notifications  it doesn t alert me when i have a text or call like it s supposed to do  i ve had it for   months  and it hasn t worked well since i got it  see more detailed review below    i do not recommend this i exercise   to   days a week  the charge   does not register that i ve completed the daily exercise and doesn t register active zone minutes consistently  i like to see how many times per week and per month i worked out  and normally  fitbit tracks this and makes it easy to see at a glance  the charge   does not track it  in the last   weeks  i worked out all but   days total  the charge   shows that i only worked out once per week  it s inaccurate and does not track  the active zone minutes sometimes track correctly  but it s really inconsistent  the active zone minutes also do not appear to sync with the daily exercise tracking  if using the fitbit to track anything resulted to exercise  it s useless i also went with the charge   because of its  increased sleep tracking capabilities  more often than not  it does not register my sleep stages or heart rate fluctuations  it says it couldn t do so  this is incredibly frustrating as this was one of the main reasons i went with the charge   i did not have these issues with my charge    the charge   has not worked well at all for the full   months i ve had it  at most  it registered if i did a    to    minute walk  but any other exercises i have done do not register or track i do not recommend this  and i m highly disappointed and dissatisfied with the charge    especially for the price i paid  it s also frustrating that i bought a new fitbit  to track fitness and sleep  and it does neither  i ve tried adjusting settings  switching wrists  different tightness of the band  and where on my wrist i wear it  it does not work      
379,1.0,                       i really liked my charge    but unfortunately after years of use it was barely holding a charge anymore  so i though it was time to upgrade and got the latest gen  it is a serious downgrade and barely worth     imo while my charge   was decently accurate with tracking my heart rate when compared to taking it manually the new charge   is way off the mark  if i am doing cardio the charge   either barely notices my heart has increased and if it does start to pick it up it is almost       bpm off i went online to research a fix and apparently it is a pervasive problem and there is no solution  the ones offered by fitbit staff on their website like resetting the watch or reinstalling the app do nothing  i guess it is just another company that lost its quality when it got too big  especially after they got bought by google either way the whole point of a fitness tracker is to track data and if the data isn t accurate what is the point      
380,1.0,                       purchased watch    july        after only   months  one  of the attachment pieces on the watch  to which you attach the band  just fell apart as i was walking across a floor in my home   watch was expensive  yet i got only   months use out of it   the watch itself still works  of course   but i have no way to wear the watch   very upset   should have at least carried a one year guarantee      
381,3.0,                       i like everything about this except it doesn t hold a charge  it says it should be   days of battery but mine doesn t last more than   update  after a week and a half the display is corrupt and i need to replace it for a new one  not happy  hopefully the next one is better      
382,3.0,                       i love fitbit  i do  i had a charge   and now have the charge    so i am still surprised that fitbit still has not figured out how to gage an accurate heart rate  the heart rate monitor can take some     minutes of exercise before it starts gaging accurately and sometimes it just never does  i m wearing a polar heart monitor on my chest at the same time  when my heart monitor is measuring     bpm  and i know it s accurate   my fitbit is measuring    or so  maybe low    s  i ve tried moving the device to the backside of my wrist  but my heart rate only moved up to the low    s  the strap cannot be any tighter on my arm   this wasn t just once  it was again and again  so if the heart rate is off  the calories burned will be off as well  calories burned on any wearable device is usually off according to multiple studies  a bad heart rate just makes it worse  not that google owns fitbit  i m hoping this changes on future devices i do love the sleep tracker and the hydration tracker  the app is great  especially if you are tracking your food  but some of the calorie counts on scanned food items are not accurate and there appears to be no easy way to correct a wrong calories count on food  but i ve only seen this a few times and usually by   calories or less charge   is good device    just know why you are buying it and what to expect      
383,1.0,                       i was very satisfied the first few weeks on the overall fitness and biometric tracking stats the device featured  i would go jogging  hiking  biking  and would do some other sports too  i even bought the fitbit aria   to go with it and got my wife a charge   as well to workout together  on my fourth week of owning the device my fitbit died and when i fully charged it again it turned on but it would no longer track my heart rate  steps  floors climbed  or even turn on the screen when i would rotate my wrist  i t really is a bummer because the smartwatch features and the screen works  but the reason i bought this item was for the fitness tracking which it no longer does  i hope no one else runs into the same problem      
384,3.0,                       i want to put right away that i had no issues with the service  delivery or product  however  i did accidently order the wrong type of fitbit for my wife as a gift  as such i had to return this one  i had to pay for the shipping on the return  which i get  because it was my error  however  when notified of the refund amount  there was also a     restocking fee  they claim this is to help absorb the cost of the initial shipping  well  you are operating on an ecommerce platform and that should be a cost of doing business i am mainly writing this  so that buyers make sure they are getting what they want and avoid losing     of your payment to a  restocking fee   if you need to return your item      
385,1.0,                       this is approximately the worst fitbit i have owned  this is my fourth fitbit and the one i like the least  i paid extra for the special reflective band which is stiff and doesn t look special at all  the device supposedly holds a charge for at least five days or more  that is u true  every couple of days i seem to have to charge it  the display is small and unappealing  a special edition waste of my money      
386,5.0,                       i had the original fitbit charge  then the charge   and now i have this one   it s different and took me a few days to get use to it  but i really am glad i upgraded  this one stays charged longer and does more  i d recommend it if you liked the previous fitbit charges and if you are new to fitbit   it s made well  the app is great and it is compatible with a lot of different things  like weight watchers app and more  i will say that it connects to more than my apple watch series   does and that was a whole lot more than this  it s worth it to get this one  i just wish i could have found it in navy blue and black  instead of just black      
387,3.0,                       i was disappointed that this model didn t have a maximum brightness feature   it is almost impossible to see while walking on a sunny day   very annoying to have this problem   why not make it a colorful interface   black and white is so old school   the only thing i like is the lightweight feature   have yet to obtain a sleep score either  i may return   this watch needs to have a maximum brighter screen for sunny days and add color to this uncheerful black and white interface      
388,5.0,                       replaced an hr   i had some minor issues with   seems identical in most areas but will say battery life seems less and charging cable is harder to align and insure charging     
389,1.0,                       i get the device and charge it for a few hours  at first it displayed the website to go to to set it up and then it went to a black screen  call customer service and was on the phone with them for over    minutes only to be told i need a replacement  i bought a fitbit years ago and experienced the same problems  i figured by now fitbit would sort out this issue  apparently this is just the normal for them      
390,1.0,                       i had this product for   months and really liked it  when it suddenly fell of my wrist in the middle of the workout   the band was faulty and snapped off the watch face   i get that things happen  but the level of customer support i received from fitbit was nothing short of terrible   it took over    days for the product to get back to them   i contacted them multiple times requesting they send me a replacement   they would not send me a replacement until the watch got back to them   the watch is there and they guaranteed me someone would contact me within   business days when it arrived   of course that did not happen   this took so long i had to go out and buy a new watch because it s been over a month   i even purchased a new fitbit   they won t refund me my money because i bought the product through amazon   the are insisting my only recourse with is a replacement  but i already replaced it   the one i got is in the    days window for amazon so it s going back so i never have to deal with fitbit again   it is such a shame because the product was actually good and their platform is really nice but not worth it   go read their forums   there are so many complaints about faulty merchandise on them      
391,3.0,                       i am an absolute fan of fitbit products  particularly the charge family  in fact  i ve been using fitbits since they debuted  when my charge   started to have issues holding a charge a few weeks ago  i started saving for the replacement  since it lasted me so long  they are durable    fitbit had already come out with the   i love the upgraded screen  fitbit settings  and expanded exercise list with the charge    i haven t synced to my spotify account  but i like that i could if i wanted to  i also like that i can put the fitbit into do not disturb and sleep life s to prevent cellphone text notifications any time i want   i like to dedicate my workout time to my actual workouts and actually won t even bring my phone into the gym so people can t distract me from my workout or interrupt me  that being said   i have to clean it after every single workout  years and years ago  fitbit bands were permanently attached to the watch face  the adhesive  when combined with sweat  caused people to have allergic reactions  i was one of them and still carry permanent scarring on my wrist where the reaction had caused my skin to rip open  they fixed this when they moved to the detachable bands  however   i noticed i started having allergic reactions to the charge   a couple hours after my workout  if i clean the watch back with rubbing alcohol after my workout and let it dry   i don t seem to have an issue  i m concerned about the charging port now being the source but so far   as long as i clean it immediately after  there are no issues at all and the raised red bumps i experienced the first   days has completely subsided   edit  i had to take another star off  i also cannot sleep in it due to the stationary position  which keeps the tracker in one place too long  woke up with a reaction under the tracker  so i will no longer be able to track my sleep  still love the interface   bittersweet having issues with another fitbit produce after my charge   did so well for years       
392,2.0,                       specifically purchased the charge   because of the built in gps   i was very happy initially as it worked as advertised and i was able to look at the map of my walk on the app   see the various stats   on week   i started getting a message that the gps was unable to get a signal   searched fitbit s site for why this might be happening but they just blame it on clouds  trees etc   the same   mile loop that the gps mapped for weeks  now can t be found by the gps   walked at the beach several days    clear blue skies and no trees or obstructions and the gps still can t find me   very disappointing   seems it s a very common occurrence on the fitbit forums and the only solution found is to return it and buy something else      
393,2.0,                       i received the charge   on june  th and there was an update that came out for the charge    i went to apply the update to the charge   and it bricked the device  it would respond to holding down the  button  on the side but the screen on the watch would never come back up  i contacted fitbit support and after walking me through the processes i had already done they offered to replace the charge   with a new one but i would have to return this one  they said they were going to send me a mailing label but i never received it so i returned it via amazon since i had only had the device for a week  we have had problems with every fitbit product that we have purchased but i have continued buying them up to this point since there were no products with as many features in this price range  i have owned a surge  versa  multiple flexes to name a few of the products  this however last round of issues has convinced me that i would probably be better off paying a higher price for a more reliable product  for myself  i switched to a garmin venu since my versa died about    months after buying  it and it died to a firmware update as well  since it was out of warranty they would only offer me a     discount on the same product  for what it is worth  my family has decided that fitbit is not the way to go for us and as our current fitbits die we will look for other products      
394,5.0,                       i liked the fitbit charge  it motivated me to move more and i really liked the gps tracking for when i d do long bike rides  on friday the small black piece that is on the fitbit and anchors the band to the device broke  the most extreme activity i did with it was   wait for it   walk in the lazy river at a great wolf lodge with my   year old  i ve had it for less than two months so it really shouldn t have broken  i hope someone replies to this message because i d like to exchange it or have it repaired  i really like the device  for         it should stand up to the lifestyle of a work from home mom        
395,5.0,                       great watch i purchased the fitbit for my mother  she loves keeping up with her steps  thing is she  suffers from dementia so i thought this would be perfect knowing she wouldn t go anywhere without wearing it because she wants it to count her steps  and  i could track her in case she wonders off  every thing would have been perfect if it had live gps but apparently it just tells you where you been  so i am still searching for a watch that has live gps  but all in all it was a great watch     
396,2.0,                       bought the charge   to replace my tired and screen not working charge     the charge   setup was easy and everything worked well for the first few months   one morning the sync process stop working  and was very irregular   now working to get a replacement   given the numerous other having the same issue  it must be a design flaw or software issue that fitbit isn t able to resolve   i would suggest going with the charge   or waiting for new version when fitbit is able to get the product stabilized update  contacted fitbit about the sync problem   after about a    minute conversation to verify the problem  fitbit decided to replace the charge     within   days i had a new fitbit      
397,1.0,                       so  my charge   only lasted   months and is now unusable  my other grievances are that it s uncomfortable to wear  and fitbit locks out features unless you pay a monthly subscription on top of the price of the actual fitbit  fitbit already gets my data  fido they need to be greedy and charge a sub too  also the fitbit app is terrible to navigate and use  i tried to contact fitbit they the app and forum but it blocked my request don t waste your time or money  i should have just ponied up and bought an apple watch  it would be cheaper in the long run even at twice the price  fitbit is a totals sham      
398,3.0,                       there is a couple of things to like and dislike about it heart rate what i mostly dislike is the slow health rate reader  to give an example  i do high intensity interval s  when i am on my peak the watch says my heart rate is at      when i manually check it by hand it s on      it takes the watch another    seconds to reach then     heart rate and then it begins dropping never reaching the peak  some other times i am at my peak  i ve tried to put the watch in different spots in the wrist  i ve followed all the instructions and even tried adjusting the straps from very tight to loose and none have made it more accurate gps wow this was surprisingly inaccurate  please see the picture as it explains itself  i started running half a mile behind my friend  when we finished together my watch said i had ran   more like than him  that s all because of the inaccuracy  plus the pace was all wrong i would suggest buying a garmin watch  my friend had a garmin and his results where much nor accurate sleep it s not the most accurate  but i can t say much since i don t have other device to compare  i can say that one day it said i was on deep sleep just before walking up and i remember i was already awake and just starting at the roof  so my hopes are not high for this feature being accurate only buy this if accuracy is not what you are looking for and you just want something to kinda track your exercises   but if you like to be more precise  don t  since it will stress you out      
399,3.0,                       it was a decent buy but i was not super impressed by it  the battery life is not as per advertised i feel  i did not use gps but still it consistently lasts only for around   days against the advertised   days  one other important that i noticed is that if i tie my fitbit charge   too tight on my wrist  it messes up the sleep calculation  i think i consciously tied it tighter for   nights and all   nights  it did not give me a sleep score saying that i was too restless  but  i feel its due to some technical issue  this actually was concerning since now i am not sure how reliable is the heart rate sensor on my fitbit  overall  i think i like the design and it is very comfortable  you can easily wear it all the time without noticing which is not true for  say  apple watch  this is the best thing about charge    i think fitbit still needs to work on quality and is not on par with apple  i agree there is a difference in price but accuracy and battery life are   important things which shouldnt depend on it  overall  i think its still a good buy      
400,1.0,                       it will take you a long time to disable all the nagging  infantile alerts  goals  badges  and other nonsense that amount to distractions and insulting  gold stars  for arbitrary metrics   i m sure they would motivate someone in grammar school but for adults it s quite insulting not only that when your wrist tracker suddenly goes off on a vibrating spree and you look down to see one of these notifications the only thing accomplished is interrupting your efforts basic hrm functionality seems to work relatively well with the caveat that optical is less accurate than a chest strap  but i knew that going in sleep analysis is moderately useful   while overall accuracy is again suspect  it can serve as a baselining tool for trend analysis had i to do over again  i would not buy this item because it has been more annoying than useful      
401,1.0,                       had to return the charge   fit bit   times  spoke to fit bit service department and was told you have to have a smart phone or i phone to sync the charge     if you do not have a smart phone or i phone do not buy the charge   it will not sync with your laptop or desk top computer   it must set up first with a i phone or smart phone   miss leading  ad does not tell you that  john y     
402,1.0,                       i started out really happy with the charge     however  now after a month of having it  it won t stay paired with my iphone   i ve reached out  to fitbit support and they haven t been helpful   after nearly   weeks of back and forth emails  the are implying it s a software firmware issue   i ve sent them rebooted the device  factory reset the charge    upgraded the ios on my iphone  tried pairing it to an ipad  all to no avail   the responses are starting slow down from their support team   seems wrong that they continue to sell the charge   if this is a software firmware problem as this renders the fitbit completely useless   if it s a hardware problem  i don t understand why they won t honor their warranty and send me a new charge     i used to be very positive on the fitbit   my entire family has fitbits   at this point  i m seriously look around for other devices as the      i ve spent is basically wasted away now in summary do not buy a charge        
403,2.0,                       honestly pretty disappointing  i bought this to replace my series   apple watch so that i could track my sleep  the charge   advertises a week battery life  but i don t think mine lasts more than a few days without needing recharging  i tracked a     mile hike today  but it only recorded it as     miles  it also went from     battery to    in about   hours of tracking  i tried to edit the distance in the app but it would not save the change  then it stopped showing the option to edit it overall the sleep tracking is good  but you have to pay for their premium subscription to get full data  which is stupid  the app sucks and often has bugs and fails to sync also  this won t natively sync with apple health and the third party apps don t completely work either  i am returning this and getting a new apple watch  and maybe some other small device to wear in bed to track sleep      
404,3.0,                       this is my third fitbit   the first was an ionic model  which was replaced under warranty because it had problems charging   the replacement ended up having the same problems withing a few weeks of light use i ve since purchased this model and straight out of the box i m a bit disappointed   fitbit has incorporated a clip on charging cord which should be an improvement of the last one  unfortunately the charging cord is short  at most a few inches more than one foot  since the cord isn t long enough to reach from any standard height us outlet to any common piece of furniture i m looking at purchasing a longer cord secondly  the last model had large and small bands that were two pieces  for this model fitbit included an extra receiving end that is longer than the other   i was rather disappointed that they aren t actually large and small but rather long and short having purchased two  one is for my wife  i anticipate buying two new cords and at least one band   i don t expect to pay more than     for these items  but i do feel a bit ripped off   i few extra pennies in materials could have provided buyers with decent bands and a useful charging cord i also find the useless cord to be wasteful   why even include an item very few  if any  people will utilize      
405,1.0,                       the fitbit features work well  like tracking sleep accurately  steps  heart rate  etc   the bad point is that lately it has to be re paired with my wife s phone every day  fitbit support is no help  they are mostly of the  turn if off and on again  type of assistance  as if we can t figure that out ourselves we can t return it to amazon  because it s past the return window fitbit won t allow returns or exchanges because we didn t buy it directly from them so we are stuck with this bad fitbit save your money  do not buy this unless you like aggravation      
406,5.0,                       have been a fitbit user since the clip on model and i just love these watches   they do all they say they do and very well  i just highly recommend you get a protection plan because problems do arise usually after a couple years    screen goes black or something like that  protection plans will cover you  the fitbit is totally worth it  i m getting one now for my    year old mom  want to see how often she s up at night and maybe the step count will motivate her to be more active    plus heart rate etc  i m a longtime fitbit fan     highly recommend  i have fitbit charge   now and have had numerous previous models  don t want the bulk of the models more similar to the apple watch    don t need all that on my watch when i have my phone  but any model you choose i m sure you ll be happy with it amazon  sells various styles of  bands at reasonable prices too      
407,1.0,                       bought a fitbit charge   for my husband to use to track his daily walks  as an alternative to map my walk on his phone  as it advertised gps and exercise tracking   it is not user friendly and does not operate the way all the you tube videos claim   can t change the clock face  the gps tracker that maps your route looks like a   year old scribbled on a piece of paper   he is ocd and doesn t walk like that   select walk from exercise  hit start and it may or may not start   today he hit start and when he returned an hour later it said he d been walking for   minutes   definitely not worth the      i paid for it   map my walk is more accurate and easier to use   guess it works fine if you are just counting steps but a cheaper one will do the same      
408,1.0,                       materials are nice and minimal  that s about all the good the pins have finicky connects  so when you put it to charge and come back hours later  it could still be dead  maybe it is just my unit  but i have been having this problem since i bought it  the  button  on the device is terrible and it s hard to get the device to actually register that you are pushing it  spend your money elsewhere      
409,5.0,                       it s my second one  truly like the way the app functions with my android  this one doesn t seem to light up as easy though with the motion of the arm to view time  the old charger for my first fitbit worked better than the newer version  newer one doesn t fit snug first time when placing on fitbit      
410,5.0,                       my first fitness tracker  and after some research i decided on the charge     i loved the slim design  and it had gps to track my mileage  i m currently way out of shape  like pre diabetic fat out of shape  so i needed something easy to give me metrics so i knew where i was and how far to get where i m going  tracking my exercise  sleep  water intake  etc has made me a healthier man these last few weeks  the charge lasts about   days  the app is v easy to use and even includes some meditation modules  woo hoo    and even connects to my smart scale so my weight and other bio markers are in the fitbit for review  can t say enough good things about it      
411,5.0,                       this little device is an excellent watch also   it does a nice job at not only tracking steps  but heart rate and even stairs   i m up and down stairs all day and the ability to track this is awesome  syncing is easy and the system will remind you if you forget to so that it can keep a running tab on your progress      
412,2.0,                       it s a daily struggle to sync my fitbit to my phone   i only want two functions out of a device  sleep tracking and heart rate   every morning i need to re pair my device and often it takes several minutes   this problem persisted for my old phone and my new phone  extremely obnoxious also the user interface has limited customization   it frequently switches to showing metrics i don t care about at all and i have to flip through the metrics to bring back the screen i want to see the app is cool  and the sleep analysis and other software features are cool      
413,2.0,                       i have had my fitbit since september        i  have had no complaints until recently when i started wearing it at night  after   weeks or so i noticed a rash and peeling skin under the watch face on my left wrist   i moved it to my right arm and after a few days i can see that a rash is beginning in the same place as the other arm  the rash on my left arm is still red and peeling   bought an aftermarket watch band immediately after i bough the tracker as i dislike the plastic bands that come with the trackers   there has been no rash under the band  only under the watch face  i would have rated my tracker highly as it does what i want it to do  however  none of the other fitbits that i have owned have ever given me a rash  this is a big problem for me as i will not be able to wear it as much as i would like  therefor the low rating   i hope the manufacturer will take note of all the people having rash problems and do something about it
