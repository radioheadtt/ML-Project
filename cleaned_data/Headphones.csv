0,3.0,                       these headphones were described as a  professional level product  but clearly miss the mark when it comes to comfort in particular  wearing these headphones for long periods of time is not recommended as they seem to not fit over the ear well and create a lot of head pressure  the sound quality is not as high as some other manufactures products as well but not the worst either  i would probably give them an  average  rating      
1,4.0,                       i just used them for about   hours and it started to become pretty unpleasant on the ear i have a cartilage piercing on  but that isn t going to be of importance to most people  i ll still probably put up with it and i should take breaks anyway  these will stay in the studio  they re not for everyday use for me  they sound great if you just want to listen to music on the go  but honestly  i think there are better  more comfortable  and more portable options  if you want a pair in this price range for your home studio though  strongly recommend      
2,1.0,                       decently comfortable headphones   actually impressed with the audio quality  both wired and using bluetooth   the undisclosed issue is with the microphone and using the headphones for bluetooth calls   numerous phone call recipients noted the headset produces audio so poorly  it s essentially inaudible   i had a hard time believing this was the case and attempted to continue to use the headset with more phone calls  only to receive the same feedback   i eventually emailed the manufacturer and received this message thank you for contacting audio technica u s   inc   yes unfortunately the echo you describe when using them for phone calls is as designed on this model   it appears to be a limitation of the microphone built into the earcup of the headphone   unfortunately we do not have any remedies for this at this time  we apologize for the inconvenience i received this information after amazon s return window was up and now amazon refuses to do anything about selling a known faulty product   amazon s customer service included helpful tips like  have you tried resetting the device   and  did you purchase insurance  and then dropped the chat conversation within    seconds   an overall very unfortunate experience you ve been forewarned      
3,5.0,                       it s been a few months  and all i can say is wow  these headphones have a great durable design and they fit nice and snug around your ears  with and without a hat on   the gun metal edition comes with a carrying case  a  ft coil cable  strecthes to  ft   and  ft straight cable  after listening to these headphones  i ve realized that these headphones focus on providing crisp and clean sound for high and mid frequencies  the lows are audible  but not very loud  resulting in a balanced listening experience  often i will hear little details in the music and vocals better in these headphones instead of my more bass heavy in ear headphones  overall i recommend this product to anybody that is trying to hear the full spectrum of any song better  i would argue  as does everyone else  that these are the best headphones for the price  by far      
4,5.0,                       there are many other reviews you can read that go into greater detail about all the specs on these things  but this is not one of those reviews i have a set for home  my old plain ath m   which i have had for   years  and a set for work  this pair  the ath m  x   i can t really tell the difference  if any  in sound quality as the speakers are pretty much identical  i bought the m  x pair for work and wear them about     hours a day  i have a rather fat head but these are still incredibly comfortable after hours of wear i have several points i like to make about these headphones     these sound good  like really good  with all types of audio and that sound quality does not seem to fade over time     these headphones are very comfortable  however  you do need to wear them for a little while so that they form to your head     while these are very comfortable  if your head ears perspire  sweat   you should remove them every so often so that your ears do not become a swamp  the plastic leather cups tend to form a rather good seal around your ears bottom line  i would wear these all the time if i did not have to interact with people every so often  the quality you get for the price  keep an eye on the sales too  is totally worth it   year edit after   years of using these almost every day at my desk  they are still going strong  the white pair did have a little bit of flaking on the top of the head band  but it is purely cosmetic  and even then  very minor i also use my older black pair when i travel  and they still sound the same    years later only complaint i have is that your ears can get a little sweaty if you wear these for too long  but that still rarely happens if you are on the fence  buy these  you will not regret it   but keep in mind  these are not noise cancelling and they are not some hyped up high bass speakers on a band  they are mid level  balanced  durable  and all around great sounding multipurpose headphones      
5,5.0,                       i m loving the ath m  x headphones  i really wanted some good quality headphones to enjoy great music on the go and these do not disappoint  really excellent crystal clear highs  the bass response on their own isn t that great  but when paired with a fiio a  headphone amplifier these headphones become the total package no  these are not beats headphones and they aren t for bass junkies   not that anything is wrong with that  we all have different tastes   but just be aware these headphones are not going to make you feel like you re inside a subwoofer  the bass is very responsive and snappy  i find it gets a tad muddy at higher volumes but those are much higher volumes i personally enjoy using the bass boost on my a  when i listen to rock music with these headphones  and i turn it off when i listen to acoustic or instrumental stuff  these two devices are a match made in heaven      
6,1.0,                       i don t write reviews often but this one was a bummer for me  i know at is a good brand so i was excited for this upgrade  at first everything worked well  i bt connected to my phone and played music no problem  and same with my laptop  i then tried to talk on discord while listening to music and the headphones would only play one program at a time  while trying to troubleshoot i ended up spending an hour completely unable to connect because the device showed up as   separate things in the bt menu  being unsure what was what i ended up going in circles until i was finally able to play the correct program to the correct bt item to get it to work again  when i was on discord i was told my voice quality was muffled and bad  when i was listening to music it sounded awful     of the time for no apparent reason  a range of issues from tinny  to flat to a distorted wave effect  i tried to use the aux cable at multiple points to just use it as a regular wired headset  but my laptop wouldn t even recognize they were plugged in  i checked on another computer and had the same problem  over all i only had them   days but i spent enough time fiddling and googling to realize these weren t salvageable  returned them and ordered the bose    s  hopefully i ll have better luck with those     
7,3.0,                       sound quality is fantastic just like the ath m  x  possibly better   i have been using that pair for the last two years on commute and in studio  i tested and returned the bt after two days of use  reasons were not sound  battery or comfort related  but realted to multi device support and the mic call quality  for me i need a headset that can switch between laptop and phone seamlessly  you need to disconnect and reconnect the m   bt  i had reports of bad mic quality on my test calls from mulitple people with full service etc  so they didn t pass the initiation   i will get the sony s next      
8,4.0,                       after one year and two months of owning these  having them broken in and having myself accustomed to them  i must say  these are one hell of a bang for your buck  they re not perfect  let s start by clarifying that  the soundstage is weaksauce and there s a peak in the treble that really makes the s sound pop out  to which my ears are sensitive  so i can t crank them up that extra     volume to reach my sweet spot  but i blast them just under and they re perfectly good there   the padding in the headband is adequate at best  defects out of the way  time for the worship soundthe clarity in these is insane and in your face  i d consider them sort of aggressive actually  which i love  but if you like something more mellow you may try going for something like bose   the bass is solid and smoooooooth  really nice  no distortion whatsoever at any volume i ve listened to it in  and i ve gone loud  deafeningly loud  so if it distorts after that and that s a problem for you  man  your ears must be serious beasts to be able to bear that    the mids are present  just present  they don t pop out  they re not absent  they re just there  loud and clear  the treble is pretty shiny  on the higher end of things some sounds may come across as a bit metallic though  but nothing particularly bad  the treble side of things does pop out a bit more  but it s just bright enough for you to listen to it crystal clear while being mellow enough for your ears to not hurt  at really high volumes there s the s issue though  as i previously mentioned  you can easily fix that with an eq  and that s the single peak that has given me any issues at all  the rest of the sounds coming out of these are amazing build and comfortwhat can i say  i ve had them for a year and two months now  i ve accidentally dropped them from my desk to the hard  carpetless floor  i ve been a jackass to them and never put them in their carrying pouch  as in  never  i just carry them on my neck if i head out to a situation where they may come in handy  i haven t been the most careful of owners  and yet  they re as good as new  no scratches  no loosened parts  no cracks  nothing  these are solid  if you were to choose one last pair of headphones and head out to narnia where you won t be buying any new ones any time soon  these would be the ones  what s more  i recently looked for someone who dismantled them online  or straight up broken them  to have a better look at their insides and i was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the entire headband is made out of metal   as for comfort  they re right there in terms of weight  they re not heavy  they re not particularly lightweight  just light enough to wear them just fine  heavy enough to have a presence on your head  if you have middle sized ears  they will fit just fine within the earpads  no issues  they re comfortable and firm  your ears will barely if ever touch the drivers  the headband s padding is adequate at best  it could be better  in my experience  they do get tiring for the top of my head after a couple of hours  but nothing a short break can t fix  and i do wear these most of the day i ve bought more headphones within the time i bought these and now  but i always keep coming back to these sooner or later  and that s gotta say something  they ve proven themselves to be potentially underpriced and i definitely recommend them psa  if the earpads are not good for you  i suggest you be careful when choosing others because the stock pads have this cushiony thick fabric at the drivers that adds a bit of a thump to the bass and kills the harsher side of the treble  so the sound will change with other earpads if you don t choose carefully  they will sound unbearably harsh so choose wisely  the thicker cushiony fabric at the drivers is necessary for these to sound right      
9,5.0,                       i bought this headset to use with my roku remote and the sound quality is great   about me  i have a xxxl large head wearing almost a size     i guess my ears sit lower than the norm since the ear pieces in my motorcycle helmet are above my actual ears   the head set fits just fine and could have handled my head even if had been a little  larger   i read somewhere that the head set eats the batteries on the roku  still not sure about that   i also read that if you leave the roku plugged into any headset  while not it in use  will drain the battery   so to counter that i unplug the headset after use which seems to work   i also  use rechargeable batteries for the roku      
10,5.0,                       sound is amazingly clean and clear with no perceptable distortion   the bass seems a little stronger than i expected  but it is solid and tight  also without any noticeable distortion   i have fallen asleep with them on and also listened to them for hours with very decent comfort   sometimes i have to readjust the headband if listening awhile and i m laying down  but the earpieces stay sealed around my ears very well   they block out almost all other noise  without needing noise cancelling   i highly recommend them  especially for the price      
11,4.0,                       i have these for almost a year and they have been great  i upgraded from crappy apple ear buds  the quality of the sound was very impressive  i was able to hear things in the music i couldn t hear before  i was shocked by the amount of detail i was missing in my songs video games  i have used these for    months every day for at least a few hours but on average probably more than   and even more in the summer  i wear them to block out the sound of my ac  they don t do a good job of that and admittedly they re not designed for that but my ac is   feet from my ears and anything helps  the pads had recently started to fall apart which is unfortunate  however  given the amount of time wear them  i m surprised it didn t happen sooner  i m impressed with out long they lasted given the material but i wish they would have lasted indefinitely  now i m off to dig fake leather from my ears  overall  i enjoyed them i forgot to mention comfort  these are a little tight on my head  maybe i have a big head  they press up against my ears ever so slightly which isn t an issue immediately  but it becomes a problem after wearing them day in and day out for months on end  the tips of ears eventually got press ulcers but they built up a tolerance to them and i m fine now  maybe i have big ears i would recommend these for casual listening  not for someone who would use them for hours and hours  days and days  months and months      
12,5.0,                       i received it yesterday  it cost twice the sony mdr       which i also own  but its quality is more than double  maybe multi double  in terms of sound and functionality  it s worth it  chrystal clear  well balance  little warm  that i like   great headphones  i listen from andrea bocelli to sting to billy joel and lots of old schools  i hear distinctive sounds it s well worth the hundred fifty something regular  but it is on sales now  with additional discounts  so i am thinking of getting another pair  just in case  buy it now i have to continue writing my paper  yeah it s that good  and i m so happy  i m a hippy  but a grumpy one  i have to stop writing  yeah today  sunday  and posting this  impression   not a review  i m not qualified   but before that  let me have one more song  phil collins is good ps  the earcups block the sounds much better than the sony s  so it s better for studio work  i like it a lot  now this at is for studio work  and the sony is for casual ps   the jack is  plug and turn  type  be careful  i was impatient  i did not read the manual as usual   but by the grace of god  it still sounds great      
13,5.0,                       i recently ordered a new pair of m  s after my old pair was stolen from my car  i had the old pair for about a year  after having m  s for about two years  the difference between the m   and m   is well worth the extra      stronger bass  way more clarity i use these for regular music listening to  as well as mixing live events one of the reasons i love m  s  especially when compared to the sennheiser hd   s or sony mdr      is actually the fit the sennheisers  despite being labeled  over ears   are really narrow  and squish my ears  thus eliminating part of the acoustic experience   generally fit a little too tight  the sonys are just really loose  and always feel like they re going to fall off my head  the m  s fit my ear perfectly  and perfectly encompass my whole ear so they re truly over ear and not on ear headphones  and they re the right amount of pressure to seal off from outside noises but also not be uncomfortable i plan to stay in my m  s for a long time i can t just say i  would  order again  if need be i  did  order them again and i hope whoever stole my first pair gets one of those colds that just won t go away      
14,2.0,                       i bought these for the sound quality but will be returning them for their extreme discomfort   i can t wear them for more than    minutes without getting a headache due to the clamping force and how hot they make my ears      
15,5.0,                       i ve had a lot of brands of headphone  including from companies that rhyme with  moes   or  sang and bowleffsun   and i loved them  but for the price  these headphones are just the cats meow  high end quality at a mid tier price only complaint i have is that sometimes when you go to pair them with a pc  and later to an apple product  it can take some finessing  the ear pads are good but the ones i have on my hyper x cloud  build for long stretches of gaming  are a bit more comfy  but other than that  it s perfect  and you can always purchase after market ear pads for a reasonable price i use mine for gaming  discord chat   music at work  or just watching a lot of youtube at a coffee shop  and the comfort level has always been great on my head  neck  and ears battery life is legit  about         hours after one charge is what i typically see  oh and they lay flat to fit into my messenger bag easily i really love these headphones  i highly recommend them      
16,4.0,                       got these because they are wireless and wanted to discard some old wired headphones  this headset has good sound quality and i am overall pleased with this purchase  the only thing that bothers me is that this headset does not come with a microphone of any kind  other than having to accommodate to this  the headset sounds good and is pretty comfortable update  pc did not fully recognize the headset initially  disconnected the headset then reconnected to the correct bt connection  and was able to utilize this headsets internal microphone  the quality is average but definitely would recommend purchasing an external microphone for greater quality      
17,5.0,                       i wanted to finally own some really nice headphones  and so after searching around i narrowed it down to    this and the sennheiser      since i d never had an open back headphone i purchased the sennheiser      and i was extremely disappointed  since i d never had nice headphones i assumed that what i was hearing was  good   but it just did nothing for me  because i was so disappointed in the sennheiser     i decided to purchase these because i was hopeful there was something better i could experience in my audible life  and i m so glad i did these headphones are amazing  of course it s hard to explain why  but you can pick out all of the little things each musician is doing opposed to everything being blended together  it s just a great musical experience  i don t know if my sennheisers are knock offs or what  but there is no comparison  the audio technica is far superior      
18,5.0,                       i have followed reviews and tried similar products for some time  including the noise cancellation type of headsets and earbuds  and tried them in air travel and airports as well as in the office   these do not cancel ambient noise  but the foam cushions do reduce background noise a few db   the headset produces excellent sound and remains comfortable over the ears for hours  the battery life has been good  easily handling seven hours of use   no complaints   for what it s worth  i have come to prefer the   db noise reduction offered by foam earplugs on flights  rather than cranking up the music or soundtrack volume to further hide the noise of infants and blaring intercom announcements on late flights      
19,4.0,                       after seeing many of the tech youtubers i watch daily keep putting these as one of their top headphones  i bought into the hype and bougth these  keep in mid ive never spent more than     on earphones or headphones  i thought i was going to experience something amazing  and i was totally wrong  but thats not the headphones fault  the first time i put these on  and listened to the smiths  my first initial thought i was its ok  but i just spent      on these headphones  after listening to some different songs the only thing i could really pin point the different sound quality over my     jvc headphones were that it was much clearn in the sense of the highs not getting distorted  and the songs overall were really smooth as well  also the comfort level on these are great  the first day they were kinda uncomfortable but after that ive been using them for    almost everyday where these really shined for me was when recording audio  i happen to have  a blue yeti mic  their was a big difference in the way i could hear myself through the mic with these headphones vs anything else ive used  in all honestly if i wouldve been able to try these on in store  i probably wouldve gotten a gaming headset  but these work fine since from time to time i work on videos and audio      
20,3.0,                       the sound quality was pretty good across a broad frequency range   they were maybe not the best i ve ever heard  but they were pretty close to optimal and quite pleasing to listen to   but the construction is pretty abysmal for the price point   the ear cups are held in position against the head by the tiniest tab of plastic held in position by other tiny tabs of plastic  all of which are prone to snapping under ordinary use   i m pretty resourceful so i repaired them multiple times over the time i had them  constructing sturdier pieces to hold the ear cups in position   this worked until the thin plastic swivel holding the ear cups also snapped  clipping the wire running through it clear off   i m done struggling to fix this junk under extremely gentle use consisting of sitting on a desk and putting them on my head calmly  these headphones lasted   years   it s not months  it was years  but that s pretty short for how long a good pair of headphones should last under gentle use   going cheap on the material for all the stress points is a terrible design choice  audio technica  and i intend to buy from another manufacturer for my next pair of headphones      
21,5.0,                       i love these   i recently became an amazon prime customer and i use them every night to stream movies   they are not noise cancelling but if you want great theater sound  then they are a great headphone   excellent solid construction  high quality  corded   update   i purchased these headphones on a lightening deal on april           it is now past   years and i still use these headphones everyday  they have held up in excellent condition  they have taken a few good beatings  the travel with me  i love it because they lay flat in my carry on  and best of all  over   years later  they still work as well as the day i bought them  there is no sound distortion  nothing loose  padding still perfectly in tact  no static  perfect sound  i made a wonderful choice buying these audio technica headphones   buy without hesitation      
22,5.0,                       use this product for listening to music and monitoring recordings   great sound across the whole spectrum   great highs  great bass  great midrange   well balanced sound   these headphones are a great value   why pay more   you get three cables with this package and a storage bag as well as an adapter for quarter inch jacks   i can t say enough about the great sound of these headphones   also  amazon delivered these quickly and in good shape in time for christmas   thank you amazon      
23,5.0,                       very very good sound  for a pair of headphones at least  i m not an audiophile though  so i can t speak with to much authority  bass is clear but not overpowering  i like it  the people that are complaining are probably bass heads  and these headphones are made for accurate audio reproduction  not bass heads the headphones don t always work with third party audio cables  i learned this first hand when i got the headphones and it was kind of confusing  use the included cable  as per the instructions i use it practically every day  and i ll sometimes go three days without charging it  and i ve yet to see it run out of battery  rechargeable batteries actually last longer when kept charged  i m just pointing out that these are great the casing is light weight plastic  i think it s appropriate  aluminum is great but overrated  and high quality plastics are very underrated on account of low quality plastics  there have been times when i forgot i was wearing them      
24,5.0,                       best set of headphones that i ve owned  great sound quality  great detail  not too much bass but plenty and can connect via the included cable to your system or connect via bluetooth i use the audio technica athm  xbt headphones at work and the battery for the bluetooth connectivity lasts for several days with continuous use when i m not working  i write  perform and record music  great set of headphones for monitoring while recording  not a flat response but close enough for what i use them for and i enjoy the extended frequencies      
25,5.0,                       i have tried a few other studio grade headphones  and these by far not only sound the best  but are extremely confortable  i guess i have a rather large head  so most other headphones feel really tight and i can t wear them for more than    minutes or so without getting very uncomfortable  these are much better   lighter  great padding on the ears and the over head portion  and i can wear them for longer sessions  my pair before this was a      koss pro aat titanium pro headphones                        but those were way to tight  heavy  and the whatever the ear cups were made of felt like they made an airtight seal around my ears and were very uncomfortable  so i m really glad i upgraded to the ath m  x s after all this time i use these mainly to record music on my computer in ableton live  and also to record my electric and acoustic guitars  so i listen to both electronic music and rock and these headphones work equally well for both styles      
26,1.0,                          go to bluetooth   other devices in settings    on the right side of the screen under  related settings   click on devices and printers    find your device listed    for example  my headphones are the audio technica ath m  xbt headphones  and were listed at the bottom of the window under  unspecified      right click the device and select properties    select the services tab    i m not sure which of these did the trick  but there are   bluetooth services listed  audio sink  drivers for keyboard  mice  etc  hid   headset  remote control  and remotely controllable device    i checked all      click apply   after this i heard in my headphones  bluetooth connected      click ok      
27,5.0,                       i love these things  the sound is phenomenal  i like the white color  but i really wanted the iron man color scheme  someone at work has a pair  so when he wasn t looking i swapped um for mine  somehow he knew they weren t his and confronted me in the bathroom  i was all like  fine sherlock    you got me    congratulations    here   he then asked me why i brought his headphones into the bathroom  i told him that somethings are better left unanswered  he doesn t talk to me anymore      
28,4.0,                       i bought these headphones after reading all the wonderful reviews  and they are good  well made  have decent sound  but they don t meet my needs  my main use for these would be to listen to women s acappella music  with these headphones  i found some noises in the environment  such as page turns by the choir  to be almost as loud as some of the singing  this may be a slight exaggeration  but you could hear the page turns  which is sort of cool  in a way  but i really want to have the voices stand out  instead  now that i have done even more research  on headphone com   i realize that the ath m  x s frequency response has a dip right where women s voices sing            hz   that s the octave starting at middle c  c  to c    the main part of women s singing range  i m sure if you are listening to other types of music that you might not even notice this  but for me  it was a deal breaker      
29,5.0,                       just so you know where i come from  i own the original athm   s and is still my favorite headphones  when hooked just as it is to my mp  player it makes long plane flights enjoyable  when it is hooked to my portable headphone amp  it takes music to a whole level now this model which is wireless  is as good as the wired version  my only issue not being to run through a amp but that is minor and is actually great since taking a plane it is one less thing to take or lose not mention the cables needed  the sound is great and bass emphasized but too large degree  as the old fairy tale says  just right  i do wish i could pipe through an amp but it is fine i can tit has no anc but that s fine  the over ear design muffle engine pretty  once the music is going  i sit back and relax      
30,3.0,                       don t buy these with intentions to use them for long periods of time  as they barely make it around my ears and hurt both my ears and the top of my head  i bought these intending to plug them into my guitar amp in order to listen to myself playing without bothering the family and neighbors  these are used as my secondary pair of headphones and are currently plugged into my focusrite audio interface for my at      my main pair of headphones are razer kraken tournament edition  of which are the second pair i ve purchased  though i m looking to soon replace them with some decent lightweight wireless headphones  this pair of headphones feel like a real waste of money      
31,4.0,                       having a relatively large head  these cans seemed tk make sense   head is not huge  but definitely on the larger side of medium the sound quality easily justifies the price   i would say these are an inexpensive way to dip a toe into the audiophile range of headphones earbuds however  they don t stay comfortable   i can wear them with ease set to one of the larger head widths  but needing glasses makes for an awkward setup   i have decided to wear the glasses on top of the cups so i can wear them for up to   hours before the discomfort sets in these are hands down the absolute best headphones i ve ever owned   i simply wish i could wear them comfortably for over    minutes      
32,4.0,                       i wanted to find headphones with accurate sound   good clean bass and balanced mid s and hi s  headphone sound is a matter of personal preference  and all  phones i have tried claimed extremely wide frequency response  but i can guarantee they were not flat   all had coloration the ath m  x  phones come close to what i was looking for    bass slightly boomy  but fairly good without being ear vibrating  but did find the treble  response a bit weak  just seem slightly  in your face    the vocals seemed very close  overall  these are fairly good over ear closed back headphones      
33,5.0,                       so i love the fact it bluetooth  quality is great  day to day and for music and gaming listening  i do though use the cable when producing and mixing as i feel it delivers a bit more and that is understandable very happy with the purchase  build quality is good  i know these are gonna be around for years to come i am glad that i chose these over the other sennheiser  sony  bose and beats options  this just ticks all the boxes for me it has no active noise cancellation  but long battery life  i knew that and would choose this option again  and believe me  when its over my ears  its quiet  when the music is on  there is no other noises and i am using them in a factory so far standard pads work the best on these  will try out sheepskin pads soon for durability and comfort  as long as it doesn t change the sounds profile which everyone loves      
34,1.0,                       they sound great  which inst a surprise  but the support for doing anything other than listening to music on a phone is pretty abysmal  i can t watch movies youtube on my pc  the lag is just too annoying  forget about doing anything where precision is key  no way i would use these for serious sound editing when the sound is behind video by half a second sometimes  its odd because i had a bluetooth adapter on my regular m  x s and the lag was never noticeable  like at all  but i just got tired of the small battery on those kinds of adapters  what a disappointment that i can t just switch these out with my old wired ones and go on with my life  how on earth is the sound latency better on some cheap pos bluetooth adapter than the built in audio technica version so i install the very limited audio techinica app to try to change the streaming codec  it seems to switch codecs but it makes no difference  still laggy  finally  while i was struggling with the app  you will see why is has     stars on the app store   the left side just stopped working  like no sound from the left side after a few minutes of exceedingly light use  guess i ll be returning these and keeping my wired versions a bit longer      
35,3.0,                       i bought this as a gift so please take this with a grain of salt as my friend told me about their experience they are easy to use  comfortable  the sound quality is great and worth the purchase  however  when you lean too close to your mic you can hear sound leaking from your headphones  it wasn t expected with lower volumes so it s worth dropping a couple stars  something about the construction is not up to snuff with what was expected for the hefty price tag of      for just listening to stuff these are okay  but for streaming it s not recommended      
36,5.0,                       i m a musician and i have a home studio setup  i needed to upgrade my studio headphones  so i went withaudio technica ath m  x professional studio  this might be the best purchase i ve ever made on amazon  i was skeptical at first of the outstanding reviews  but after many hours of researching the best headphones for under       i then decided to go with these  i love the clarity and the tight bass is pure and not overly exaggerated  some of the reviewers here complained of these headphones sounding  tinny  and lacking bass  well  there are equalizers if you require an insane amount of bass  the bass is just right in my honest opinion and as i have stated previously the bass is tight and accurate   if you are on the fence about getting these headphones like i was    fear not i definitely recommend these for both the studio and for listening to music  i m even recommending these to my family and friends  theaudio technica ath m  x is also great for games  the sound quality is outstanding on my mbox    ipod  th generation video and iphone  s update as of             i m so thrilled i chose to go with these headphones  i have no regrets about this purchase and i have been rocking out with these headphones with no problems whatsoever  trust me and just buy these headphones  the sound is pure and amazing  the bass is just right and not overbearing  i find myself listening to pink floyd and it just sounds epic      
37,5.0,                       there s not much more praise to be showered on these amazing studio monitor headphones  especially for the price   the sonic characteristics are pristine with crystal clear  but not harsh  highs a balanced midrange and deep  articulate lows   the presence and sound stage are amazing   these are the kind of cans that make you look over your right shoulder while listening to music that seems to envelop and surround the listener they have a very different sound signature than my reference sennheiser hd    s  not better or worse  just different   the hd    s have a more lush and mellifluous sound while the ath m  x is      accurate with ultimate clarity stop shopping and buy these headphones now      
38,3.0,                       no noise cancellation the mic is way worse than i thought  the other side of the call can t hear me properly  and when i contacted the support from the company they said  the headphones were designed to bring you excellent audio quality when listening to music   the ability to answer calls was an added feature for convenience and is not designed as a communication headset  so you will not find the audio quality of the microphone as good as the headphone portion so if not designed like a real headset why you add this feature        
39,5.0,                       i am a value focused  mid level audiophile and for me  these cans just do everything right  enough bass for modern listening pleasure and a great audiophile wireless option  incredible overall value    modernization of a timeless  critically acclaimed set of cans  m  x clone w bt    excellent build  durable  light and comfortable for long sessions    bt     w aptx and aac codex  great range  sound and    hr battery    wide soundstage for closed backed headphones   very accurate imaging   accurate sound reproduction   slightly tuned on the fun side   accurate highs  hear all the highs w out sibilance    intimate mids  clean vocals and instrument reproduction     good clean bass kick and bass fullness  low base bump w out bleeding into mids these cans check all the boxes for sound  style  comfort and value enjoy        
40,5.0,                       consistent    i have the original m   and built up my headphones for various uses  travel  in home studio  podcasting  etc   and bought these for my everyday use and travel  the original m   s i used for djing replacing my old sony v    s  the standard for me   and they fit the bill    was hoping these to be all arounders to replace bluetooth earbuds when i need them too  or just to block out eveyone while working   a few caveates  but workable and hope they last as long as the m   s  which are still in use for studio work and podcasting duties build quality   it is up there with the m line  clamping force on the head is there  it feels a but stiffer compared to my m   and m  x s  but these are brand new  so they should break in quite nicely  by the way   i also replaced the earpads with brainwaves prostocks    better noise blocking  and softer on the clamping force for long periods of use sound quality   this is where i dropped it a bit  the sound quality was not up to par when using bluetooth  i had better quality using the wire  which made sense when using dolby atmos that was built into the s     but again  that s not why i bouth these to begin with    even when my phone was optimized  the sound was lacking  maybe i need to burn in the headphones  but it would be nice if the audio was just as good out of the box rather than foing theough the hassle of breaking them  so the drivers are good and loose   these are fairly flat  ao its not an issue  for studio use for me  but again  it would be n ce if they were tuned right out of the box to sound great immediately not much to really say   i am looking forward to uaing these  but you think the audio would be up to par to all the other high end headphones that have come out over the last   years    the price was good  but for what im going to need these for  i m not complaining  i have a full set of m   s  which also means these are my personal favorites       
41,5.0,                       i got these headphones in june       since then  i ve been using it with a bravo audio headphone amp with an electro harmonix tube  it sounded good  but never thought it worth to write a review  last week  i picked up an aq dragonfly red and pared it the atx m  x  wow  world of a difference  sound stage and clarity is amazing  i m hearing details i ve never heard before  i find myself playing my favorite tracks over and over again with the dragonfly red  i ve compared this headphone with the sony mdrv  and beyerdynamic dt         ohms  these headphones pared with the red is the best of the bunch  i m getting the sennheiser hd     soon and will be able to compare  as of now  for my ears  with the dragonfly red dac  the ath m  x is the way to go      
42,5.0,                       don t believe the reddit threads out there  these aren t meme headphones  they re very high quality and are far more comfortable than people are saying   i enjoyed the clarity these headphones bring  plus i also do a lot of sound editing and recording so the fact that they don t bleed out audio like my seinnheiser hd s is fantastic   i believe in terms of audio quality they re at least on par if not better than the hd     s that i own  that once again bleed sound something awful  which in retrospect  should not have been my second pair of headphones that i purchased   i haven t owned many audio technica products unfortunately   i ve always seen them as a bit elusive due to high prices for some of their equipment  but these headphones were an excellent buy at the time and were worth every penny   i would recommend a high quality audio output when utilizing any high impendance headphones  so if you happen to have say  an expensive sound card inside your computer  you ll likely see the full potential of this product   if not than you might be of the people giving it a negative review      
43,2.0,                       i was in the market for a decent wireless headphone that had a decent microphone  the problem with this headset is the the bluetooth that goes with it  it may be a windows    issue  but i had two bad experiences on two different machines  both on windows      on my work laptop  it has build in bluetooth connectivity  when the headset would pair with the laptop  it would create two different sound devices in the system sound options  the first was a  hands free headset  and the second was just  bluetooth headphones   the  hands free headset  mode sounded horrible  the quality was greatly reduced  maybe this is done since phone calls don t have that great of quality to begin with  i don t know  but  when i would be done with the call  the headset would not automatically switch over to the  normal  mode  i would have to manually open the sound settings and change the default device over  additionally  sometimes during the call  my coworkers would tell me i would cut out  that is because when i would receive an email the sound would switch to the  normal  device  and cut off the  hands free  device on my home desktop  i purchased a bluetooth receiver to use this headset without a wire  a sound delay occurred and was extremely obvious when watching videos or movies all of these problems went away when i hardwired the headset  though  when wired  the sound quality was great  however  i purchased these to be used as a wireless device  i do not recommend for wireless listening      
44,1.0,                       these are very nice headphones but it consistently fails to connect with my phone  sometimes it works  sometimes it doesn t  sometimes it fails to connect       times in a row before magically connecting after many repeated attempts  some days  it just doesn t connect at all  extremely frustrating  i can t depend on these headphones to actually play music  so if i go anywhere  i will have to bring a backup pair  i wish i would have purchased a different product that actually works      
45,5.0,                       phone calls are below average  buttons are clunky  touch response is painfully slow  but the sound it produces is something i haven t heard before  with my modest budget of        i am sure there are a lot expensive and better quality headphones but the sound they created is exactly of my liking  i would recommend these headphones for casual listening  nor at all for phone calls      
46,1.0,                       the overall sound is flat  which is good for mixing  but it gets a one star because the headset is so darn uncomfortable and your poor ears will be thrashed in a matter of minutes  no way to adjust  it is because the pads are too small for ears unless you are a child  so where your ears go in  the pads lay on top of ears instead of cradling the ears  and they are way too tight  i do not have big ears at all and am female  i would not even attempt to buy these if you are a grown man with a larger head than mine  triple ouch  i am very dissappointed with these  also noticed that the sound is way too different than other headsets  so mixing to these will cause the mixes to be off too much to rely on them as your mixing headphones      
47,5.0,                       these headphones are almost perfect in every way   they sound great  even without an amplifier  but sound even better with one   they are very comfortable for extended use  and i usually have a  hard time finding headphones that are comfortable for me   i love the detachable cord and the two additional cords that it comes with   i own about   pairs of headphones hovering around the          range and these are by far my favorite   very clear and clean bass with crisp mids   i haven t found any music that does not sound good in these headphones what makes these cans so great is the comfort and the closed back design   i ve always wanted a pair of great sounding headphones that i can take with me without others around me being aware of what i m listening to   these have become my go to headphones for travel  because of the portability  close back design  comfort  and great sound quality i let my brother compare them to his beats  i m not a fan  and he was amazed at how good they sounded   these headphones have a rich feature set and a wonderfully clean sound   i can t recommend them highly enough i also have a pair of      sennheiser hd                            and the      grado sr   i                        and i have to say that i like the sound of m  x s a little better  although it is close   the m  x has a little bit heavier bass than the other two headphones   although the bass is heavier  its certainly not overpowering   my sennheisers probably have a little bit more range and depth  but the incremental absence of extra bass makes me prefer the m  x   sennheiser headphones are not very bass heavy anyway  but a little more bass for certain types of music goes a long way most of what i listen to is christian hip hop  country  neo soul  and    s r b  i know  weird combination    the country and the hip hop is where these headphones shine the brightest  mostly because of the extra low end    the neo soul also sounds great  i m hearing new instruments in the background so much more clearly than i have ever heard them before   i m very happy i made this purchase and i am considering upgrading my amp and possibly adding a dac although i don t really find a dac necessary   if anyone knows of a great portable amp to go with these headphones  please let me know      
48,3.0,                       sound quality it sounds fine for its price point but if you are a bass treble head don t go for these as this product lacks in these fields because it s a more neutral sounding headphone  it will also tin out if a specific noise is played when you mess around with sound quality settings  all in all  for sound   they are great for people creating monitoring music but not for gamers or people that want to squeeze every drop of goodness out of a song comfort comfort for me is a huge one alongside sound quality  and compared to other headphones i ve had in the past these are sadly lower on the list because after a good hour or two you start to feel an uneasy pain on the top of your head because of minimal padding  there is also not to much padding on the ear cups and you can start to tell after a good hour or even less  all in all  for comfort   it doesn t really make me happy especially for this price pointbuild quality in this section these headphones stand out pretty well  it is mostly comprised of strong plastic  it feels good to hold   it has metal like snap points when adjusting the height  they are not to rigid and not to loose  very nice   and they fold up really well for an easy carry  on top of that the ear cups swivel a nice     degrees so you can rest them around your neck to your liking  all in all  for build quality   it is amazing in this category  it s well built features this one i didn t really care for too much  so it doesn t impact the review  there are volume up down and a pause feature as well as skip forward or back for songs  pressing on the logo activates siri  nice touch   you can go wired or wireless with bluetooth  which worked like a charm  i could walk around my whole house listening to music while my phone was in my room   all in all  for features   it s great  there are not too many and not too much buttons and everything is quick easy and responsive final review for me they where ok but  headphones that i bought for    bucks outclassed these where it mattered to me the most  if you can handle ok comfort and neutral sound quality  good for music making monitoring  these are a great fit for you side note i love to listen to music that has rich  not over the top  bass and very clean audio  i also like to game  which can take over   hours of my time   when i first put them on they where fine but when i kept playing games i just started to notice my ears and the top of my head feeling uneasy  and when i went to listen to music it was to neutral for me and i heard things i didn t want to      
49,5.0,                       i came from some cheaper  gaming  headphones and i immediately noticed just how  flat  these headphones were   they don t add anything that s not there or subtract from whats supposed to be there   you get natural sound   in my opinion some of the best headphones for the money      
50,5.0,                       these are the best headphones i ve ever owned   buy these right now   you will not regret this purchase   i ve not compared them to any other semi professional headphones  but i have compared them to some  gaming headphones  purchased as a gift for someone else   the cups on these ath m  x headphones swivel and tilt  so they conform to your head no matter what the shape or size   they also have an even seal around your ears   other over ear headphones i ve tried don t all do this  so this is a serious plus   the included pads are super soft and seal very well   i can listen at  too  high volume  and people can t hear them at work  and our office is pretty quiet most of the time   the included coiled cable is a little long for my use  but the short one works great at my desk or if i m travelling with these and using with my phone   these aren t noise cancelling  but with how well they seal  i imagine they d be decent on a plane   i ll try to update this review once i ve tried them on a plane update  after a few years the leatherette of the ear cups is disintegrating  which is not uncommon  but still disappointing  the headphones are just okay on a plane  but even cheap earbuds seal better for noise isolation  in a normal room they re still the best headphones i ve ever owned  still recommended  but maybe buy a replacement set of ear cups      
51,5.0,                       only thing i dislike about this is they are a  little power hungry came in a nice box  had   different cables  and a     inch adapter  came with a soft leather case to store them in  hooked them up to my note   cell phone and worked real good audio was clear  bass wasn t bad  my son has beats by dre  and this sounds better with more bass than his blue color doesn t make it sound any better  however does add a bit of flash now granted  the black color is cheaper  but i thought what the hell  to be honest i wanted the red pair but amazon was out      
52,5.0,                       i am by no means an audiophile  and these are my first headphones that i ve spent more than      to purchase  however  these headphones have definitely raised my awareness of the quality of recordings i listen to  i ve never been able to hear very well the difference between a standard mp  downloaded from amazon or itunes and that of a lossless file until listening with these headphones  i have been reintroduced to old favorites with new detail or with a clarity i ve never heard before  it has plenty of bass without being overpowering or muddling the mid and low range like a pair of beats or monsters do  if you listen exclusively to bass heavy music and like that sound you may be a little disappointed  but if you have a wider palette then i think these definitely provide a nice  real world balance so that they produce good sound in a wide variety of situations  i ve listened to classical  metal  and played video games with them and been pleased with them in each case that aside i like the build of the headphones  i find them comfortable and usually wear them for an hour or more  occasionally   or   hours at a time  and haven t gotten warm  sore  or a headache from the fit  they do a pretty good job of passively canceling out a lot of noise  they come with   headphone cables   a short and a long straight cable  and a mid length curly cable that stretches out longer than the straight cable  it comes with   screw on     adapters  though only the long and curly cable are threaded  the included cables are keyed so that they can be inserted into the phones and locked  though non keyed cables will work fine  it comes with a leatherette pouch that once folded up the phones will fit in  but with cable included it s a tight fit so i see myself finding an alternative at some point  all in all i am exceptionally happy with these headphones      
53,5.0,                       i ve been using these for about a year now  and i love them  i used their predecessor  ath m    for probably seven years before i bought these   these are very comparable in sound and build  they seem like the same headphones sans wires and with buttons   let me tell you  i beat the crap out of those headphones  and they held up wonderfully   they started looking rough after a while  but they never broke the sound on these headphones is really great  it s not for everyone  the emphasis is on clarity rather than bass  i love them for jazz  bluegrass  folk  lighter rock  and things like that  i ll sometimes switch to different pair for metal  harder rock  and some electronica   they feel weak when you re listening to noisy  bass heavy music where the clarity of the headphones doesn t do anything for you and the less exaggerated bass response takes away from the music the battery life on these things is great  i use them off and on throughout the workday  and i generally charge them once or twice a week   they do take a long time to charge  so it s best to plan ahead a little and charge overnight  this might make them a poor on the go choice for some folks  but you ll run into issues with their weight and bulk first for those uses   the controls are simple and easy to use   the buttons feel like they ll keep up with the rest of the headphone in terms of durability   i don t really use the touch for voice assistant control  but it does work if you re into that sort of thing they don t have active noise cancellation  but they do passively block out noise pretty well   word to the wise  glasses do interfere with that noticeably   not a big deal in a quiet ish  office  on planes i ll take my glasses off to help block out noise   i don t think that s unique to these  it s just a fact of life with over ear headphones overall they re great headphones  worth every penny   hopefully someday they ll switch from usb b micro to usb c  but i think it was a fair trade to get these to market at a good price      
54,5.0,                       these headphones are  by far  the best purchase i made all year  in       i did extensive research on several pairs of over the ear headphones from several manufacturers over a several month period before finally settling on the audio technica ath m  x s   to give a little background  i am a huge fan of all kinds of music and consider myself a casual listener with some audiophile tendencies   my budget was      max  so for the money  these headphones are the best value out there if you re not willing to spend upwards of      or more for true audiophile quality cans these headphones had everything i was looking for  quality  balanced sound  with maybe a slight emphasis on bass  which is definitely alright by me   a collapsible   attractive design  durability and flexibility  light weight  a detachable cord  and these cans come with   cords  a great value    and of course  they fit my budget most importantly  the sound is so crystal clear   there is no muddling in the lows and the mids truly shine   highs are also pitch perfect   these aren t the best headphones for bassheads  but they definitely deliver a good  deep boom in my opinion the only concern i had when i bought these headphones was that they may be too bulky or uncomfortable but i have used them for hours on end several times since i first bought them last week and have found my worries were for nothing   they are a breeze to wear and while they are larger headphones  they aren t too ostentatious   they truly are a joy to wear and use if you are on the fence about these headphones  don t wait any longer   these headphones really do live up to the hype      
55,5.0,                       out of the box connected within seconds and then i was blown away by pearl jam and rage against the machine i bought this head set for my own podcast and webinars and didn t worry too much how other audio would sound till i put these babies on  i have lost a lot of time listening to crappy headsets it seems i m that person that doesn t understand why you would pay over a     bucks for a headset  but boy have i seen the light cons after    minutes i can feel some friction on the crosspoints between my glasses and the headset i live in the caribbean  so a bit ear sweat will happen pros sound is amazing connecting was easy high quality feel cable with mic      
56,5.0,                       okay  so my original review  below  from      still stands  seeing as it has been a few years owning these headphones  i thought it was about time for an update  these headphones are more than i looked for  and i am quite impressed  these things have retained their quality  all throughout  still some of the best headphones for the money to buy  i am watching a movie and thought to myself  these things still sound good years later  hoping to get more years out of these some of the best headphones i ve ever had  better than the beats mixr  the bass doesn t hit as hard  but he overall quality of the bass  mids  highs and lows is superb  they take a bit of adjusting to because i wear glasses  but they re comfortable for hours  i wear them at work for almost my entire shift  highly recommended  best headphones under          
57,4.0,                       random notes  you will read online that these sound identical to the wired version  they do not  they are similar  but slightly worse the latency is surprisingly low  even when streaming  i was very surprised these are not noise cancelling  nor do they claim to be   you can hear even a loud fan in your room they are also not very minimal so it is hard to use them outside the pairing process was very easy      
58,3.0,                       for starters  these are recommended from the various yt reviewers because they are loud  or better  can get loud and really in your face sound wise since its very bass oriented  most people think loudness equals quality which we know is not true   like most things in audio  these are going to be very subjective cans  and i laugh at the people that mock these the same as those that praise them to be the best  they are far from the best  they should not be praised or mocked  but appreciated for what they are meant to be used for  studio monitoring  and banging your head to amazing overly aggressive bass while maintaining very good detail  very narrow  vocals and other instruments may sound  confined  when compared to more open headphones  but that s why there is no  pair does it all  headphone  its just not possible three stars because i love these cans  but they have a lot of flaws imo  had them for over   years now  def broke them in  build quality is not bad  its not amazing  but its above average for sure  again  had them for    years and they still hold up very well the original pads are garbage  absolute garbage  they are tiny  they make your ear sweat and press on your earpad and really hurt after    minutes  cables are garbage  the headband is huge  and it itches after around   hour of use  i have to size them just right which is very annoying however   if   you get new deeper larger pads  if you break them in  and if you use  even if these don t need to  i know  even a cheap entry level dac   dac amp like the btr   more amp  what  you must be insane    and if you re into hip hop and electronic music and want to really hear that bom bom bom bom to where yes   there will be tracks you will go  oh f that s too much    then these are going to rock your f soul and you re gonna love them if you re someone that likes speakers like audio  open air sounds  more sound stage more openness   etc  etc    which of course we all appreciate as well but    nope  you re going to throw these away and do all sorts of rituals against it because you may as well think these are satan s cans   but if you love acid techno like i do   these can be a lot of fun  but that s it  and studio monitoring but i mean  yeah  do i recommend them for above      bucks  no    i got them for      do i recommend them for lower than      maybe  if you read above  you decide do i recommend them if you want mainly listen to hip hop and electronic  bass oriented music     f yes don t listen to these self proclaimed  audiophiles  that rip on these because they don t like them so neither should you  that is bs  they clearly have a diff taste and listen to diff music  simple as that  these are quality cans with major flaws design wise but that serve a specific purposes and do it very well ps  they do not have good sound stage or imagining  which makes me wonder why these clueless reviewers suggest them for gaming  these are not for gaming at all  the moment you see a vid suggesting these for gaming  unsub  they are clueless  you need open back with wide sound stage and near perfect imaging for gaming  not bass oriented closed backs  come on now       
59,5.0,                       the primary purpose was sound that i would live  obviously  only laymen in the audiophile world would ever consider them flat headphones  yet  for people who keep using the senn  xx  or hifiman or even the aria or the    s  the m   x is a breath of fresh air  the bass is tight  and yet the sound profile has limited variability to ensure an almost flat response  the closed back nature does not help the soundstage much  but as with most closed back cans  what we sacrifice in soundstage we gain in noise isolation  of course  it isn t the best choice for a beginner if they re looking for accuracy and flatness  but for audiophiles who want to rediscover a little joy and even infatuation in the music that they listen to  these are a cheap  travel worthy option to consider      
60,5.0,                       i ve had at earbuds before and loved them  these are exactly what i ve been looking for  reasonably priced  good  but not bass head level  bass  decent soundstage  i listen to a lot of classical and instrumental music as a casual listener  and these sound good enough for my purposes  some older orchestral recordings don t seem to get a lot of separation in instruments  pop  r b  and edm sound fantastic  ran my favorite  test  songs through them and didn t get any of the clipping or harsh brightness that cheaper pairs give only note  but not enough to take away a star   i m a petite person  and the band to strap sizing is just verging on too big for me  i think i ll add some padding to the brace that goes over the top of the head so it fits better      
61,5.0,                       i ve been using them for a year i ve thoroughly enjoyed the well balanced sound of these headphones  my first review wasn t very good but in the past year i ve had plenty of time to reevaluate and i would definitely buy them again  i think they are a great pair of introductory headphones for audiophiles on a budget  comfort could be improved a little but stock cushions are fine  when the music kicks in they do a great job of drowning out most everyday sounds      
62,5.0,                       up until this point  i ve never owned audio technica headphones   there are no words to express how these headphones sound  it s the type of product that you need to try for yourself i have never heard headphones this good in my life  if your phone has aptx  your in luck because these headphones support it  pair that with spotify  very high aka extreme quality  then your golden bass is just right  highs and mids are perfect  you end up noticing flaws in some songs that the artists didnt notice they feel amazing and cancel noise like you wouldnt believe  even if you have volume at max  which we ll get to in a second  there is very  very little leak about the volume   for years  i ve always maxed my volume out  these   are different  this get very loud  so loud that i have to keep the volume at about      i ve never had to turn down the volume on headphones so that should tell you something i havent tried watching movies with it but havent noticed latency with youtube videos would i suggest these headphones  yeah   yeah i would best headphones for under      by far  bye  bye bose and sony  audio technica has come to play      
63,5.0,                       first  this is really a     star review  but if i have to round up or down  i m inclined to round up  these headphones aren t perfect  but they are better than       good i ve been looking for a while for headphones that actually sound good without breaking the bank  it s surprisingly hard to find anything in the sub      range  really the sub      range  that has a sound profile that s basically neutral but just on the side of pleasing  most consumer level headphones have vastly overemphasized bass  terrible mid range and sibilant highs  that s true even of headphones considered expensive at this level  like the sony wm     xm  s  which i tried before these  yes  you can adjust the eq on those  but the drivers just aren t tuned well for anything but how it comes set from the factory  so you can get less bass and more midrange  but the sound quality just ends up being really harsh and just    bad alternately  a lot of higher end headphones have  under  emphasized bass  which is a side effect of an open back design  i had a pair of expensive sennheisers when i was younger  no idea what happened to them  that had this issue  and in looking at various reviews on the net  such as at rtings com   not much has changed in current models the athm  x s are apparently intended to be studio monitors  but i don t personally think they re quite accurate enough for that except in maybe a home studio setup  the sound stage is very much in your ear rather than all around you  so in that sense they d make for good monitors  but the overall sound profile is what they call  consumer friendly   ie  it s intended to sound  good   not      accurate that said  if you look at the actual frequency response graphs at any review site  you ll see that these are very accurate considering the price point   way better than you ll find with some of the trendier headphones out there  and they do give you that sub bass response too  without it being too over emphasized  they are a closed back design   so i think at did a really good job in balancing neutrality with just making music sound a little better  these won t give you that muddy  thump  but they don t sound shrill or tinny either  the mid range  which honestly is where most of the music is  sounds great   not harsh or compressed as it does in most consumer headphones  and the highs sound clear  maybe a tad underemphasized but not at all sibilant  very nice comfort and build quality is where i d made take a half star off  they have a pretty high clamping force compared to most other headphones i ve tried  and i was concerned initially that this would make them hard to wear for long listening sessions  and no  they re not ideal for that  but i will say that i kind of just got used to it rather than it becoming less bearable over time  the earpads are also on the thin side  but i understand these are easy to change and many other pad styles are available  they also can use pads intended for other headphones   in terms of construction quality  the headphones are mostly plastic  although the headband itself is metal  they are light  though these are     more than the fully wired  non bluetooth  version of these headphones  i figured for that price difference  it was worth the upgrade  bluetooth seems to work fine  although from what i understand the best codecs these support are aac and aptx  not aptx hd  and no ldac   of course they will drop down to sbc if that s all your devices have   sbc is kind of the lowest common denominator  if you have bluetooth  you have at least that  but honestly  in most cases it s really hard to tell the difference between codecs anyway you can still use these as wired headphones too  and that s mostly how i ve been testing their sound quality  with high res flac files  so not relying on lossy compression in either the file or the transmission  or the dac in the headphones themselves   they come with a pretty short  thin wire with mini plugs on both ends   good for using with a phone or portable dap  but probably not sitting on a couch attached to an amp or receiver  you can of course upgrade to a longer and or coiled proper headphone cable if you want  and i plan to at some point  but it s obviously an extra expense keeping on the theme of included  or not  accessories  these do come with a charging cable  and a really basic leatherette  bag  to carry or store them in  honestly the lack of a proper case doesn t bother me too much    if i m traveling i ll probably be carrying my cheap set of noise canceling headphones rather than these  but it s something to consider if you do want to carry these around with you everywhere  also keep in mind that these do  not  have active noise canceling  i feel like that s getting to be such a common feature even in cheap headphones that it s necessary to mention if a set of      headphones does not have it  these do not  they do block a lot of noise just through their overall design  passive noise cancelation   but there are no electronics to assist with that  these are old school headphones with bluetooth added  that s it but i do think i ve found my headphones for sound quality without going broke  they re a good value if sound is your primary concern over all else      
64,5.0,                       i might not be the best person to ask as this is my first set of nice headphones  they are great though  they sound very clean and make music more of a joy to listen to  the bluetooth is nice  these work great for gaming as well as music  i have a fairly eclectic taste  these sound great  they are more of a flat sound so if you are a bass head these may not be the best for you but you can hear things way more clearly  for the first time i could clearly pick out all of the string instruments when listening to classical music  i recommend these and would buy them again      
65,1.0,                       i purchased audio technica headphones on amazon on october      from a seller named tech sales usa  seven months later  the right headphone stopped working completely  i believed all at products come with a two year warranty  but when i looked this up on the at website  i found that tech sales usa is on an  unauthorized online resellers  list and therefore is not eligible for warranty  at the time of purchase  i bought two pairs of the same headphones  ath m  x  one from a legit dealer  and the other not both from the same amazon page  guess which one has stopped working  at the time  i believed i was buying directly from amazon services  because that is what i initially selected from the amazon search window  however  the seller changed without my notice to an unauthorized dealer when i switched the preferred product color  amazon needs to do a much better job being transparent to customers about who they are buying products from and alert you when the seller changes suddenly because you wanted  for instance  black headphones instead of blue ones  amazon should also be much more forthcoming about which sellers are actually authorized dealers and which are going to send products not eligible for a warranty  i m not abdicating all responsibility for this i do a ton of homework when i buy products but when the seller changes midstream simply because you tweaked something minor on the page  that s willful deception on amazon s part and i think we deserve better i ve contacted tech sales usa to inform them about the defective product they ve sent me  i ll update this review when i hear how they plan to remedy the situation      
66,4.0,                       excellent sound quality  perfect for using in a studio or for home use  however there is one problem  and it s a nasty one  the ear pieces appear to be leather  but don t be fooled    it s fake leather    and after a few years it will disintegrate and leave black plastic flakes everywhere  including your ears    nasty      
67,5.0,                       i bought this product more than   years ago  i used them everyday and i have never had any issue or complaint today the quality of this product reached another level  i was leaving home to the university and i forgot them on the roof of my car  as you may be thinking  the headphones fell off the roof and i saw when two suv s ran over them i was so sad  but i returned  to pick them up  for my surprise they only have some scratches and the plastic in one of the holders broke  i  fixed  it with electrical tape   however  they are completely functional  this product is just amazing      
68,5.0,                       i just received these today  so my review is after only a short while of usage  i was tired of my old ipod and cheaper headphones all sounding the same  after doing some research i went out and bought a pioneer xdp   r hi fi audio player and started rerecording all of my music in flac style  the music sounded somewhat better until today  when i plugged these headphones into the pioneer and started listening  wow  everything sounds cleaner  i m hearing notes and sounds that i never got from the music before  i think that if i could  i d just sit here for days on end and just listen to all of my music till my ears got tired of having the headphones on  they feel quite comfortable right now  but if they get uncomfortable  i ll just buy an upgraded set of pads  but thats all  for now i can say  try them you won t be sorry      
69,4.0,                       i am a live sound engineer   i had gone through at least   pairs of m    from losing them  etc  since i started using them in          years     it was time for another order  since i lost my last pair while touring  so i got these so i can have the added benefit of bluetooth  for general music listening  not necessarily work  wired worked great and sounded very similar to my prior m   s  i still need to figure out what other cables i can use  whether i need trrs on the headphone side for it to work properly or if a    mm trs male to trs male would work  bluetooth worked great for a couple weeks  then suddenly every non wired sound  both the internal  power on    bluetooth connect  sounds and actual bluetooth audio  started sounding very distorted and weak and quiet  and the right channel wouldn t come through or would be intermittent   at first i thought the battery was simply on the verge of dying  but charging it fully didn t help   something broke internally   however  using wired still worked fine   i returned and ordered a replacement  hope it doesn t happen again all of my prior m   s were very rugged  i probably dropped them hundreds of times  they lived at the bottom of my backpack underneath heavy stuff  and i had blasted them with super high sound levels for long periods of time many times  while doing live sound and they were sitting next to the desk  fortunately not while i was wearing them  like  oops i had the headphone volume all the way up for the last hour of this loud rock show   i m really hoping the additional electronics inside the bt version aren t fragile  and that this was just a fluke  because i want to continue loving these      
70,5.0,                       great sound  i used it for gaming as well  csgo etc   and is so much better than  gaming headsets   only problem i had was with the ear piece  it was too thin for me and would hurt my ears after a while  so i got a replacement from a third party company for thicker ones  now they are super comfortable and still sounds great      
71,3.0,                       i like the ath m  xbt headphones very much  great sound  including bass  which is more than adequate  they are not noise canceling cans but i didn t want nc phones and these closed back phones block most external sound out i gave three stars because the build quality could be better  specifically  the  earcups slide too easily on the metal  guides   so the earcups do not stay where you want when you adjust them  i may return these if the problem gets worse  otherwise i m pleased with my purchase      
72,5.0,                       these headphones are amazing  especially for the price  i m recommending to anyone that asks for a new headset the one downside i have is the stock earpads  when monitoring a mic  the material and extra closed nature make  my own voice very loud in my head  like i m talking while my hands are covering my ears or something  i bought a set of the brainwavz velor foam earpads which made these headphones perfect by opening up the sound stage a little bit      
73,5.0,                       using this for home music and foley recording studio monitoring  comfortable  physically stable  doesn t fall off   seems like a good flat response  but i don t have means to measure   purely subjective opinion here not cheap  but not out of the world  pricewise  either  i feel like i am getting my money s worth  again  that s subjective   i would buy it again as long as it died of age and regular wear and tear      
74,5.0,                       cons  like any faux leather headphones  they can make the area surrounding your ears hot after using them for an extended period of time   this  however  is a minor  acceptable issue pros   these headphones are incredibly comfortable   they feel very well constructed  which his important because i m not known for being delicate   i use the products i purchase  and i use the heck out of them   even the cables feel like they ve been designed to last   though i ve never accidentally reached the end of the cable  i use the half coiled stereo cable   a fact that can be attributed to the cable s length  i don t feel like i could rip out of the headphones with a good pull   the audio quality is crisp and precise  it s well balanced and sounds good on everything from audio books to folk music  hip hop to rock and roll other   for me  these fit my head  budget  and musical tastes better than beats   even the aesthetics of the headphones are more appealing to me     stars well earned      
75,3.0,                       for      though  i have to say i m a little disappointed  i expected more  wow  factor  i d hoped for better dynamic clarity  richer bass without muddying the mids and highs  honestly  i can t hear much if any difference between these and my     phillips headphones  and at a relatively normal volume  everyone in the room is annoyed at how loud they are  they don t sound bad but if you re looking for a step up in quality from your       set  i can t recommend these      
76,2.0,                       this review is only for bluetooth usage of these headphones i want a simple bluetooth head phone that is comfortable and sounds somewhat okay   long story short  these sound pretty bad and make it hard to intuitively switch between bluetooth devices connecting out of the box was easy enough   there is a light static noise whether listening to music or not   when i tried to connect to my phone i could not pair   i had to disconnect from my computer firsts and then pair  which is annoying   so i installed the new firm ware   issue persisted   i can t devices easily and it sounds bad   hope others had better experiences best thing about these  they are super comfortable   and the sound was very good with audio plugged in  i know this is expected  but other bluetooth devices i have just are leaps and bounds better sounded than these      
77,5.0,                       i did a lot of research on headphones with good bass  clear sound and comfort while wearing   i then went and spent time in the store actually testing them out before making a decision   i am glad i picked this one   it has great sound and is very comfortable to wear   i wear glasses and they did not cause any discomfort while wearing the headphones   i have had these for a little over a year now and i love them   i have taken them on two trips to the philippines and used them on the long haul flights   longest flight so far was just under    hours and i wore them for most of the flight  i can t sleep on planes    they are great for music  movies  podcasts and audio books although audio books and some podcasts can be a bit more difficult in loud areas because they are not noise cancelling   love that they will lay flat on my chest so that i can keep them on comfortably while not listening to music or podcasts   the only downsides are that they do not have a wireless option without purchasing additional product and that they are not noise cancelling   i wanted the cord since i was going to be using them for long haul flights and didn t want to worry about them running out of battery but it would be nice if they sold a pair that did both   with that said  there is an adapter that will convert them to wireless and even though they are not noise cancelling  they do a decent job of blocking out noise      
78,5.0,                       fantastic headphones  worth more than the price they are asking these days  i find these a step up from the pricier at     art monitors i ve been using  crisp mids and highs  tight  but not overpowering bass  they are good for everything  not just one genre of music  i look forward every day to coming home and listening to my favorites like i ve never heard before  and appreciating new music in the best way under        that you can find   my test music for new cans is nin the fragile  and later yello cd s  but i listen to everything from bowie  techno  metal  dance music  classical  both digital and vinyl  and it all sounds incredible  and  that is without any of the fancy headphone amps that are out there that i see talked about in many reviews   they do have a snug fit  so it can bother some after long periods of wearing  but they are solid  the fact they they give you   different length detachable cords is astonishing considering how may companies relish in making you buy extra stuff for their product  like others have said  i can t recommend these headphones enough      
79,5.0,                       i am a musician so i had to choose between many headphones to fit my picky ears   after some serious comparison between this  beyerdynamics dt         and bunch of akg  and sony mdr      i chose this  this might not be the flatest headphones flatness is subjective too  and our ears don t really perceive sounds as flat any way  this is very close to harman target  which again is not the most accurate standard at all   but boy it makes the music sound amazing and alive  music is not flat  the bass accuracy is insane  only complaint is may be it s a little bit harsh and the comfort is good but not the best  but its sound will cancel out all this      
80,4.0,                       great sound quality  i do notice that these headphones have a hard time with my iphone and corresponding      to lighting adapter  the sound seems to be underpowered and a bit choppy  when used with my macbook pro  it sounds amazing  while creating edm style music on logic pro x they perform flawlessly  these are definitely your studio headphones that live on the rack  i highly recommend these headphones when looking for a decent pair of studio quality headphones  just make sure your devices provide adequate power to them and you will head every deep bass and high tone      
81,5.0,                       excellent well rounded sound  i looked at lots of reviews before purchasing  great value for      out of the box i was disappointed in the sound quality but the battery was low  charged it and i m happy with the balanced sound quality  very nice high and mid range sound  base is about right for my taste  not overpowering  balanced  battery charged in about   hours  supposed to last    that remains to be seen earcups could be a bit larger but fine for most ears  if you have big ears may not work so great build quality feels good and they re not heavy      
82,4.0,                       i bought these based on the m  x reviews  expecting that the bluetooth capacity would give them even more versatility  but    you can forget about making receiving calls using them wireless  the mic is amazingly bad  you can t rely on it to keep a fluent conversation  you ll need to plug the cable  which mic  works perfectly  to be able to make calls in the audio department  there s no doubt these are made by an expert company like audio technica  it s clean and balanced  you can hear every detail very clearly  the bass is not too deep  which for me and for everyone who thinks of to use them in studio is something to highlight these headphones are also very comfortable to use and are well made  you can find better construction quality or design  but not in this price range finally  the battery lasts forever      
83,5.0,                       i ve own these headphones for two years now  with absolutely no problems  no broken wires  and more importantly  nothing within the headphones has broken  spending     dollars two years ago is a hell of a lot cheaper than spending    every   months to replace a pair a cheaply built headphones  definitely worth the price to invest higher in your headphones  the design of these headphones also allows you to conviently fold up and carry them with you  perfect for traveling  all around fantastic design now onto the actual sound of these things  fantastic  these are balanced headphones  there is no  bass boosting  or anything of the likes  these allow you to hear the music as the artists have produced it  everything comes across crystal clear  the highs don t hit a screeching frequency that makes you cringe  the lows are muddied with static  and the mids are there to hold everything together  if you ve never listened to music with a decent set of speakers or headphones before  you probably don t understand how many dynamics you re missing  music is  and sound in general  a very   dimensional space  the right music will allow you to feel sounds from not just the sides of your ears  but seemingly in front  behind  above and below you  thus  for anyone truly interested in listening to music in the right way  it s important to have headphones that can capture these  d elements as a student in an audio engineering course  and a music lover  these headphones provide both the sanctification of listening to music  as well as being able to mix music at home  without expensive sound insulation and studio monitors highly recommend this product      
84,5.0,                       awesome awesome awesome  they are comfortable the aren t noise cancelling but the keep out most noise  i had them on for easily    hours having them on then falling asleep with them and kept them on after waking up with no discomfort almost forgot i had them on   they fit over my ears perfect so there is no contact also allows for great sound  the quality of sound is great  good mids  lows and highs  i love bass  i wanted headphones that would hit hard  and they do a pretty good job of iti could always use more but most headphones don t or cant hit as hard as i d like  yes even the way over priced and rated beats cant   i recommend buying a headphone amplifier as most devices cant put out as much as these can take  i bought https   www amazon com gp product b  vethz   ref oh aui detailpage o   s   ie utf  psc   its a bit overpriced but the difference is huge  as for gaming they don t have a mic so no com but you can get an adapter for them  in game sound again they sound great i downloaded a surround sound program and they work so good with it  the extra    bucks between this and the other modle i think worth it but i haven t tried the other model so i cant really speak to that  what  i can tell you they blow my other set at the        price rang away      
85,5.0,                       i am so glad that i decided to purchase this headphone  yes  they are very comfortable to wear even after after several hours of wearing them  no fatigue  but the high quality audio produced by the headphones was something i really didn t expect  the vocals were crystal clear  the bass full  but not booming  the highs were pristine and not harsh  just a pure  natural sounding headphones  they could handle just about and musical genre  at any volume level  listening to my vinyl lps or ipod in these headphones has renewed my enjoyment of my music      
86,5.0,                       i m not an audiophile  but i have been learning how to dj  so these headphones are the ones i connect to my controller  they sound great and are comfortable to put on  rest around neck and maneuver while i mix  i am very happy with these headphones and their clear and high quality sound  they do fold up for better portability  the detachable cord slot makes it easy to switch between the   different length cords that come with the headphones that have     mm headphone jacks  there is also an adapter for a         mm  jack  i did not get the bluetooth adapter they are not really noise cancelling   but they are decent for knocking down external noise  i have not used them in a club for djing  so i have no idea how good they are for blocking out loud pa systems  very good product for the price      
87,3.0,                       awesome sound  as expected  i also own the     ath series  which i use for console gaming  but when it comes to pc gaming  i wanted the very best  these are certainly no exception to that  crisp highs  mids  and lows  the best sound quality i ve experienced to date edit  i ve owned these headphones for   and a half years now  and the black cushions are starting to dry rot and crumble to pieces  leaving black flakes all over my ears and neck after using them for extended periods of gaming  the sound quality has diminished a bit too  particularly the lows and highs  leaving me to speculate about the long term durability of the materials used to make the driver  i will soon be replacing these headphones  solely because of the crumbling cushions  which also happened with my last pair of headphones  sony       
88,5.0,                       these headphones sound damn incredible  i am extremely satisfied with this purchase  the price is also in good place  i have yet to plug into amplifier to push them further  but these puppys are plenty loud coming out of a phone or a laptop  the m  x has an excellent range  bass is consistent and rumbly  oscillating bass lines are distinct and audible  mids and trebs are clean and separate from the bass creating a full  rich sound  they are comfortable  and reduce listening fatigue  i highly recommend comes with   different cables for amp hookup or standard headphone jack  great for making mixes on the tables or playing an instrument through an amp they are little bulky but no so much so that it looks weird  gotta put those drivers somewhere   audio is clearly heard from outside the headphone  these headphones  breath   so the sound is better  but if cranked up everyone around you can hear the music         
89,5.0,                       i always used to see a lot of buzz around audio technica headphones which i didn t quite understand until i finally owned a pair of my own  i must say  after owning beats  bose  jbl and many other brands  these headphones might be one of the best pair of headphones i ve ever owned  the sound quality is crisp and clear  almost as if this is the way you re intended to hear it  the bass is amazing as well too  it even sounds great when using it on pc games  my only gripe with it  is that i tend to get complaints from others when using them on the phone  stating they can t hear me as well  which is why i gave it   stars for sound quality   asides from that  for anyone looking to get really good quality headphones  look no further      
90,5.0,                       i absolutely love these headphones  i ve had them for about   months and i m still in love with them  the leather is soft and the padding completely surrounds my ears rather than just smooshing them back which is great because my ear cartilage piercings aren t being smooshed  the sound quality is amazing and the overall look of the headphones is fantastic  a friend of mine would always use my headphones whenever she came over and she eventually decided to buy herself a pair because she loved them more than her brand new beats headphones  i think she gave her beats headphones to her mom after she got her new black audio technica headphones  the only issue with the white headphones is that they can get dirty easily if you dont be careful and you dont take care of them  i had to buy a special stand to put my headphones on when i m not wearing them so they don t get any random stains which is fine i didn t mind buying the stand it was cheap and it does the job  but overall i d definitely recommend this product      
91,5.0,                       i really enjoy these headphones  the sound quality is crisp and they get really really loud  the three included cords help cater to your specific needs  and they twist lock into the headphone connection which is a great feature  i purchased some replacement memory foam pads to add some more comfort  but the pads that come with them are great too  one thing i would say is that the bluetooth option might be good if that fits your situation  but the wired ones are a great buy      
92,1.0,                       they feel good  have clear sound  wired    and have good battery life  the wired option is convenient and i have no problems with it non affecting things  the mike volume is based on the headset sound not your device as a heads up  it s not a problem just the way it is  the touch for assistant option is interesting but i disabled my assistant my cons are with the bluetooth settings  the sink system looses connection at the beginning of every video  add  and song for several seconds  when it connects it pops like you pulled out an aux plug or put too much sound into a speaker  when set to bluetooth    best i have gotten is loose the first second or two  there is a constant feed back sound no matter what settings i use  the sound is a constant poping buzz that does not go away and starts as you turn on the headphones  that is before any bluetooth is connected  i returned the first pair for the same problem  needing your gps on to use the app at all is annoying  as well as how little it does might just delete the app in my opinion get a pair of beats if you want bluetooth  or for wired get any gaming headset  the comfert difference is not worth the extra cash  pass on these      
93,5.0,                       excellent and powerful headphones  amazing clarity  i love how these are shaped to fit over the natural shape of ears  i love the removable cable and the fact it comes with   different cable lengths  no more buying new phones due to wear tear of its cable   simply replace the cable  the sound quality is beautiful  even with my not so great hearing  i use these on tablet nexus phone for audiobooks and music without issue  i use them on my computer that has a powered soundcard  thus making the phones sound super rich in bass and highs   all at     volume  i also use them for sound monitoring on my tascam audio recorder when doing documentary film interview work  an area where it is important to monitor and reproduce audio quality sure  they are big  but they aren t meant for you to take to the gym or on your jog  they are meant to reproduce sound as if you were there  they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time and the cushion seal around your ear not only provides extreme comfort  but a sealed environment in which an orchestra appears to live in your eardrums  this investment will make you happy for a very long time        
94,5.0,                       i m writing this review after using these headphones for over   years  i have three other heaphones  so i haven t used these steadily  but i have used them regularly  i have just oredered the audio technica branded replacement ear pads  as the originals have not torn  but much of the vinyl coating has worn off  the rest of the unit is nearly pristine after   years  so i consider them to be very durably made  as to sound  all i can say is that after being used for my kind of music  classical  and not abused  it is superb  the bass is just right  and highs  especially vocal highs are clean and pure  with use the sound quality has improved year by year  this says a lot for the idea that headphones benefit from breaking in on the kind of music one loves  one of my other headphones is the oppo pm    highly praised for their sound quality  and i can say without a doubt that the ath m  x sounds just as good  perhaps even a little better on instrumental and vocal highs  that makes the ath m  x a great bargain  at a little over     the price of the oppo pm    particularly given that oppo has now gone out of business  i don t think you can find a better sounding or more durable headphone at any where close to the price of these      
95,4.0,                       these are the first quality headphones that i have ever owned and they sound very good  the bass is punchy at very high levels but sounds good on lower levels  the music is clear and balanced to my ear and i am really enjoying them  i have not used them for more than two hours but i did not get tired  i think it helps that i have a small head  i have read somewhere that people with bigger heads have trouble with these   i won t say these are the best headphones oranything because these are the first i have ever tried and owned  but the quality is definitely noticeable  i bought them for     on a lightning deal and i honestly would not have paid      for these  specially since i was not sure what i was getting into  however  they might be worth full price if you have some disposable income   anyway  i highly recommend these to beginners for their portability and good sound quality  specially if found cheaper      
96,5.0,                       this is now my third pair of this model  and i love them  they re accurate and clear  which helps in my monitoring applications  the build quality has gotten better since my first pair  unfortunately my    month old got ahold of those and did too much damage to the connection wiring   so glad to see there have been incremental improvements  the first pair lasted six years and would ve lasted more without my son getting ahold of them  and i ve got another four year old pair that work and sound like new  highly recommended      
97,3.0,                       super plasticky feeling  and the way it hinges pivots seems like it might break with time or by it getting twisted the wrong way  also  the spiral cable that came with it didn t even work  which is preferred when djing so you re not dealing with a long cord  has a cool look  but looks weird on my small head  too  the sound quality is good  though  i just didn t love the design construction of this product      
98,5.0,                       i bought this after my wife broke hers old ones  she was very upset  so i bought it after reading reviews in amazon and online  she is very happy and she thinks she got an upgrade  i would recommend this for anyone who loves good sound and a headsets that last  it is strong and looks good even for a lady      
99,5.0,                       first things first    stars defines sound quality for this price point  for      these are amongst some of the best sounding closed back headphones out there  better than      studio beats fyi  i would know  i had them before my producing days   occasionally the extremely high frequency treble can appear a bit harsh but the clarity and balance throughout the sound spectrum is great  as an audio engineer  these are great for monitor use and mixing purposes  the noise cancellation is pretty impressive considering there is little  if any  deterioration in audio quality  with greater noise cancellation you typically have to sacrifice audio quality   but if you re an aspiring producer or a music lover on a budget  i would look no further than here      
100,4.0,                       i bought these for personal use  i am not an audiophile or professional user  i just wanted high quality sound that did not break the bank  the price point of the m  x headphones coupled with the mostly rave reviews prompted me to order on saturday  i received them today  monday  with amazon prime and i have to say  the nuances of songs that i listen too are much more evident than in my old phillips noise cancelling pair that i had for twelve years  i am noticing aspects of songs that i did not notice before because the headphones are so precise in playing every single nuance  its nice to be able to hear the little things that add to the listening experience  there is a great balance of all ranges so that no particular range such as bass is overemphasized  this makes things sound as though they should  and also  the feel of the headphones are extremely comfortable with the soft padding on the top and around the ears  my old set were metal and had smaller cans so my ears and the top of my head would be sore after       minutes  not the case with my new m  x phones  i could wear them for hours  they do look a little bit dorky because of the larger size around the ears  but i don t care how i look as long as it is comfortable  that being said  i had to deduct one star only because of the leakage issue  at either full volume or even half volume  i can take off the headphones  cover them and i can still clearly hear the songs and specific lyrics  so i can see that if i were not alone and in a place such as an airline lounge  gate waiting area or other place with people  it could get annoying to others  some state that the leakage is less noticeable inflight with aircraft noise and i am hoping that this is the case because i would like to use them while flying update           still works well  but unfortunately  the ear pad cushions wore out and resulted in messy tiny black flakes getting all over the table and near my ears  i just purchased new replacement ear pad cushions for about          
101,5.0,                       i can t believe how much i like these   i narrowed my choices down to these and sennheiser hd   i own a really nice pair of sennheiser earbuds    as far as quality goes  both were about the same  however  these were over      cheaper   the sound quality is excellent   very crisp clear  and above all  accurate   if i want more bass mid treble i can always adjust the source   in headphones  like speakers  i prefer faithful reproduction of the source material   the bass is crisp and not muddled with the mids and highs are clear and well defined   the soundstage is excellent   i have no problem closing my eyes and  seeing  the field of sound around me   as for volume  these headphones deliver everything in the proper relationship regardless of volume   i did not need an amp to use them with my phone or mp  player   i also wear glasses so i was concerned with long listening sessions applying undue pressure  but the soft ear cups mold very well around my glasses   as others have mentioned  these are not  noise cancelling   but i did find that exterior noise has to be fairly intrusive to past them the only negative for me was the fact that the straigne relief on the provided cables was intrusively long   that caused the cord to constantly rub up against my shoulder and be distracting   i will look for a    degree cable to fix that   i did not reduce my star rating because i do not feel this to be a significant factor in my enjoyment of these      
102,1.0,                       i did a ton of research before buying these headphones  i wanted an extra pair of closed back headphones that i could use for music production  and i chose these because i could also listen to music on bluetooth or talk on the phone while out and about  i also considered bose headphones  but chose the audio technica because they are known to be more neutral for mixing and audio engineering purposes  i hoped they could be dual purpose for my mix listening and my personal phone call use i was never able to be heard on phone calls without using the detachable cable  which contains a microphone   i cannot find it advertised anywhere if there is a microphone on the body of the headphones  so mine is either defective  or there is simply no microphone  meaning it is impossible to take calls on bluetooth  major downside   it is possible to do this on bose headphones  i did not end up using these a ton for mixing  the cable did not fit properly into my audio interface adapter so i got pops  clicks  and poor audio quality and my daw  ableton  does not accept bluetooth as an output device  the pops and clicks are more likely a bad adapter  but if the cord were constructed for a screw on adapter  as on other mix headphones  this would be avoided for any sounds geeks i will say the times that i have been able to listen to music  i do like the audio quality of the headphones  the stereo field is great  they have just the right amount of bass  mids are clear  they are not tinny  but again  this has only been possible in a regular aux jack  not through my interface  so basically only when i am listening to music for leisure  like on my phone or computer  and i would rather due that through bluetooth  but   the bluetooth does not work  after using it probably about    times so overall  paying the extra for bluetooth is not worth it  i would rather just have a version with the cable built in and a screw on adapter for more reliability i do intend to return them under warranty  but the process requires to ship fed ex  or pay an undisclosed amount as a  handling fee   honestly  i don t think i should pay a penny extra for headphones that i have barely used  and that have barely worked i ll update this review if audio technica comes thru on the warranty or customer service      
103,5.0,                       these headphones are wonderful  if you are looking for a closed back headphone with good frequency response and a fair price  look no further while these headphones can get a little tight and uncomfortable for longer listening sessions     hours  due to the noise isolating ear cups  they provide great listening experiences in environments where there is some background noise  because of the closed back design  sound does not leak the included cables include both    mm connectors for common devices like phones  mp  players  and computers and     mm connectors for use with soundboards  amps  and other high end professional audio equipment to cater to your needs the swiveling ear cups make listening with   or   ears easy  and they rest comfortably when worn around your neck  these headphones are also surprisingly portable as the ear cups fold up into the area inside the arc of the headband  and the cables disconnect from the headphones all in all  these headphones are one of the better choices in their price range  outperforming more  popular  headphones like beats by dre  sol republic  and skullcandy with ease      
104,4.0,                       bought these during the recent sale a few weeks ago  i have been looking at these for a few years now and finally decided to pull the trigger on them with the discount  i have no regrets with these  i have been using sennheiser    s for the last   years and have been happy with them  but they are starting to show there age so i felt it was time to retire them the sound from the audio technicas has been all i could have expected  i am very happy about that  however  the comfort is not what i expected  i have read many reviews that have praised the m  s for the way they feel on the head  my experience is not meeting the expectation  i have a large head  that was never a problem with the sennheisers  with the ath m  x it is most definitely an issue and seems to be  at this point  not getting any better  within an hour or so of wearing these i can feel increasing pressure on my head and my ears start to ache and burn  i do not regret the purchase and i hope the situation eases with more time  but at this point i am beginning to worry a bit  i guess time will tell      
105,3.0,                       the mic is extremely insufficient for calls or video conferencing   my coworkers complain constantly that the sound quality is very poor when i speak   don t use this for important calls      
106,1.0,                       these sounded fine when i first got them a few months back  not bad  not great  just fine  they are certainly not uncomfortable to wear but are also not the most comfortable over ear cans i own either  they land somewhere in the middle  i would generally say these headphones land squarely in the middle which is not a bad place to be for the money but also not very exciting  they get one star from me in this case though because they have died after only   months  they never left the studio and actually haven t even been used more than a few times a week and they no longer work at all  i don t know if this is indicative of their overall build quality but they certainly have not been mistreated while in my possession  my pair of beyerdynamic dt     open ear cans are still going strong nearly    years later  do yourself a favor  go with the sennheiser hd     pro s over these      
107,4.0,                       i have a lifetime of headphone use  but being a musician i quickly advanced from being okay with  decent  sound headphones that you could get at the local superstore to not even wanting to get anything at best buy to pretty much only ordering from musical supply companies and amazon  that doesn t mean that i have lost the capacity to hear a good set of cans for the price  nor does it mean that i only would recommend the      cans for everyone the ath m  x s are listed as studio monitors  and as studio monitors they are supposed to sound balanced   no exaggerated bass  no rolled off midrange    it s all supposed to be there so you can make informed mixing decisions when listening  even so  these do have a pretty impressive bass response  they don t hide anything and i prefer them sometimes when playing videogames  especially vr when i m in a louder environment these cans are closed back  which means they have a pretty good ability to mute outside noise though without any dsp to actively adjust to noise   they reduce the sound of my computer when it s at full fan blast  which is really noisy  akin to a small vacuum cleaner literally  to nearly zero with these cans on how do they treat music  well  i listen to a wide variety of music on these as well  and find them to be quite spacious and accurate in terms of being able to tell where sounds are coming from  and they perform well regardless of how powerful the signal is going into them   no need for an external headphone amp to push them properly practically speaking they ve got a couple good features too   these cans came with   cords  a shorter straight cord that works well with a cell phone or computer use  and a longer coiled one that i use in the studio  in addition  the cups swivel a full     degrees for dj s or matching sound from the cans to the room a note about price   these fluctuate in price pretty regularly  the ath m  x are a great buy at around       if you re paying any more  check to see if the seller you re buying from is including the case  which is optional through most sellers  these cans have much more competition at the       tier  so watching the prices is recommended      
108,1.0,                       these headphones would be a pricey pick for middle of the road quality even if they weren t a medieval torture device for the head sound quality   ok but should be better at this price point  some         monoprice headphones are just as good in this arena  without the needlessly pricey proprietary audio cable  buy a set of fancy replacement earpads and you ve got a     pair of headphones that knock this pricey audio technica junk out of the park comfort   the worst  i have a normal sized head  who doesn t   and the smallest setting on these headphones left a lot of space between the top of my head and the headband  couple that with the fact that the earpads are concrete hard and crushingly vice like  i couldn t spend   minutes with these cans      
109,5.0,                       i have the wireless headphones  they sound great wireless or plugged in  truly the best headphones i ve ever owned  however  the fact that my pc  windows and apps  fight with the bluetooth and the apps want to take control of each other when i m using them is extremely frustrating  this is probably not a problem with the headphones  but with how they pair with my pc  so  its frustrating to not be able to use them to the full extent wirelessly i currently have them plugged in with the wire that comes with them  fyi  you have to make sure that its pushed in all the way into the headset   i had to push harder than i thought would  and after plugging them in my pc went into a tail spin and had to be restarted  hopefully my pc and these headphones learn how to play well together wirelessy because now that i ve had a taste of wireless headphones thats all i want         
110,5.0,                       as someone who has owned countless sets of cans and really demands good sound quality out of my headphones  i have to say these are the best  i currently own the ath    s and although they are good  they simply don t match the ath m  x  i can hear so many more of the musics nuances  the bass is more clear  the definition of movies through my ipad pro are amazing  i love the neutral reference of the headphone and that it doesn t color the sound like beats or sony  for a little over     bucks you cannot find anything comparable  sure  they might get out matched by a set that is   or   times the price  but could you really justify paying that much for a likely dead heat in sound quality  maybe if true monitoring in a professional studio were the case  maybe  other than that i cannot think of a better set for the common listener the headset is comfortable and fits nicely over my ears  the folding action of the cans is also nice  i wish the carrying bag was bigger and the fact that you must use the included cables  nope  your      cables will not work   if you want a killer set of cans and you want the best sound quality and style does not hurt your feelings these are for you cheers      
111,5.0,                       bought these for production and casual music listening and it has surprised me with how good it is  at the price i got it for        this is by far the best head set i have ever used  the sound is rather balanced with a bit of extra bass but nothing that i wouldn t consider still very useful for studio  something to note is the detachable aux cord  which will not be compatible with just any aux cord  due to a special locking mechanism attached to the headphone  it ships with three cords so there is no need to buy more   the only thing i would recommend is getting a carry case  around     for a good one  as the one they pack is a small bag and will not protect them if you put them in any sort of backpack      
112,4.0,                       overall the headphones are great   if you by these you absolutely need to do the firmware update  if you don t you will have a lot of issues with the microphone  once i did the update the microphone works great   they say these headphones are noise cancelling  they are not  however  they are incredibly well insulated so even if they are not  noise cancelling   they do block a lot of noise just from insulation  if you are wearing them with no sound playing  you will have difficulty hearing what the other person is saying  the sound quality is good but doesn t quite cover the full range of human hearing   but for the price you are paying it is as good as you are likely to find      
113,5.0,                       somehow  they ve actually managed to improve on the sound of the classic  reliable ath m   for the wired connection  i have no clue what those claiming otherwise are talking about   a direct comparison between these and my old m  x shows a night and day improvement  the older model certainly does not sound better  unless i wore out my old headphones so much their sound was damaged  which is doubtful as for the wireless connection  it sounds nearly as good as the wired and certainly is the best you re going to get over bluetooth at this point  supports aac and sounds great and transparent coming from an iphone  there are no problems with connectivity  no drop outs  and the battery life is exceptionally long  used on back to back long trips without recharging  with no problems  so this is great news considering travel and portability are obviously top concerns for wireless headphones my one complaint is that they apparently can only be  attached  to one device  so for instance if i wanted to switch from my iphone to my laptop  i can t just click  connect  on the laptop and the headphones automatically switch  i have to first manually disconnect from the iphone  then connect to the laptop  but this is minor and  having no prior extensive experience with bluetooth headphones  may be standard for all i know overall  a great purchase  not just a supplement  but a total upgrade to and replacement for the ath m  x  this is now my third pair in the m   series  following the original and then the x  i ve had some variety of m   for several years now  and i stick with them because they work well and sound great  i ve heard supposedly higher end headphones  but you just can t get a better set for the money as far as i m concerned      
114,1.0,                       purchased around christmas last yr thx to marques brown youtube review which also came on time no worries  cuz ive been wanting a good set of headphones to enjoy my tunes with when i started to listen using default cables with my phone an other devices  ths sound out put are really good but i realised that its not truly balance as the two driver one sound way louder than the other it being the left one as its more bass heavy and the right it being alot less easy on the bass with more vocals  other ppl have noticed the difference as well which leads me to thing thats it could be a defect  i purchased brand new so i thought i woulda have eliminate this kind of prob but yet still it really annoys me to hear somthing louder in one ear and soft in the other  lets see how well we can work together to solve this problem ty if its a problem or thats how the headphones are design which i doubt      
115,5.0,                       can t believe i forgot to review these headphones      months so far and they are fantastic   very comfortable and excellent sound quality   i have a high end audio system at home and it nice to be able to enjoy it without waking everyone when i get home from work  the cable assortment that comes with them is very handy   i use the short straight cable when on a plane and the coiled cable at home  also came with a long straight cable with a     headphone adapter that screws on the cable and a nice pouch to hold it all      
116,5.0,                       my first pair broke down after   years of use  the ear pads have away but those can be replaced  the material on the headband quickly wore away from hair oils and friction  the way the headphones fold has a weak point  there is a small plastic tab that prevents the ear cup from folding outwards  if you drop your cans that is where they will fail  i dropped mine more often that i should have  then the cops told outwards and cant clamp on your head anymore these new models have detachable wire they come with a short  a long  and a coiled wire  the part that goes into the headphone is smaller so you would need to get the wire from the company if it breaks there  but you have three so not the worst situation to be in the sound is phenomenal  use this more than my hd   s for casual listening  great  not overpowered bass response      
117,2.0,                       the sound quality was decent  although felt just slightly tinny but these headphones weren t as comfortable as i was made to believe  i immediately felt how poor the padding was for the headband  which due to the weight of the headphones  was causing a lot of pressure and discomfort against the top of my head  it became very uncomfortable and painful after just an hour or so returned them immediately      
118,4.0,                       such a gorgeous headset  i got it in white and i m so in love with it  audio technica does an amazing job with the sound quality  overall material quality  and packaging  the only thing that makes me a little sad is that since i ordered it in white the solid pieces are very plasticky  this was something i should have expected however and i honestly don t mind it with how amazing the headphones sound and how beautiful they are  they don t come with a mic but that s a very minor problem if you have the money to spend on a separate microphone  this definitely goes down as one of the things i m happiest with buying  it s well worth the price      
119,5.0,                       i really like these headphones  the sound reproduction from them is really pure for the price you pay  i like that they have bluetooth     also  they are not the most comfortable headset  after a while you get used to the comfort but not the most comfortable  the battery life is incredible  i wish they had the ability pair to multiple devices at once  solid construction  great sound over bluetooth and even better sound with a cord and a dac  these headphones are really all you need for the price you pay  all music sounds great on them  i have an android so i get to use the aptx codec  if you are looking for great sound quality at a great price than these are a winner for sure  i have compared them to the sony xm   soundcore q    and others  these blow all of them out of the water with their sound reproduction  great product      
120,5.0,                       i pre ordered these headphones and was thrilled when they were shipped well before their initial release date  the included three detachable cables are very thick  and their ability to lock into the monitors makes sure you don t accidentally pull rip the cord out of your headphones  the padded headband and pleather earcups are very comfortable for extended use  although they can make your ears a bit warm  the fit isn t very tight over my head  but my head isn t exactly large  from my first listening to now i am blown away by the sound these headphones produce  i listen to everything from tupac  to john mayer  to slipknot to beethoven  for the classical music  they produce a very clear sound with good separation of instruments for hard rock  you can hear every lyric clearly while also feeling the punch from the drums and guitars  for rap  the bass is pleasant and solid  without overwhelming the rest of the song  if you are looking for something that really pours on the bass  these are not for you  get yourself the overpriced beats  studio  headphones  if you are looking for comfortable  durable and very natural sounding headphones with a flat frequency response  ie studio headphones  these are incredible ps  i have used these with my   gb zune  my galaxy s   and my pc and all of them powered the headphones very well  i found that the best sound was produced by my zune  but i will be getting the fiio x  when it is released in the us  so i am confident that the sound will be pushed to even greater levels        
121,5.0,                       sound quality is very good  the ear pieces fit well around my ears  so as to filter out most external noise  so i can hear what i am practicing to while i play my drums  so i don t need to blast the volume  i really needed headphones of this quality for some time  they are also very good if you just want to listen to music  very near my infinity reference series tower speakers      
122,5.0,                       when my sony headphones broke because of the cheap plastic holding the earcups on the headset i began looking for a replacement set with the same or better sound quality  this set has excellent sound quality which sounds like a live performance in a great concert hall  compared to the sennheiser     s  the bass is deeper and more realistic  not boomy like the car stereos that rattle the door skins   the highs and mid range notes are pure and the way they would sound coming from a live performance  at      they represent money well spent which should give years of service and enjoyment due to their sturdy construction      
123,5.0,                       this is my son s second pair of these  he had the first pair for   years but the leather started peeling away so we bought him a new pair for christmas  these were an upgraded version of the m   ones he had  they changed the material i believe to hold up better and include   different types of cords so he likes that  he claims they are great at sound quality and hearing bass  they were rated top   among other music producers and the price is reasonable compared to other brands with similar quality      
124,5.0,                       these beat out there competition  plain and simple  extremely comfortable  easily adjustable  very sturdy and the sound quality is better than any in its price range and several that are more like the beats solo or studios  three cords for different uses  one for on the go  one for moving around while your connected device stays stationary and the awesome expanding cord which has saved me from jerking my ipad or phone off my desk several times  each cord locks into the headphones preventing you from so easily pulling it out  the carrying case is a nice leather and matches whatever color scheme you choose  when i bought my beats studios a couple years ago  i had buyers remorse because they only sounded ok and weren t as comfortable as some other brands  as soon as i got these and gave them a listen i felt relieved that i had made a quality purchase      
125,5.0,                       i bought these m   s because they are familiar and very portable  i m not the biggest audiophile in the world  so my needs aren t many  at the moment these headphones stay at my computer desk coupled with my magni   or come with me to round    to plug into headphone jacks for various music games like wacca and sdvx  are they super comfortable  for the first few hours  absolutely  but anything longer than   or   hours and you might want to put them away for a little bit in hindsight  maybe i should have upgraded to the m   s for increased comfort  but i can always buy aftermarket earcups i will keep giving these   stars because they re a great pair of headphones for anyone that wants to consider getting into serious listening the m  x s are not the best headphones on the market  but for the price especially if found on sale   it s a great way to experience your music at the next level it will be entry level  but just because you re beginning  doesn t mean that it s a bad way to start      
126,5.0,                       i ve been using my m  xs now for over a year and am definitely in love with them  i m not a sound audio music editor so i may not be the best person necessarily to compare various headphones  however  i really do love these and think they sound amazing for my personal use  it sure helps as well that they look amazing and came at a great price  after much research on my part i felt these were the absolute best option in the mid    s price range and i do not regret my decision at all  they feel very sturdy and high quality  the cabling system works amazing and the cables themselves feel high quality as well  my only complaint  if there is one  is after several hours of use they begin to get mildly uncomfortable  however  i will not knock a star for this because for myself this just tells me it s probably time i got up and took a break from whatever i was doing  i would absolutely recommend these headphones to anyone who wants great sound quality at a great price  and can appreciate the various ranges of music or audio and doesn t just want some terribly overpriced  too much bass beats      
127,5.0,                       i have been using the sony mdr      headphones exclusively for audio production and entertainment for about   years now  i thought they were the best headphone under       i waited until the ath m  x went on sale for      last black friday here on amazon and to see if they live up to the hype  well i rarely use the mdr     s at all any more  the m  x are just so much better  the sonys can often pierce the ear with mids and highs  not the case with the m  x  the sound is always warm and rich even at very loud volumes making the sonys seem flat  the sonys are better at representing actual bass as the m  xs greatly over emphasize it  which is perfect for entertainment but can be problematic for music production      
128,5.0,                       heavy duty closed back studio headphones  excellent audio quality  very good noise blocking as they fit firmly over the ear  great for monitoring live shows to listening to your favorite music  the odd blue color makes them look vaguely like a kids headset  so less likely to be stolen  not a fashion statement      
129,1.0,                       i live in egypt and paying for a premium headphone is not easy to do because i have to pay a lot of money  i read a lot of reviews and decided to pick the m  x because i thought it s the safest choice  and i can t go wrong with them considering all the positive reviews  however  once i put them on  they were really uncomfortable  like really really uncomfortable  they gave me a headache after an hour or so  and i decided to remove them and put my cheap headphones on again  i really regret following the hype because now i can t use them without getting a headache and that s not healthy at all      
130,5.0,                       as an audio enthusiast  i fell in love with audio technica s budget friendly line of products around    years ago    right before the hype was starting  i m going to preface this and say that without a doubt  for casual and professional  listening  or  general recording  these will not disappoint whatsoever  keeping in mind that they re slightly cut at the    hz    hz level and boosted at the lower frequencies  this will count the most for those looking to record  if you re a casual listener or general audio enthusiast  you can skip this next part for monitoring audio  there is  relatively accurate  credibility to the claim that the ath m  xs are the superior headphone  for casual listening  there is very little  there is absolute credit to be given for the   s having a flatter response and without a doubt more neutral flavor  you can feel it in the soundstage as well   i owned a pair of m  x for   years and handled them roughly before they finally snapped at one of the earcup hinges  the actual plastic   i can remember turning my head in surprise a bit more when listening to hi fi audio where subtle changes led to dynamic frequency shifts and would grade their  soundstage  at a       however  their   mm drivers always  always  always lacked bass unless plugged into a headphone amp  their construction is slightly less robust and they are generally less comfortable are there times i miss my m  xs  absolutely  generally the particular cut at the    hz frequency of the m  x will eventually lead you to those pieces of audio that you wish it was more neutral in that range   and that range alone  would i ever go back  yes  but not over the m  x  best analogy i could find is ordering an amasing cut of prime steak and asking it to be prepared medium  you have an amazing dinner and think  wow  what a great steak   and people yell  you should have gotten it medium rare    true  steak aficionados  all agree  yet no one ordering the cut  medium  has any complaints  let me give you some ath m  x bass presence     xath m  x natural sound isolation ath m  x comfort   m  xm  x s   mm drivers     mm driversm  x style  m  x stylem  x popularity  rd party accessories m  xfinally   finally here we are       for a pair of black m  x or      for a pair of blue black m  x blue black audio technica m  x all the way  the wonderful anodized blue and black paint over the hardened quality plastic is also awesome  clamped them around the box the first night  and fall asleep with them on ever since night    take them off at some point while asleep and toss em wherever  not a scratch  earcups get a little warm after a few hours  hardly noticeable  wearing them right now with no music on due to the natural sound isolation  impedence or frequency eq generally has me listening at     volume whereas the m  x i was always pushing     just to feel the bass a little  great pair of natural headphones  but they re not better than the m  x s at          
131,4.0,                       i got these for         and as a  person who has owned numerous headphones ranging from     all the way to       nothing beats the m  x in terms of price to performance pros   arguably the best headphones for sound quality under      and i purchased them for     less than that   comes with a variety of audio jacks ranging from different lengths to different connections  a respectable carrying bag for them  very portable due to having a detachable aux chord and folds up to a very manageable size  professional aestheticcons   the ear cuffs are terrible  i have fairly averaged size ears but they sit on the top of my ears instead of over them completely  i do know people who prefer having on ear headphones but i am not one of them and this is advertised as an over ear on online spec sheets  on top of that  the cuffs can be very hard for the material it s made out of  i opted to purchase aftermarket replacement ear cuffs  ones that you can conveniently find here on amazon  and it s been a whole new experience   it can be confusing to unfold them and put them on if you fold them up  the benefit to having modular movement is the ease of folding them up  but when unfolding them  you can easily try to bend and rotate things in the wrong way and it can get annoying   no microphoneoverall  in my opinion  the m  x is the best pair of headphones you can get for under       especially if you can get them on sale      
132,3.0,                       these sound awesome   i have them plugged into my pc to listen to music while i am working and some games   the sound is crisp and accurate   the highs are well defined but don t sound tinny while the base is perfectly low but doesn t sound muddy   to me  they sound perfect   the bad side is while it does include   cables with the locking mechanism on one end they don t include a simple adapter so one can use existing cables with them   i already have a nicer cable than they provide but it won t fit in the locking adapter port   found an adapter on amazon     for almost       are you f   g kidding me   such a simple  very simple  stupid simple  thing to include yet it isn t      stars for that incredibly stupid oversight      
133,5.0,                       here s my review after one year of using them  these headphones are the best headphones i have ever used  i don t use them for a professional duty but rather just for an everyday listening experience  for teenagers  the go to headphones are the beats which empasize bass and nothing else  which is great  if you listen to r b and rap and nothing else  however  go out of that and suddenly fleetwood mac doesn t sound as it should  for people in my age range  teens   for the same price as beats  i highly advise getting these headphones the sound quality as said before is absolutely pristine  and will simply blow anyone away in this price range  also  the build quality is very good with metals and durable plastics and cushy leather  i can wear these for hours upon hours at a time and they are still comfortable  when one slips these on  they will know they are putting on serious equipment  they also fold up quite nicely as well  on the downside  my heavy usage has made the earcups wear down after a year with the leather cracking  however  replacing the earcups is simple and costs just     so  for      or so i wouldn t hesitate to purchase these headphones   they might have been the best      i ve ever spent      
134,5.0,                       i love them  i am no expert and these are the first quality headphones i ve had  i ve always used the ones that come with my cell phones  and i just didn t imagine it would be this much of a difference  these sound even better than my home theater  wich  unlike my previous headphones  is actually a good set   i just love them      
135,3.0,                       the ath m  x was my favorite headphones for   yeas until i discovered sennheiser  beyerdynamic  etc  i still like these for listening to specific types of music  i was super excited when i heard that they made a wireless version of the ath m  x  but when i received them i was very disappointed pros  these sound exactly the same as the original m  x in wired mode  i ve seen people say that it sounds worse     which is completely false  the battery life is great and i m able to them continuously for     days without charging  bt pairing is also not as bad as some people say  oh and it comes with a built in mic  great for gamingcons  these do not sound the same in wireless mode vs wired mode  anyone who says they do cannot tell the difference  i exchanged these three times thinking that it s a defective unit but the wireless audio quality is simply inferior with reduced volume output  wireless sound quality is still decent but versus wired mode  it s night and day   probably because the m  x are too good  also  there is definitely an audible hiss at all times in wireless mode  whether you can hear it or not depends on how sensitive your ears are but some people say that there is no noise which is not true at all  oh and the included cable is a far cry from the coiled cable that the original m  x comes with imo the     premium is only worth it if you absolutely need the portability  else just get the wired version  the upgrade doesn t justify being able to go wireless occasionally with worse audio      
136,5.0,                       bought this for my gf and she absolutely loves it  normally her headphones break within weeks but this has lasted months and will most likely last much much longer  we usually talk on the phone together and the microphone on the headset is lack luster but once she plugs in the cord to the phone  it sounds very clear  this is very much worth the money      
137,4.0,                       i own athm  xbt headphones and love it  even though they are not the best headphones for everyday music listening  i mostly use them for playing my yamaha electronic piano  my piano sounds much richer  crisp and clear through these headphones as compared with the built in speakers or the other headphones i have for everyday casual music listening i would say there are better headphones in market for similar price range  these headphones do not have active noise cancellation and are not even as comfortable to wear as compared to similar bose or sony models things i like about it great sound quality for playing my pianoyou do not need to keep them powered on  to get good sound  while using wired  unlike other headphones great built qualitysound quality at par whether wired or wirelessthings i disliked bass not good enough for regular music listeningear pads not as comfortable  though i replaced it with an aftermarket earpads and fixed that problem overall  these are probably the only headphones currently in market that offer the professional sound monitoring quality along with the flexibility of having bluetooth connectivity      
138,3.0,                       i ve used the ath m  x for over a year and decided i wanted to go cordless  sadly the downside of cordless is still too great  i ve run into numerious issues  first one being that the band puts lots of pressure on the top of your head causing pain after extended wearing  i did not have this problem with the m  x  the other issue  i have is battery life  i was expecting to at least be able to use the headphones while they are charging cause that only makes logical sense  nope  these headsets are unusable while being charged    and they are not fast charging by any means  on website it s listed that you need to charge for   hours to get    hours of battery life   they really need to put fast charging on these things and make wireless charging a thing to make charging wireless headsets more convenient   i could get by all the downsides if i it was able to be used while charging  but you can t even do that    overall i do not recommend wireless headsets the technology just isn t there yet  if you forget to charge headset then your pretty much going to spend entire day charging it which really sucks      
139,5.0,                       i m a recording artist and was in the market for a corded  durable  quality sounding  affordable  and professional studio monitor headphones  after about a week of doing reviews and comparing specifications and price ranging i went with a hunch and decided to go with the same manufacturer as my condenser microphone  i almost purchased the m  x s but when i saw the m  x came in a pearl white  badda bing  that was about   months ago  and at least two to three days out of the week every week for at least    hours on those days i am blasting these headphones either recording vocals or mixing down tracks  if anything the sound quality has gotten better  i m actually kind of curious to see how long they hold out because i am putting them through vigorous usage  i m very expressive when laying down my vocals and tend to throw my head around but the way these headphones are fitted to your dome they dont budge  i m very hard of hearing so i purchased a auxiliary amplifier with them and used it for a couple days before i realized i didn t need it  my mixer pushes these babies just fine and on occasion have plug them into my phone an android and it seems to be the same case as well  highly recommended if you would like a pair of excellent quality studio headphones      
140,5.0,                       incredibly balanced sound  without messing with the eq  the bass doesn t drown the sound and the treble doesn t shrill  i ve been using it on a boss br     and a      sony android tv via avantree bluetooth adapter  the only thing it can t do is produce the deeper bass frequencies louder  e g  low b on a bass guitar      hz   also  it s very choosey with what    mm adapter it accepts  it needs to have a slender housing or the ones that have the speacial twist to lock pattern      
141,5.0,                       these headphones are the real deal  clear crisp sound that will have you hearing new details in old music  these will work with an iphone or similar devices with a    mm jack  as other reviews have stated  i do believe these headphones have a little bit of extra bass added  however  it is in no way obnoxious  it adds just enough bass so that songs will powerful bass  e g   radioactive  by imagine dragons   we will rock you  by queen  etc   sound better than ever  but songs with more variety  like soundtracks or other instrumental pieces  sound undistorted and beautiful  outside nose reduction is amazing  with music playing  you will not be able to hear a conversation  i imagine that it would work very well on a subway or plane  as to construction  they seem to be solid  they are all plastic save for a metal strip in the headband  however  this is not toy store plastic but very rugged and thick plastic that will last for a long time  the materials for the earpieces and headband are comfortable  sturdy and the coverings are constructed from imitation leather  it does come with three cords  two    mm jacks and a larger    mm jack  you insert the cord into the headphone by inserting the mark on the cord to the left of the mark on the headphone  and then turning the cord until the marks align  having a removable cord is nice because it prevents damage to the headphones from a cord being accidentally pulled  because these headphones are not cheap  i suggest a quality hardcase for them  i got this one  http   www amazon com gp product b  lz vfw  keywords headphone   case qid            ref  sr     s musical instruments sr     which fits the headphones perfectly  in short  i recommend these for any music lover of any genre  you really can t go wrong with these      
142,5.0,                       for the time that i have used these ath m   headphones ive been impressed  i wont give a complete breakdown of various frequency responses  ill comment based on a project studio level user  they are comfortable  very adjustable with many points of rotation and adjustment   i wear them in studio sessions for hours without fatigue  they come with a cool bag and various cables of different styles  curly  straight  short  long   these options are great  the headphones are quality construction  feel like pro headphones  as far as sound goes  they get the job done  i m currently using them  at night  to do mix downs and a   song ep  when i take them off after mixing and play back listen through my tascam near field monitors  i notice no difference between the two this is perfect because it allows me to mix and listen while others are sleeping  very happy  very satisfied  great product      
143,3.0,                       for almost      it s just not worth it  they are very uncomfortable and with prolonged use can cause pain around the ears  if i m not listening to something at all times while using them  an obnoxious rattling sound can be heard  the sound is fine but absolutely not what you would expect for     dollars  the only positive is the battery life  which is very impressive  i would suggest you save up for something better or just buy cheap earbuds headphones  i honestly prefer my     bluetooth ear buds to these      
144,3.0,                       i m a fan of audio technica s headphones in general    i own two of this model  their audio quality is top notch for the price  you can listen to anything from music to amateur podcasts with these  there s no gimmicks like overblown bass or the tinny sounds of cheap headphones but the ath m  x has a major design flaw  without even trying you can snap back the spring loaded hinge that holds the headphone against your hear  this hinge is the one built into the silver bit on either side that says l and r  left and right  respectively  a quick google search reveals many others with this problem  and just as many solutions  rubber bands  glue   d printed fixes  etc  while i haven t gone quite as far as  d printing anything  none of the simpler solutions work terribly well to fix the hinge once it s been over extended  it s a shame because these headphones are otherwise built to last with many of the parts including the wire and the pads easily replaceable once they re worn out or lost so i m giving the ath m  x a three out of five stars simply because the poorly designed hinge component doesn t live up to the quality i d expect from audio technica      
145,4.0,this is going to be a long review  so try to hang in there and read to the end  i promise it s worth it   alright  so chances are  you re looking at buying the audio technica ath m  x most likely because of one of three reasons  a friend that has never listened to genuinely good headphones before is telling you that these are way better than beats by dre  a youtuber told you that these are way better than beats by dre and most other consumer grade headphones  or because you need a pair of headphones for audio monitoring  i d say almost     of people aren t buying the m  x for that last reason  which is the main problem here  not so much the headphones themselves  but the reason people are buying them   countless amounts of people spend the majority of their lives listening to music with headphones and earbuds that are either cheap  tinny sounding trash or overpriced  consumer grade  fashion cans  with overpowering bass  so it s only natural that when you go from something like that to something like the m  x which has waaaay more detail and clarity  you re going to think they re the bee s knees and that they knock everything else on the shelf at your local electronics store out of the ballpark  and for the most part  that s very true  the m  x have been regarded by many as the  beats killers   and this is also true  they have better sound quality than even the most expensive beats headphones  for around half the price  these headphones get compared to beats quite a lot  if you haven t already figured it out   but  there is unnecessary hype surrounding these headphones that has been built up by various people on youtube who recommend these headphones for everyday use and gaming   so here s the deal  i don t dislike the m  x  i respect the m  x for their original  intended purpose  audio monitoring  if you don t know what monitoring is  in simple terms  it is listening to audio recordings and analyzing them  in order to effectively do this  you need a pair of monitor headphones or monitor speakers that playback music with as much detail as possible   so while these are indeed very good headphones for monitoring  they have several very important flaws that make them impractical for casual listening  i m going to break things down into   main categories  build  comfort and sound   build   build quality on the m  x is  for the most part  no issue here  the plastic feels sturdy and fairly thick  and the headband is metal  leading to an overall robust feeling headphone that won t break unless you really try to  they fold up and the ear cups flip all the way backwards  so portability is very good  they also have a detachable cable which is great for portability  the fake leather on the headband and ear pads feel soft  but a bit cheap  nothing deal breaking for the price  in my opinion  but later on  the corners cut on the quality of the fake leather will bite you in the back when the pads and or headband start flaking  the pads can be easily replaced  however  overall  solid build quality but nothing amazing   comfort   if you re anything like me and most audiophiles  you ll refuse to wear a pair of headphones that bother or hurt your ears  no matter how good the sound quality is  the m  x aren t super uncomfortable  but they re nothing close to being the absolute most comfortable  anyone who says the m  x are  super comfy  have probably been wearing concrete on their ears until they bought these  for a lot of people  the main reason these are uncomfortable are the cheap  poorly made ear pads  as mentioned in the build quality  they re made of a fake leather  which isn t a big deal  but the padding inside of them is  in my opinion  unacceptable  it s a cheap foam that has very little density to it  the second reason  which can fortunately be fixed for the most part  is the clamping force these have on your ears  when i first used these  the clamp wasn t terrible  but after    minutes of listening my ears starting hurting  also due to the bad ear pads  you should be able to fix this by stretching them across the box they came in and letting them sit there overnight  maybe a bit longer  this helped enough to relieve the clamp a fair amount for me   comfort can be improved a ton by buying different ear pads  however  doing this will affect sound quality  usually for the worst  more on that in the sound section  overall they aren t exactly comfortable  but these headphones shouldn t be used for long listening sessions anyways  which leads us to      sound   how to describe the sound in simple terms  clear  detailed  accurate  but also harsh  fatiguing  and narrow  do these sound better than all beats by dre headphones  yes  not by an unbelievable amount  though  you won t have a life changing experience just from switching to the m  x if a pair of beats studio or solo were your previous  best  listening experience  bass is cleaner and less emphasized  which to extreme bass heads  people who absolutely crave bass in headphones  may be disappointing  but this doesn t mean the bass is bad  bass does get deep  but it can be a bit  muddy  at times  meaning that it isn t very tight feeling  i know  these terms might not make much sense  google them up  you might find a much better explanation than what i can give    mid range frequencies  think vocals and string instruments as well as most wind instruments  are there and can be heard fine  but aren t exactly up at the front of the stage like the bass and highs are  you might have even heard someone already say that the m  x have a recessed mid range  and this is true   now the high end frequencies  think high pitched  sibilant vocals and instruments like flutes and cymbals  as well as higher pitched chords from acoustic guitars   this is where the m  x stop being a casual listening or  fun  headphone  the highs are upfront and detailed  which can be good for the purpose of monitoring  but they re so heavily emphasized that it makes listening at high volumes uncomfortable and fatiguing  some people like for headphones to have this even when casually listening  but the majority of people will eventually find it uncomfortable and not very relaxing   finally the soundstage and imaging  soundstage  how big the area of the audio sounds  if every sound seems like it s very close to your head and not further away  that s narrow soundstage  if it sounds like you re in a big room or a theater  that s wide soundstage  imaging  how accurate the placement of sounds are within the soundstage  if you feel like you can hear almost exactly where that sound is coming from  that s great imaging   soundstage is almost non existant  it exists  but it s pretty narrow  everything sounds right up against your head  however  the imaging is decent  i could usually tell pretty accurately what direction sounds are coming from   so the sound of the m  x is where the fun  casual listening experience gets cut short  yes  they are very detailed  yes  the clarity is exceptional  but the highs and sometimes muddy bass  especially the highs  can make relaxed listening very difficult   it boils down to this  the build quality of the m  x is good and they re very portable  but the comfort falls short of other similarly priced  and even lower priced  headphones and the sound quality is not suitable for listening to music for pure enjoyment  audio technica themselves  for some reason  claim  casual listening  as a selling point for this headphone compared to the other headphones in the m series  which is silly and goes to show that they re trying to profit from all the unnecessary hype about these headphones  shun me if you want  but if you do some more research about these  it s blatantly obvious  but once again  like i said  i respect these headphones and they are good  just not for the reason people are led to believe   alternatives   if you truly want a pair of good  portable pair  most are portable  headphones meant for causal  fun  enjoyable listening  then check out these headphones i ve either personally used or have owned myself  there are more out there than these  but here is a short list to get you started  happy researching   sony mdr  a  great headphones for portable  everyday use  build quality is excellent  comfort is on point and they sound warm and relaxing  but definitely not dull or boring  they do however  cost a little bit more than the m  x  nowadays around      brand new  the price jump is worth it though   bose soundtrue ae   good portable headphones  comfort is outstanding  they re lightweight and are easy to forget about when you wear them  build quality is good and sound is relaxed but can still be fun when the volume is cranked up  as of this review  they are on sale for      on amazon  you can find a used pair for even less  not on sale they re      which is a bit pricey but still in my opinion  worth it   beyerdynamic dt      ohm  an overall great pair of headphones for both casual listening and even professional use  build quality and comfort are on point  and sound quality is like the m  x  but honestly  better  however  the cable isn t detachable and they don t fold up  so they aren t exactly portable  these can be found for around       sometimes less  definitely less if you buy them used   status audio cb    these are basically half the price of the m  x  but have more enjoyable sound  plenty of bass    and are more comfortable  build quality is questionable  though  so don t be rough with them  and if you have a very large head  they may not fit snug on your head because of light clamping force   b o play h   these are more expensive than the m  x  especially the  nd generation which start at around       but the build is great  they re very comfortable  look fantastic  and have a clear  warm  inviting sound that s fun to listen to   philips shp      right now  these only cost around     or less  and they re fantastic  build is good  comfort is fantastic and the sound is spacious and wonderfully pleasant  however  these are open back headphones  which means that sound will leak  if you re listening at normal or loud volumes especially  other people around you will hear your music  but if this isn t a concern or you re going to be using your headphones mostly at home  definitely go ahead and get these   audio technica m  x  this is the little brother of the m  x that nobody cares about for some reason  even though they re way better suited for casual or fun listening  build is good like the m  x  comfort is pretty much the same  but changing the pads to something like the brainwavz hm  angled leather pads would make them excellent  and doesn t negatively affect the sound  pads other than these may affect the sound   sound is more neutral than the m  x  the bass and highs aren t emphasized  but they re still great  also they cost only        hifiman edition s  a comfortable  well built portable headphone that sounds great  and actually has the ability to switch between being open back and closed back  open backed headphones usually sound better    also on sale for      right now  a great deal   if you managed to read through all that  thank you for actually taking the time to do so 
146,3.0,                       i ve been using it for a month now so i can finally make this review the mids are bad and i needed to use equalizer apo to fully enjoy this headset however it is not comfortable i can t have it on my head for more than an hour   it just hurts aesthetic wise it does look really slick but other than that i d recommend you spending your money somewhere else      
147,3.0,                       the comfort and quality for these headphones are amazing  i ve tried a couple of over the ear headphones and this one is the most comfortable for medium sized ears  i m no audiophile but the quality is as good as many of the reviews make it out to be and compared to the microsoft surface headphones  they are noticeably better  the one main issue i have with these headphones is its bluetooth feature  usually  once my bluetooth speakers or earbuds connect to my pc  i can play from any source at the same time or switch between the sources without the secondary source being muted  these headphones however do that  if i were to play a game such as league of legends and watch a youtube video while in loading screen and swap back  all my audio for the game is muted  the only way i can get the audio back is by restarting the game  another example is if i m editing music on fl studio    and then play a youtube video  the youtube video is now permanently muted until i close out of fl studio  i never had this issue if i m connected to my pc via the wire provided in the package  but i primarily purchased these over the older m  x because of the bluetooth feature  it s very frustrating to constantly be cautious about what i play because i can potentially mute an application entirely  i attempted to update the firmware but my firmware update always fails to go through  i follow all the steps that the audio technica app gives me to the t and i still cannot seem to successfully update the firmware  this is really disappointing that the bluetooth on this headphone sucks because of how amazing the sound quality and comfort is  the sheer amount of inconveniences i go through and the amount of changes i had to make on my everyday workflow in order to work around this bluetooth issue is very annoying  the only reason i have yet to return them is because of how amazing they are  besides the bluetooth  please fix it or if it has been fixed with the firmware update  fix the app because the app is the only way to update its firmware  i ve checked on many online forums on how to update the firmware and the app seems to be the only solution  if this one issue is fixed  i d say this is the best bang for your buck wireless studio headphones on the market     
148,4.0,                       short  i think at this price point  you cannot go wrong  for gaming  studio  or personal   if you set yourself up with things like a physical eq that plugs in to your computer  with some very much needed headband cushions  velcro  you re good to go in terms of sound quality  if youre on a desktop  it should be a sin to not have some sort of eq or amp or whatever  if youre doing something more simple like listening through your phone  i dont think i have much to complain about my sorrow mostly is in terms of comfort  as my scalp now feels like its lost blood circulation and every time i try to put them back on its like im getting blown out of an airlock  buy yourself some  headband cushions  along with these with some velcro and you ll be set  do not forget about an eq if you want some decent bass and things of that nature  as that is one thing i very happy about  as these can punch some great kicks in songs the quality is great  packaging  and other toys provided are also great  be careful with the wires though  they sort of last as long as the apple ones do and the earmuffs may need to be replaces every   years or so  they also look great      
149,5.0,                       the sound quality of these headphones is astonishing  i ve spent the last few years buying    dollar headphones and never really found any i was happy with long term  these headphones change everything  and i am so happy i coughed up the extra dough to buy these pros sound good on a phone these headphone are the first full size cans i ve owned that actually sound excellent when played through something like a phone  with previous cans i always craved more bass when playing through my phone  and smaller earphones were the only ones sensitive enough to provide that  but these cans solve the problem in two ways     detailed  accurate sound makes everything sound clean and wonderful including the bass allowing me to run these at much lower volume and be completely satisfied     these have very high sensitivity allowing them to produce the same perceived volume as earphones when set to the same setting on my phone another benefit of these cans is they are tuned perfectly  to my tastes  for music listening  which means eq adjustments are not needed  the bass and treble are boosted just enough for music listening while still maintaining a very balanced sound across the board  this is in contrast to some cans which may provide a very flat even sound across the frequency range  but the lack of bass and treble make eq adjustments necessary for the best music listening enjoyment  since i plan to use these with all my devices including some which have very limited zero eq options  this is a huge plus for me very good build quality the pictures do not do these cans justice  very high quality feel to them with a little bit of heft to them  these cans feel very solid and i am confident they will last  i love the low key understated design  not flashy and no glossy surfaces  i was worried that the use of plastic would make these feel cheap  but that is not the case at all very comfortable the articulation on the ear cups on these is perfect  the tightness of the headband is just enough to provide great sound isolation without being uncomfortable cons would have liked to seen standard     jacks on the headphone  unfortunately it looks like you will be stuck using the cables included with the headphones as these are not compatible with standard     male to male cables  with that said  having   cable options included is awesome and they feel like durable cables  time will tell  overall i am thrilled with these headphones and recommend them to anyone looking at full size cans  if you can t afford these now  it is worth the wait to save up and buy these  as these sound so much better than cheaper cans and i suspect they will last much longer too      
150,3.0,                       great sound quality and amazing battery life  i have a   hour round trip commute everyday and i have only charged it after   weeks of use and even then it wasn t low on battery i will say the bluetooth is a little odd in the sense that when it s not playing music it will go into like a sleep mode where it ll take a second for the sound to kick back on when you start playing something from your phone  and sometimes it doesn t kick back on when you re going through something like instagram where a lot of short videos with sound are starting and stopping as you scroll  and it gets confused sometime when switching from one app playing sound to another  annoying quirk from expensive headphones but the for the sole purpose of listening to music it serves its purpose well though it is good to note that there is absolutely no noise cancelling  you ll hear everything unless you turn your music up loud  if you re bothered by ambient noise on the train then these aren t for you most likely      
151,3.0,                       before i comment  i want to mention that these headphones are pretty good for people who prefer clarity over bass  if you re expecting these headphones to have decent bass  you ll be disappointed  i returned these simply because i felt they did not have enough bass at all  the music i listened to felt like it needed something  it didn t make much of a difference to the songs i listened to compared to other headphones  it s very comfortable though  not sure why people are complaining about the comfort  they all must have insanely large heads because these are the most comfortable pair of headphones i ve ever owned  they feel like a pillow is resting on my head so other than that  these headphones are pretty good for the price  but if you re expecting bass  look elsewhere      
152,5.0,                       based on   days of using these  this was one of the best purchases i have made in years music is just clearer  i m noticing things in songs i ve listened to for years that i didn t hear before  my ears have been getting a steady stream of pink floyd  aphex twin  miles davis  and radiohead  and i feel more immersed in the music than ever before they are great for video gaming too  my friends on call of duty say its much easier to hear me  and i can say the same for their voice and the sounds of the game the ability of these to instantly switch between a wired connection and bluetooth wireless is another huge plus for these  they have a play pause  and volume buttons on the unit for convenience  but they are sleek and not obvious  keeping the clean no frills aesthetic that at is known for   stars  will be recommending to anyone with ears      
153,5.0,                       i bought these because i needed an upgrade to my previous studio headphones   i wanted to spend a bit  but not too much without sacrificing quality   read reviews on multiple pairs of different brands  and when i found these i ordered them immediately   the sound quality is great  and they are incredibly comfortable   i took them on deployment with me and they did a great job for my mobile studio   if you re looking for some good studio headphones that cost less than most big name brands  look no further      
154,5.0,                       i loved my first pair so much i had to buy a second for home use  they re great quality  feel nice  i can wear them for extended amounts of time  they have some low frequency response that is great for listening to music and playing games  these aren t studio reference headphones  but i do use them to mix master music and it s close enough to what i need  as i m not in the recording studio world  just live audio  if you want to hear clean audio  these are your headphones  they re not noise cancelling  but with enough volume on anything  it s possible  but that s not a huge issue for me personally      
155,5.0,                       i make experimental digital  algorithmic music  and have needed an accurate set of headphones that doesn t boost bass  this set of headphones more than met my expectations  details came through brilliantly  mud introduced by previous pop enhancing headphones disappeared  and they fit over my giant old man s ears  the padded headband feels comfortable for hours on my old man s bald head  couldn t be happier      
156,5.0,                       received my refurbished ath m  x in excellent condition with all cables and papers   everything looks to be in brand new condition as for the sound  it does get a little bass heavy with newer music   but  it is really good for music that does not have much bass   here is my take with the ath m  x and the ath m  x  yes  i own this too  the ath m  x sounds more musical with the highs being crisp and more present   the lows have a kick with the sub bass  and this sounds good with music that lacks bass   music with bass may become slightly enhanced   the mid range is present with no distortion   it s like sitting in a small jazz club  very intimate with making the music fuller and alive   i think most will want this sound as compared to the ath m  x the ath m  x sounds much more flat and may be better suited for audio monitoring   the mid range is slightly more up front   the bass and highs are very present and detailed  with no distortion   you can listen to this for hours as the sound is not driving   it s like sitting in an concert theater at about the   th row   very enjoyable   people that do not care for too much low bass will love this cans very happy to get the refurbished ath m  x here  as i was tired of playing the ebay auction for used cans  where some looked quite used    both of my ath m  x adn ath m  x are keepers   including my grado sr          
157,5.0,                       these headphones are great for the home studio  plugged directly into your audio interface or mixer  for monitoring your sound creations   also for the price  i have not used the bluetooth yet  i have had beats  they are good  but these are great once you get used to the audio range  bass is not over the top but adequate  mid range and treble are on par also  would i purchase another pair of beats  maybe  would i purchase another pair of these  definitely      
158,5.0,                       decided to take a risk  i own  including this pair     headphones   one is  a standard bose ae  that i had for over   years  still works like a charm  and i use those for the gym  next is another pair of bose that replaced the ae  s and they are known as sound true  i use those interchangeably  gym and for work   then i decided to step up to the noise cancelling wireless headphones and went with sennheiser  bt      noise cancelling  at the time i got my sennheiser headphones   bose was dropping in the qc department and at that point  i refused to pay what they were asking  and their new products have the entire alexa nonsense and that is not the point of having headphones if you are really an audiophile   so  in the case of the sennheiser headphones   it did the job sound wise  i have certain tracks that i use as a litmus test those tracks passed  as for the wireless feature  just like any wireless product   it is going to be spotty or laggy pending what  you are around  that feature i did not care for too much  if i am sitting and utilizing the wireless feature   solid no issues of course   the issue i ran into the sennheiser s was more of a comfort thing  the ear cups does  not fully cover my ears and it became uncomfortable after so many hours  i will say i had them for a year and a couple months  every now and then i would do some research to see what is out there in the audio world  i would never purchase beats  sony  jabra  bose or any major brand at this point because the risk is too high  so  in the case of the brand audio technica  i knew of them since many professional musicians  or dj s would utilize this particular brand  did some digging on the product and took a chance   they came in today and they do have a wireless feature  but that is not a priority for me  more of an afterthought at this point  the headphones are extremely comfortable and super light  the sound quality is astronomical and the headphones provided a different musical effect for me  i was able to listen to various tracks of different genres for a good minute to see the capabilities of what the headphones can do  man  as an audiophile   i am a happy camper     this will be the only brand i would purchase for now on  anyone who is an audiophile  will not be disappointed at all      
159,5.0,                       okay  if you re a audiophile like me  but do not have the money to spend ludicrous amounts of it for headphones    these are the headphones for you  but  with that being said  do not think the price compromises the quality of these headphones  the clarity of these headphones is perfect for mixing music or just relaxing at home jamming i read plenty of reviews before purchasing these and i read that they were lacking presence in the low end  but i have to disagree  if you truly enjoy music in it s entirety  highs  mids  and lows  these will give you that and won t drown everything else with head thumping bass  the lows are there and it does offer some good thumping  but just not over exaggerated like beats  honestly  these headphones are like having studio monitors on your ears so if that doesn t say anything than i don t know what will  just trust me and the thousands of other reviews on here  check out already  happy amazon shopping      
160,4.0,                       if you are a fan of the audio technica  ath m  x wired version of these headphones  you will appreciate the sound from these as they are pretty much identical except for having bluetooth pros  can attach a wire with a mic and use like a regular headset or as a backup if the battery goes out  which is very useful  solid build  classic sound with deep bass and performance at a reasonable price   i got it on sale   battery life is excellent as it will last for days with moderate use cons  bluetooth connection was sometimes finicky  had to use switch twice to get it to respond at times  same thing for the  touch  control feature on the ear cup  feedback was hard to tell if you pressed it properly  slight static popping and ear pressure feels heavier than wired version  i have both    hence  it was somewhat fatiguing for long term use  you can use a mic built in instead of the wired one  but the sound quality drops a lot and in a noisy room your caller will have a hard time hearing you although it seems like more cons than pros  i think this is a good buy  especially if you prefer over the ear vs  ear buds  but not perfect      
161,5.0,                       i can t say anything bad about these headphones  the sound from them is superb  they are a closed ear design and the ear cups make a good seal around your ears  creating an excellent basis for sound  in a normal situation  there is no need for noise cancellation  the sound isolation is so good  i can hear myself breathing or even the beating of my heart or movements of neck joints   these are all internal conductive sounds you would not normally be able to hear unless your ears were totally isolated from the outside world frequency response is excellent for all ranges  everything i ve listened to with any other headphones pales in comparison to these  it s like listening to everything you have ever heard anew      
162,4.0,                       i initially had a pair of beats studio headphones that broke on the right side of the headband  and while i m not on the hate train that some audiophiles tend to be towards them  i can t justify paying      even with the sale price that i initially bought them for  however  if there s anything that makes them remotely worth their price point  is the technology of their connectivity  i get that they use proprietary software but i ve never ran into any issues of interference that most other bluetooth headphones run into  so finding headphones that connect to my mac relatively well is important to me  these do that for the most part for starters  you don t have to get into any pairing mode  just flick the switch on and have bluetooth enabled on your mac and it should recognize and connect to it  the only latency issue i ve encountered is that the audio doesn t immediately start to play from the start of a video or even when manually starting a track on itunes  but otherwise  the audio is in sync  i don t run into any major interference  i once tried these bluetooth skullcandy headphones and just turning on the faucet would cause the sound to cut in and out   can t really speak on the range but i do feel like i got a slightly better range distance with the beats studio  the battery life is pretty good for bluetooth headphones but not quite as good as the beats were  if you kept the anc off  and while it doesn t have any real noise cancellation  it does seal off outside noises pretty damn well  in fact  if it did come with anc  i m pretty sure the outside sounds would be      cancelled the sound quality on bluetooth sounds pretty similar to being wired  i never owned a pair of the normal m  xs but from what i ve seen read in reviews  it sounds virtually the same  the only major negative i have with the bluetooth is that it doesn t like when you switch from one sound source app to another  for example  if you are playing something in itunes and then try to play a youtube video from your web browser immediately after  it will mute all sounds from your web browser and you ll have to cancel one or even both to get it to play sound again   otherwise the bluetooth connectivity and sound are really good  although  i personally prefer a cleaner  flat sound profile       
163,5.0,                       learning to love my favorite music all over again with these  after years of earbuds and stock car stereo  crisp  precise  undistorted sound  bass volume is inadequate without an amp  but that s to be expected with large drivers  these would be excellent with a dac amp the free downloadable headphone amp equalizer apps work surprisingly well to boost the bass volume even over the bluetooth attachment  though at a loss of max total volume  which is too loud for me anyways  there is a barely noticeable loss of sound quality over bluetooth  but it isn t bad at all love the simple sheet metal band wrapped in soft material  easy to adjust the amount of pressure they put on your head by and find what s the most comfortable  just gently bend it with your fingers so it makes a wider arc      
164,3.0,                       really awesome sound quality  comfortable too  but takes some break in time to get them comfortable  quite tight on the head  but if you stretch them out  they eventually loosen up update edit  after having these for   months  they are still quite tight on the head  breaking them in by stretching them out yourself helps  but these are still really uncomfortable to wear for longer than an hour great sound quality for the price  but they give me a headache with how much they grip on my head  going to sell these and find something else  that provides the same quality but is easy and comfortable to wear      
165,5.0,                    creo que ya esta dicho todo  a este precio no encontraras nada mejor  estos se comparan con aud fonos de     dolares o mas  he escuchado aud fonos mas caros y estos les ganan de largo  son grandes  toscos  dicen que fr giles por eso los trato con mucho cuidado y hasta ahora todo bien   meses de uso frecuente  le pondr a   estrellas y medio a la cancelaci n de ruido  aunque no cancelan al      es mas que suficiente lo que cancelan  en mi trabajo debo estar atento si me llaman por tel fono y de fondo escucho el timbre del tel fono as  es que en ese caso agradezco que no sean      de cancelaci n de ruido porque si lo fueran no me los podr a poner en el trabajo y trabajo en la madrugada la paso escuchando m sica toda la noche  buen producto muy buen sonido      recomendado         
166,4.0,                       solid pair of phones  epic battery life  when i first got these i charged them fully once and didnt have to charge them again until   days later and i used them pretty heavily each day and it still had juice to keep going  i did notice when the battery was really low the volume drops off slightly and bt connectivity begins to degrade slightly also  wish it performed just a little bit better with sound quality and loudness  feels like i want to turn it up   or   more notches and can sound a bit rough without a customizable eq  bass is pretty decent and clean however my ear wants it to be just a little louder than the maxed out setting on some tracks  all that said  battery life alone make these a sweet setup and the aesthetic aint bad neither      
167,5.0,                       as the title says  i m not an audio snob  but i like quality music  these are the best headphones i own  now  just for reference  about       is about the most i d spend on headphones  but  these are everything i need them to be  i don t play my music at skull rattling volume  i like it loud enough to clearly hear the texture of the music  i like balanced and clear bass  mids  and highs  i get this with these headphones  i can turn music up reasonably loud  and just enjoy it  note  if you test headphones with youtube or something like pandora  that s not an extremely high fidelity source  usually  playing a cd would be better  in particular  most streaming music is missing much of the high frequency range  so  if you cannot clearly hear cymbals  chimes  and snare drums  or the overtones of a performance on a harp or violin  maybe the source isn t giving you that sound  even if the headphones can do so  note that these headphones  as designed  have an accentuated bass response  some people call it punchy  some people like that  also  the factory earpads are not the most comfortable  they are ok but not great  therefore  i m using brainwavz replacement memory foam earpads for large over the ear headphones  those work fine  and are very comfortable  they also change the sound response slightly  reducing the bass just a bit  so  for me  it s more balanced and transparent  which is how i like it  one more thing  these have closed backs and are over the ear  so  they have some natural passive  not active  noise prevention  that works great in a quiet room  i plan to try it on an airplane  but have not done so yet  other commenters say that works  so  overall  i really like these headphones and strongly recommend them  ron     
168,1.0,                       i ve had them for a little over a month  everything was great until yesterday  the return window ended   days ago  and now there is a whining sound coming from the left ear  tried different dacs and cables and still the sound persists  its really unfortunate cause i liked them      
169,5.0,                       i m a musician and do home recording and thought it was about time to replace my many years old sony mdr v  phones i never paid this much for cans but i must say they are worth every penny first  i listened to a kat edmonson album which are not over produced and meticulously engineered  it was like hearing them for the first time  i was very impressed then  i did a piano track to an original composition i d been working on  these phones will definitely the recording pricess i had them on for about an hour and found them to be light and comfortable  maybe more so than the old sonys  i was shocked that they fit my head right ootb   no adjustment required  of course all heads and ears are different so ymmv i also like the way the cable is detachable and those additional cables included are a nice touch i got these for recording purposes and will not use them for mobile applications  i think eer buds are a better choice for that      
170,5.0,                       i am totally amazed at how old these are  beyond the cosmetic changes  they feel  look and sound like i only bought them last year  it is hard to describe what a good product this is  it is clearly durable  my daily workhorse  i use these headphones every day from sun up to sun down  except when i am at the gym   they come with a leather storage bag  but i never use that thing  each day these get rolled up and chucked into my carry bag on my way home from the office  and it stays there until the next morning when they re emerge for a new day  there is something lovely about a pair of phones which have been sat on  banged up  thrown around  treated with complete abandon  and yet  keep going with little evidence of that damage  this alone makes it something worth looking at but then the sound quality is top notch  it is not as bass heavy as the beats headsets  but it is far more versatile  it easily does a good job of most genres  jazz  hip hop  r b  house are some of my favourites   they are great for the office because the sound leakage is limited  at the prices you get these for  i doubt that you can get anything better check out these pictures  you can see that the headphones have aged  but they do the job  and i still love them  these are my first audit technica purchases of any sort  but they ve found a life long customer  and fan  in me  this level of engineering quality  and at these prices  is almost impossible to find these days  did i say fan  no  a stan    januray       see updated pictures over   years later  the faux leather is completely worn but the cushion is still soft and does a decent job of isolating the noise  the sound is good as ever  i use these everyday and they work like they did on the first day  buy these immediately      
171,3.0,                       these headphones are amazing  they have great definition and bass but the one gripe i have about these is the imbalance in volume between the two sides  it s the smallest difference  most noticeable when the output is turned down very low  the left ear cup is slightly louder than the right  i produce music and was attracted to these headphones because of that  this issue is detrimental when it comes to layering instruments and vocals  no matter what software you use  overall i love and recommend these headphones but wish there was more consistency and i didn t have to send them back  deal with amazons system  and wait a week before going back to my creative work      
172,5.0,                       these babies look great i would only say that these are not what i expected for the cost i paid for them  i ended up returning them and getting me some bose comfortsound see  i initially thought these were going to be good enough for working out  but they re more for indoors cause they kept falling off my head and plus  that bass was lacking in my opinion i won t take stars off though cause they re still great for someone looking to use them indoors  sound isn t impressive though btw  now also take note that i just used my smartphone  s   with high quality pandora music  which isn t exactly a way to get the best sound out of your phone anyway  for anyone wanting gym headphones those  bose ones though  are bad ass    definitely worth the extra bill      
173,4.0,                       these are great quality and  deliver great sound at a great price   they feel very high end  i would give it five stars but they do get uncomfortable after awhile  it is as if the cups are not deep enough  i can feel the the driver pushing on my ears  the part that is very frustrating is i have used these for about a week everyday thinking i d get used to it but it has had an unexpected effect   my left ear feels like it s being folded or has pressure on it even when i m not wearing the earphones   i feel it all day long   so i may be returning these and hoping that sensation wears off  i hate feeling like returning them because  they are so nice  but that sensation concerns me especially if it doesn t go away      
174,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          everything was perfect with the headphones i already have a pair of black ones and decided it to get the blue black for dj use at places since they are more eye catching  sadly today after   days the left side stop working while listening to music  customer support was helpful i ll get a brand new replacement by tomorrow  i ll still give it   stars i just probably got a defective pair let s hope this is not common otherwise i ll lower my rating and request a refund      
175,4.0,                       maybe it s from spending a lot of time listening to my sennheisers  but these sounded very  hot    particularly from cymbals   other higher pitched instruments   way better when listening to older recordings  read    s     s   and i suspect that given decent eq control might really helpful   this is from listening to them on day     i m guessing that a few weeks of break in might also improve things      star for the sweat inducing vinyl ear pads      
176,3.0,                       don t get me wrong  they sound great  audio quality is very good in my humble opinion  easy to use and the cushions are fantastically soft the issue i have with them is i found them on a list of  headphones good for large ears   they are not  i have both large ears and my ears poke almost straight off the side of my head  the pads are not large enough to be over ear headphones for someone resembling a chimpanzee like me  while the cushion is soft  it still hurts my ears after about an hour of use i m sure these are fantastic for most costumers  but not for the large eared variety of headphone users      
177,5.0,                       use these at work for hours on end   best headphones i ve ever owned   comfortable   tight  but not too tight on the head   i have some hearing loss in one ear but even with that  i can hear things with these cans that i ve never heard before in my music collection using other headphones before buying these  i would never have paid full price for them   waited to buy them on sale   after owning them for a while  i now think they absolutely are worth the original price   i have no reservations about recommending them even at that price   fortunately  these go on sale often enough that you may not have to pay full price if you can afford to wait a bit      
178,4.0,                       moving from my ath m  x to this mostly for bt and battery life  the sound is just as good to my ear  the battery is tremendous  and it s nearly perfect the two drawbacks with this headset is the new connector  it s not as secure as the old ath m  x connector and the only included cable is really short  this is fine if you have a dac or extender with a longer cable but it s annoying to pick this up and not receive the same wonderful assortment of cables that came with the ath m  x the other drawback is the stock ear cups  they are something that you would want to look at changing out as the stock ones are shallow  all in all i m quite happy  just little complaints that i hope they consider when making a future revision      
179,5.0,                       i bought these headphones as a replacement pair  i must say that i do love these headphones  they come with   different cords which you can connect to the headphones  i use the coil cord with them due to being in broadcasting recording  they have a very deep  rich sound with good highs and nice bass  one of the things that i do like most about them is they fit very snugly over your ears to prevent feed back from the microphone  the color that i picked  the dark green with the brown headband  really is a nice looking pair of headphones  they do come  like i said with   different cords and also a carry bag  the cord disconnects from them and the headphones do fold up so you can carry them in the bag  i would totally recommend these headphones not only for the looks  but for the great sound they produce      
180,3.0,                       i ve had all kinds of headsets ranging from     to        sound  clarity  and value is what i care about the most  brand and who is paid to promote them has no effect on my evaluation the higher price products i expect better quality   i don t recommend sets in the     to     priced range as i ve never found anything decent   they re just horrible all categories   price might seem good but you re going to be buying replacements when they stop working which will add up   sets that s     and up are so much better this audio tech set that s         should cost around     to      it s a total a rip off in the current price range   because of the price i would not recommend them to anyone it s like chevy trying to price a fully loading  dr impala to the  dr bmw m  sedan  i like both cars but would never recommend the impala if the price was the same as the m  pass on audio tech and get something in the     to     where those sets are of the same quality or stay in the same price range and get something better don t listen to those youtubers and streamers that are paid to promote audio tech   if another brand paid them more they d switch will tell you to buy that  some will purposely show off the name brand of what they use instead of saying it  visual promotions      
181,5.0,                       i got these as a birthday gift after hearing how great they were for years  i was not disappointed  they sound so rich and full with deep bass  without going overboard  and full mids and highs to match  my only problem has been some discoloration on the earcups after letting my nephew wear them on a road trip  he s   and dirty lol   if that s something you re worried about get the black ones  you d be hard pressed to find a competing quality pair of headphones for this price        would recommend      
182,5.0,                       most who buy these do so after reading articles and reviews online  often compared to higher dollar competing brands  i did my research and tried out a couple kinds and these were as good as some twice the price  plus they re durable and i like how they look as well  these put my old beats  they were a gift  so don t attack me  audiophiles  to shame  buy these  the bluetooth version are great and i seemlessly change from my phone to my ipad to my macbook easily with the little app  such a worthwhile upgrade      
183,4.0,                       the overall sound quality and sound stage are good   the highs and mids have solid presentation   the lows are just not there   the passive noise cancellation is very good with a circumaural ear cup the physical comfort is top notch   you can wear these comfortably for a few hours almost forgetting they are there overall these are decent headphones for a clear  crisp sound and solid comfort   using them for gaming and music really helps demonstrate a good product and sound field for comparison  i was a big fan of a classic  solid competitor  mdr  product for years   those had a more balanced overall sound presentation of highs  mids and lows when compared to the ath m  x   i have also tried the most popular  synonym for  pound   product   it had great lows but lacked the solid mids and highs when compared to this product      
184,1.0,                       bought these march      and they didn t even make it a year  my left side has stopped working entirely  i ve tried multiple audio technica cables that lock into the headphones  different sources and the audio will not work in the left ear  i ve also made sure the inside of the headphones had nothing blocking the connection and seems clean in there  bummed because i truly advocated for these headphones but for the price i expected more than a year of use         
185,4.0,                       while these are a great starting semi budget pair for those getting into the headphones enthusiast world  they do have a bit of a v shaped sound signature  lows and highs are raised  and the sound stage is very narrow  sounds centered in head   compared to the m    the pads on the m  x are great and the detachable swappable cables add on a lot of versatility  but the pads are all pleather so some people might have comfort issues from heat or clamping depending on size and shape of head  i highly recommend the brainwavz hybrid memory foam earpads mod as it widens the soundstage  neutralizes the sound signature  and makes the headphones really comfortable  the only reason why i gave it   stars is because it needs this mod      
186,5.0,                       i am absolutely wild about the m   series of headphones  and the m  x did not disappoint  i have also owned the m    so i can offer an intelligent comparison between the two  as far as i can tell  the m  x uses the same well respected and critically acclaimed audio system  audio technica certainly has not changed what has been working well for them however  they have made improvements with the m  x  the cushions are softer  so they are more comfortable and can be worn for long periods  i got a headache after wearing the m   all day at work  but i have no issues with the m  x  the m  x also comes with a detachable audio wire  which is really great  the product comes with three wires  and i ve spread them out  i leave one at work and two are connected at home  so i just have to carry the headphones around  it s easy to insert the wire  just install and twist    degrees to connect it  and the opposite procedure to remove  overall  i really like them  would buy again      
187,5.0,                       there really isn t a lot that i can say about the ath m  x that most others haven t already said  these headphones blew my mind with the fact that they sound as good  if not better than my sennheiser hd     s  i m amazed by the fact that a pair of closed back headphones can be on par with massive  open back headphones  they have the highs and mids you expect from a pair of open back headphones while having all the perks of closed back headphones  there s good bass that isn t too heavy but still has a bit of a kick to it  while the highs and mids are crystal clear  i really never expected such clarity from closed back headphones  the fact that they sound as good as my hd     s  while leaking little to no sound is the point that really wins me over and convinces me to say that these might be my new favorite pair of headphones  the only downside i found in them  after listening to music and podcasts with them for about   or   hours straight  is that the ear pads are a little thin  or they clamp down a little too hard on my head which does cause some discomfort  but then again  not many headphones are still comfortable after the  th or  th hour of use  i found that many people actually snag a pair of brainwavz replacement memory foam earpads to remedy this  which i have done  so i hope that might remedy this minuscule issue  but over all  absolutely worth the money  i don t think i ll ever buy any other closed back headphones  i ll just stick with the ath m  x s for a good long while      
188,4.0,                         months use so far  purchased for      usage i use these headphones for everything  gaming  movies  studying  and anything else you can think of  in all regards  the headphones perform well what you would expect from it s price tag comfort there is never any discomfort on the top of my head no matter the duration these headphones are used  but i d advise anyone to remove them for a few minutes after a couple hours if possible  in my case  i d say my head is on the larger side and extended use never bothers me i advise anyone with a medium to large size ears to purchase alternative ear pads  with the latter being absolutely necessary  if your ears are the medium size  order these and feel them out  if your ears are larger  i heavily advise you add alternative ear pads on your order  adding an approximate     to this particular purchase  continuing  ear discomfort was the only discomfort i noticed  however  the average user will be very happy with these headphones and would be surprised as to how long they can wear them sound extremely clear and balanced  if the music you re listening to has good bass  you ll hear it  if it has good treble  you ll hear it extra value these headphones come with   separate cables  short  long  and coiled  they also come with a travel bag just the right size to hold the headphones and a cable to conclude  the sound  comfort  and extra value in the purchase makes it well worth the price tag  if you opt to buy new ear pads on top of a new pair of these headphones  i d say you ve reached a great value for some good headphones      
189,5.0,                       very comfortable over the head and on the ears  blocks out the vast majority of unwanted noise  i e  dogs  baby  coldplay   and has a decent kick to the bass without being solely focused the low end like beats and its ilk  i ve been using these headphones to livestream with for a couple years now and have never once been tempted to look for anything else  i absolutely love the extra long cable and the fact that it can be removed entirely for proper folding and storage      
190,5.0,                       at first i wanted to cry  worked like a charm but after installing the app i found there was a firmware update available  well it failed installation   times  took hours to redo and i thought my unit would be inoperable  the next day i tried one more time  it worked finally but as i thought  only because i read up on this all night before and followed instructions to the tee this time  it s an awkward means of upgrades with some uncertainty like when to power down the unit  connect to a usb source to reset the device and a few other steps  please read every word before you attempt to hit the restart button on the app after the     point otherwise you ve got some serious fixes to make  audio technica needs to make this more clear as i ve seen tons of posts where other users faced the same problem i did when the update finished and all the problems at the restart phase began  here is where it gets tricky  it s an awesome headphone  my favorite now  i just hope there are no more firmware updates      
191,5.0,                       at first i was skeptical in buying an expensive pair of headphones  i saw how good of reviews this pair got so i thought i d give them a try  now over two years later  using these headphones for almost every single day and with probably months worth of usage  i can see that these were the best investment i have ever made into anything  these reviews don t do its justice for how good these headphones are  they are loud as hell  but they don t hurt my ears  they are of real good quality  i feel like i can easily decipher every individual instrument and all it s intricacies when i listen to heavy metal even through all that distortion  i ve never had an item last for this long  it s of such quality that it feels like the only thing i ve ever wanted to take good care of and after    years and so much usage it has shown very little wear and no deterioration in its sound quality  i highly recommend these headphones to anyone seeking for something different than airpods or regular earpods  these are really just the better way to go if you enjoy listening to music  i feel like they have opened me up to a whole new way of listening  the way that the artists intended their music to be heard      
192,5.0,                       i ve owned the ath m  x  wired  versions of these headphones for a few years and i bought these so that i could listen to my music without being encumbered with a physical connection  these bluetooth headphones are every bit as good as the original non bluetooth versions  i haven t found any latency problems  the sound quality is excellent and better than the beats  monster and bose models that i tried before buying these  i use these only for listening to music and i d recommend these to anyone who wants a great listening experience  i d buy these again in a heartbeat  they ve got good deep bass without sacrificing the treble or voice portions  of your music      
193,4.0,                       i bought these   dj with  needed better over ear isolation when playing in clubs   isolation of these cups is decent  compared to many other headphones i ve tried  these are good sound quality  not tinny shrill on the high end  not muddy on the low end  good overall full sound   they are plastic build  so i ve been trying to baby them and keep them in a case   they come with a couple of different cable lengths   fairly comfortable  i have a large weird shaped head so comfort is always an issue for me with headphones   the cups swivel pivot in all directions as compared to most headphones that only swivel in one direction      
194,5.0,                       honestly love these for a closed back  great for sound quality and use them when editing for gaming though if you are going to be using a headset for coms go with an open back as not being able to hear yourself will feel weird af  you may get used to it  but i didn t and have a separate pair of open back gaming headphones very good noise cancellation      
195,5.0,                       i had a bose qc    that i loved until the battery unexpectedly had a major leak  there was no warning  i just started hearing the popping warning sound of weak battery and when i opened the compartment  there was acid around the battery  that was the end of the headphone  it stopped working altogether  i found out that the warranty of course had expired  also  that these headphones are not repaired  they are precision molded without any screws   but if they are malfunctioning   they replace the whole thing under warranty  i was not about to spend another     plus dollars for something so easily breaking down i kept searching for a long time for a good substitute and based on the excellent reviews i chose this headphone  i love bass  but did not want to be overwhelmed by it  i prefer a balanced sound with just the right touch of everything and this headphone turned out to be an excellent choice  i am not sure if any additional gadgets would be an absolute necessity  bass booster or amplifier   i use it with iphone and my laptop  the sound is excellent  i recommend it without reservation      
196,5.0,                       these are the most expensive and by far the best set of cans i ve ever had listened to   i compared these to sennheiser hd     hyper x cloud ii  jbl  plantronics  and blue branded cans  the prices ranged from         previously i was using monoprice dj style head phones at my desk  for under     they re hard to beat  however  the clamp was a bit tight and the earcups a little small for my ears and caused pain after a few hours the ath m  x has very comfortable earcups and headband  the worn pair i tried were more comfortable than the new ones i got from amazon so i assume they need some breaking in  i wore them for four hours last night and had no problem at all when i did my comparison at the store these were the loudest and most sonically pleasing to me personally compared to even the most expensive pair  i was trying to stay under      but the difference between these and those under      was worth the extra     for me compared to the monoprice pair these blow them away  i don t notice a difference in range but what i do notice is that when the bass hits hard it doesn t muddle the highs and mids which would happen with the monoprice pair   these sound great with or without an eq tl dr  for      you get a pair of cans that is more comfortable and sounds better than many cans at higher prices  compared to the cans in the      and under category  these will make you want to spend more      
197,3.0,                       if you re basing this on pure audio quality these are spectacular  i m not sure how i feel going from open to closed back but the sound signature is undeniably good  along with that it sounds unique  there really is no replicating these headphones  pairing it with a decent dac will also do it wonders  i don t necessarily  see the use in an amp as my onboard audio drove it fine but if you have on available its worth using  now the major con with these headphones are the comfort  its horrendous  nearly unusable  i d get the sudden  overpowering urge to remove these after around    minutes due to the awkward clamping force  the earpads also contribute to this issue as there s not enough cushion thus causing my ear to press up against the driver  a  rd party replacement set of earpads fixed this issue but not without destroying the low end making the experience similar to a gaming headset  modding of the earpads was needed to restore the sound to normal  overall i think these headphones sound great  amazing even  but a product shouldn t need modding to make it shine      
198,5.0,                       i was looking for a set monitor cans for my editing station at home   as well as something that is good for just listening to jams and relaxing   i went on reddit and posted asking what are the best headphones for around        i wanted a closed back so i wouldn t annoy my wife any further from being locked down for so long and something that had the best most accurate sound quality   also wanted them wired so i could plug into an amplifier   response after response the ath m  x kept coming up so i picked up a pair   when they showed up i was impressed with the build quality  yes they are plastic but feel sturdy and no creaking or cracking when twisted   i was a little disappointed that it didn t come with the hard case shown in the pics  it came with a soft bag   now the good part   so i was comparing between my sony s and a couple high end ear buds i was blown away at the clarity and detail from the m  s   they really shine when connected to an amplifier and listening to master tracks on tidal the m  s were just so immersive  you could hear lots of details that i couldn t hear in the other cans   the bass is not overpowering  it s controlled and clean   i found the mids warm and accurate  the highs are little recessed  not tinny or blaring   overall just well balanced   soundstage is there but definitely feels like the music is coming right at you   for      it s a no brainer   you made it this far hooray   bonus tip  the ear pads aren t great  especially if you have larger ears   they aren t the most comfortable for extended listening either   so pick up a pair of brainwavs ear pads  they have a bigger opening and the pad is memory foam so they are super comfortable   basically makes the m  s perfect   cheers      
199,5.0,                       when i got my m  x s i had high hopes cause of all the posative reviews and youtube reviews  i took them out of the box and listened to them and after an hour i was going to return them  cursing all the posative reviews     i had a pair of m  x s for about a week and loved the balanced clean audio but wanted to upgrade cause of the   mm driver size vs the   mm to get more detail and richness that   mm drives just didn t have  i was upset why the m  x sounded terrible  but then i did some research and discovered  burn in time  the audio technica web site says they are good out of the box  other reviews says you do need to burn them in so the sound opens up    i decided what the heck  let s give that a try  over   weeks i let them play music while i was away and listened to them as much as i could and after   weeks the sound has absolutely transformed and opend up     the muddy tone that was drowning the music from my s  had got cleaner   but   it got alot better but they still had too much bass that over powers the clarity and detail  yes it is true  but i found that if i download an eq i can further transform the sound to be more balanced and flatter  i sat side by side with an   x and the m  x and listened to the same song over and over for about an hour or   i got the m  x to match the balance of the m  x by adjusting and reducing the lower frequencies of   hz to    hz  also dropping a little off of the higher frequencies  hz to   hz just a tad according to the picture of the frequency spectrum of the m  x via google images  that flattens out the sound alot and the   mm driver size brings out clarity and detail better than the m  x  so basicly i transformed the m  x into a much better m  x and to me a much better version of the m  x  now i love them and i have the versatility of adding bass back if i want to alot of the negative reviews are people like me just plugging them in and going off of the sound that is already their  with some burn in time and a simple eq download i can quickly and easily make these headphones sound alot more balanced if i want to and get rid of the muddy bass and bring out the clarity alot more  their very good headphones now  my next step is a dac to make them even better  sometimes in life you have to make things work and work at them  you can t expect them to just be perfect right away and give up  hope this helps anyone reading this      
200,4.0,                       i suppose that for the price this set is ok  sound quality is just ok  i would love a deeper bass sound but i guess that does not come with these less expensive headphones  my greatest aggravation is that i can t get more that about    feet from the device i am paired with  the headphones suddenly have static and then cut off  honestly  i should probably send them back but i do use them when i can stay in the living room or kitchen but going about chores throughout the house is not possible  i am surprised at the   star reviews because i don t  hear  the quality that the reviews speak to  i would not buy these again  update  i returned the headphones yesterday  after using a pair of my husband s less expensive set and learning that i could walk throughout the house and onto the deck without them cutting out  i knew that the ath mxbt do not suit my needs      
201,5.0,                       these are great headphones for audio mixing or video editing  i also really enjoy listening to music with them as well  they have a very clean crisp sound to them  really good highs and mids i wouldn t recommend them if you are really into music with big bass  these have more of a punchy bass ergonomically these are the best headphones i could find  i was using the sony mdr      for a long time  but i would always get annoyed with how the coiled cable would tangle up and the exposed wire by the earpiece swivel would always get stuck or damaged  with these you can choose your cable and length  if it gets twisted up you can unplug from the ear piece and quickly untangle it and plug it back in  also there are no wires by the earpiece swivel so you don t have to worry about the wire getting stuck  also the pads over the earpiece last a lot longer than most headphone      
202,5.0,                       these are probably the best pair  of headphones that i ve ever used  i wanted a headset for general use  i play a lot of games on my computer and wanted a headset without a microphone attached to it   i ve wanted these for a few years now and after i started listening to music on my computer again and playing fps games i wanted something more  let me say my favorite things about these headphones is that i feel like i can hear each sound separately while listening to music   i m not sure what the term is but it s pretty amazing and takes music listening to the next level  the sound range is seems very wide and the bass isn t over the top but it s still there when you wanna bump  they re quite comfortable  with sliding adjustments on the side each cup and be     flipped pointing outwards and you can lay them flat on your chest from around your neck so you don t feel like you re choking  they are collapsable for easy transport in the carrying pouch if you re into that  the cord detaches from the headset allowing you to use the    mm  foot cable or the longer one it also has a larger size which i assume plugs into a dac or more serious sound equipment  i don t find them heavy though i ve been used to heavier  gamer  headsets until recently  if you d like a very good review of them by a pro i d want the mkbhd video on youtube about them it s what originally made me want them      
203,5.0,                       i m not a sound buff  but these headphones work for everything i need them for  music listening  watching movies videos  the sound is good and the material on the ear pads is super soft  it comes with a few different cables  which is helpful  especially for travel when you don t need a  ft cord to listen to your phone  overall very happy with the purchase and would recommend      
204,4.0,                       these are the best headphones i ve owned in the last two years hands down  my only problem is the app reads out the wrong battery percentage  currently the app is telling me    remaining and when i check the bluetooth settings that s telling me     which seems more accurate from my last full charge which was three days ago and i use them about six hours a day roughly  actually yesterday i used them for a full twelve hours while the app was telling me    then  the app needs some work but these are awesome to listen too      
205,5.0,                       comfortable  durable  and excellent audio quality  on a scale of         being listening to music through two speakers in an old beater pickup  and    being a perfectly engineered musical auditorium  these are probably a   or      bought these to replace a pair of circa      sony noise canceling headphones where the earpieces disintegrated  and audio stopped working in one earpiece  the at do not noise cancel quite as well as past headphones i ve had  airplane is the test environment  but sound far  far better  glad i went with these over bluetooth  which i was considering the cord is fat  durable  and for a     connection  it is closer to the build of a     guitar musical cable than a     cheap headphone cable  i ve had a lot of headphones earbuds die where the right angle plug loses connectivity inside the cable  and will last a long time  the fact that various cables and a     connector plug is included is impressive worth the price tag  my only complaint is i wish i had these back when i was    years old and spent all my time listening to and playing music      
206,5.0,                       i use to have the sony mdr     professional large diaphragm headphone and while they are great headphones i decided to go with a different set of headphones when they started to degrade  i read over some audiophile forums and the consensus for decent pair of headphones that will not break bank is the audio technica m  x  i decided to trust the forums and the amazon reviews and decided to purchase these headphones the audio technica ath m  x is absolutely amazing  even better than my mdr      not only is it comfortable but the sound is also amazing  i am no audiophile so i cannot comment on lows  mids  highs  etc    but what i can say is that these headphones sound good and they are not expensive either which is the great part i love the removable head jack  it makes traveling with the headphones easy and i can change the cord length depending on how close the device i am trying to use it  i also own another pair of audio technica but the head jack is not removable      
207,5.0,                       look good  sound good   competetively priced for the quality i had a pair of noise canceling bose headphones die on me  their policy  to keep customers spending    with them  is to offer a credit  value varies depending on your model  to send yours in  and get a new pair i was so unimpressed with them that i passed up on a      discount  to still buy the audio technica  and i m so glad i did i wear them primarily for running with and working out in the gym  i don t find them to be overly bulky  heavy or cumbersome at all i m no audiophile who can tell you the subtle differences in quality and depth etc  but i dig these bad boys  and if you are looking for some cans in this price range  these will make you happy      
208,5.0,                       love these   i ve had these headphones now for about a year and they are still going strong   i primarily use these for music on my phone and watching things on the ipad and have no complaints whatsoever   the sound is great   very crisp   i also used them at my old job and would have them on for most of the day  about     hours  and never had any sort of discomfort not much sound leakage on these  but it all depends on how loud you listen   if you have music all the way up  yes  people will be able to hear you a little bit   i would have the volume up a good amount  and wouldn t have any issues   nobody every seems bothered by me at work while these aren t true noise cancelling headphones  they did quite a great job at getting rid of any outside noise   i can barely hear anything other than music when i have these on   that was a big plus for me   i also loved the detachable cable on the m  x  especially for the fact that if i ever need a replacement  it s very easy to get     
209,4.0,                       i picked these up because i wanted to get a more neutral sound when editing videos  as far as sound goes  i can completely understand why so many people like these  they produce a really good amount of sound and not just any sound  a clear and accurate sound  i was also pleasantly surprised at how well these sound when listen to music  you would naturally assume that reference headphones would only be good for editing audio due tot he more neutral sound but that s not the case here  now i won t get into an in depth comparison but i also own the beats studio wireless and these are a bit louder   which is definitely a plus  they are also really comfortable  i ve been able to wear these for   to   hours without any problem  the only negative point for me  which is the reason that i did not rate these   stars  is the build  i really dislike the shinny plastic material  it makes the headphones look cheap  it almost looks like they were spray painted  the ear cups also look painted  from experience  if  this  is the case  this painting style tends to crack over time  i m curious to see how they will fair  with that said  i d definitely recommend these  they perform really well and are among the best at this price      
210,3.0,                       the wireless does resemble the wired in terms of sonic signature  but thats were the similarities end  the wireless don t do a good job at handling treble at higher volumes  don t even think of using the wireless in wired mode  it like listening to a    headphones  it s bad very bad  overall i am actually disappointed with these  if you are looking for good bluetooth headphones with little emphasis on bass without effecting other frequencies i would recommend p  s even though they are      more expensive and are a bit more uncomfortable than m  xbt  they are worth it i completely forgot about the app  it s a joke  i don t even know what purpose the app serves other than collecting your personal information and location information call taking is a mixed experience sometimes its ok sometimes it s not  i wouldn t buy them if one of my check lists had taking calls reguarly on it      
211,5.0,                       these work fantastic for monitoring the voicework i do   i use em for everything else too  gaming  easy listening    they are fine  but they are of course geared to fidelity monitoring  so ofc it doesn t enhance those sounds   they are designed for audio work  not  especially  enjoyment the comfort level of the headband earcups is fine to me  but i m also not too picky   they can be a pinch tight after a long session  but i think the earcups are swappable sold seprately the cord  for this model  is wired to be detachable but more so you can swap it out   they are not wireless   they give you three different styles of cords to use which is cool  but they have a little divot that makes the whole thing slightly proprietary to my understanding   anyway  it s overall way better options than having a irremovable cord  so no sincere complaints overall i d recommend them for amateur level audio professionals   not qualified to say much past that      
212,5.0,                    quiero aclarar que no soy un experto en sonido  ni m sico  ni mucho menos  soy un usuario com n y corriente  uso estos aud fonos para gaming y la verdad es que si pudiera comprarlos de nuevo lo har a he tenido aud fonos sony  mpow  jbl y la verdad es que no tienen comparaci n  los uso por largas horas porque tengo un canal de youtube de videojuegos  lo que implica largas horas de edici n  y grabaci n  son perfectos  tienen una duraci n de bater a excepcional  calidad de sonido incre ble y son muy c modos y est ticos  me encantan         
213,1.0,                       i bought this in hopes to use it with my vr set up on my pc  but  i soon found out that it does not work with windows    it will connect fine as a voice device  but  the sound quality is terrible  as expected for voice only  my other bluetooth devices always show up as three devices  two for voice and one for stereo  this one only  shows as the two voice options when pairing  it will show a ble ath m  xbt in the list of devices  but  the only thing this seems to do is give you a battery percentage will be getting a refund      
214,4.0,                       let s keep this short  the overall quality is good  but there is a little piece near the joint for lateral movements that is quite fragile and prone to breaking if it gets knocked off your desk in a bad position   if this piece breaks  when you put the headset on the ear cup will push outwards  and only the top of the cup will touch your ear   this is quite disappointing  though it may be possible to fix      
215,1.0,                       these get a lot of good reviews   apparently from people who have never heard what good headphones sound like these are all low muffled bass  and some kind of an attempt at clear highs  no mid range  terrible phones  i returned them  i do audio production for a living      
216,5.0,                       thanks to amazon s return policy  i have tried and returned   different pairs of headphones in the past month and i finally got the right ones for my ears   no  they don t have noise cancellation but the separation of bass  mids   highs are fantastic    the bass is not thunderous but not muddy like the other ones i ve tried  the vocals are pure and the treble is crisp and not tingy   i finally said  i do  to a pair of cans and let the music begin      
217,5.0,                       amazing bang for your buck   ik some audiophiles are bitchy and sissys but this headphone is really great and clear especially for the price and the overall quality  i listen to mostly hip hop so there is no hard bass with these but the bass is clear and crisp and now that i have a dac and amp its even better  this is a neutral headphone so anyone expecting any bass boost or soft sound coloring its not for you  it comes with   detachable cables which is great  one is you curled up pc cable and the other one is for your mp  or phone and the third is just straight long cable  the only big con for me is that the ear cushions that they come with are not comfortable at all for long use do i had to get brainwavz hybrid and leather ones which makes them super comfy  so if you want these i recommend getting brainwavz leather ones unless you like the hybrid or the full velour ones      
218,5.0,                       love these headphones  amazing sound quality  i ve read a ton of reviews and watched a lot of youtube videos and some people complain of lack of bass  if they think these are lack of bass  i d really hate to see what they are currently using  there heads must rattle like an old rusted of civic  i feel the bass is perfect  everything is nicely balanced the way music should be  i bought these for gaming but i wanted to see how they sound with music  everything from instrumental to rap all sound great  as for gaming  they are awesome  much better then gaming headsets that cost   times as much as the audio technica  i tried and few and returned them   these headphones paired with a good mic will be the ultimate gaming streaming set up  these are not noise cancelling but they do help quiet the outside world  i know this going in so i expected it  highly recommend them      
219,5.0,                       same great audio quality  comfort  and durability of my  wired  ath m    but without the pesky cable i managed to trip over at work at least twice each week  the bluetooth connection is reliable and the audio quality is top notch between audio technica s awesome customer service and the solid ath m   line  i m not sure why people bother with anything else buy these      
220,5.0,                       i love these headphones so much i bought them again after my first pair broke after three or so years  and i bought them as a gift for my brother these are a great introduction into high quality headphones  i saw a video of rick rubin doing a recording at his studio in california  everyone was wearing audiotechnicas  and i think some of them were ath m  s and m  xs  they have a clear  clean  balanced sound  the response curve is flat  so if you just want bumping base without being able to hear the highs and mids as clearly  these are not for you  i don t produce music  but i listen to a lot of it  and i love hearing all parts of the music on a wide sound stage  compared to something like skullcandy s aviator heapdhones  my only complaint is that they use their own custom  locking cord  i think they do this so that it wears more slowly  but i think they could have come up with a clever solution that allowed the use of standard    mm cords  anyway  that s a small price to pay for great sounding headphones  i also recommend getting the wireless adapter if you re of the bluetooth persuasion      
221,5.0,                       these are absolutely awesome  i m a bodybuilder and decided to get over the ear headphones to deter people from talking to me during my training  these cancel everything out  stay on my head well  and lasted a month training for      mins  x a week on one charge     that is insane  and i don t have to be one of the sheep who wears beats lol     
222,1.0,                       within   months of owning them the wire snapped without reason as i was wearing them and was stuck within the headphone  i tried to remove it for about   or   hours to no avail  when speaking with their tech support they couldn t even send me a pair with a hold on my card and release the hold when they received this pair  instead they wanted me to pay for the shipping and wait a few weeks to get my product back this is my second pair of headphones  my first one lasted a little over two years and broke at multiple points due to cheap plastic components but this is absolutely ridiculous  i will never purchase another one of their products again      
223,5.0,                       finally hit the   year mark with these  heavy usage at least     hours on them  music producer  so let s get to the product after weeks of reading reviews and going through all the pros and cons about headphones from the           range i finally bought these first day i got them  amazing packaging very neat and straight forward  they re made on really high quality materials  yes plastic is evolved in the making of these headphones but don t let that scare you away  they look and feel amazing after unwrapping everything i came to the point where it was time to give these a go  i plugged them straight into my laptop and played a random song  i was really amazed with the quality coming from some okay sony headphones so hears exactly how they sound in the best way i can explain vocals  amazing and very wide  they are pronounced the most in the mixbass  lacks deepness  these are not for bass heads at all  i have a hard time jamming to trap or house music with these because the bass is lacking  imagine being in movie theater and then a huge explosion goes off and james bond does a triple back flip off a moving plane landing on his bear feet on a pile of radio active scorpions but you can t feel the deepness of the explosion and it sounds like it s covered by a whole bunch of neglected pillows who only wish to be loved again highs      mids      lows      i run these now on an apollo interface and they sounds beautiful  but even a   thousand dollar interface couldn t bring up those lows at all over all review they re great for beginners who want to hear chris brown swallow in between verses but you won t be able to hear him slap women in the background      
224,2.0,                    malos malos malos no se loes recomiendo a nadie absolutamente p simos ten a unos aud fonos viejos desde hace   a os y quise cambiarlos por algo mejor o igual  estos aud fonos no son nada buenos    cuando te los colocas te cansan al poco tiempo de uso    la calidad de sonido es p sima compar ndolo con su precio    creo que unos aud fonos de     lo podr a comparar con estos estoy arreglando mis viejos aud fonos para volver a usarlos  fue una p rdida de dinero con estos aud fonos de verdad una decepci n         
225,5.0,                           amazing headphones  i just received these m  x with the amp bundle  i first plugged it in without the amp to see how they work  they sounded amazing  very clear and flawless sound  i have had the experience of many headphones and these are by far the best pair i have ever experienced i decided to plug in the mini headphone amp it i bundled it with    it was one of the greatest music experiences  the amp made the music sound unbelievable  high quality sound that flowed like a river of music through my ears giving me a flawless symphony of sounds  i did not want to stop the music  i am still listening now  you can increase the bass with the little amp and boy does it work   highly recommend the bundle  would by again     
226,5.0,what is it  these headphones are of awesome quality  personally i think these are the headphones to purchase when you are more serious about audio rather that the brand name   what s hot   superior audio quality   lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods of time    comes with   different wires   comes with leather carrying bag   headphone are collapsable   ships with     inch adapter  what s not        isn t a bad price but going cheaper would be nicer    proprietary headphone connector means you can use random headphone wires   being that headphones are collapsable the hinges are bound to wear over time    i feel they should have shipped with a microphone enabled wire   design  these are geat looking headphones  not only are they good looking but they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time   features  this would have been perfect if they have included a wire with an inline mic  otherwise  this is the total package for headphones  if you want to hear audio the way it was recorded  this is the route to go  including   different wires and leather pouch was a great idea   performance  audio quality is superb  music sounds like it should  if you want overstated bass i suggest you look somewhere else though  these are the best all around headphone that you can buy under        value  for      you can t go wrong here  you can find others in this price range like beats  and skullcandy  as well as sony  none of the others will sound a good as these do though  this would have been a perfect if they were around      or if they included in line mic   test of time   recommendation   these headphones aren t new  they are technically ath m   s  with a detachable wire  the ath m   released in       that is    years of being one of the best headphones you can buy  at a normal consumer level   i highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for great over the ear headphones or to people considering purchasing comparable products   thoughts i have been eying these headphones for about   years now and finally caved in a brought them  i have to say i m glad i did  i was gonna just pick up some bluetooth pair of earbuds but this was definitely the better route to take  currently i my main phone still supports a    mm headphone jack so i don t have to worry about compatibility at the moment  on another note  these headphones also sound amazing when using them with my digital piano  my previous ones all sound like crap 
227,2.0,                       i m certainly no audiophile but i do have a strong appreciation for quality audio  i bought a pair of these headphones to replace my sony mdrxb   bt  the sony headphones construction was garbage  it was mostly plastic so while the headphones worked great they basically crumbled to peices  both were priced at       here s what i found the audio technica headphones are also made of plastic  all the components on my sony headphones that failed were plastic and those same components are plastic on the audio technicas as well  specifically the peice that attatches the speakers to the head band  not good as that is the part that will be under the most strain the audio technica headphones have very little bass  granted the sony s i had were geared towards solid bass so the difference was very noticable the audio is crystal clear  when they aren t cutting out   i immediately noticed that the audio quality of the audio technicas were significantly better than the sony i like the headphones a lot but not for the price  these are legitimately worth              so i m definitely returning them  i wouldn t recommend these unless they are at a very reduced price  audio technica has a similar pair that are cheaper with the only difference being they don t support bluetooth  i would ve been happier with those  the bluetooth feature doesn t justify the price difference between the set  even if it worked properly   poor showing audio technica   update  shortly after returning the audio technicas i decided to try v moda crossfade wireless  immediately fell in love with them  awesome build quality  great clear sound and more bass  i went with the original crossfade and not the crossfade   because if several different product reviews and ended up spending       they were on amazon      
228,5.0,                       i ve had these headphones for about a year now and i absolutely love them i initially purchased the pioneer hdj      for djing   i liked the way they sounded so i started using them for producing as well   but  i must have a weird shaped head or something because they started hurting my ears after sessions with extended usage   after doing all the research i could think of i decided to pick these up and i m super glad that i did   i found that i can wear these for longer sessions and  imo  they actually sound better than the hdj s   i would recommend these to anybody also   i ve dropped these headphones from time to time but they still sound fantastic   hope this helps      
229,5.0,                             worth of clarity   yes  studio monitors are always recommended for final mixing   mastering  to get up close and personal with details  though  this set of headphones can t be beat  after reading a lot of on line sites  ath m  x always seemed to show in the recommended list   they were right  instant clarity   flat response  if you can t afford studio monitors or the environment prohibits them  go with the ath m  x      
230,5.0,                       my ath m  x headphones are  bar none  the best headphones i have ever owned  as a club and mobile dj  i need cans that are durable  reliable  clear  and crisp  the m  x satisfy all of these requirements with flourish  the m  s are often compared to the sony vdr  mdr      in the dj world  and i find the m  s superior in every way  they are pricey  and the noted sonys can often be had for half the list price of the m  s  but worth every penny  if value is important  keep an eye out for sales   the m  s can be had for      from time to time  that s what i paid for them  in terms of durability  i have dragged these cans through the club  three burning mans  two dozen house parties  and every day use  and they still sound perfect  deep bass  bright mids  clear highs  the vinyl pads even have yet to start disintegrating another feature the m  x has over competing phones   the replaceable cord  i went through multiple mdr     s whose cords failed in one form or another  some got munched  others just quit on me  while the     s have big solder pads  even then i was never able to successfully replace the cord  the m  x however  should the cord ever quit or get damaged  has a detachable and replaceable cord that can keep these cans going for years to come the ath m  x headphones are a bit expensive  but i wish i d bought them first before going through three sets of     s  i would have ended up saving money edited july          after five years  the ath m  x cans are still going strong  they have been to burning man five times  gone to dozens of gigs  and get near daily use in a house with three cats that love dangling cords  the only part i have replaced is the ear pads  which i upgraded to some nice comfy memory foam  i can t recommend them enough      
231,5.0,                       there are many different types of headphones on the market these days and it s kind of difficult trying to justify a       the price for a pair of headphones when i distinctly remember buying headphones when i was much younger  without disposable income  on a pair of headphones for     at your local electronics store   i am also not an audiophile so i don t feel like i am able to judge the quality of sound from headphone a to headphone b   but after much research  youtube videos and blogs  i felt like i should indulge myself into this world of audio that i never really learned to appreciate it has been said about these headphones time and time again that they are very neutral and provide great quality   i never understood this until i put these on and listened to many many different genres of music   things that were drowned in my bass heavy headphones became as clear as day and made me learn to appreciate many more artists   from subtle breaths that the singer takes before a big solo or how a  twang  is plucked hard or soft becomes much more apparent   i believe there is a lot from music that isn t heard or felt because of the way it is heard and the audio technica ath m  x s is a great tool for you to learn to appreciate sound music   if i haven t become an audiophile in a few years because of these headphones then i should at least be on track to understand the nuances that make listening to music enjoyable i will also be using these for field recording with lavalier microphones and shotgun mics in the near future and i will update about the overall construction and durability once i ve gained some experience with these headphones   for the few months that i ve had them they have held up great and cables hold on strong   they also feel great      
232,5.0,                       i love these headphones  they feel like a quality product  the leather feels soft and the cushions are really comfortable  they are sturdy yet flexible  which makes it ideal  the size can be adjusted fairly easily  but they stay locked in place unless you change it again the sound               since they re not the best for gaming  naturally   it doesn t sound as bass y as i d like  only for games  for everything else  the sound is beautiful  well balanced  clean  i love it i d say they re uncomfortable for people with glasses  myself being one  but it may just be the fact that i ve spent so much time wearing them     h straight daily   i do have to take them off every   mins or so to get some air on my ears  otherwise they get really warm these are not just one of the best headphones for       they are one of the best headphones  period      
233,5.0,                       i find these headphones to be perfect for daily life and in the studio    they are extremely comfortable  i can spend    hours with these on my head and only have to readjust a few times    they sound great  they have a very even frequency range and sound great with all kinds of music  from classical to hip hop  rock to dance  yes  i listen to all of these genres    the noise rejection is just right  they work well in transit  because they block out enough noise to hear the music well  but still allow me to be aware of the sounds in my surroundings and not get hit by a car or even miss my stop on the bus  for example overall definitely say these are a great buy  especially if you can get them on sale  i got them on sale for           us      
234,3.0,                       pros  amazing  comfortable sound profile long listening of all music and gaming with good punchy bass  decently comfortablecons  you will likely have to replace the ear cups and headband assembly multiple times over the lifetime of these because the pleather coating will peal flake off over time  probably within the end of a year or after the first year of owning them  which won t be covered under warranty  so calculate this into the cost of owning these  while spending    dollars and some time on replacing these  it s better than re buying them new  but still not fun  an alternative for the long term flaking would be to buy a headband cover  and aftermarket earpads that are of a cloth type of material instead of pleather coated ones that come with it      
235,2.0,                       this is clearly a general consumer model and not an  improvement  on the original model  there is only one single audio cable as apposed to the   that came with the wired model  there is no      adapter  aside from not having the ability to plug into     of the audio interfaces on the market which is a huge inconvenience    the biggest deal breaker for me is that the audio cable does not twist lock into place  this means that with nothing but a light tug  you ve just lost signal  have fun fumbling around getting it plugged back in in a dark room with flashing lights  this totally removes their reliability for any kind of live performance monitoring in my mind  things happen  if you enjoyed the m  x  just keep the og s  these have been marketed as  if you liked the m  x  now they have bluetooth capability  which to me  is a total farce  they don t seem to retain the wired model s extra flat profile  which aside from the aforementioned complaints  further reduces it s usefulness for studio applications sound quality is decent for consumer use  battery life is great  bluetooth is decent  this is the only reason it gets a   star bottom line  the sound quality is decent for consumer use  battery life is great  bluetooth is decent  this is the only reason it gets a   star  so  if you are just looking for a decent pair of cans for the morning commute  for the gym  or just personal listening  these are a good choice  if you are looking for an professional use  this is not an upgrade  just go with the m  x original  it s cheaper  has more cord options  it is more reliable for live and studio     
236,5.0,                       i have an anker bluetooth device which receives signal via optical cable from my tv  then sends the signal to my audio technica m   headset  i have been using this headset for about   weeks now at   to   hours a night  i am happy to say that it works flawless  its a great headset and worth the money  i haven t had one drop out and sound is crystal clear  i highly recommend this headset but only for adults      
237,4.0,                       i ve owned these for about   months and have almost no complaints  the sound is literally so well balanced and well designed  that i can t tell how loud my music is until my ears start to hurt  there is a little distortion at max volume  but i don t plan on listening at this level for any extended period of time  there is also very little if any sound leakage which is great for an office environment  the reason for four stars is because  after   months of ownership  the right earpiece stopped producing sound  i tried a few different cables and different audio sources and all produced the same issue  ultimately i had to send it in for warranty repair  this was a very seamless process and there was no hassle whatsoever  if i would have paid the       for overnight shipping  their warranty documentation states they would have tried to repair it same day and return it with the same overnight shipping  that s pretty impressive in my book  the only caveat with this process is that there was no communication until i received a return tracking number  it would ve been nice to have received an email letting me know that they received the item and when i could expect the headphones to be returned  but i m otherwise very satisfied with the process  i would very highly recommend these to anyone looking for a great pair of headphones from a great company      
238,5.0,                       my son saved up his money and bought these for himself  he really loves them and is extremely proud of them  they look good and sound great  this is his  rd pair of headphones and he said they are    x better then the skull candy   beatz ones that he had in the past      
239,2.0,                       after about a year of having these headphones  they ve   literally  given me many  many headaches  i ve tried to adjust them so they span wider  but the headaches continue the sound quality is good  but the headaches i could do without to boot  i can t figure out why   these headphones made a permanent indent on the top of my skull  i ve had headphones for years and years in my life  other brands  that have never done this  these headphones  for some reason   left a mark on my skull sadly i have to find another set of headphones to wear   stars because quality of audio  otherwise  i would stay away      
240,5.0,                       everything  about these is nice  great sturdy cords included  comfortable as can be  easy to store and hang somewhere  and balanced sound  they seem built well enough to take some accidental drops and are flexible  unlike my xbs that cracked and broke easily where the earmuff meets the headband  the bass is there  but not ridiculous  all of my games sound good      
241,5.0,                       definitely worth the investment  i spent a month researching which brand and model i wanted to spend the money on and i m very satisfied that i landed on these  i have a big head and these are really comfortable on me without feeling like they re squeezing the life out of me  they fold down for travel and came with a drawstring bag  the cord was completely detachable which i didn t realize how much i would love  the sound quality is outstanding  i listen to a lot of binaural asmr videos and these provide such a more immersive experience  the sound is clear and the bass is impressive without being overwhelming  very happy with my purchase      
242,5.0,                         years ago i bought these headphones  their sound quality is all you really need for your average listener  the only problems i ve had with these is that the headband makes the top of my head hurt  so i can t wear these for long periods of time  i would recommend looking into modding a head strap onto these as well if it bothers you  another issue is that its plastic  which is good for weight but not so much for durability  a bit if the headphones broke and i ended up taping it together which did the job  would i recommend traveling with it  sure if you don t have other options  and really having the additional cables in my bag can be annoying  i already have too much  so getting the bluetooth ones might be good if youre ok with charging them all the time and don t have worries about possible sound delay      
243,1.0,                       in order to use these worthless headphones  i had to use their own cable  what about the bluetooth function  by far  the worst bluetooth device i ve ever used  it rarely paired with my computer and phone and  even when it did  the audio quality over bluetooth was worse than a cheap    pair of walmart headphones the cable it comes with is too short to be of any use  because of the aforementioned issues of bluetooth being worse than anything i ve ever used  i had to use the worthless  non locking cable  the basic m    even with its proprietary locking cable that i used to hate  is far superior since i never had to fear that the cable would rip out by me slightly adjusting how i m sitting in short  if you like wasting money  you ll love these things  if you like sound quality and having a usable product that won t make you want to throw against the wall just for existing  save money and buy the non bluetooth version  if you still want bluetooth  for whatever crazy reason you unreasonable idiot  buy a different set of headphones      
244,3.0,                       i have pair of at m   headphones which produce a flat response  i wanted an upgrade  this isn t it  these headphones are not worth the pretty penny charged  first the    s are uncomfortable and heavy  compared to the    s they do sound fuller but not by much  they put pressure on my head immediately after putting them on  that was my first impression   nd they are extremely heavy  i also have a pair of bayerd dt     which are a dream in comfort compared to these new m   s  these    s isolate sound more but what wouldn t as tight as they are  i just can t keep these as they are a step down not up in terms of comfort and sound quality tech between my other   pairs  i will be returning these and searching for a higher end set of phones  at that price point  i can do better  just need to keep searching        
245,5.0,                       the audio technica ath m  x are amazing  i love these headphones  i bought myself a pair about   years ago and still use them daily to this day  they re extremely durable  which even saying that feels like an understatement  the look of them has not deteriorated whatsoever after   years even though i m known to be heavy handed  however  i did replace the ear cups on the day i revived them because after market ear cups are hard to beat  for this reason  i m not sure how the original ear cups would ve help up those   years  i like them so much that i ve bought my brother a pair and myself   extra pairs  one for my bedside and one for my workplace because i m big time lazy   music and gaming all sounds phenomenal  i would ve given these a     on noise cancelling as well  but since they do not have active noise cancellation  i m forced to put them at a      they re stylish and low profile      
246,5.0,                       so i ve had these headphones for about   months and i ve got to say these are one of the best true to source headphones i ve listened to  i ve used this for producing and light mixing and the sound quality is amazing  the lows aren t too loud and it really allows you to hear the sounds well  i wouldn t really say it s a noise canceling headphone but it does get pretty loud if you just wanted to use it to listen to music  it sounds great  also i ve used these for gaming as well in fortnite and war zone and it allows me to hear everything  overall great purchase worth every penny  would buy again and recommend to anyone who would like to use them for any of the things i ve mentioned      
247,3.0,                       but these things do not accurately represent the male voice in the higher ranges  robert plant sounds like he is singing through a can  and that is a shame because otherwise the headphnes have a pretty accurate sound  especially in the    hz range where they shine  if you are looking for a good pair of monitors  or reference headphones  these are not your guys  i would say they would make decent monitors if there was not an issue where the low treble and high mids cross over  i am guess they boosted here to keep the sound from becoming muddy due to inferior drivers  it helps vocals cut through  but colors the sound imaging is decent  dynamics are very good  music sounds punchy and tight  but i can not hear a brush on the symbols on a track with loud guitar  so on that level the imaging is average these would porbably be good headphones for watching tv  or a less discerning music listener   they do sound good  just not accurate  and the sound stage is nonexistent      
248,5.0,                       these headphones were my favorite purchase in      while its almost comical  i originally wanted over the ear headphones to keep my ears warm while listening to music during my morning walk to work  and it doesn t leave you with hat hair  ladies   but after an initial search  i got knees deep in finding the best quality headphones for my money i am a devout lover of music and typically used ear buds  i used to wonder why speaker and headphone sound quality were so important to some people    now i know why  the second i put these over my ears  my life was changed  the sound was so crisp  so smooth  and captured the tones and bass in a way i have never experienced  i was hooked since my purchase  i have spread the greatness of these headphones like nobody s business    of my co workers and   of my friends purchased these after hearing me obsessively gush and letting them take a test drive  the kicker  one of my co workers is a huge sound quality buff and owns    pairs of high quality headphones  he bought these and they are now his favorite set thank you audio technica for rocking my world      
249,4.0,                       wonderful headphones  sound is crystal clear with no over emphasized bass or treble   i m hearing things i ve never heard before when listing to songs i ve played a million times before  these are easily the best sounding headphones i ve ever owned  i set all eq to flat or off just to get a base line  the sound is is so defined that i didn t need to turn the eq back on  i didn t need it  all my music is perfectly balanced from songs with heavy baselines to songs that are vocal heavy  bass isn t overpowering and treble isn t shrill  it just sounds incredible  i m using a gen     ipod classic which has been touted as the best sounding apple device ever made how to quantify my experience with these headphones so you know where i m coming from    i was curious to see if i could tell the difference between good and great sounding music  i went to a website that plays two versions of the same recording where one clip is higher def than the other  i was always able to pick out the better sounding version  i had to really listen  the difference was so subtle  it s far from scientific but at least i know my hearing is somewhat sensitive now the bad   my ears hurt   after the first   hours my ears felt a little sore   this is because there isn t enough padding so my ears are up against the speaker grille  my ears aren t big either  they don t stick out at all  my ears are probably a small med sized ear  i already purchased a better set of ear padding   all in  these cost me almost     dollars  are they worth it  so far  a solid yes  i deducted one star for the uncomfortable ear cups      
250,5.0,                       as a software developer  i spend most of the time focus on a task  so a good pair of headphones is a most to keep me in the zone  in my personal experience these headphones deliver   great build quality   comfortable for long periods   the sound is insuperable for the price  everything sounds clear  crisp  detailed  punchy   extra cable with mic     hrs of battery   bluetooth       a really good mic      
251,4.0,                       the sound is excellent  can compete with bose head phones the cable is proper and robust a lot of important additional cablessuper flexible and won t brake under pressureproper noise cancellationproper bass  but   you sweat in them if you use it outside of the house   the weight will put pressure on your outer ear which makes it hurtful after     hours   the tension will put pressure on the inner ear and make it hurtful after     hours     
252,5.0,                       the audio technical brand has been a bit like an under ground hip hop community though it has been ignored and sometimes never even heard of due to to over whelming mainstream music  i e  beats  once you experience the real music you can never go back  the complete of saturation of beats has made regular non audio files believe that beats are gold standard headphones  while they are just like the prada of headphones  you are paying for a brand  nothing more  while when you buy something like these ath m   s you are paying for sound quality and comfortability for long listening sessions  i was gifted a pair of beats studios for my birthday and up until then i listened to music on earbuds and when i put them on i heard that the music was better so i used the crap out of them until my friend let me try these on     wow just wow  these head phones are just amazing to listen to and put on  the sound is crisp and clear with a balanced sound stage  these headphones are a great entry level pair of head phones and i m very curious if these can be the beats to an even more premium pair of head phones      
253,4.0,                       if you re looking for noise cancelling or over ear comfort like bose  this is not your go to  but if you re looking for decent bluetooth headphones that can make calls with a higher quality than most  than this is your pair to get pros   makes calls with better quality than the alternativescons   not the most comfortable to wear  the price is a bit too highif you want a generally okay pair of headphones that make calls with higher quality than most  than buy these  if you value comfort more and don t care as much about phone calls  go with another brand      
254,1.0,                       i m so sad  i had high hopes for this and chose them over beats but that was big mistake  i ve had better     headphones than these  being the singer musician i am i was looking for some high quality headphones and these don t even come close  sound isn t clear  bluetooth cuts out and there s barely any bass  i m soooo disappointed and want my money back         
255,5.0,                       i loved the bluetooth version so much that i bought this wired version too  the sound is amazingly clean and natural from thunderous lows  when content calls for it  to crisp highs with accurate mid tones   i play piano and guitar and demand natural sound  not colored sound  when using a yamaha digital piano with these  the sound produced from each key is heard almost as accurate as if the headset wasn t used thanks to the yamaha technology they re noted for when using headphones for studio use  having said this  without a headset that is geared for professional studio use like this one is  all of the technology yamaha could create would ever be utilized   this headset delivers accuracy   when deep low notes are played  you hear these natural low notes with a powerful punch only during those notes  the sound from this wired version is identical to the newer wireless model which is impressive  the cords are not interchangeable with both models unfortunately  the fantasia upgraded cable sold here on amazon is worth the small investment since it is superior to the   ft cable provided  this is my favorite headset along with the wireless version ath m  xbt  you re not going to want to take these beauties off your head after you hear the accurate dynamic range up and down the entire music spectrum  as a musician  this outperforms the bose   marantz and yamaha sound monitor models  yamaha is not known for headphones so i m not surprised  i am however surprised marantz could not deliver the sound i would expect from a premium brand  the sony professional mdr       also a studio monitor headset   is a very close competitor to the ath m  x and bt units  i own all three and love them equally  the sony is not as solidly built as the audio technica models  the ear pads on the at models look and feel much more leather like than with the sony  in summary  this along with the sony mdr      are the industry standard all others are measured to  this is why these two classics are the choice of studios      
256,5.0,                       first of all i m a gamer and streamer so i needed good quality headphones  i tried a couple and these ones just won in all categories  i tried hyperx cloud ii  hyperx cloud alpha  corsair void pro  razer man o war and quite honestly for sound quality  comfortable  and clarity   these ones are the best ones out of this list  the hyperx cloud ii and alpha would be my  nd and  rd pick on this list  the only thing i recommend if you purchase these headphones is to get the brainwavz memory foam ear cushions as they are   x more comfortable and highly recommended with the audiotechnica community  also great style fashion color if you choose to go with white      
257,3.0,                       for a wireless pair of headphones  these are just okay   the first thing i noticed was the volume level    not remotely close to what i m used to   then there were the controls    not sure if they were thought through the f  are far cheaper but   x better than these i d recommend these for someone who is used to an open back sound  but want to try something a little different      
258,1.0,                       after   month of working well and being awesome these headphone took a turn for the worse   i baby them so i don t know what happened   they now sound shallow and weak   the sound quality and strength is just not there   where once i could easily connect them to bluetooth now it is a real struggle to get my pc or my phone to recognize them   i didn t change my phone or anything about my pc    something in these headphones changed and now i regret buying them   i don t have a recommendation but do not buy these audio technica wireless pieces of garbage   at should be ashamed      
259,5.0,                       i d been wanting to upgrade my trusty audio technica m   s to these newer m  x s for some time but been a little put off by the        price  a few days after almost buying them  again   amazon dropped the price to      and i leapt at the chance in short  i d have been happy to upgrade at the original price  these things are epic not only is the sound from the headphones crystal clear  evenly responsive and wonderfully accurate  but because of the higher quality construction  there s practically no noise from the hinges creaking when i move around   something that was annoying about my old m   s if you re in the market for some fabulous headphones that accurately reproduce the original music as recorded  look no further  if you want headphones that massively amplify bass at the cost of general music quality look elsewhere      
260,4.0,                       the pros   the insulation adds some passive noise dampening of the outside world   the insulation keeps you from annoying your neighbors when you re blasting deathcore like brojob or hiphop like a ap rocky  the design is inconspicuousthe cons   the sound quality is just ok  it s got punchy bass  but it can t compare with something like the grado sr     the pads  for me  were uncomfortable to wear for over    minutes or so   the closed design actually makes these like ear muffs  so you can get sweaty while wearing these overall  these are great for school or office use  if you have to be considerate of your neighbors  if you have your own space  go with grado for sure  but they re a bit stuffy and uncomfortable      
261,5.0,                       i plan to start recording music of my own at home   so  i ve been researching everything i d need   a decent pair of monitor headphones are at the top of the  essential  list   i figured that if i were going to be spending money on some headphones  i d like them to work casual use as well as mixing   so  after lots of digging  reading reviews  watching comparison videos  i have determined that the m  x would be the best for me  for the following reasons   excellent sound quality  relatively flat response rate  comfortable with glasses  detachable cables  included with purchase   reasonably affordablei m glad i put in all the legwork ahead of time   these arrived yesterday  and i ve worn them for several hours  listening to music  mostly rock  metal and pop  and playing games  diablo   and skyrim    the sound quality is outstanding   admittedly  these are the first studio monitors i ve listened to   i ve owned decent  fun  headphones in the past       range  and these are by far superior to what i ve experienced it took me a bit to settle on these  as some folks claimed that they were either bass heavy  harsh  or uncomfortable   fortunately  i ve found none of this to be true   i ve had these on for up to   hours with no discomfort what so ever   when it comes to the sound  all i can say is  wow    everything is extremely clear  and i feel  balanced   the bass is definitely there  but it s not overpowering  and it certainly doesn t detract from other frequencies   the high end comes in really well  and not harsh at all to me   the layers in the music i ve listened to so far are so much easier to distinguish in the past  i ve been able to accurately distinguish various bitrate mp s audio files over laptop speakers      vs     vs lossless    these headphones make it way easier      
262,5.0,                       as with all user product reviews  personal impressions are completely subjective  but i am one that generally relies on these reviews for most of my purchases  i am a  home recording enthusiast   and i have used the previous version of these headphones for many years  so i must admit a bias towards them  reviews  even professional reviews  can only get you so far with something like this  if you live near enough to a music store  you really need to demo headphone to find your preference that said  i find the ath m  x to be very well balance  with a solid  but not hyped  bottom end  a natural to slightly warm mid range  and a clean  but not overly bright  high end  for me  that makes them near perfect  as a musician recording at home  so much of the work is done wearing cans  and i can wear the m  x for hours without any fatigue or discomfort  most importantly  these headphones are  neutral  enough that i can get almost     of the way to a finished mix before needing to switch to monitors to get the final mix  this makes working at home  and not driving my family crazy by hearing the same song over and over again during the tracking and mixing process  much easier      
263,5.0,                       love how these sound   i was in the market for a pair of good headphones for general music listening as well as pc gaming   i originally looked at all in one headsets which have simulated surround sound and mics  and all the bells and whistles   i looked at so many different brands and price points   ultimately  i decided that sound quality and not a bunch of extras is the most important thing   i do some gaming  but not nearly enough to justify the loss in quality you get from those all in one headphones   mostly  i listen to a lot of music while i do photo editing on my pc and good stereo sound quality is the most important thing for me to compare  i should add that i own a pair of beyerdynamic dt    s  which many people recommend over the m  x   i personally disagree   i consider the m  x a big upgrade   music sounds richer  with more powerful  but not too powerful  bass  and crystal clear treble  everything just sounds much more engrossing and music that i ve listened to for years suddenly come to life with a richness i didn t hear before i am pairing the m  x with a smsl sd    ii amp and it sounds amazing   you don t need an amp to get great audio out of these headphones  but using one will provide subtle but noticeable improvement in audio quality i also own a pair of turtle beach surround sound headphones for my ps   and these blow those out of the water   like i said  the all in one headsets just can t compete with a nice pair of stereo headphones if pure sound quality is a priority i highly recommend these headphones  and frankly  i can t believe they are so affordable   unbelievable value   the build quality is fantastic  and they are very comfortable   no complaints whatsoever   would recommend to anyone looking for nice headphones      
264,5.0,                       full disclaimer  i m not a audiophile by any means  i may not be able to immediately discern differences in different ranges of audio like others more experienced might     of my time awake is usually spent at a pc  and i listen to a very large array of music  from harsher bands like korpiklaani  korn   mastodon  to softer things like sleep dealer  yiruma  beethoven  etc  i tend to favor  but obviously not strictly  instrumental or vocalless music  and i also listen to a extremely large array of videogame music i love to listen to music while i m  say  programming or just lazing about  but i don t like using speakers  since i have a roommate i don t like to disturb to this end  i was looking for a good pair of  all around  headphones that were  great   ie  better than a poopy     walmart pair that  even to me sounds flat as heck  but reasonably priced  and reviews and research led me to this pair of headphones i m in love with them so far  they seem really great all around  basey  but not painfully so  and definitely far from the flat cheaper headsets you d normally find around it comes with a few different sizes and types of cords  so you should always have a nearly perfect length of wire for what you re using  that said  i just about always just use the longest cord  but that s just for my setup i also put the headphones through a bit of abuse  not on purpose  but i tend to lounge around in my hair weirdly  and get uncomfortable if i m one position for too long  so the wire will sometimes wrap around the chair weirdly when i m not paying attention  and in a couple cases it s been enough to tug the headphones right off my head and onto the floor  but it s held up pretty well anyway  so i d say they re also pretty durable i kind of dislike that you can t just use any old aux cable for it  since it comes with a specialized cable that  locks  into the headphones  but it s not really a issue  just preference i d definitely recommend this pair of headphones to anyone looking for a reasonably price  good  pair of headphones for regular general use  and i ll definitely get a pair of these again if i somehow break or lose them      
265,4.0,                       i got these to replace my aging sr    s that have fallen apparent one to many times these headphones sound good  not as good as the sr    s mind you  but good  i think part of the issue is they are closed where the sr    s were open  on the flip side the sound isolation of these is amazing  put them on and forget the noisy cube mates the build quality of these is also really really good  way better then the sr    s  perhaps way better then anything i have purchased in a long time i m not however too fond of the length of the plug that plugs into the headphones  i find it frequently catching on my shirt every time i turn my head which is super annoying if the build quality and design of the grado labs were better i would probably have gone that direction again  but it is not   so there you go      
266,5.0,                       i have owned these headphones for   months  i m semi audiophiliac   they ve generally been my go to for listening to music  i m only writing this review because i unlocked the truth i d been missing out on for   months  that s my resume here are my thoughts on why you should choose these over budget or more expensive headphones      yes  you should  but read on  these are great no matter what you plug them into  i ll give them that  you will be generally impressed if you plug them into your iphone  android  mac  etc   they re pretty darned good  the volume is perfect  the highs are there but tame enough while keeping truth  you won t blow your eardrum tweeter  but the highs are definitely there and serviceable to truthiness of the treble band   the bass is true bass  it s not overly exaggerated  these will not give you an ear massage  it will however give you pretty close to exact bass  that s actually a fantastic thing  learning to appreciate bass rather than it treating your ears as a trampoline is definitely an enlightenment i mainly use these with spotify for my music diet  i m a premium subscriber which gives me the rights to their high quality streams  these will expose bad recordings  certain punk rock will not sound good as high quality electronic or high end produced modern pop  the ath m  x s keep the recording quality obvious  but i would go on to say that they re pretty forgiving at the same time  if you picked up a pair of at s higher priced cans  you d probably expose even more  and is that worth it  ehhhh it s up to you  but these are the sweet spot for the price if you re really looking to find flaws in recording  ya geek the biggest take away for these cans is this  while plugging them into anything will get you great audio  what they re plugged into matters they will expose the the truth of the audio output of the device they re plugged into  an iphone won t sound as good as plugged into a macbook pro which won t sound as good as a pc with a good sound card  i d been running these on my dell monitors headphone jack  which runs into an nvidia    ti gpu  which serves up audio through the mentioned audio jack  it was okay  today i pulled out the long    mm male to    mm male  the connection on the ath m   s is    mm fyi  that came with these and decided to plug these into my gaming pc that has a decent realtek soundcard   oh my lord panty dropping audio blissfulness  the gods have spoken  how the hell did i miss this  hot damn it awoke the beast  i cannot say more until you try these in a preamp  coworkers recommended  or something that pumps out decent audio these are a catalyst  you just need the correct crucible to handle it  you pair these babies with the correct output mechanism  and it will be one of the best      range headphones you ll have ever have bought  sky s the limit  just feed them correctly since owning these  i ve bought other audio technica audio and recording devices  have a set of their ath cks  xbt blue tooth headphones        audio technica solid bass bluetooth wireless stereo headset ath cks  xbt                       as well as the at     usb microphone      audio technica at    usb plus cardioid condenser usb microphone                       it helps to live   miles from their main headquarters and warehouse  but my first venture with at were these headphones bought from amazon  and i haven t looked back  these can s established brand loyalty in me to at  they are the truth      
267,5.0,                        prosgreat noise isolationcolorful soundgreat designlightfeel good to holdgood texture on the plasticstrong construction where the strength is neededthree cords in the boxgood carrying bag consplastic at certain places  though these areas are not susceptible to damage  it just takes a bit away if you have a smaller head  it will be difficult to get a good seal on the ear cushions for the best noise isolationthese feel nasty if you re sweating too much  but they don t hold sweat nearly as bad as other headphones that i ve usedthese headphones are simply amazing  they block out the fan noise of my yoga        inch  which admittedly isn t too loud  that s very average for a laptop  but it s very nice  with audio on  only at ten volume  all voices are blocked out at farther than    feet away  there is almost no noise leak on these  these headphones are like the philips shp     when it comes to sound quality  but there is a lot more color to the sound  these headphones are a must  i appreciate how light these are aswell  there is no fatigue after a weekend of studying  music  and video games   that light weight might seem like an issue as these headphones are made of plastic  but the texture makes them feel great  the plastic does not feel like a    dollar pair of headphones you re getting your     dollars worth      
268,5.0,                       my fianc  is an audiophile and these have hands down been our best purchase   he has one pair for his music work and one for gaming  i recently purchased him gaming headphones and they just didn t compare obviously   even more expensive models and not stood up to the quality of these      
269,3.0,                       my first try at over ear headphones  i have to say the sound quality is ok after you toggle the adjustments in the phone but bass certainly lacks  i just did not find them to be for me and go back to in ear style  the assistant button does not depress and takes a specific touch to work in my case  limited in uses for them to inside because they aren t somewhat water or dust resistant   i didn t see enough value to keep them      
270,5.0,                       what s not to love  i have been using audio technica headphones for about   years now  in my opinion  they will always be better than beats  the sound quality is amazing  they fit well  and are not unstylish either  i got these after my old ones were getting pretty worn out  the old version did not have interchangeable chords  this new feature is my favorite thing ever  being able to disconnect the chord when i store the headphones has definitely lengthened the chords life  it is also great that i can choose if i want a short or a long chord  i use these every single day  i take them with me wherever i go  they are amazing  they are not completely noise canceling  but you really can t hear anything  unless someone is being super loud or is right next to you  when you have your music playing  one thing i would recommend is to get a protective headband strap  the material on the strap of the headphones is prone to flaking  to stop this  just use a knitted strap  can be found on amazon       
271,5.0,                       well  i have to admit that i did something dumb   i own a   year old m  x model   the m  xmp which has been  discontinued and i got the idea that i wanted to upgrade to another model   after reading very positive reviews i purchased the sony      wired headphone   i was perfectly satisfied with my new       but on a whim i thought i would compare it to my old beat up model m  x   omg    there was no comparison whatsoever  so  in   minutes time i went from liking my      to having it boxed up to ship back the next morning   i promptly returned it and ordered myself a new m  x and two pairs of brainwavz hybrid ear cups for both of my m  x headphones   yes  i did something dumb  but it all worked out in the end  and i won t be straying again from audio technica       
272,5.0,                       these are the best headphones you can buy for under       i had the m  x for   years before they finally broke  and upgrading to the m  x was a great decision  the build quality is much better  i can tell it will last even longer  the sound is as true as it gets   no extra bass or trebble and every little detail is clearly aueivpe with these headphones      
273,3.0,                       i like the sound the phones produce but the volume is not loud enough for my taste using an iphone  with the volume up as high as it can go i still could use a lot more  i don t listen to it overly loud and i am not hard of hearing but these phones just do not play loud enough for my liking  i will try them wired next but that kind of defeats the purpose for wireless headphones  not entirely happy with this purchase      
274,5.0,                       sorry  no picture to assuage anxieties  but the review is honest   unpaid  in fact  i paid       for ats headphones from this ol vendor  prior to these audio technica headphones i was using a     sony set  audio technica is another dimension  sound is perfectly reproduced  the versatility of the design is fabulous  product quality validates that you get what you pay for  these are well designed  comfortable   private  to wit  this is not a long review  but all character   quality of what this  presumptive  audiophile did wish to find represented in the product   the product s performance across utility   sound is      on expectation  no disappointment  nothing but pleasurable comment for audio technica ath m  x headphones ps  i do not  game   no comment there      
275,5.0,                       terriffic  neutral  detailed  full sound  what s not to like  additionally  they are over ear and block sound entering leaking while being extremely comfortable  i m a vo pro and i m confident with these  actually when i recently left tokyo for los angeles  i gave my studio monitors to a friend  thinking i d simply replace them when i got settled here    i ll re think that idea because these may be all i need  oh i know  the studio engineer types will be up in arms  but  these are that good  do yourself a favor and try these before you spend a dime on anything else of course  most everyone i know with a home studio has their favorite set of cans and these are mine  audio technica delivers the sound and amazon prime delivers the goods  recommended      
276,5.0,                       these are really fantastic headphones  they sound very good for mostly all music  the bass isn t super strong but beside that  it s really clear  there are   different cords included which is nice  the headphones feel sturdy and fold up nicely for storage  if you wanna kick your style up another notch  check out dbrand  where you can buy a variety of skins to customize the headphones how you like  i should also mention the bluetooth adapter  which adds a nice bit of convenience  it does seem to have a very low hum interference noise but if you turn the volume of your music up it cannot be heard over it  the battery lasts a reasonably long time      hours  i ve attached a picture of my headphones  customized with a mahogany skin from dbrand  and the bluetooth adapter is below them      
277,5.0,                       i wouldn t consider myself an audiophile mostly because i can t afford the headphones i want  but i do love a great sounding pair of headphones  i have a pair or mrspeakers mad dog headphones with alphapads  very good headphones  and those are my point of reference for comparing these the m  s aren t the most comfortable headphones  i would definitely look at changing the ear pads unless it s not an issue for you  the sound quality is really good though and very clear  different sounds are very distinguishable with the m  s  bass is there but it s not over powering and they aren t made to be bassy  if you want bass another paid of headphones will do the trick i bought these mainly for my wife  she listens to music and her audiobooks and she loves them  she uses them at work and the workplace is extremely loud and she says the headphones block out nearly everything on the outside these are great headphones for the price point and unless you re a serious audiophile you probably won t be disappointed      
278,3.0,                       someone should remove  deep  accurate bass response  from the descriptions because these have almost no bass response  if you can get past that  these headphones do have very good response and fidelity across the rest of the spectrum  they are also very comfortable to wear all day long      
279,5.0,                       i have never written a review on amazon  but these headphones are so freaking amazing i had to leave a review  they are the best purchase i have ever made from this site  as many other reviewers have done a fine job of giving these headphones justice  i ll just try to keep this short and simple rugged  these headphones have seen a lot of use over four years  i play video games and listen to music often  usually     hours a week   tripped over the cord  stepped on them  dropped them  and rolled over them with a chair and the darned things still work the same as they did when i purchased them  the only thing i ve had to replace is the earpads  and that is only because they wore out amazing sound  my god the audio quality on these is amazing  i went from a turtle beach gaming headset to these and i would never go back  i remember it taking a little while to adjust  but once i became used to all the sounds i could hear  my gaming experience and music listening transcended to an new level  fps games in particular are so much better now that i can clearly hear footsteps and other nuanced noises  my friends didn t believe me when i raved about how good these headphones were  but they finally had an opportunity to use them at a gaming party  they listened to what my games and my music sounded like and immediately bought a pair  now they  too  will never go back to pleb turtle beaches  price  like i said in the beginning  this is the best purchase i have ever made on amazon  the audio quality and durability of these headphones are amazing and well worth the price i paid for them  they sound just as great as when i first purchased them  kudos to audio technica for creating such a great pair of headphones for audiophiles  if these things ever break  i ll definitely be buying another pair i cannot recommend these enough  especially to those like myself that are looking for the best bang for their buck but still obtaining quality products  they have lasted through four years of abuse and still work as well as the day they arrived  anyone i have shown these headphones to is impressed by the quality  and you will be too      
280,4.0,                       i think the sound quality is very good considering they are bluetooth headphones and the battery life has been good  but i personally find them to be uncomfortable  i cannot wear them for more than an hour because my ears will start to hurt  i work on a computer all day and i like to listen to music while i work so i end up having headphones on for hours at a time  i am not able to do that with these headphones  i have a cheaper pair of avantree bluetooth headphones that i think are more comfortable and half the price so i ll end up alternating between the two  overall  great sound quality but you should try putting on a pair before buying them  they might not be a good fit for everyone      
281,3.0,                       i have a evga nu audio on my pc  tidal with master quality music  these were the least enjoyable headset i have used  my philips fidelio l  s beat this as do most other decent headphones that i have tried  the pitch was off  bass seemed distant  everyone is different at perceiving sound so i recommend giving them a try regardless due to the numerous reviews that are positive  you might really enjoy them and if not just return them until you find a pair you like      
282,2.0,                       i am in the market for bluetooth headphones and was excited to see a bluetooth version of m  s which i have had for years now  the wired headphones have held up as the best pair i have owned  and the audio on this wireless set seem just as good however  one reason i wanted bluetooth headphones was to use with my pc and work computer  but they do not seem to want to pair reliably to either  they work great with my phone  but trying to connect to another device is aggravating  and i have to make sure bt is off on my phone before even making an attempt  but they just flat out won t be detected as an audio device on my windows    pcs  and they keep disconnecting from my mac  so i am returning them and looking elsewhere      
283,4.0,                       i had purchased some sennheiser hd     s  i ve always been a big fan of sennheiser      although in this case i was very disappointed in the sonic quality  distortion was pretty evident at modest listening levels which was bad enough but there was no real bass or warmth to the sound   so i sent them back for the at ath m  x s   love the sound  no issues there at any level of listening   one irritation     i do not possess big ears but the ear cups are very snug and occasionally rub my ears     and they create a fair amount of warmth when wearing them for any period of time longer than    minutes or so   if they could improve that issue they would have a real winner all around      
284,5.0,                       short review  these are by far the best headphones that i ve owned   i give them my highest endorsement   of course  since you don t know me  my testimony should count for much long review  in an effort to save you some time as you go through the painstaking process of researching quality headphones  i ll direct you to the one other studio  recording  pair that competes with these       sony mdr     professional large diaphragm headphone                          i have researched cnet  amazon  several forums  head fi org  and spoken with two studio musician friends  and the     s are the only pair that were nearly universally mentioned    though one or another headphones from the audio technica mx line are discussed a lot as well   i ve also used the     s  and was impressed  but i have yet to compare them to these audio technicas  not that my anecdotal opinion should count for much    on sound quality alone  my research indicates that the two are very close   keep in mind  however  that these are studio headphones  designed to give even responses across all frequencies and accurate tones  so  these are probably not the best gaming  where a large open sound stage would be preferable for improved surround sound  or base heavy headphones i chose the audio technicas over the     s for the following reasons  i  i believed  and still do  they produced sound that is at least equal in quality to the     s  ii  detachable replaceable cord  iii  multiple cord  and connector size  options  iv  increased comfort for extended use  larger ear cups with thicker padding   v  low impedance  performs better without an amp  but the      sound quality will improve more when amped   and vi  no exposed cables near the ear cups or head band  the     s have an exposed cable that i fear would not survive long in the company of my toddler  one potential negative  especially for studio use  is that these do leak more sound than i was expecting for a closed back  over ear design   also  though they do reduce incoming ambient noise  they are not super noise isolating   since i do not live alone and sometimes have to unexpectedly interact with others  this is a feature that i like   also  these are almost twice the cost of the     s  so  if you re constrained by a budget  i d recommend those instead      
285,1.0,                       alright  call me a fake audiophile or yell at me for not appreciating the finer points of music or audio production in the comments  i don t care  the tl dr is that these surprisingly comfy  sturdy feeling headphones sounded completely terrible compared to my  actually literally broken  logitech g   s that i was trying to replace to begin with here s what happened   put headphones on  comfy  can t hear the roommate s baby crying either  not bad for not having any active noise cancelling   plugged headphones in  confirmed that they were connected  great  loving the thick  meaty cord  i bet my cat can t chew through this   turned on music  ooh  the instrumental sounds detailed  it has depth  i can even hear that it s a flat  clippy mp    wait  why hasn t the vocal come in yet   has the vocal not come in yet  i hear a choppy noise vaguely in the background      is that  the vocal   proceed to boot up a lossless cd rip of christopher tin s  waloyo yamoni   off of the drop that contained the sea   what has happened to vocals  is my sound card broken suddenly what    last attempt  turn on overwatch league livestream  cannot hear casters over background noise  bullet and game sounds are so tinny they hurt  this is the worst i ve ever heard something sound and i ve used the phone in bucket method as an impromptu amp before   admit defeat  put headphones back in box  plug broken logitechs back in i ve returned these  unlistenable mids do not a good experience make  a quick aram in league of legends just sounded tinny and awful in every way too  with in game voice being downright incoherent   so it s not just audio from bad sources here  i do agree on some points   they do bring out the poorer quality of certain mixes and recording devices  so you ll be able to hear whether compression or clipping or mixing has killed an instrumental track or not really well   but the mids  my god  the mids  if this is  true sound  then  true sound  is trying to listen to someone who s had a tracheotomy attempting to do asmr over the top of a concorde jet mid takeoff      
286,2.0,                       to start off  i really like the way these look  they re visually really cool  the felt fine on my head  though they were too big at their smallest size for my girlfriend  however  there is a constant ticking noise from the left ear cup that never goes away  its really noticeable during slower parts of songs and it drives me insane  on top of that  they didn t sound any better than my girlfriend s skull candy hesh   s  which were less than half the price  overall these were really disappointing especially considering they re over whelming positive reviews and reputation  couldn t live with the ticking  ended up returning them      
287,5.0,                       i had a pair of ath m  s for roughly   years  before a recent trip to vegas where they stopped working   we ll leave that one in vegas  i use them every day at my home pc for my primary means of sound output  anywhere from      hours a day  every day  for four years  they worked perfectly  and these are even better bass heavy profile  isolated stage  blocks exterior sound fairly well but not entirely  the m  x has a detachable cable  which may have prevented my m  s from breaking if they had that feature if i had to make any reccommendations  it would be to source a pair of velour ear pads  they change the sound stage a bit  but reduce the sweat factor by an order of magnitude      
288,5.0,                       reading all the reviews helped   these earphones have great sound quality  it has a large range of sounds   using it for recording helps you to hear any distinguisable background noise i use this for gaming  and it has saved me multiple times from dying beecause of hearing sounds that i never heard before from other brands    never had one this expensive   but they were decent    when no music or sound is going through it you can hear some of the background noises  but once you have sounds going people have to yell to get my attention they do get slighly uncomfortable after a long time  but personally  they feel great and it takes about   hours for me to notice that they are starting to hurt   i usually wear them     hours before taking them off    and sometimes i just put them around my shoulders and turn the earphones outwards and listen to stuff that way    it is not as loud but you can still hear stuff      
289,3.0,                       i purchased this set of headphones back in      and have retired them as of      in the   years of ownership i was initially very happy with these headphones  however as they aged the pleather like material has begun to peel away  and the foam padding has lost its comfort entirely  if you have ears that stick out more then the average person you will note that these headphones become painful to wear for extended periods of time  the sound quality is great  however if you are looking for these to last you for a significant amount of time i would save your money for a higher quality pair of headphones      
290,2.0,                       first off  i noticed sound would cut out from time to time while listening  i wasn t listening to them loud or anything  but it had the feel of the speakers dropping  like clipping  at certain levels  secondly  the sound quality compared to my  albeit very broken in  allen   heath xone xd     headphones  which i thought these would be an upgrade for  was night   day  these m  x s are very  distant  sounding  all bass  lacking midrange and highs  the vocals are recessed way back  making the songs i m familiar with sound really different and weird  i m going to stick with my xone cans for now      
291,5.0,                       many of the other five star reviewers do an excellent job of going into the more technical aspects of these headphones  so i ll just briefly add my voice to the cacophony of praise for these cans  audio quality is absolutely superb   i used to own a pair of regular m   s before breaking them after about a year  and until i finally got around to purchasing these i sorely missed having high quality headphones  it absolutely does take some time to burn in these headphones   some people say up to     hours  but i ve noticed a marked improvement in just after       hours of listening time  i use these almost the entire day at the office   having a removable cable  though new to me  is actually a plus as it makes packing the headphone s up much easier   in the case of actually damaging the cable  fingers crossed that doesn t happen   swapping it out is much easier and there s no risk of rendering the whole unit useless  fit is fine   i have a medium sized head and have no risk of them sliding off  nor are they too noticeably heavy  my one gripe remains with build quality  as like the regular m   s the m  x s use a lot of plastic components   if you will be traveling with these  i highly recommend purchasing a hard travel case  which could save you some heartbreak further down the line   i recently purchased a caseling headphones case to avoid just that and that s it      
292,5.0,                       i ve had this headset through college and for a few years afterwards  has lasted very well  never noticed music quality decrease  love this headset  after hours of use it gets tight on the ears  but what can you expect from a headset  i d rather it be on my head and be tight after hours than it be loose and receive lessened quality of audio      
293,1.0,                       sound great  but lag too much for pc gaming     really tempted to try the audio technica ath g wl premium wireless gaming headset but for the price im considering saying good bye to audio technica   i worry the athg wl will have similar problems with connectivity   shame because i loved my m  x ones and these sound great for music   might be worth trying a different bluetooth adapter first   recommend getting new ear piece covers and a cover for the part that sits on top of your head to make it more comfortable     
294,5.0,                       i ve been into headphones since middle school  i m gone from skull candy  to sennheiser  to other various brands  i ve had a pair of beats by dre  and these are the best headphones i ve ever had  my brother in law told me about these a few years ago but i didn t take him seriously  and man  was i wrong  the bass is good  the vocals and treble are excellent  these headphones are loud so you don t have to turn the volume up on your phone much  incredibly comfortable  easily worth the price listed      
295,5.0,                       this is my first time a  writing a review and b  buying these kind of headphones  however i m writing a review just for these headphones because they re just that good  thus i think an objective list of everything good with it is warranted  good all around frequency response  most of the other headphones i had either were too bassy like gaming headphones or too tiny like open backed consumer grade headphones  so this isn t really saying that much   overall quality  since this headphone uses audio jack  both    mm and       the drivers can be bigger  and higher quality without needing to save room for a dac and or adc  the one downside is that you re at the mercy of both the cable length  though with a high quality cable it shouldn t be an issue  and the sound device it s plugged into  because the quality then will be the weakest link  historically it d be the audio device  but it can provide way more control over the auditory experience comfort  the padded ear pieces are something new to be tbh  i have some big ears and a lot of other headsets tend to hurt them because either it s hard plastic  or the cuffs don t compress to accommodate my ears  these a  are pretty big and fit my ears perfectly and b  even when my ears are caught on the edge of the cuffs it s still comfortable build quality  the build quality is amazing  as mentioned earlier the cable is really high quality with some pretty heavy duty materials to sheathe it  the whole headset itself is using a combination of high quality plastics and some rubber in order to make it not only durable  but somewhat flexible and able to survive some drops here and there  noise dampening  as far as i can tell there is no active noise cancellation on this headphones  and the passive noise cancellation though better than nothing still leave a lot to be desired     
296,5.0,                       to start  i m definitely no expert or anything like that  just a guy that finally had enough of uncomfortable  small easy to lose and terrible battery earbuds i work as an electrician  have been since i was    and i m    now  so i have a ton of experience dealing with every kind of headphone style or earbud style that is on the market  i have gradually spent more for better quality headphones as i get older  and i think i have finally discovered the holy grail for what i am looking for in headphones  i am by no means saying that these are the best in any way or category technically  i have no idea if they are or aren t  just what my needs and expectations are and how they fit those  i dont need perfection in any category  just consistency  durability  dependability  ease of every day use  idiot proof bluetooth pairing that is always fast and smooth  a few special features that are actually something that will be used and the grand pubah a big mean nasty bad    battery the audio technical ath m  bt does all those things but better than even i expected  the sleek matte black color is low key but still cool the ear pieces are the most comfortable thing i ve ever seen or felt  coming from the earbud life  these feel like you are wearing a giant comfy pillow  i barely know i m wearing  cans  on my ears  trust me  if you are easy to please and just looking for something that is any level of comfort above buds  this is a grand slam  i give comfort a perfect    the bluetooth works perfectly every single time i flip the switch on the left side ear piece  it s easy to find and slides right over  volume can be controlled on the headphones or your device  i paired these to my phone originally in seconds and every time after it automatically links to my phone  boom done  simple  bluetooth and controls is a    sound quality is superb for me  i have a note   which has an equalizer option  i had to play with that a small bit at first but if you don t have that option you should be good to go out of the box now for the part i hoped was on another level above buds  bass  i m a rap fan and  idk why  but i gots to have my bass  just what i like  and these beauties have got bass in buckets  the first time i wore them it kinda caught me by surprise  i had no idea how much bass i was getting  to compare it to the best buds i ve owned would be like comparing android to apple  android eviscerates an iphone by a gigantic margin  sound quality is a   and bass is an    i ve rambled way too long  look  if you wanna spend just a little bit more than the normal       bucks you usually spend on some type of headphone and you are a simple person that just needs a dependable long lasting product with pretty good sound quality plus you have had it with nasty earbud falling out of your ear  getting plugged with earwax don t act like it doesn t happen to you  you ain t gotta lie to kick it  then please i implore you to spend a few more bucks on something you will instantly love and will have for many many years  these headphones are the answer  the perfect answer to your problem  the last headphones you will buy for    years or more  i absolutely was not gonna spend basically      for this  no way  but i finally did it and i can t describe how furious i d be if i had been cheap again  i spend a lot of money a year on headphones  but that has been solved  you should also solve your problem  buy this pair of headphones  you can thank me when you write your   star review on amazon  lol  enjoy  thanks for reading this insane review  peace      
297,5.0,                       i m rating these headphones   stars because they excel in what they do  and the price is arguably a bargain   however  i must note that these are not  flat  studio monitor headphones   i ve compared them back to back  numerous times  with a wide variety of music  against the m  x  m  x  r  x  and msr    all of these other audio technica headphones have a more neutral sound than the m  x  the m  x sounds notably more  scooped   with strong bass  sizzling highs  and more hollowed and recessed sound across the mids and mid highs   this sound profile makes the m  x sound exciting and enjoyable with some music  but less suitable for other music  for example  compared to the other headphones i listed  the m  x isn t the best choice for vocals  acoustic instruments  and pop music which has already been mixed with scooped sound in the end  there s no such thing as a  perfect  headphone  since the sound that reaches our ears involves interaction between the headphones and how each piece of music has been recorded and mixed   the best scenario is to have several good headphones  and choose the headphone which you find best suits each piece of music   i think the m  x can have a place in such a collection of headphones  but the m  x wouldn t be my choice if i could have only one headphone here is a brief comparison of the other headphones i listed versus the m  x   the m  x is more neutral overall  and probably a better choice overall than the m  x for a wide variety of music   the m  x is  much  clearer and flatter than the m  x  with more accurate and realistic detail   the m  x lacks a bit of bass for some music  but modest eq can fix that when needed   overall  i like the m  x considerably more than the m  x overall   the r  x has a more spacious sound due to being open back  and also has more detail and more accurate highs than the m  x  while also being less fatiguing than the m  x   the msr  is a better headphone than the m  x for most music   the msr  sort of finds the middle ground among all of the other headphones i listed   the bass is less than m  x  comparable to the r  x and m  x  and a little more than the m  x   the quality of the details and highs is better than the m  x and m  x  comparable to the r  x  though not as smooth as the r  x   and not as good as the m  x      
298,4.0,                       the cable that was included with the headphones was not of high quality  i had to wiggle the cable to get it in the perfect position or else the sound would only come out of one headphone  when i replaced the cable with a higher quality one  the results were fantastic  i ve always enjoyed audiotechnica s products and this one kept up to my expectations  i highly recommend these headphones if you want great sound quality without emptying your wallet      
299,1.0,                       sound quality is good but the headphone jack is made cheaply and the tip will break  sooner or later      months for me   the tip became lodged into my laptop and that took me hours to get out  then when i go buy a replacement online  audio jack size    mm to    mm   i found out that it is incompatiable with the headphones  audio technica s audio jack has grooves that allows it to fit right into the headphones  thus  audio technica requires a very specific audio jack that only they produce  which they overcharge you for   a whole      the entire situation just sounds like audio technica is intentionally selling me cheaply made wiring so i have to go replace it every     months even when i take care of it really well  i don t think i will every buy another audio technica now that i know their sale strategy   the only reason the headphones is relatively cheap themselves is because you d have to spend     every few months to  upkeep  it      
300,2.0,                       the headphones are great for everything  quality is fantastic  comfort is wonderful  but i m going to give it a negative review because i found that they are incredibly easy to break if you accidentally get the wire caught on something when you have to move your head with them on  there is an extremely cheap piece of plastic that keeps the ear pieces from swiveling away from your ear  i included the part that i am referring to in the image  that broke off on the right side of my headset because i had gotten the wire caught on my arm chair and it jerked the a bit if that breaks  the headset is ultimately unusable as it won t fit on your head  the only cheap       piece that is essential in keeping the headset fitting for your head is the piece that will most likely break and make your      headset unusable  come on guys  the product is made in taiwan though i guess i shouldn t be surprised  tried to use the warranty but constantly had issues with customer support      
301,5.0,                       whether it s for music  gaming  or casual enjoyment of audio  these headphones have exceptional clarity and south  bought them on a whim primarily for gaming but have been enjoying listening to music  as well  every detail is crisp is smooth  soothing to my audiophile s delight in terms of comfort  they take a little getting used to and you may need to adjust their positioning a little  once you have it sorted out  they re superb for hours on end      
302,5.0,                       i replaced a corded set of headphones that i was in love with  never mind the brand  i dropped them once  they broke and i was mad even though it was my fault   i was leery on trying the ath m  x headphones but in all honesty   i shouldn t have been  they are comfy for continued music listening  they are not too heavy that they are annoying  i use them with a bluetooth base from my pc and the range is excellent  even in a machine shop   i was very pleased with the battery life and the charging time  i hope you are as happy with yours as i am with mine      
303,4.0,                       it s really good  but the ear enclosures start to degrade after a couple years  which wouldn t be a problem  but the last time i looked into replacing them  the company doesn t offer this models ear enclosures  rather  they only offered the previous models ear enclosures  which were not as nice  so  the noise cancellation has severely suffered if you get these  i d suggest that you look to find ear replacements at the same time  so  you don t have to worry about it in the future   i think it was either the lotion i was using or just my normal skin oil that quickened the degradation process  because only the side that touched my skin is degraded  so  that s another thing to take into consideration       
304,1.0,                       for  high fidelity  audio  the build is extremely cheap  i was a faithful audiotechnica customer   loyal even  i wouldn t dare taint my ear holes with chinesium and cheap bpa full plastics  i raved about audiotechnica to everyone and anyone  not anymore  for the arh m  x either has faulty wiring or impedance issues that cause all noise to shift to the left side of the headphones  the sound quality changes more sporadically than a cleptomaniac with adhd at kohls  i spent nearly       on a god forsaken lemon  and i can t even have lemonade      
305,5.0,                       i m no audiophile but i love music  i m not a professional  i m just a casual listener with a huge passion for music  i tend to be a bit of a bass head  my go to genre regardless of mood or setting is rap  logic is my fav   other reviews do an excellent job of pointing out the extensive qualities of these headphones  they are super comfortable  the detachable cables are great  they are the best sounding headphones for their price  ect   so i am going to focus on just the bass  if you have the same taste for rap bass heavy music  listen up  the bass won t blow you away  you aren t going to feel like you re in the club with the subs banging your head around  but the bass is definitely there  and these by no means sound tinny or empty  it s not a low level of bass because of cheap drivers  it s a low level of bass from careful balancing of the eq  it s a cleaner and clearer bass than i have ever heard from any other headphones  and  cleaner and clearer  does not mean quiet or subdued  even the lowest end frequencies come through plenty loud  but it doesn t mindlessly boost any bass to overpower the rest of the sound  it instead balances it well with the rest of the song  after a few minutes listening to the m   x s i couldn t go back to my sony extra bass headphones  while you may get more oomph from other cans you won t touch the quality or clarity of these so ultimately  like everything else related to music  it comes down to personal preference  if you want quantity of bass over quality of bass these aren t for you  for better or for worse  in my opinion better   these are no beats  but as a bass lover myself  i cannot recommend these enough  in my opinion the quality of the bass far outweighs the tendency towards a flat eq i hope this helps      
306,5.0,                       if you are a true audiophile and love to hear rich sounds within the music and other media than these headphones are a must for the listener  i ordered my pair through amazon and it has been delivered quick  in a little of three days or less  now these headphones are very durable and can maintain it s original form always  i ve had these headphones for over a year and they look perfect as just out the box mainly bc i like to keep my stuff neat and safe   they are quite flexible  though i do not recommend twisting them  they may feel delicate  but it is well crafted and well made with good material for everyday use  the headphone fits perfect and is not to tight  but almost relaxing to wear  however  the cups around the ear may get your ears warm and feel hot  nothing bad but noticeable  it also comes with three cables of different lengths which is pretty nice and useful  it also includes a carrying pouch  not very useful as a hard shell case  but almost like a shield from being scratched  now the sound is excellent  which is why i write this review  with these headphones  you hear a song perfectly  the sound is rich and even hear sounds not hearable in other headphones  i mainly listen to classical songs like the beatles  queen  elvis presley  etc and with audio technica ath m  x the song is only more pleasing to listening  not just songs but also  anything you can listen to and you notice the details and fluent sounds  however  they do not have much base as beats or v modas but base is perfect as it is  hip hop and r b can be enjoyed excellent  finally  these headphones are a must get  they are worth more than   stars  just to good  but do keep in mind they are studio monitor headphones  mainly used in computer for editing  this is nothing to worry about at all  as they offer great quality sound to the listener      
307,4.0,                       i am using these headphones as my daily drivers when i am playing games  listening music or talking with my friends on discord  i previously had hyperx cloud gaming headset but i wanted better quality mic with a better headphone and found out m  x s does great job when paired with antlion modmic  i listen music all the time in the background  even if i am talking with my friends or playing a game so sound quality is really important for me  the other important thing was comfort since i am planning to use my headset for at least   hours a day sound      they sound really good and have a flat neutral sound signature  it is very well balanced  all around really good sound signature where bases don t overwhelm the mids and highs are very clear  this is a closed back headphone so sound stage is not phenomenal or cannot even be compared to an open back headphone but as most people would say these are probably the best budget monitor headphones on the market right now  compared to my old cloud s their reaction is better in mids and highs  where bass feels similar build quality        like a tank  very well build with solid frame but i think in the future i might see some problems with the plastic parts used as hinges where it allows you to rotate the earpiece of the headset  i am not saying that they will brake but they will probably get looser in time and not hold as firm as it is now  all around very solid build comfort        edited update  after trying brainwavz ear pads  i am raising my comfort rating to      now it feels like over ear kind of headphones which i prefer to on ear  size is a lot better compared to stock  original  ear pads  glasses are not an issue anymore  on a side note bass now feels distant which makes sense since distance between my ears and headphone speakers increased with brainwavz ear pads not good  i am wearing glasses and i can safely say that these ear pads are not designed for prolonged use with glasses  i start feeling discomfort after an hour with these headphones  headband is really comfortable but the ear region of this headset have   problems  first one is the material used in the ear pads and the second one is the size of the ear pads  they are small in size and lacks the cushiony feel i had with my hyperx cloud s  they are small for my ears  i can say i have average sized ears  and my ears can feel the pressure of the ear pads since it is more like on ear than over ear kind of headphone with original ear pads  additionally ear pads are not cushioned enough and my glass frame hurts the back of my ears because of that  for these problems i bought replacement ear pads from brainwavz for        and i will update the review once i receive them  m  x s get   out of   from me compared to my previous cloud i gaming headset having       in terms of comfort antlion modmic combo reviewthey work really well with this headphone as long as you put the adhesive base clasps properly  the way antlion advertise on their website  https   antlionaudio com products modmic    using these headphones is not it is supposed to be attached  the problem with their way is that you can t put the mic on base clamp pointing upwards due to headphone s removable connector  trust me i tried before removing and attaching the adhesive base again to the way can be seen from the photos  hope it helps  sorry for photos but can t seem to find a way to rotate them      
308,5.0,                       ive owned these headphones for about three years not  they have been through hell and back  and have long since surpassed my expectations  after these past three years of very heavy useage  the white pair that i have at least  have become dirty on the inside of the ear cups from sweat and skin oils  but are no worse for wear  while the ear padding and headband have started to slowly flake away but are still as comfotable as the day i bought them  the cables are also fantastic quality  only recently has the short straight cable broken  my absolute favorite     and it was entirely my fault as i always got it caught on things by accident  and the end that connects to my phone just disconnected from the plug slowly over time  but three years of abuse  and these have barely flinched  so if you are hesatant to buy these headphones because youre afraid of breaking them  dont be  trust me they can take the abuse      
309,3.0,                       the m  x did not meet my expectations for this price point  compared to the m  x  while the bass was a tad bit more present  the highs and mids  especially the mids  did not blend well overall  because of this  i d rather stick with the m  x for better sound balance and clarity  or even the      panasonic rphje   k      earbuds for more bass  in my experience  i d recommend the m  x for casual listening  or some other brand of headphones for long listening sessions or gaming because these audio technica headphones will clamp and cause discomfort for your ears      
310,4.0,                       pros  build quality is excellent and the design is nice and simple  audio is clear and i have yet to have them peak  comes with plenty of different cables for every occasion  cable is interchangeable and has a locking feature cons  honestly not that big of audio quality difference from my old headset  ear cups could be bigger  don t buy if you have big ears   cushioning isn t as good as i d hoped for the price overall  they are a nice pair of studio grade headphones for their price and while i do highly recommend the i warn anyone with a larger head size or large ear size to be wary as the ear cups are not as large as you d think      
311,4.0,                       i own another cheaper pair of audio technica headphones and am impressed with the sound for the money  that s why i decided to try these  they are good headphones for price but honestly i expected better performance at this price level  the sound is good and  accurate   but if you are looking for great base these are not the ones  the base is only  good   i was looking for  accurate  and these are accurate  though at high volumes they distort  but so do other even more expensive headphones at those volumes  on my system they begin to distort a little at just beyond     volume and would be noticeable to anyone at     volume  i have sony mdrs that i purchased around      that don t begin to distort till around     volume but i wanted to replace those old things  i sent these back  looking for better      
312,4.0,                       i tested the senheiser      ath ad   x  sony mdr        these  these were a good middle ground of all of them  loved the brightness   detail   price of the sony s  but didn t like the cheap flimsy ness    the non existent clamp of the headband      liked the detail  open sound stage  build quality    comfort of the senheisers  didn t like the light clamp    just couldn t justify      for them     the ath   xs was just bizarre  very very light   air  is an apt product line name for them  like the soundstage and detail  but lacked any low end punch    unless you have a pumpkin sized head they slide down your head to where the tops of your ears are holding the weight of them  even with trying the zip tie mod on the  wings   if they d increase tension in the wings i might have chosen them  so went with the hated m  xs  ignored at  st because of all the bad reviews opinions  but they were in my price range so i thought i d try them  i personally feel they took most of the good outta all these  good clamp  but can be uncomfortable after awhile  i have a small slender head so i can see how melon headed ppl would not like them  good detail  but not great  good punch but not muffled  needs a little eq for my taste  very hot  detachable plug which is nice  however both these and the senheisers have notched plugs so you turn the plug  then pull  which to me defeats the purpose of having a removable plug  i thought it was for if you got the cable tangled on something   stood up  it wouldn t tear the cord  it d jus pull free  i guess mabey easier for transporting  all in all  for the price i m happy with them easy to drive  big sales so parts are available  highly modifiable     on a side not it cost me around     to send the other   back  even with prime  so keep that in mind if auditioning  also the ad   xs i got from a camera place in jersey mabey  and took forever to get here to las vegas  i watched them through package tracking   they kicked around jersey for a week before being shipped  then suddenly was here  i ll probably not order anything that far away again  anyway that s my   cents  for this price range for closed backs  get them      
313,5.0,                       these are easily the best wireless headphones i have used to date  the battery life is amazig  easily lasting through    hours of active use before needing to be charged  i usually charge them for    min to   hour per day  but that s really not necessary   just dead battery paranoia from other devices  the sound quality is great  coming in slightly under the sennheiser hd     se s  mainly due to their less spacious sound stage  that s to be expected  though  as these are close backed  where the sennheisers are open back  the pads are quite comfortable unless i get warm  but it does take a bit of fiddling to find the right setting to balance the clamping force  i can easily wear these headphones for     hours with little to no pain or fatigue in my ears  they are also able to easily connect to multiple computers and my phone with no issue remembering each device  so no need to re pair them every time i switch  they can be used while charging  though i wouldn t recommend it  both because i haven t checked whether that might damage them  and because the one time i tried it there was a significant loss of sound quality  poorly isolated ground  maybe    the one thing i would wish for is an updated version with usb c charging instead of micro usb  as i would rather carry fewer cables      
314,5.0,i owned a pair of the original m  x  bought these as a replacement after they were stolen and was excited that they added bluetooth functionality  until i used the bluetooth functionality  overall these are good  but the bluetooth is abysmal  see the bad   and strikes me as an afterthought in the design  considering how much cheaper the ath m  x s  not bt  are  i d say go for the other pair   the good   very clean  symmetrical design with relatively minimal branding  these are the best looking  audiophile  headphones   comfortable to wear for hours on end    superb sound quality  after having these     earbuds just don t cut it anymore    buttons on the left ear cup make it easy to tell left from right without having to look at the headphones    battery life is good  with minimal use it usually lasts me about a month    the cable  this one is better than the original m  s  both ends are    mm and the whole cable can be replaced by any ol  aux cable in a pinch    noise cancellation is good  you can still hear the outside world but it s quieter  sometimes i wear these just to hush things   the bad   there s an audible high pitched whine hiss screeching when bluetooth is on  this made my ears ring after a while and i try to avoid using it  which sucks because its the main feature i bought them for    range for bluetooth is awful  works fine if you carry your phone in a breast pocket but otherwise cuts out    bluetooth of this low quality is not worth an additional      i don t know what they were thinking    i don t see why the included    mm cable needs a button mic on it since the headphones already have both built into the ear cup  i wish they d spend that manufacturing cost on a better bluetooth radio    i live in the damp pacific northwest and have noticed some rusting around the right ear cup  this could also be from sweat but it s notable regardless    they are hot to wear when doing anything physical  or in the heat 
315,5.0,                       beyond the stellar reviews this product has across the internet  it s pretty life changing if it s you re first pair of upscale headphones  like me   purchased this months ago and it still works flawlessly  i only use it at home so it has stayed clean and has no problems  maybe avoid using this on the go because they re fairly bulky   yesrs laterstill going strong  the audio quality has not perceptibly gone down so i m keeping them around i did have to replace the ear pads and bought a headband cover because the white paint started shedding which was a mild annoyance  that being said it s normal wear and tear that s to be expected  no regrets  i also bought an audiotechnica turntable after this purchase and i m an at fanboy now going other first      
316,5.0,                       i m something of an audiophile   a sound snob  if you will   i bought these solely due to another reviewer s comment that one can hear everything that was recorded  breaths  buzzing  etc     i love the quality of the sound in these headphones   they are mostly noise cancelling  tested now on about a dozen airplanes   i m not adamant that bass be obnoxious for me to enjoy what i listen to  but i find the level of bass to be complimentary to the rest of the sound   in short  i believe these to be the best headphones i ve had the pleasure of using      
317,3.0,                       these specific cans are clean in the highs and deep in the lows  they definitely sound better over bluetooth  powered by it s internal dac amp  or externally via designated dac  plugged into a phone audio device directly they perform very well and are will still out perform most intro audio fidelic headphones out there right now  at least for the price  plug it into a good amp dac and you will be surprised at how well these will handle all bass notes and seperation between the lows and highs  i was expecting a lot when i purchased these having read other  critical reviews  thinking these cannot possibly this good  but the reviews got to me so i purchased a pair  not regreting it at all  worth      of the money you are paying  just noticed my  battery lasts about  hrs before i need to charge it again     really brings down the review  but there is bound to be a bad few in the bunch      
318,5.0,                       i ve been using m  s for a while now  and this pair is just what i expected  the bluetooth is good  though i occasionally get some crackling while using it  especially when connected to my tv   not sure if that s caused by the tv  the headphones  or just the distance   i m not hugely a fan of the cord that came with them  as the trrs connector causes some issues with my computer s audio output  i m not certain whether that s a common issue  but it s there  the cord works fine when hooked up to my fiio e  k      
319,2.0,                       the sound quality was poor  there was to much static sound from the speakers when listening to someone is talking or music is playing  even for dj ing it has poor sound quality  in addition the sound isn t sharp and the bass is non existent  the speakers for the price point are just far to low quality as well  the foam pads developed a crack in less than a week of use  they are primarily plastic  while some plastic are very firm and feel sturdy  the plastic feels cheap and like it could break easily  i was hope to no have to get an expensive replacement for my older sennheiser pro headphones but looks like i ll still have to  i had a pair of audiotechnicas from a programmer friend and they worked great but these were just awful      
320,5.0,                       i buy this headphone for a person use of listening  movies and etc  the most reason i trust this  i saw how many people reacts to noise canceling and sound loss   leaking sound  its very good  since you put these ear cups together or on your head the noise will disappear and thats makes me happy  overall i m thrilled  and this brand its from the heart of japan so there s no doubt about it      
321,4.0,                       many reviews make these headphones seems like they are the absolute best  they re a solid choice  but don t be fooled into thinking you re going to have a euphoric listening experience i m an audio hobbyist and have experience with some moderately nice car audio sq gear and have made some nice home audio speakers as well  so those experiences alter my perspective of what good music can sound like and the experience it can give you  you won t get that from these headphones  but they are still nice  i use them pretty much every day on my computer  if i want to have a fun listening experience i go to my living room or car      
322,5.0,                       my beats are getting old and are being held together by some tape it was time for some new cans     it came down to these or the bose  these were my pick and at      they were a steal  i put them in my cart for a couple of days when i saw     off the price  off the bat i got these to use them wired to my home stereo system   they sound fantastic better then the beats they are replacing  as for the blue tooth part of these cans they are not loud enough for me and sometime they are a pain in the but to connect but that my system your results may vary  these are being used for good old rock n roll music            
323,5.0,                       you of course get the great quality m   headphones  and the sound quality is amazing when plugged directly in   hands down the best clarity i ve ever gotten from any cans   i ve had multiple pairs of sony  the top end status audio over ear phones  and these blow those away   the bluetooth connection seems to be a bit fuzzy  when there s nothing playing  almost like a faint white noise   but i can t attribute that to the headphones  as i ve only tried them with my phone   but you don t notice it when anything is playing   no issues when plugged in directly   i would definitely recommend these if you are thinking about purchasing a set      
324,5.0,                       if you are the type of listener that enjoys a balanced sound quality  no boomy bass  no harsh highs   these are it     if i could make one teeny complaint  the soundstage is not that wide  it is not so narrow that it is suffocating  but if you enjoy a large soundstage  look elsewhere  if you enjoy your music pure and neutral sounding with the bass  midrange and treble each getting their moments in the sun  these headphones are for you  i have these hooked up to an ifi headphone amp at the      setting and they are perfect for me  as i enjoy a bit of honey like warmth to my music  try listening to money by pink floyd  breezin  by george benson or grace kelly s saxophone  you will be in heaven        
325,5.0,                       absolutely great   very good value   you ll never want to put an earbud on again   i listen to nin and am constantly hearing something i ve never heard before in other audio devices   for example  hearing crickets and katydids throughout ghosts    and at about the     m mark  a tv or feint talking   it sounds like reznor is sitting at a piano with the mic set up outside every other experience has been great   i also listen a lot to christ whitley   it s amazing how you can virtually hear a foot tap that you never knew was in the songs   you can even tell which direction his head turns from the mic when he sings   you can practically see him moving around just by subtle changes in the sound      
326,5.0,                       best birthday present i have ever bought for my husband  hes a huge gamer and these were the ones he planned on getting  we added the mic  not included in purchase  the sounds is great and he can t hear me standing   feet from him with them on  great      
327,5.0,                       brought this for my son for christmas   he couldn t take them off   his buddy has beats  but likes the m  x better and half the price   we passed them around so the family could listen   big mistake     now everyone wants them  even the wife   i consider myself an audiophile  that s why i brought these when my son asked for the m  x   i wanted him to know what a good pair of head phones sounded like   he was very pleased   i was highly impressed with the sound coming from these   good bass  clear mids and highs   these are well built  detachable cable  with   variations   would highly recommend the m  x s over any other head phones under      and some that are more       
328,5.0,                       i wanted to get a pair of bose qc   s but they just won t go down much in price and i don t have that kind of money as of yet  so  i did my research for a while and finally decided to give these a go as i heard a lot about audio technica  holy  crap  these headphones   these headphones  as a musician  i m very picky in what works for me  but these handphones are a perfect balance for what anyone should be looking for  now  yes i know there are better out there  but realistically speaking not everyone has that kind of money to shell out  these though  i m surprised they re even the price they are  i would ve thought they would be      more  the quality is awesome  not too much of anything  so the sound is well balanced for mixing and mastering as well as just nodding to stuff  when you know  you know  all i gotta say      
329,5.0,                       the clarity in sound is so crazy  to think i ve been walking around for years with crappy headphones just makes me mad now  i ve used beats  bose  sony  etc  but  i m tellin  y all  these are the headphones for you if you value music as a whole  meaning  for those bass heads  people who love bass   i honestly wouldn t even say this are bad in bass  they re quite good  however  not as good as those designed with that in mind these headphones are for understanding and listening to music at it s fullest  i believe  i make beats music and these are too good  i d almost say i d wear them for normal use to be honest if you love music  these are it      
330,5.0,                       i have had my audio technica s for several months now  and absolutely love them  incredible sound and build quality at this price point   the hype is absolutely real  go search for the best headphones under     dollars and these constantly top the list there is no bluetooth or fancy features  some might even try to argue they are a little generic looking   but let me tell you this  these headphones are not about style  or what s current  fancy colors etc  they are about playing music  and at professional sounding quality   clarity and power is phenomenal  the comfort is wonderful  noise blocking is great and they are tough and durable do yourself a favor and get a pair   yes  they are worth every nickel  throw away your    dollar gym ear pieces  don t even contemplate buying overpriced junk like beats  and grab the very best headphones in the world for under     bucks      
331,5.0,                       i ve never purchased professional headphones  i m used to cheaper headphones or earbuds  for the past year i ve used      lg earbuds  and let me just say that they have nothing on these headphones  i don t know if i should be comparing earbuds to headphones  but it s all i ve got   the sound is crystal clear and everything is balanced  i just received these   hours ago and cannot set them down  the bass is rich and i can hear every little detail of each song that i listen to  the headphones make my ears a little hot and the sound leaks out considerably  these are just minor problems  though  these certainly are the best value headphones under       i highly recommend      
332,4.0,                       i purchased these headphones to replace my beats that i used for pc gaming and i was not disappointed  these headphones pick up ambient audio as makes the subtle noise crystal clear  i am a fan of the headphones design  these are the first headphones that do not hurt or irritate my ear after long use with my glasses  i am especially a fan of the headphones having a cable lock system to ensure the cable isn t unplugged from the headphones at random the only negative about these heads phones is that after a long period of use the headphones make a loud crackle noise but i believe it may just be these headphones or a issue with my microphone  i have yet to figure it out the cause but this only happens like once in   months which  overall this in my opinion is a great buy and worth every penny  i will most likely buy this brand model again because i like it so much      
333,5.0,                       ath m  x is one of those gems in the audio industry  and they proved again that this headphones is definitely worth the price for the sound quality you get  from using multiple headphones like the m  x  dt     dt     etc    i could say this is definitely in my top    sound is subjective and difficult to please everyone  but the ath m  x manages to do that on the majority of people  my only complain is the highs were a bit harsh i guess compared to my other headphones  the bass was stronger than what i expected despite people telling me that the bass lacks on it  i m a bit dissapointed because the price went down     a day after i bought them      
334,5.0,                       hoo boy  when i got my first pair of m  s back in       that was a whirlwind of good sound  a few years later  when i had sold them to a friend  i decided to grab a pair of m  x s i am so glad i did  the sound is as good as ever  and a removable cable inspired me to make some modifications  i added on velour earpads  a braided cable  a microphone  and a wool headband get the m  x s if you want fantastic headphone sound at an affordable price that you can easily add on to      
335,5.0,                       i was thinking about how i ve had this pair of headphones longer than any other pair before breaking  and looked in my amazon order history to find that i ve had these for over   years    years of taking them back and forth to the office every day and taking them on every out of town trip  when i m not using them  i wrap the cord around them and throw them in my bag  i have never owned anywhere near as durable a pair of headphones  every  daily use  headphone i have ever owned lasted less than   year to under   years at the most  i have treated these ones no better than any of the others  sound quality is as good as anything in the price range and much better than many at higher prices if you re talking bose or beats      
336,5.0,                       wow  what is there to say  other than you re getting a quality pair of studio headphones that are acceptable for daily use in just about everything  my main reason for getting these was because i needed a pair of over the ear headphones for work that would isolate me and block out more noise since my company s office has an open floor plan whether i m at work coding and working on things while jamming out to music  or if i m home watching videos  playing video games  or even playing guitar with these plugged into my amp  so i don t disturb neighbors or my girlfriend   they just work  these worked as expected  came with   cables  and the audio quality is top notch  trust me  as someone who used to just buy beats skullcandy or whatever was the latest  gaming headset   the sound quality here is amazing  it took me a little while to adjust  but now nothing compares with the crisp and clear sound that these put out  i ve found myself enjoying bands i didn t use to like  noticing sounds in games that i never noticed before and so much more buy them  totally worth the      price tag  but if you can get them for cheaper   you d be foolish not to grab these      
337,2.0,                       overly siblant  s  and  t  sounds lisp   very disappointed thought they would break in and did not   missed my    day return window   the   xs were thr best pair of headphones i ever owned to those who claim it is that way because it has more detail  presence  sound stage or is more natural sounding  i have to call bs   i never heard any acoustic insturment or sound in nature do that excepct when reproduced      
338,5.0,                       with the date of this review  i will have owned these wonderful headphones for   years    months    week  and   days  back when i bought these  had previously gone though a multitude of various headphones that would be suitable for daily use while i worked  none of them lasted and i was always dis satisfied with the audio quality  i finally did some hardcore research and found these beauties when i first started using them  i was not a fan of how they felt on my head  i figured  well  maybe i just needed to break them in a little bit and they should hopefully get comfy  glad i did  a week or two after purchase  they were snug and comfy on my head  i could easily wear them for my entire work day which wasn t less than   hours audio quality  i was blown away that headphones could have this rich of sound  however  it also depends on the quality of the music sound etc you are listening too  honestly  listening to anything from streaming from youtube to uncompressed flac files sound excellent  they re not kidding when they say these are  studio monitor headphones   they mean business if you re checking out the pictures i have attached  you ll see that the earcup leather is finally showing wear and tear  like i said  i ve used these daily for almost three years  at work and at home for gaming and video editing  beyond that  the sound quality has not diminished  the sound is just as rich and full ad the day i got them the reason i m writing this review after so many years  to show a testament to how great these things are  and because i m picking up another pair to keep at work  and keep my current pair at home  i love these darn things so much that i really felt compelled to review them audio technica    thank you for these headphones  i am really not looking forward to the day these finally kick the bucket    but i know that won t be for a very long time      
339,4.0,                       do you need reference headphones  do you really   i ve had these for a few years and they re great  just please remember these cans are purpose built  if you re more into jamming then look for something with better bass  these have none   if you re a gamer grab something cheaper with a mic on it      
340,5.0,                       this is perhaps one of the best headphones i ve ever had  sound is well defined across between bass  mids and highs and it can be loud  not that it focus on doing that  but it has a really good volume one major  gigantic disadvantage is that none of the cables that come with it have phone controls or mic  and the connector is proprietary on the headphone  meaning no     to     cable with a control and mic could fill that gap  as such  it is useless to take calls but if you re just in the  listening  portion  it is hard to get anything better than this at this price range      
341,5.0,                       pros solid build quality  no extra bells and whistles  stay firm on head even when shaking violently    different audio cables  solid sound quality  proper amount of natural bass  sound canceling a bit cons  hard extra firm on top of head initially  thank god they break in fast   if you are doing anything where you are talking alot while wearing these it can be hard to hear yourself since they block out         sound     
342,5.0,                       anyone who is serious about audio knows that these are some of the best headphones on the market  especially for the price  as with any piece of professional equipment  making sure they are properly set up is important  being flat response  they have to be eq d in order to sound their best  out of the box  they will sound a bit trebly and airy  but when you dial in the proper eq  you ll find that these can take a beating  i love using these headphones for video editing and mixing because they will give you the truest representation of what you re hearing  people who borrow them can t believe the sound quality and how dynamic they are  they can also be folded to be compact in a bag  the only negative i can think of is that they can feel a bit plastic y  not to say they are cheaply constructed  but if they were stepped on or bent the wrong way  i could see them running the risk of snapping  specially near the ear pieces  all in all  these were the last pair of professional headphones i ve purchased  almost   years ago  and i haven t looked back  i laugh to myself when people try to tell me their beats or sony s are better  you won t find better headphones for the price      
343,5.0,                       i had these headphones  yrs  the headphones are durable and the sound quality on these audio technica ath m  x is awesome and price is very responsible  if want good headphones these are it  i would definitely recommend this headphone to friend      
344,5.0,                       amazing  comfortable  great sounding  and generous amount of cables with it  since i am a musician and composer  i have been through a number of high end headphones  the last pair i had cost twice as much and i couldn t wear them for extended periods of time  these headphones do not have that problem  i can easily wear these for hours on end with no discomfort  i also like they gave a few cables  instead of just one like others do  that really give you some options about how and where you would use your headphones bottom line is  i will be going back to audio technica in the future if their future headphones are this good or better      
345,4.0,                       for the price  i don t think there s any headphone out there that could beat the sound quality of the m  x  unfortunately for me  after very short use i started experiencing sharp pain in my ears due to the super sharp and crisp sound which lead to permanent tinnitus in both ears  for the most part i was pretty careful with the volume i listened at and kept it at no more than      if you re not accustom to high end headphones like i wasn t  i suggest slowly easing in to it and let your ears get accustom to the new sound quality  if you re ears starts to hurt  take a week long break before using it again or quit using it all together and find other headphones      
346,5.0,                       an amazing pair of headphones  my previous set of headphones were about    years old  they were the      sony mdr xd    stereo headphones                         and they were finally starting to give out  the sony headset was actually quite nice  one of the few problems i had with it was that inside the earcups  there was not enough space for my ears the m  x completely fixes this problem  there is ample amount of space for your ear  i ve done some     hour gaming sessions and it s been completely solid  you ll most likely forget that they are on  as others have mentioned  if you are in a warmer space  since these are completely over the ear  you might have some sweaty ears  this hasn t been the case for me so far  my favorite thing has been listening to songs that i ve listened to dozens of times before  the same song will give you a new experience as the headphones bring out the minute details  it sort of ruins other speakers and headphones experience from the standpoint of not hearing the same amount of details my only complaint is that the headband could use a little more padding  i found that if you get the headphones adjusted for your head  the weight of the headphones distributes nicely across your ears and the top of your head      
347,5.0,                       i bought this about two years ago  i use these headphones every day and love them a lot  they are very comfortable to wear and i can wear them for hours without my head hurting  the sound is slightly v shaped  but it is not that bad  the headphones come with a bunch of different wires so you can choose whichever you prefer  i like the way these headphones fold in and the pouch that came with them  i use them for light gaming as well and they are decent enough  these are a really great pair of headphones if you don t want to spend a lot of money but want something comfortable and with good quality sound      
348,1.0,                       my pair probably had some manufacturing problems  the wired jack doesn t seem to work and i m having trouble pairing them with a device other than my phone  sounds great but kind of useless  the pause button doesn t have a double click to skip function which is a bummer having used beats for a while edit  after using as a backup pair for the last year or so  i really hate how this pair refuses to connect with my phone  great bluetooth range means that every time i try to turn them on  they pair with my ipad  no way to have them pair after being turned on  because selecting them in my bluetooth devices will not override them being paired with another device  like beats can   avoid at all costs      
349,5.0,                       these headphones have lasted me at least   years and show no sign of giving up  i use them very regularly for computer gaming  and listening to music  with the right equipment to compliment these headphones  a good dac amplifier for computer stuff   they are without parallel  they are light and comfortable  although i have replaced the earpads once when i bought fabric pads  which was totally just personal preference  nothing wrong with the stock pads   and once again when they became impossible to clean  if these ever break  surely they must eventually    i ll happily buy another pair  audio technica earned a customer for life in me through these headphones      
350,5.0,                       i bought these for my son for his birthday this past year  i wouldn t normally pay so much for headphones  but  my son is currently learning to play bass  and like any    year old  he loves his music passionately  he s also an avid movie editor  so  after doing his own research  asked for them  i was sceptical at first  but my kid is pretty good at researching the things he can not buy with his own allowance and giving justifiable and logical reasons for wanting needing something normally out of the question  he pretty much had me convinced  but i called my best friend who is a professional drummer and teacher to make sure   are these really worth the price   he immediately said absolutely and that they would serve him well and for a long time  long story short  on the day they arrived  after my son had finished gushing over them  he let me give them a try  wow  i have never enjoyed listening to music or movies with headphones  but i can t seem to live without these now  yes  i loved them so much my bestie got me a pair of my own for christmas  these are remarkably comfortable so no issues with using them for an extended length of time and the sound is crisp and clear over a range of really loud or really soft music  it s easy to focus on a single instrument while enjoying a song  i even love these for movie and tv watching on my laptop  also  audio books are amazing now  i never knew what difference quality headphones can make  a bargain at twice the price  as they say  they re the best headphones i ve ever used  period  audio technica has earned a lifelong customer  well  maybe two  as my son is absolutely in love with his own pair as well      
351,5.0,                       these headphones provide exactly what i expected  excellent sound quality  pretty comfortable to wear  even for long periods of time  and the interchangeable cables are great for whatever length you need at the time  i ve had these for about   months now and they continue to be my daily headphones  for reference  i listen to music    hours day i will mention that i replaced the original earcups with the shure hpaec    ear cups as those are a little thicker  my ears would press against the hard plastic on the inside of the earphone but these thicker ear pads helped with that do i wish it came with a hard case  yes  is the soft pouch good enough for carrying them around  yes sound quality      build quality      comfort         made better  for me anyway  with the new ear cups      
352,5.0,                       these are my sixth pair of headphones and are making me wish i had just bought these to begin with   let me start by explaining what i wanted from a set of headphones   as strange as this may sound  sound quality was not my primary interest   my hearing is not that good and sound separation for me is a concept not a reality   that said  things sound way  way better with these headphones than anything else i ve tried   i wanted a good quality headphone with great battery life and a comfortable over the ear fit   secondly  i wanted them with bluetooth that would pair easily and allow me to range away from the source without dropping the playback  finally  they needed to fold up for travel and be adaptable to iphone  ipad  pc  tv  etc this is the first set of headphones i ve owned that do all those things and do it well   the sound actually has separation that i can hear   the battery life is fantastic and the recharge time is short   i can also use them corded if i wish   i can leave my ipad in one end of the house and they still play just fine in the other end of the house without dropping the playback   comfort   comfort is different for each individual   this is the first set of headphones that are actually comfortable for me   i did replace the ear pads with a set of aftermarket pads that another reviewer recommended  and it made all the difference in the world   i wear glasses and there is no pressure on them at all  the headband is the right width  and the pads fit entirely over  around my ears   i ve worn these for eight hours straight and they were still comfortable   my ears didn t feel pressured  they didn t get hot or numb  i actually can forget i m even wearing them   they also fold up and will pack nicely in my suit case and appear to be quite sturdy in construction   the noise canceling works also   when i m listening to a video or to music  i hear no outside noise at all   i m sure that is in part due to my hearing  but they do work better at canceling out room noise than any of my other pairs did so  all things considered i couldn t be happier with this set of headphones   for me and my needs they are awesome      
353,5.0,                       these headphones are a big upgrade compared to my previous headphones  the sound quality is drastically different  but it s most likely due to using the other pair of headphones for years  these headphones feels great and can wear them all day without feeling like your ears are being crushed  definitely has great noise cancellation and they keep all the audio from exiting the headphones  i couldn t hear anyone knocking my door with these on  i m using it to play my games and it works just fine  my only minor issue with these headphones is that the bass feels like it doesn t exist in my opinion  i feel like it s worth it for what i paid for it  not bad for a pair of under      headphones  again  the only thing this thing is missing is some good bass      
354,4.0,                       i am a casual listener  unwinding with music at the end of the day helps me get through each day of stress and hardships  i had been using the earbuds that came with my phone  wired akg tuned earbuds by samsung  which were just fine and i liked them a lot  unfortunately  the right earbud stopped working and so i was stuck with only the left side and decided it s time to shop for a headphone because samsung does not sell those any longer  because smartphones are slowly getting rid of the audio jack  i wanted to get a wireless headphone so i can continue to use it with future phones  but as much as i would have loved to buy the new sony wh     xm   anything over      is a bit too much for me  so after doing some research  i came down to the taotronics tt bh     was for      and the audio technica ath m  xbt  on sale for        here is what i noticed when using the two headphones     both come with bluetooth      which is nice   both are fairly comfortable for me  maybe because the taotronics are less expensive  i feel less worried about future wear and tear  the audio technica ear cups are softer and more plushier    which up to each individual is a good or bad thing  but that doesn t mean the taotronics are hard or uncomfortable   audio technica definitely wins in the sound quality department in my opinion  which would make sense considering the cost  listening to the taotronics afterward gave me a headache  it has a more thumping muddy enclosed sound to it compared to the clean spacious bass and clear vocals on the audio technica  that being said  i was fine with the sound quality from the taotronics before i heard audio technica    just a noticeable difference that i found between the two   less sound leak on the taotronics  i was actually surprised at how much sound leaked from the audio technica  and was a bit disappointed    but it wasn t so bad to return it i can t say much about the button controls  build  or battery life  but from the amount of time i ve had them  i d say they re both pretty good in those areas  ultimately  the sound of the audio techinca won me over the taotronics      
355,5.0,                       transitioning from a cheap and mainstream headphones  i would describe the experience as  three dimensional   my jaw dropped for the first    minutes when i played overwatch   the laser sizzling  metals making clanking sounds  even the sound of mccree smoking a cigar were heard for the first time  this headphone truly brings the sound effects to another level  felt like i was playing the game in a movie theater moderate bass  very clear treble  no muffling in mid range  very comfortable even with thick glass frames tested with different songs  but the quality difference with       usd headphones are not as noticeable  to me  the headphone added more realism and clarity for games than music      
356,2.0,                       i admit  i love the sound  and i wish that was the end of the story   it s inconceivable that they would choose to make the    mm connection hole so small  that the majority of standard cables will not fit   i literally have   different cables and only   of them will work   there is absolutely no reason for audio technica to cripple these headphones in this way   consider me very disappointed      
357,5.0,                       no complaints about these  they re comfortable  though a little tight initially   and come with two high quality cables  perfect desk headphones for work  they seem to make environmental noises about half as disruptive  which is about as good as i feel like i can get without active noise cancellation  which gives me a migraine   definitely     for value for your money      
358,5.0,                       loved eveything about them  sound is audiophile   studio accurate without being sterile  so good     hrs battery  bluetooth or wired  get a longer wired cord  you will need that      
359,5.0,                       these headphones are crazy awsome  i ve worn them all day without irritation etc  they are extremely comfortable  when you have them on the music is very clear  if you re looking for a headset for music with alot of base you might want to get something else as in v modas  but if you are normal like me and listen to music with lyrics these headphones will make you jizz your pants from excitement  they seem to be very loud when you have them on  but once you take them off to see if other people can hear your music you ll notice you cant hear a thing  when i had bought this product it was on sale for      i was kinda regretting it expecting terrible headphones  but once i received them i was amazed by how great they were  if you want over ear beats by dre suck up your ego and go with these  they are alot cheaper and have way better music quality  another great thing with these is that i can use them as a speaker for when i sleep  i would just turn out the thingys and turn the music volume all the way and it will act as a speaker  i m not sure if it ll damage the headphones  they prob will   but i don t care i love music and i got no speakers so yeah      
360,5.0,                       i originally purchased this item in black a few years back  and they were the best headphones that i had  they beat out my old pair of sony headphones  as well as the beats studio     headphones  when the headphones got damaged  entirely my fault   i decided to get a new pair in white  this product   they re the exactly the same  as i d expected for sound quality  these headphones are clear  and very well balanced  they re not muddy like the beats  and i use them daily for gaming  video editing  and a lot of music listening  edm and hip hop   as for build quality  my pair has been dropped a few times  and i can t tell  the paint isn t chipped anywhere  the hinges perform exactly the same  they re incredible comfortable to wear for longer periods of time  and the earcups sure help with that  but the earcups aren t only comfortable  they do a really good job with canceling out background noise  not the best job  my beats had actual noice cancellation  but still come second place despite not having actual noice cancellation technology      
361,5.0,                       i was disillusioned when i returned the sony      xm s  they were kind of my last hope  i thought  to find a pair of bluetooth cans with the sound quality i wanted  the bose qc series was a little muddy for me  and it turned out that the sonys  while fantastic at nr  had a similar problem  i tried the m  xbt after reading some online reviews  and wow  i can hear every track  there is just enough punch in the bass  and the mids and highs are so clean  i hadn t even thought about going with non nr headphones  but the seal is quite good  and nothing much gets through  seriously  if you have been disappointed with bluetooth headphones because of audio quality  give these a try  they don t look quite as good  but i don t really care  they sound fantastic  and in the end that is what i wanted      
362,1.0,                       the sound of these is great  but everything else i have issues with  the headband in particular is not very comfortable  with very little padding  the cuffs are not great  and aren t really big enough  they press really hard against my head  which is good i guess if you need to block out a lot of sound  but i don t  it just makes these more uncomfortable but the biggest issue is that it has some sort of power saving feature where if it s not being sent music for a while  it goes to sleep  so if you get a short sound or something  like a discord notification  oops  guess you just don t get to hear that  sorry  oh even for normal music and whatnot  if it s been in sleep mode  here s a delay for you while it wakes up oh  and i get these pops and crackles every now and then if music isn t going  which makes these very unpleasant to use  i think it s again the power saving thing  and i know it s not my setup  because i had another pair of headphones before this that had no issues i was going to give this like a   star  but no  no  in everything except sound quality specifically  my old     pair beats out this nearly      pair  that should not happen      
363,4.0,                       i own a bose ae  pair  used sony mdrxb   bt for a year and half  tried bose qc   for    days and bought these a week ago  without a doubt these are the best sounding headphones out of all of the above here is my honest comparison of these headphones with all of the various headphones i have used so far comfort   even though these headphones are not too heavy  they do exert a lot of clamping force around my jaw area  i use my headphones at work and commute daily  around     hours daily   and my jaw tends to hurt after   to   hours of listening and i have to remove them for    min before i could wear them again  i will wait for another week or two to see if it gets better  out of all the headphones i owned and used   bose ae s are the most comfortable   i used them for     hours straight on some days and didn t feel any pressure around my jaw  ever build quality  these headphones have very good build quality  the head band is quite flexible and the headphones look like they will last the daily abuse of commuting  compared to bose ae  and sony  these seems as good if not better than them in this department music and sound quality  this is where these headphones blow away every other pair of headphones i owned  i am not an audiophile at all   but i do listen to various genres of music     hours daily and i can confidently say that these headphones are amazingly clear and have very balanced tones  don t expect too much bass like mdrxb   bt though price  i got them for      on amazon and they are worth every damn penny conclusion  one of the best sounding headphones that one can buy for        provided that you can bear the discomfort from long listening sessions      
364,5.0,                       after using these for a few weeks my conclusion is  they are good     no  bass  whatsoever  if you want to hear even the tiniest of bumps  do not get this product  i think this is what other reviewers suggest when saying  not a good headset for casual easy listening    excellent sound though  i can hear things i ve never heard before in music  crazy  works great for voip calls  i have a dedicated mic  so i just mean the output part   pretty comfortable  idk like   out of     i can only compare to something like bose unless you are recording music and need accurate sounds  i would argue to avoid these headphones   so  those who only game for example should probably not buy this headset imo      
365,5.0,                       i am not an audiophile but i ve owned many pairs of headphones and earbuds over the years  these have honestly given me an experience above and beyond anything i ve expected  i love the inclusion of   different detatchable cables  it definitely improves portability  excuse the layman s terms  but i find the sound of these headphones to be very deep  it sounds like there is a great amount of space between insturments  for example  you hear things in songs that you havn t quite been able to hear before  i d also like to point out that whether you ve got these hooked up to a desktop computer  mobile phone  or home theater amp  they always sound great  i d definitely recommend these to anyone willing to spend a little more on a longterm pair of headphones     
366,5.0,                       i bought these a number of months back   i wanted a high fidelity last set of headphones and that was pretty much what i got   these are most comparable to studio monitors in their reproduction  with response that is very flat   you can eq them into whatever sound profile you most enjoy if you are more of a bass head or whatever as they have no issues reproducing any frequency   these headphones are so good at reproducing detail that i unfortunately uncovered some issues with my motherboard s circuitry notes  i have a big head and wear glasses   i have to fiddle with my glasses because the phones are fairly tight on my big dumb head   if i take off my glasses i can wear these for long periods but if my glasses are on i have to mitigate note    a lot of the time i use these as speakers   set on the desk with cups rotated open towards me   they have sufficient volume for this to be an actual usecase without getting blown out      
367,5.0,                       i m olympia s husband  we share the acct  so this is my review of the  cans i just snagged i got these to replace my sony mdr studio headphones that are literally over    years old  they served me well  but one of the drivers has finally fizzed out  so i was going to buy a replacement  the reviews for my sony s continue to stand out  but i wanted to try something else  so the former reviews of the ath m  x made me want to experience them i have to say that right off the bat  the fact that they come with   different cables with a twist lock jack is a great idea  short  long and coily i have replaced the cord on my sony s a couple times since owning them along with the plug from use and abuse  this just makes sense next  the fact that the fold down and are fairly portable is another great aspect  solid construction  not flimsy at all the included pouch is a nice touch the listening experience  very nice sound stage  to my ears  a little wider and more spatially fuller than my sony s  frequency response is stellar  i put in a track that i had just finished mixing and was able to hear some tweaks that needed to be made in the upper end of the frequency range that i hadn t heard with my temporary earphones  these have great low end response without being boomy or overbearing  just tight accurate bass  mids are full and well balanced and the highs are crisp without being harsh i am breaking them in while enjoying the band  tauk   and the depth and mix is really well defined in these headphones i am really enjoying them and hope to do so for a long time to come great bang for the buck after you ve been bamboozled by brands like  beats  and want to try a real set of headphones that reproduce music accurately  as it was intended to sound  grab a pair of these  you ll appreciate your music more no hype  just great sound enjoy      
368,5.0,                       i m extremely pleased with these headphones   they were a little tight on my head at first but after loosening them up for about a week  they re much more comfortable now and i can wear them for several hours at a time   i use these in a home music studio setting and the audio quality is just as good as my studio monitors   i would highly recommend these to anyone that works with music   i also really like the special edition blue color   not that it affects the performance of the headphones at all  but it s my favorite color so it makes me happy   as others have said  these probably aren t what you want if you re just listening to music  that s not what they re designed for and there s cheaper options that will sound better for casual listening      
369,5.0,                       going to make this review basic and simple extremely clear highs and mids  bass is there but compared to the studios  fall a little short  of course  that s ok very ok comfort is great though  i would love to see the headband s cushioning to be on the edge of the headbands  i can feel a little discomfort from there but  nothing to make me take them off after for how ever many hours  leather on the cups are fantastic almost to the point of figuring out what exact material it is to use on my couch  chair  anything  these aren t noise canceling headphones but  put a very well mask on to give a great sensation that it is extra cables make a perfect bow to tie it all together  the cables are durable and perfect for any situation nor do they get tangled  there s a catch though  the way the locking mechanism works on the headphones mean those   wires are the only ones you can use from my knowledge  in conclusion                                                               like everyone says                                                          these are                                                                   the best headphones for under      dollars      
370,5.0,                       this review is for the audio technica ath m  x professional studio monitor headphoneswe use these headphones to monitor while recording our show  the sound on these headphones has superb quality  the highs are sharp  the midrange is enjoyable  and the lows have a solid punch it is normal to have headphones on for a couple of hours at a time while recording and editing  and for the first time i found a set of headphones that extended use leaves no fatigue even though there is significant weight  i think that the added weight is what gives the feel of a solid construction  the cans have an extremely soft cushioned and fits comfortably around your ears  the band across the top is hardly noticeable and is padded with the same as the cups  they are full sized headphones  however  they do fold up for easier transport they are over the ear and are very comfortable  because they don t have the open back they keep out ambient noise while keeping sound leakage to a minimum i especially like having a removable cable  this headset comes with   included  all of them have a locking mechanism to keep the cable from being pulled out  you get a short straight one  a longer straight one and a coiled one  this also comes with a screw on   adaptor  that does not connect to the shorter cable   you re no longer forced to make a choice between cables when buying your headphones final conclusioni have been highly impressed with all the aspects of these headphones  for the price and quality they can t be beat      
371,5.0,                       brilliantly detailed sound   if you re looking for  overly  heavy bass  but some beats or the sony extra bass headphones   if you want a great neutral  precise sound  these headphones are a good buy the battery lasts forever  and they sound really good over bluetooth  aac is what i ve been using   but they really shine with my stereo receiver  or hanging off a usb dac on my laptop they do clamp pretty hard  so i stretched them out a touch for more comfort   i wear a       hat  so not a large head   if you have a larger head  i could potentially see comfort being an issue      
372,3.0,                       i bought these   years ago to replace my mdr v   today the arm assembly cracked while i was mixing with no force on them  i always took care of them by hanging it  it will cost me    dollars for a replacement arm  the durability isn t great because of these plastic parts holding the ear cups  the first year of use the ear pads started flaking but it s much better than the mdr v s because the pads are still intact around the stitching  the  rd year the headband is starting to flake  they sound clean as the mdr v s after breaking them in with a deeper bass response      
373,5.0,                       came to the ath m  x after my long faithful akgs finally fell apart  i never knew what i was missing  i went through and listened to nearly my entire library of music over again  there was so much in each song that i had never heard before  i remember sitting in the lobby of one of the dorms on campus and just smiling to myself because it was like experiencing all these songs for the first time  everyone thought i was weird but what else is new bass is perfect  the depth of sound is better than any headphones i ve ever heard  though i m sure you can get better if you re willing to shell out a couple hundred extra bucks   it comes with multiple interchangeable cords so you can use the one that fits your needs the best  for me  this was awesome because i swapped out the default   foot cord for the shorter   footer  the days of trying to walk outside with wads of tangled cord spilling out of your pockets are over best of all  these things are comfortable  i sometimes wear them during gaming and my ears never get cramped or sore  great headphones      
374,2.0,                       i purchased these to have a wireless headset to use for business video audio conference calls via my laptop  while the sound is good  there is a lag in my own voice playback through the headset  the headphones use the bluetooth connection to my laptop and it is very distracting to be speaking and hearing my own voice playing back with a delay through the headset if i were only using these to listen to music  they would be fine  however  i don t recommend them for the purpose that i purchased them      
375,5.0,                       i have already used audio technica headphones in the past so i knew they d be great  i upgraded from the m  xs finally  as i didn t feel like i needed  but when the blue ones released i knew i had to get some finally  the sound quality isn t noticeably better that the m  xs  that being said i bought them because they re blue and i wanted to be able to disconnect my cords and have different length cords  i will say  the color of these look better in person than the pictures      
376,5.0,                       short review  these headphones are better than anything else i ve used in this price range  and quite a few headphones above this range  slightly longer review  since i got these headphones  i ve been finding myself losing hours of time while i go back through everything in my music collection looking for old favorites to listen to again  the sound through these headphones is so crisp  that you will hear things you have missed in the past  the bass response is tight and satisfying  but the highs and miss have tremendous clarity  these definitely shame all the bass heavy headphones that cost way too much and sound terrible with most genres of music my only real gripe is the pivoting ear cups  i know that s probably a pro for lots of people  but i don t really care for it  i d rather lose the pivoting function for increased durability over the years i m likely to use these  i have a pair of v moda crossfades  and those feel much more solid and satisfying  i m also not crazy about the vinyl ear pads that are on almost all headphones  including these   but i have seen velvet replacements available for sale and will probably get those fairly soon  i also own a pair of incase sonic headphones that are the single most comfortable pair of headphones ever made  as far as i am concerned  i picked them up for almost nothing right when they were discontinued  and i could wear them all day without feeling it  i wish all headphones used the same velour memory foam pads that those used  but it doesn t seem to be popular  and unfortunately  the sonics just can t compare to the sound quality of these headphones final word  i used to work in a store that specialized in high end video and audio equipment  and i ve used headphones over pretty much all the price ranges and styles  these fit exactly into the sweet spot of best possible sound quality before you have to start paying a price that is above what your average music listener wants to pay      
377,5.0,                       so  i used to have the m  x about   years ago but never liked the sound quality on them  fast forward   years later and wanting to give the m   series another chance and wow  these sound different then the original m  x s from last time i tried them  the bt sounds more  fun  sounding with tighter bass  and i thought the original m  x s were boring  maybe audio technica changed the frequency s on these slightly for more consumer friendly  but neither less i like the sound quality on the bt over the m  x     
378,5.0,                       they sound great but one thing i didn t expect was how comfortable they are after coming from other headphones  the headphones i have experience with     s of hours with each  are  beats mixr  razer kraken      and turtle beach xp     i ve tried bose quietcomfort a bit as well  these m  x s are by far the most comfortable out of all of them  the biggest problem i have with over ear headphones is that they can press my glasses into the side of my head  making them uncomfortable over long periods of time  the beats weren t as bad  but they were so tight that they hurt my ears in a different way  the turtle beaches are terrible for this  and should be way more comfortable for the amount of time they re expected to be worn  i thought the razers were finally the answer for me  and i wasn t far off  they definitely work for long periods of time  however  the m  x s blow them out of the water  they fit firmly but don t squeeze  and are very soft and fairly light  i ve been wearing them for multiple hours a day since i bought them and can t stress enough how comfortable they are  they re also great for vr  which is what i bought them for originally  because they stay firmly but comfortably in place on your head while you move around  and are light enough that you forget they re even there  unlike the included earbuds which would constantly fall out and break the immersion as far as sound i m no audiophile  but they sound great  i feel like i hear a lot more detail in the music  and more of the nuances in the instrumentals stand out  they definitely don t have that  thundering bass  feel by any stretch of my imagination  but they have a very high clarity sound signature they also come with three different cables  which i actually found very convenient for my needs  i use the   ft cable to run from my tv to my couch  so i can watch without playing the sound through the speakers and disturbing others in the house  i have the shorter  non coiled cable wired up to my htc vive  when i wanted to switch from the tv to vr  it s very nice to be able to just swap the headphones over to the other cable  finally  the third  coiled cable can be kept somewhere if you want to plug it into a phone or other audio source when you re on the go  i like the versatility of these included cables  one other thing about the cables is that they lock into the headphone with a twisting action  at first i was a little turned off by this  as it makes it harder  maybe impossible  haven t tried  to use third party cables  but i ve actually grown to like this  using them on the couch  i would have accidentally unplugged them a dozen times if it was not for the locking cable  in vr  when cables get a little tangled up or when i need to remove the headset  letting them dangle for a second  which i wouldn t recommend doing for very long  is better than having to worry about them unplugging and falling to the floor overall  a really fantastic and versatile product that i would highly recommend  especially at the price      
379,5.0,                       excellent wireless set of headphones  bluetooth hasn t bugged me once and the battery life seems pretty legit  my only problem is there could be more bass but the part i like is that it allows you to hear the song exactly as it is supposed to sound  this makes way for great performance in the production and mixing stages  being able to hear your song while mixing it  will lead to perfect quality  sometimes when it s too bass heavy  you won t hear how it will sound in the final product so this is spot on for audio engineering and making beats    don t cop this if you re looking for general listening  great product for musicians and producers      
380,3.0,                       clean but passive sound  distractingly floppy fit of oversized cans  earpadding thin stiff  no go   not worth the price  get  tribit xfree tune  headphones for      has a more vibrant active equalizing sounding better right out the box and a much higher quality material feel   you ll begin to realize how much of a scam it is for all these other brands to charge          for headphones that barely offer more  sometimes less  than these tribit headphones  can t beat     for nearly equal value if not more value on all categories       
381,4.0,                       these headphones are good a decent improvement from my m  x s but the blue tooth was poorly executed  for this reason just get the atxm  x with out bluetooth and get the blue tooth adapter if you want blue tooth  you cant really use ur headphones while there charging  if you just get an adapter for the non bt model you can use ur headphones while they charge      
382,5.0,                       incredible headphones  best i ve owned under      in sound  wired or bluetooth they are amazing  bright at first but really warmed up the first   months  is burn in real  i don t know but these really got warmer  fuller for me  you can get these on sale around      one a yr or so  buy them when you see a lightning deal  etc only consneed usb cneed apt hdnose cancelling option would be cool      
383,3.0,                       when i turned the bluetooth on it made a noise like a clock going  tick tick  in the right ear  the bluetooth was not connected just turned on  i also found the bluetooth to be too quite for my liking but the ticking noise killed it for me so i returned them and got the non bluetooth version      
384,5.0,                       i ve had these for   years  they provide good noise reduction  no active noise cancellation  if you are looking for that then look for that specifically  there is a good reason these are the industry standard  i ve slept with on these  sat on them  stepped on them  taken them in the rain  on camping trips  walked off with them plugged in  yanking them out of my computer or the cord out of them countless times  i broke off one of the retaining pin on one side  letting it swing away from my head  making for awkward listening  but i fixed it with a zip tie trick that i found on reddit   i did end up messing up the cord that was included through this  so i had to get a     replacement  but the cans work great still  they re loud  and sound better than any i have had before  absolutely recommend them for casual listening  or monitoring while recording  they do a ok job of keeping in sound and not bothering others on flights  if you like loud music  maybe noise cancelling is better  recommend if you re as reckless as i      
385,5.0,                       holy s  t these headphones are awesome      i bought these for some home studio guitar recording and the quality of sound is amazingly good   the bass packs a big punch and the clarity is so great that i ve been hearing guitar parts of songs i m trying to learn that i ve never heard before through other earbuds  headphones      
386,3.0,                       the sound is excellent   when i first tried them  i could hear frequencies that were missing in my cheaper headset   however  the ear cups are too small  my ears won t fit in them   if they are designed to be on the ears  they are too big   if they are designed to be over the ears  they are too small   and my ears aren t particularly big if you want to hear the mix  so you can tweak your mixdown  these are good for the price   but if you want something for extended listening  you might find that your ears don t fit  and you ll get the same pain i have      
387,5.0,                       fits great just like my wired m   s  large adjustability range for people like me with big noggins  audio quality is great  pairs easily with everything i ve tried so far originally bought a pair of skullcandy crushers a month ago because i didnt know at made a wireless version of these  but got tired of my skull being crushed by those  appropriately named  i suppose  and bought these as soon as i found out about them      
388,5.0,                       beautiful high quality sound and quality  though they do have a drawstring back they fold into  i don t use them while casually walking around  i d rather be sitting and chilling to my favorite tunes or podcast  i don t because i think they re a little too bulky for me to do that  but that s just me  the pads are cushy  i never feel like they re just going to slide off  i like the choice of swiveling the ear if i don t want to have the headband on in the studio  i ve had a pair for five years and still sound amazing  the headband padding hasn t faired well though from heavy wear time      
389,5.0,                       i can usually tell fairly quickly whether the overall sound of headphones or speakers is going to be acceptable or not  these sound just right to me and i am now uninterested in listening to music with any other headphones  including higher end models from grado  bose and sennheiser  i listen to classical music and jazz  i do not appreciate thumping bass  these headphones seem extremely well balanced across the audio spectrum and the sound of instruments is more realistic than on other headphones i have used  there is more bass  by which i mean the lowest notes on a piano for example  than on other headphones  which makes the sound more complete and realistic  these headphones seem well made and are generally comfortable to have on  although the ear pads can get a bit warm  i recommend these headphones with enthusiasm      
390,5.0,                       i have used my sony mdr v    for almost    years   unfortunately it fell apart recently i tried sony mdr  am   it was a big disappointment   the sound quality is nowhere near my old sony then i did more research and found this audio technica ath m  x at      there are several less expensive models by the same company but considering i will be using this for many years to come  i decided to try the higher end of their offering my tv is connected to an amplifier and i use the wired headphone to listen to programming and music this model does not have noise cancellation nor do i use it for gaming but i don t have any need for that if you are looking for a headphone for similar purpose  this is a good choice i am very happy with thisi expect clear high frequency  solid mid range and powerful bass   this headphone delivers      
391,2.0,                       i like everything about these except one thing  when the bluetooth radio is on  there is audible  faint hum in the right ear  it s extremely distracting i have exchanged for another unit and it does the same exact thing these have a perfectly eqed flat response for listening  it s just too bad the bluetooth radio causes that interference i will be returning the second unit too in search of a new set of headphones  super bummed      
392,5.0,                       i ve only listened a few hours but they are pretty great  i tried a few genres of music that i really know well and the dynamics on these cans are amazing the only drawback is they are warm and toasty which is fine   months of the year in michigan      
393,5.0,                       this is my second pair of these  and a newer model than my last pair  the last ones only needed to be replaced due to the frame breaking through clumsiness on my part  not due to a defect or design flaw i do music production and game design  including editing of audio and sound effects  these headphones are very popular in the industry  and once you use them  you will understand why  excellent clarity and articulation  especially at the very low and high ends of the spectrum where other headphones often color the sound this being the newer model  i will mention that the detachable replaceable cable is great  especially since you have a choice of lengths and can avoid having six extra feet of cable laying around   a problem with my old pair that led to their demise  also  i feel like these have a better fit and seal out external noise better than the old ones  which may be due to better tension in the headband  or improved ear cups i recommend this model to everyone  and should i manage to break them again  i ll happily buy them yet again      
394,4.0,                       after using the      rated app that is recommended and updating the firmware with it the device stopped working for a couple hours  you can only know the battery life inside their garbage app  the bluetooth connect percentage lies and is stuck at     or       shady  now that im done talking about the bad things  the headphones themselves are perfect apart from never really knowing the battery percentage      
395,5.0,                       i write this review as i m using these excellent headphones  just to emphasize that this is a positive review to start  audio technica has a wonderful packaging presentation  everything about it screamed quality  and nothing was there that shouldn t have been  this was a plus right off the bat the included cables and carrying pouch are a very nice touch  everything matches with the color that is specified in the order  i had white myself   it should be noted also that the cables are detachable from the m  x s  they lock into place  so you can only use the specified cables  which is completely fine in my case now the headphones themselves  already it is clear to see that much thought was put into the design  they are flexible  yet sturdy  nothing squeaks and everything rotates nicely  the adjustments lock into place and the headphones fold easily for transport  the only flaw in the design which i can see   and i m really nit picking here   is that the leather band on top folds when worn  for all i know this may have been intentional in the design  so i can t really complain  in terms of visual appeal  i don t think i have come across a more elegant looking pair of headphones in my entire life  the white is bright  and with good maintenance  shouldn t get too dirty  i am very proud to wear these  also one other great thing about the build is that the plastic material does not smudge  my hands sweat a lot  and i can gladly say that the material is somehow completely smudge proof moving on to sound  all i can say is that these headphones provide a whole new listening experience for me  i m no hardcore audiophile  but enjoy listening to music on a frequent basis and have listened to quite a few headphones  the m   xs provide crisp highs  and solid mids  i will say right now  the lows are there  but they do not protrude from the rest of the sound  which personally i think is a good thing  sorry  if you are a bass head  these probably aren t the headphones you are looking for  overall a very evenly distributed sound which just makes you feel good all over  not to mention  the m   x s have a good amount of noise cancellation  on an average volume level  almost all outside noise is blocked  and you can really loose yourself in the music  these headphones really bring a genuinely great experience  especially for that price tag one last thing  comfort  the m   xs really grip your head  this helps to keep outside noise out  but can get a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours  the headband can also get uncomfortable very quickly after a few minutes  the key is to make sure the adjustments are set correctly  put the headband in the correct position on your head  and make sure none of your hair is clumped together  do this  and i swear i forget i m evening wearing them at all final verdict  the audio technica ath m   x studio monitor headphones are an excellent looking and sounding pair of headphones  whether you re on a budget or not recommended for  general music listening  video games  audio editing  professional studio mixingnot recommended for  bass headsoverall ratings quality       sound        comfort           
396,5.0,                       pros comfort  my ears sweat easily and yet i can wear these for hours and remain cool or room temperature while doing so  the pads are soft and accommodate my large ears well sound  i guess i should have started with this first  they are amazing  all my other earphones or headphones have geared their sound towards the highs or bass but this set of cans definitely goes completely neutral while allowing me to hear every voice and instrument in all my types of music    alternative rock  hip hop  r b   i ve been reliving some of my favorite albums for the first time as if i m in the studio with the artist  i ve found the best way to enjoy the music is to plug these in to a dac  external or portable  or have a phone that can actually drive these properly  lg v    v    v    lg g   zte axon    razer phone  build  the build quality is great mix of metal  leather and plastic  feels completely solid in the hands and on the head and the articulation to fold flat on your neck or fold up into the carrying back is the best bonus of allcons i m not just hyping up these cans but i really haven t found too many  the only one i can thing of is that it didn t come with a cable with inline controls for my smartphone  that would have been nice so i didn t have to use my watch or my phone to change the track or lower the volume     
397,5.0,absolutely fantastic headphones   tldr  i would buy these again without hesitation  i might even have purchased over the ath m  x if these were available when i purchased my first pair a few years ago  they sound the same when running directly via    mm cable  they are built the same and they feel the same  very comfortable   pros    can be used cord free via bluetooth connection    can be used with    mm aux cable without bluetooth  like  oops  i drained my battery or no bt reception     using via    mm cable doesn t require batteries  it s passive  just like any normal headphones  like the ath m  x     the head phones have a large memory so that it will remember multiple device connections    if i remember     the reception is good       feet away from a bluetooth device  i ve been able to walk into other rooms or down stairs and remain connected  i ll get a skip or studder depending on distance and number of walls  which is totally normal and to be expected     switching between bluetooth and wired is as easy as connecting the cable  you should turn off the power switch since technically you re not streaming over bluetooth  i accidentally left the bt connection to my phone on and plugged in the cable to my laptop  it worked and i didn t realize until i walked away and returned to see the pulsing white light  i had left on the power switch     i can get a few days of   hour use before having to charge them again    they sound the same as the ath m  x when the power is off and they are connected via    mm cable    they have a small bump in base over the ath m  x when connected via bluetooth    same build quality and feel as standard ath m  x head phones    little to no sound leak  using glasses with thick frames will be an exception     although they are not noise cancelling  they do a good job isolating external noise because they are over the ear  with music playing  you won t hear much around you  with music paused  you can hear when people are trying to talk to you  planes  public transit  etc       cons  the first two are minor     the pleather bag that comes with these is really small  yeah  the headphones fit but it should probably have a minimum of an inch more in length and width  this would help bag not be as tight around the headphones  especially when the cable is there    after only   months  the factory    mm microphone remote cable that came in the box wore out last week  this was without any drops  yanks  or hard wear and tear  i listen to bluetooth at home and while commuting on the train  i turn off bluetooth in the office and just listen via cable because crapple osx      has massive bluetooth failures       apple  not the headphones     micro usb to charge  seriously  this is stupid  micro usb is cheap so that s why people use it in hardware designs  but omg don t try to connect this to power in the dark  it will take you a year to first locate where the port is for power  let alone figuring out if the cable is upside down or not  they should have put up the money for usb c  it s more robust and is bi directional  that is my biggest gripe about these  honest  everything else is tolerable     edit   november      it s been a year of daily use for these now  i stand by my origional review  i only wish charging was usb c type of connector     audio still great    call clarity still great    construction still sturdy    battery still holding up       mm audio port still holding up    single replacement cable still holding up and that s with connecting  disconnecting daily    cushions still in great condition    bt pairing still spot on   regarding the comment on the factory audio cable   i replaced the broken mic audio cable with a nice braided cable     mm on both ends  one side naturally has an extra conductor and insulation band for the mic   for those of you looking to replace a cable  spend the money and don t buy cheap low quality cables  you ll be so much happier with a soft braided cable of higher quality of you need a replacement 
398,5.0,                       the audio quality of this headset was a very nice surprise when i tried it for the first time   it replaced my old sennheiser hd     set  which still worked but the ear pads had fallen apart   however  the audio technica ath m  x sound  much  better than the sennheiser hd               retail   and even better than my hd      originally          now the newer model is            the fit of the audio technical is very comfortable  the ear cushions are a solid build  and i like the fact that the audio cable can be unplugged and swapped out with one of three different styles provided by the manufacturer   in conclusion  this is a five out of five     headset for the price   you d have to pay upwards of      to see   feel any improvement compared to other high end professional headsets available on the market      
399,3.0,                       so i will start by saying that i probably had an incomplete experience of this product  i do not own any high end stereo equipment  and i listen to most of my music on my phone or my laptop i ended up returning these headphones  if i was listening to different types of music or listening on different equipment  who knows  i may have kept them  but as a person who mostly listens to streaming music that is heavy on guitars and higher vocals  these were really not for me  i found that the lows were super pleasant and accurate  the mids were passable  and the highs were harsh  using these headphones  i found it very difficult to enjoy rock music  which is my go to genre  i will say that i tried some other types of music for testing purposes  electronic  jazz  pop  and they sounded much better with all of those than they did with rock anyway  if you are an edm  hip hop  jazz or pop fan then go for it  but don t expect these to make your guitar riffs any better than tolerable      
400,2.0,                       i ve owned an old pair of ath m  s and ordered the bt version of them as i was really happy with my old pair the headphones sound the same as my old m   s and when using these with a headphone jack plus a dac   amp these are great headphones with a natural sound that can be eq d to your preference  like myself  i like heavy bass and i m able to eq it in fairly well  but again  this is only when wired to a dac   amp my first major ding is unable to use them while charging  as soon as i plug it in to charge it will disconnect the bluetooth connection the second ding  i can t see what the battery life is on the device  i m using the headphones on a windows    pc and it won t report the battery life and the device has no way to see battery life my last ding is the construction  it s mostly all plastic  the key points like where the headband connections to the earphone is a plastic hinge  i ve had a lot of headphones fail when they use plastic on this hinge i couldn t recommend this product as the bluetooth features are very lacking compared to most other bt headphones in the price range of these      
401,5.0,                       these do everything you need them to  they are known for noise cancellation so i give them a pass on that  as soon as i used them for music  i noticed things and sounds coming through on song tracks i hadn t picked up before  i m not an audiophile nerd but i could definitely tell the difference  would buy again  i do wish they came with a     inch headphone jack though     
402,5.0,                       let me say from the beginning these headphones have a phenomenal sound  the lows  mids  and highs are evenly balanced  they are so comfortable that i can wear them for hours  they re well made and if handled with care i m sure they ll last a long time  one word of caution when you plug in the cables you have to turn them on the headset and push them up into the connection hole  i returned my first order because i thought they were defective  buy these headphones you won t be disappointed      
403,5.0,                       i ve been a fan of audio technica for     years now  buying audio boards  mics and headphones from them when i can for my home studio this week it was time for new headphones  the ones i had for the past   years were getting a little worn out and uncomfortable looked into my favorite company and picked these up first  have to say  they work perfect for monitoring audio through my board when i am doing a broadcast or when editing youtube videos  this headset picks up every sniff  breath of air you take and you can even hear minor sounds in the background  things i wasn t hearing before it also cancels out the background big time  so all i head is what s in my headphones to all those crying about the sound  these are monitoring headphones not headphones you attach to your phone and listen to the latest jam as you walk down the street thinking you re cool these are perfectly balanced  no added b s  headphones for professional studio monitoring keep that in mind before you start crying your one star reviews      
404,5.0,                       if you were to make a list of truly good headphones    scratch off the over hyped fashion statement schock and high priced toys designed to make portable music players  sound good    you will end up with a small list of truly good headphones sold at fair prices  these headphones will be on that short list  and will be around when the over hyped  star studded  brands are in the landfill just remember that  garbage in   garbage out   don t expect these quality headphones to make your smartphone and mp  files sound like audio nirvana  with the mild exception of a slight  v  shape pleasing tonal balance   these are accurate and true to the master recording if you feed them a good signal      
405,3.0,                       so  for the most part these are amazing headphones for the price  sound quality  including bass volume  is amazing  i find incredible fidelity whenever i use them  however  there is a significant flaw that will most likely render these useless after about a year of daily use that you should be aware of  there is small piece of plastic that holds in the hinge that holds the ear cups to an angle that fits your head snug  after about a year of constant use  this fails and breaks  both times i have purchased these  after a year of constant use this piece has broken  making the right side pull away from my ear  strangely the right side both times   i haven t had this issue with cheaper headphones ever  making me believe this is  planned obsolesence for this product  as much as i love these headphones  it s difficult to recommend them since you ll most likely need another pair after a relatively short period of use      
406,5.0,                       these are the bomb  so comfortable  and also very stylish  the sound is crazy good  i am not a dj or a producer or anything like that  i dabble in garageband  and like to watch movies late at night  i am usually watching movies at night while my girlfriend is sleeping in the next room  so i pop these on and we are good to go  sometime i forget i am wearing them because they are so comfortable pros  great sound different length cables  allows me to watch tv from the couch and not have to stay up close to the computer  has both studio and regular size jacks super comfortable  i have a fairly wide head and these seemed tight a first but you can stretch them out a little with some gentle tugs  fit like a glove now cons  the white finish seems like it will get dirty over the years fairly bulky     
407,5.0,                       i bought these   years ago because a friend of mine sat down and showed me  what real headphones  are  if all you are accustomed to are fashion brand headphones  skullcandy  dre etc   or  gaming  headphones  youre in for a treat these headphones are stupid comfortable  and have lasted   years of heavy daily use and have not broke down  cracked  not one thing is  wrong  with them  before i was going through  gaming headsets  easily every   to    months  just cheap garbage that cost at least    dollars if you pair these headphones with a dedicated sound card  and enable all the bells and whistles in the cards software  these are absolutely fantastic for gaming  its my primary use case  using a dedicated soundcard with a built in amplifier will only enhance what you will get out of these music is amazing with these    i can go on and on bottom line  if you are tired of spending money on over priced gaming fashion headphones that break or just dont sound that great and you want to invest in a quality headset that is not going to break the bank and blow you away with the sound you will get  these are it  and they are durable and wont break to boot also the detachable  cables for short long coiled are awesome  i take these everywhere with me      
408,5.0,                       i m a big fan of wired  but have tried several bluetooth buds and over ears in hopes to find a decent bluetooth solution  like others i ve been disappointed by poor quality audio  poor comfort  short battery life  not loud enough  etc being an audio technica fan  i had to grab these when they came out  so far so good   the m  x design in general is very nice  with sturdy hinges that rotate like crazy  metal click headband adjustments  decent size earcups  balanced  detailed sound  and nice volume level  sound signature is indeed the same as the m  x  they crank about as loud as a wired m  x connected to a non amped device  with that said  my dream bt headset would crank as loud as a wired set connected to a small headphone amp  these could use more juice to enhance volume and bass  but they do better than anything i ve tried so i m happy volume buttons work independently from my android   device when connected  so be sure to adjust both device volume and headset volume   instructions are graphical  red light on during charging  off when full  powered on  white light blinks when unpaired  solid white when paired   sturdy usb a to b charging cable  wish it was usb c but i understand at was trying to keep the headset cost under        i imagine aptx hd support would have made them  more expensive   if so i think at did good by offering only aptx as it s nearly impossible to tell the difference with standard quality streaming music  how most including me will use them  last note is on connectivity and range  my phone is bluetooth      and this is the first set i ve tried with      i don t know if that helps with range  but i m able to leave my phone in any room of my two story house and go just about anywhere without connection issues  nice  best connectivity i ve seen with a bluetooth audio device update   i found a very worthy eq and volume app called equilizer fx pro that works flawlessly with this headset and my lg v    the pics show my best settings  nice eq that actually works       
409,2.0,                       i ordered the ath m  xbt after trying my friend s pair and loving them  when i received mine  i noticed two things    the bluetooth would stutter occasionally  but this is to be expected  especially since i live in the city   the right headphone had a distinct rapid clicking ticking noise that was audible between songs or in soft quiet songs  it s drowned out by loud music but very audible when the volume is low for any music  and it s impossible to ignore  because it s only in one ear  and it occasionally changes pitch because of this ticking issue  i exchanged the headphones for a new pair  but this new pair had the same issue  and  a loose rattling component in the right ear  i emailed support at this point and they told me that all bluetooth headphones make some noise due to the electronics  however  i compared these headphones to my friend s older pair of ath m  xbts and hers had no audible ticking noise  so something clearly was different and defective  i ve just returned the second pair      
410,5.0,                       i ve been using these headphones for years  i ve enjoyed their excellent sound quality both on the go and gaming  it s an excellent option at the price point and i would buy them again the headphones have a nice balance to them however bass lovers may find these lacking  vocals pop much more with these headphones  the sounds are clear and crisp  i also use them for gaming and find they work just as well compared to  gaming headsets  these are over ear headphones  with a leathery ear pads and headband  the headphones can adjust and swivel to fit most heads comfortably and i found wearing them for long gaming sessions comfortable  with extended use and sweaty oily heads the pads will come off and absorb oil  be sure to clean them every so often and avoid putting them near paper as the oil may come out in paper  the ear pads are removable so replacing them will extend their life the headphones are collapsible and can fit compactly for travel  the wire can be disconnected  and comes with multiple types of wires for ease of use  i kept the short one in my backpack and the long one plugged in my computer and switched cables for at home and on the go these headphones are very durable as they withstood many drops without failure  my headphones did break after years of use at the hinge  when i try and wear it it bows outward i will be buying another set soon      
411,4.0,                       these are the best sounding closed back headphones we own   i m subtracting one star for the awkward sounds of the plastic flexing while wearing them in bed   any slight movement causes unwanted sounds when the plastic and or metal bends and warps or presses against the pillow   to be far  most other monitors also do this   the only headphones we ve tested that don t have this issue are the status audio ob   open back studio monitors  which sound awesome  but the ear padding is too small around my ears and the pressure is too tight on my head  and dual cables get in the way while in bed   the audio technica ath m  x headphones  on the other hand  are very comfortable and sound great except for the sounds when moving against a pillow headrest         
412,5.0,                       pros  comfortable fit  even for big ears flat sound  good for studio work   audiophilesgreat design  build quality useful carrying pouch and   detachable cablescons   can take some time to get used to the flat sound  after using bass heavy headphones  these might sound weak  small soundstage  lack of  space  in the sound meaning sounds feel very close and don t give a sense of  distance   these aren t the best headphones for gaming as you want directional sound   search for open back cans  not for everyone  the sound is amazing throughout the entire spectrum but it is very flat  this is great for mixing and studio work but some people might want headphones that have more bass or less focus on the mids   highs verdict  i like these a lot  music has never sounded clearer and more balanced  there is no clipping or distortion and every sound on the spectrum can be heard irregardless of what sounds are already playing  instruments sound incredible  voices are defined and the bass is crisp and clear while not overpowering after using bass heavy earbuds for a while  these took a few hours to get used to  but now i can appreciate how music is supposed to sound like       would recommend to whoever wants the best bang for your buck pair of headphones       studio work      music listening       bass music  you can bass boost though        gaming  small soundstage        travel  wired  no noice cancelling  good noise isolation however       style looks  white looks incredible      
413,3.0,                       i bought these for editing videos and to listen to music while working on said videos  and honestly  i m not impressed  these have little to no bass  which i don t want too much when editing  but the bass was practically non existent  and the treble was waaaay to crisp  as someone who grew up in a family of musicians and has a lot of family in the music industry  but not personally perused that avenue  i know what good sound should sound like and these just aren t doing it for me  and definitely not for that price tag  i have sony headphones that are cheaper than these with better sound quality    and no  more bass does not mean better sound quality  basically  if you re looking for a set of headphones where all you hear is the treble and the singer  these are perfect  but if you want to listen to music  videos  games  or even podcasts and listen for all the instruments  tones  and sound effects that are occurring on a track or background  skip these and find something else i tested these with various songs from various genres  podcasts  and youtube videos and wasn t satisfied  so i m returning them  packaging was good  and the points of articulation on the headset are nice  they are comfortable  light weight  and pretty sturdy for the most part and could definitely be worn for longer periods of time one thing i did notice  was that you could hear the video or song coming from the headset as someone wore them and you could almost use them as speakers for around your neck  so they have a lot of sound leakage  the noise cancelation was okay  and i could still hear the person next to me talk  they just sounded a little muffled  with the music on low or off  whereas other headphones i have with the same feature i can hardly hear other people at all i was unable to test battery life  because i didn t keep them long enough to find out hope all this helps other youtubers and music nerds out there      
414,4.0,                       these headphones sounded great  were comfortable and i loved them  but apparently the my phone  the oneplus  t  is the only device it wouldn t pair with   saw a similar posting on the oneplus forums and when i called the manufacturer they said they had received several calls complaining about non connection from other people with my same phone   their only recommendation was to return the headphones i cleared my bluetooth cache  tuned off on paired over and over  but after   to    minutes my bluetooth connection on my phone would turn off and one by itself uncontrollably   i ve paired other bluetooth devices for an indefinite time with my phone and had no problem until i paired the m  xbts the headphones did successfully pair with another smartphone  nexus    and my dell laptop  but not worth the oneplus  t      
415,3.0,update nov   th        the battery level indicator issue still persists everywhere  on android phones  connect app  and windows     all three shows different levels altogether  and the engineering team responded with multiple answers    they provide a replacement  but will not troubleshoot the existing issues     they refused to troubleshoot the windows    since they claimed the headset is designed only for smartphones  never mind there are illustrations on their own guides where the headset is supposed to be connected to a computer for the charging process  therefore  proceed at your own risk if you plan to use this headset with your computers     that answer brings forward the issue with smartphones  as they stated it s a smartphone exclusive headset  they still failed to troubleshoot the battery indicator issue with android where it is just plain inaccurate borderline useless  their conclusion is apps  fault  which in this case is their own connect app and android itself   all nougat  oreo  and pie  the fact they won t make the headset to work properly with their own connect app  which is clearly advertised  is enough reason for me to knock a star off the review   the whole experience with the support team gave me the impression of half hearted efforts from at  and at times it seems they would avoid responsibility given chance                                                                                          i have such a mixed feeling on this one   introduction the build and quality are great right out of the box  nice packaging  and decent accessories  noise cancellation got   star because the headset doesn t have a noise cancellation at all  so no surprise there  i m not quite sure i want to isolate myself from the surroundings when i wear the headset the absence of noise cancellation is perfectly fine for me  so   star isn t necessarily bad in this case  also  when you re playing audio at a moderately loud level you couldn t hear your surroundings   problems on to the unpleasant part of the review   in bluetooth mode  several problems cropped up in the early several hours of my hands on  most of the audio related problems don t exist in cord mode   the headset emitted some kind of interference inaudible pitch in windows    during idle  which caused uncomfortable pressure to the eardrums  it didn t happen when paired with an android phone   there are no sounds at all when the headset is used to play grand theft auto v and mechwarrior online  the alternative is to revert back to corded mode   the battery level indicator is simply broken on android  it will always show      no matter what the actual level it  the connect app has a battery gauge but it also feels inaccurate  and there are very few other functions offered other than headset locator and firmware updater  windows    battery gauge works the best  but it also doesn t seem to be updated in real time  i need to disconnect and reconnect before the number would change  it s a minor annoyance  but an annoyance still   sound quality to my untrained ears  it sounds just as pleasant as jabra   h and more reasonable than the overly loud bass of beats  which both are considerably more expensive  bluetooth mode and corded mode sounds almost indistinguishable  apart from the volume boost in bluetooth mode   conclusion if they can fix that battery indicator problem  it s going to be an easy   star 
416,1.0,                       haven t even had these for year and they are already failing on me  there is constant static and it takes constant twisting of the cord to get the music to come in at least barely clearly  i never dropped  damaged or abused them in any way  clearly  it s a poorly made piece of plastic and the sound wasn t even that great when they did work  but i just attributed it to the cheap price  it was all treble and now it s all static  i hate to say it but my beats lasted longer and sounded better  hopefully the v modas i bought will hold up better      
417,5.0,                       i was very excited to receive these headphones because i ve heard nothing but good things about the m  s and  as someone who gets up to move around a lot  just the simple fact that they were wireless made it a no brainer for me to purchase  first impressions were pretty great  the sound is loud and clear and while the fit feels kinda tight  you get used to it and it conforms to whatever shape head you have pretty smoothly that being said  make sure you get the audio technica app on your phone and update the firmware  i kept running into this issue where if i were to pause something making sound on my pc  spotify or youtube  for example  it would pause every single sound on my pc and the only way to get around this was to mute the application but keep it  playing  in the background  this was unacceptable  i tried reinstalling the drivers  repairing them  etc  nothing was working  i was just about to return these headphones when i saw that there was an update available for these headphones  all i did was get the app and the headphones updated ota and now everything is great  just keep in mind that the update took me about an hour  very slow download but was well worth it in the end just to be able to use these headphones hassle free   and it truly is hassle free they connect automatically  they re easy to disconnect  the range is pretty good  and best of all the battery lasts forever highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a great pair of wireless headphones for work or gaming      
418,2.0,                       this is the third pair of audio technica i have tried  each one sucks in their own way  no idea why they are so overrated  they lack bass  crush highs  and are completely boring with nearly every genera of music  forget edm  techno  punk  and rock  they were ok with classical  piano  and vocals  very little detail in sound for the price  apple earbuds do a better job  for studio they might be ok  but casual listening at work or home is underwhelming at best  i went with the v moda crossfade  but wired only  as the bluetooth is laggy  way better sound      
419,5.0,                       have used them for several months now and no complaints   they are reasonably comfortable and the sound is pretty good   i did add a preamp to them which boosts the volume and the base a bit but its not necessary if you are a casual music listener which is how i use them much of the time along with occasional gaming   i ve had them on for hours without much trouble      
420,5.0,                       i ve been on the market for the  perfect  headphones for a long time   in the last     years i ve had astros  hyperx  sennheiser  hp omen mindframe  and a few others trying to find what i was happy with   most the headphones i ve had were great and i enjoyed using but would still find myself shopping for something else i have been eyeing the ath mx   for a while and decided to finally pull the trigger on purchasing   following the instructions of other reviews  i also purchased aftermarket ear pads to replace stock ones immediately   this is an absolute must in my opinion   they re alright with the standard ear pads but they are down right perfect for my big head with the aftermarket ear pads i m no audio expert but games just hit different the moment i started using these   bass was super crisp   audio was clean   i was hearing things i ve never heard in game before   and things i did know about was coming through so much more clear   i ve already recommended these headphones to all my gaming buds   do yourself a favor and order these bad boys      
421,5.0,                       i really like these headphones  i have mostly purchased sony line of extra bass headphones in the last decade or so  i ve had the sony xb   s and the sony xb   b s  ive also had the in ear extra bass headphones from sony as well  i have also had in ear solid bass headphones from audio technica  before those i had the original skull candy crushers which had bass powered by a aaa battery  that was about    years ago  as i have gotten older i have decided to move away from the bass heavy headphones  this is my first pair of professional monitor headphones  i know that people say these have stronger bass then a lot of monitoring headphones  while i have nothing to compare them too i would say they are not even close to as bass heavy as what i am used too  in a few pop songs i have heard parts of the songs that were before drowned out by bass  o think the sound quality is great and it definitely plays a more true to the music type of sound  build quality is worlds better than what i am used too  the sony xtra bass headphones each lasted me about two years before they fell apart  keep in mind i am very gentle with my headphones and only use them at home  i believe these headphone will outlive the previous ones i have owned by a lot  comfort wise they are not as comfortable as the extra bass sonys but more comfortable then the skull crushers  the sony headphones i used were made very lightweight and had huge ear cushions  these are still very comfortable  i have a smaller head and ear size  i wear them on the smallest size selection  the reason i say this is because if you have a larger head or larger ears i can see these as being uncomfortable tldri really like the true to the music sound with just slight punchy bass  these really suits my needs as i primarily listen to pop music from around the world including america      
422,4.0,                       the sound is  first and foremost  the main reason i got these  sound is great  build quality overall is also great  my favorite actually  however  what can be a big flaw is the quality of the earpads  good at first  but can really be painful about an hour in  don t fall asleep with these on  i recommend changing out the earpads with wicked cushions  they re a little too soft and can cause your ears to sweat but are great for long use  perfect combo with these headphones  still  my go to pair overall      
423,5.0,                       i am no audiophile  but these things are freakin amazing  i make boombap beats for fun and i sample from records  i use a maschine studio and i own a pair of rokit   studio monitors  when i plugged in my audio technicas to my mixer  right off the bat i was able to detect any and all white noise that i could not detect from my rokit   speakers when i sampled from various records  i was able to filter all of my beats to omit all of the white noise and vinyl popping sounds for cleaner crisper sounding music  for the price they are very very good  i got the blue ones and they look dope       
424,5.0,                       i broke my bose earphones and was in search of replacements   reading reviews  i assumed that these are comparatively cheap with similar kind of specs  i half heartedly purchased these just to test them out  after trying them out first  there was no looking back and i feel these are far better   i was explaining this to my son  who borrowed these   after trying he never gave them back  he smiles  whenever i ask them to return    am glad that it turned out to be a good buy      
425,4.0,                       i purchased this a year ago and have used it quite a bit   one thing to note for people who are looking to purchase this headphone  this is a professional studio monitor headphone  your audio experience will not be simnilar to the sony wh     xm  nor the bose qc   ii or similar headphones  the audio is very flat  a bit of bass but for the most part the sound is quite flat  it s main intended use is for audio recording mastering so it s important that the audio has to be flat before applying any tweaks  if you re looking for a headphone with enhanced bass  or enhanced mids  skip this headphone  of course you can use an eq app program to achieve the audio experience you want the build quality of this headphone is superb  i ve used it whilst asleep loads of times and it never physically brakes  i ve had other headphones  house of marley headphone   before that if i fall asleep with it on  the plastic material would break after few uses      
426,5.0,                       i m an audio engineer  and for the price point and overall practically these headphone are excellent  the only problem you ll run into is you won t want to wear them for     minutes in most cases  they are a bit thick  but it comes with the territory of the type of headphones  possibly in the future there will the a lighter weight material that will still block a considerable amount of outside noise      
427,5.0,                       these headphones are absolutely fantastic for someone who truly wants to hear all of the music and isn t afraid to divert from  hyped up  headphone brands like bose or beats crisp highs  great mids  and the bass is on the full and punchy   all around a fantastic listening experience for anyone no matter what sort of music you like   i feel like these really shine for club music    hip hop  dubstep  electronic  etc   however even country music sounds like you are there in the studio with the artist and producer   for           these are absolutely worth it make sure to adjust the headband to your head size in order to get the most comfortable fit   also  the swiveling ear cups allow the the cushions to sit comfortably at any angle of your head to relieve pressure points side note   the first pair of these i ordered had somewhat of a bass imbalance   after doing some research on the internet  i learned this can be a common manufacturer s defect with the m  x and m  x s   sometimes the bass in the left ear cup is slightly stronger than the right ear cup   this may or may not be noticeable to most people  but for me it definitely was   i was skeptical  but after having an amazon send me a replacement pair  i can say these new m  x s are perfectly balanced   if you receive a pair you think is imbalanced  send them back and get a new pair      
428,4.0,                       i ve been using these for a about a month now  they are not going to change your life  nor the way you listen to music  not to say that they are bad  but i expected more since i had never spent more than     on a set of headphones before  there is certainly a difference however  in the quality of the sound  i wont pretend to know the terms   seems clearer  and the high notes don t seem to distort as much  plus good bass  the bt is seamless  pairing directly up to my phone and computer  though the sound quality takes a hit in bt mode  it s still a  few steps above any other bt headphones i ve used  i would recommend these to someone who wanted to enjoy a pretty good quality sound  wired or wireless   but didn t expect audiophilic perfection if these still works in a year  i ll give it the  th star      
429,5.0,                       review of audio technica s ath m  xwhen you buy headphones  there is a lot of criteria that you can look at  sound quality is arguably the most important part when looking at headphones  next you want to look at is  the type of headphones and what the physical quality is  the last thing to consider when buying headphones is the price that you would have to pay soundso first up is looking at the sound quality of audio technica s ath m  x headphones  the two main things i use my headphones for are gaming and listening to music  right away i noticed how clear the music was with the headphones  because of that  you could pick up on every single sound in the song  when i began listening to music i realized that some of those songs sounded scratchy and had background static  i realized that the recording of the song was the reason for this and the headphone was just able to pick up on it  if you enjoy a lot of bass when you listen to music i m not sure these are the headphones for you  the bass is well rounded but when you listen to the heavy bass songs you can t really notice it quality   typenext  i m looking at the build quality and the type of headphones that the ath m  x is  these are studio headphones that are over ear and have a closed back  since they are closed back  they have better sound isolation don t leak sound nearly as much as an open back would  looking at the build quality  i am fairly impressed with the structural quality of the headphones  as well as how compactable they are  the padding on both the ears and the headband are comfortable for long sittings as well pricelastly  you want to look at the price for these headphones  these headphones are usually sold for around      on amazon  that may seem expensive but for what you are getting it is a steal  audio technica s ath m  x are arguably the best headphone in this price range  even beating other headphones in the           price range   if you are wanting to splurge on a new set of headphones  you won t go wrong with these summarythese headphones have great  clear sound quality that helps you notice every single sound presented  they are comfortable for short or long periods of use and are built great  if you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars on a pair of headphones  you couldn t possibly go wrong with buying these      
430,4.0,                       bought these to pair with my samsung tv while my wife passes out on the couch  pairing was super easy  and aside from some weird lag the first time i turned them on  they ve been great ever since  sound quality is excellent  with a pretty good response across the tonal spectrum  they seem to last a pretty long time  i charge them every few days  but i haven t run in to a low battery yet my only disappointment with them is the comfort  they squeeze a little tight  i wear a m l size hat   the pads are a little stiff  especially compared to my old second generation bose qcs  and the diameter of the cups is just a tad smaller than i d like  i do have pretty big ears  but i do find my ears cramping up a bit after an hour or two      
431,5.0,                       great sound quality  i am hearing sounds i ve never heard of before in the music and movies  sound quality is excellent  my only criticism     i had a hard time aligning the cups  they have a unique design  i struggled with them a little bit  it took me a while to put them in the right position  i may be the only person who had that struggle lol  however  there is nothing in the manual that explains how to align the cups  or if there was  it wasn t sufficient  i remember reading the whole thing but not seeing any particular instructions about how to position the cups  the other criticism is that the cable that i had to use for plugging into my yamaha receiver has some connectivity problems  if the cable moves a little bit  sometimes the audio briefly cuts out  i called the customer service and left a message  they were closed due to covid     but haven t heard back  it s not a big deal  you may want to test your cables and if you notice any issues  you may ask for a replacement  those cables are not very expensive  you can probably buy them separately as well  to me  the sound quality is the priority  and this product delivers it      
432,5.0,                       right out of the box these scream professional  at      the sonic properties are unbeatable  there s a reason why year after year the m  x is rated at the top of the list for professional studio headphones they work awesome in a office too  no sound leakage and comfortable enough to wear for hours on end be wary if you have glasses though  the headband is too tight for     of my pairs of glasses      
433,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          sound quality is similar to the wired m  x  seems identical even thru wireless but i need to do more test and measurements  but if you love m  x  the feel and sound would keep you as happy have to take one star off as the mic is unusable  check my video so the extra     is for making the headphone wireless for listening only  that s it  in terms of convenience  i buy it  i used to resist to wireless solutions as i perceive them poorer in sound quality  after reviewing many solutions  i m now in for the wire cutter      
434,5.0,                       this is my first bluetooth over ear headphones and it is great for its price  noise cancellation works very well  when i m on a plane it blocks out most other noises  i ve worn it upwards of     hours at a time and it is very comfortable  i didn t experience much pain that i usually do when wearing headphones for a long time  have yet to have the battery die on my while listening but if it does  it comes with a connector to make it work wired  the bluetooth connection also works very well  much better than the multiple wireless earphones that i ve used for running      
435,5.0,                       best headphones i ve tried for the price  very comfortable with top sound quality  the frame is also sturdy enough to handle most falls from desk height onto solid flooring without cracking  the audio cable has been yanked out several times after getting caught onto something and no audio port degradation has been experienced  the one major negative is that the false leather coating the foam headband and earpads started cracking severely after a year and a half despite being well maintained  thankfully  the flaking hasn t been as bad as with the usual budget headphones  but new earpads and a wool cover for the headband will have to be bought      
436,5.0,                       they still work great after four years of use  to me they sound better than the recent sony     xm   though the sony noise canceling is great for when i want that  i m no audiophile but the sonys have more base while the m  xs are clearer overall  after years of use  the included earpads will wear out with their outer layer flaking off  though they are simple to replace  the headband faux leather is also cracked and flaking off  though it hasn t impacted use or comfort yet just took a moment to look it up  and there are various headphone headband covers being sold for around     for this exact purpose  thanks capitalism      
437,5.0,                       these headphones are not for a casual audiophile   they are perfect for a project studio or an acoustic engineer on a budget   these are monitor headphones for music production studio use   if you just want to groove out to music and enjoy it  go with the sony noise cancelling kind that sells for less than     the price of these the frequency response is very flat    so flat that it can be fatiguing to the ear over long periods of time   they reproduce every detail of the music  but not necessarily in a pleasing way  every imperfection in the mix can be heard   basically  if a mix sounds good on these  then they are likely going to sound good on everything else too the bass on these can be muddy at high volume   they re comfortable enough  but not especially so  you know when you have them on      
438,3.0,                       i have the original non bluetooth ones  and for a      headphone i expected a little more in this bluetooth version pros   audio is great  like the old ones  especially the bass  in my opinion  better than my bose qc  ii and sennheiser pxc     which are anc headphones    although not the most comfortable headphones  they are a little better than the original ones which have a painful clamping force   i have not tested this yet but they re supposed to have a great battery life      hours  i suppose this estimate is by playing them at not too loud settings cons     bluetooth works fine with android but is a hassle to make it work with windows     i will provide a solution at the en of the page  i learned it from deaconslim at the microsoft forums     quality of materials seems a little cheap  and volume skip  play puase buttons are flat and hard to identify with your finger     at this price range i think they should have anc  active noise cancelling   that would make them much more desirable     the touch for google assistant is not very reliable  is a hit and miss  works about     of the time for me     when bluetooth connects to a device it only says   bluetooth connected   it does not tell you what device you re connected to  unlike bluetooth headphones in other brands  it also seems to not be able to connect to more than   device at a time to make it work with windows       go to bluetooth   other devices in settings    on the right side of the screen under  related settings   click on devices and printers    find your device listed    for example  my headphones are the audio technica ath m  xbt headphones  and were listed at the bottom of the window under  unspecified      right click the device and select properties    select the services tab    i m not sure which of these did the trick  but there are   bluetooth services listed  audio sink  drivers for keyboard  mice  etc  hid   headset  remote control  and remotely controllable device    i checked all      click apply   after this i heard in my headphones  bluetooth connected      click ok headphones or bluetooth audio device should be working and selected as the enabled audio device      
439,5.0,                       so around            i became an audiophile and tried all of the nice headphones  hd     audeze lcd x             iems   i could go on and on  i eventually settled on two that i liked  the shure se    and the jerry harvey roxannes  i only listen to music when out  and need isolation  and comfort  and these fit the bill  i really liked their sound too getting bored  i thought i d get a full sized headphone to wear to the gym sometimes  these arrived last night and i m returning them today  i wore them and listened to music off of my phone and  it sounds good  but nothing great and these are heavier and look more bulky than my iems  if i return something  i want it returned in pristine condition so i don t feel like i abused the policy  so i only used them for an hour before packing them up so why did i give these five stars  well  this morning i unpacked it again and tried them again on my phone  again  meh  not bad in any way but not amazing  out of curiosity  i then plugged them into my ess     hifimediy portable dac amp  not expensive  only      when i got it in       and wow    they were elevated to        headphone status  every song sounded amazing  exciting  perfect bass  highs and mids  so these are apparently much harder to drive than people think but if you give them a proper dac amp they will sound amazing conclusion  if you re going to drive them off of your phone  they re ok i guess but probably meh  if you have a basic dac amp with sufficient power  they re amazing      
440,5.0,                       i ve used these headphones everyday for   years now and i still love them as much as the day i bought them  i bought these during the      prime day for      and i couldn t be more pleased with the purchase i wear them for usually     hours per day and i never have had any problems with the comfort  however  i did purchase a set of velour ear pads a month or so after my purchase  which i highly recommend  these are a closed back set of headphones and over the ear so there s not a whole lot of noise that bleeds out and could annoy nearby people  sound quality is great to me  though i am no audiophile i also received the brooklyn labs bluetooth adapter as a christmas present this past year  i originally hated it  i thought the sound quality was horrible  but it turned out to be an issue with my pc s bluetooth receiver and not the headphone adapter  i still think it s a bit expensive at      given the build quality but it s a lot cheaper than purchasing a whole different set of headphone just to use as a wireless pair      
441,4.0,                       amazing quality for the price  i have be clear and fair  you need sonarworks to get the full     star rating these headphones are capable of producing throughout the frequency range  to be fair these headphones are designed for music production and mixing engineering purposes  although these headphones are capable of cancelling some noise while recording vocals  they are not specifically designed for noise cancelling purposes  hence why professional studio environments have the budget to acquire multiple different headphone types to meet specific listening requirements  the material quality is very durable and long lasting without diminishing over time  i highly recommend this model for any home studio mixers and producers  again if your serious about sound i would highly suggest saving for sonarworks reference   to get that extra     out of your headphones and or monitors      
442,5.0,                       hassle free set up out of the box  charge them first  pair them and you will not have to worry again  just use the on device controls to adjust them  i don t know the specs  but my sound was weak and these headphones provided a boost  long battery life makes charging infrequent  i really like these headphones because they are well made  work as advertised  and are easy to use  you might have a comfort problem though  i have odd shaped ears so i do have to move the headphones around once in a while  but that may not apply to everyone      
443,5.0,                    tiene una gran calidad de sonido  a pesar de obviar el uso a trav s de dispositivos m viles el sonido no est  nada mal  aunque la funcionalidad principal no es esa  los compre porque manejo podcast para radio y gran compra  presenta buena calidad de sonido al momento de conectarlos a una interfaz cumpliendo con gran desempe o  s  que existen mejores por un precio similar  pero no me arrepiento en absoluto de la compra por la calidad precio que brinda  ofreciendo un plus al momento de editar audio sobre todo al momento de resaltar los bajos         
444,5.0,                       i have owned a set of bose and other brands  these are by far the best sound quality i have had with headphones  it just doesn t have noise cancellation  i also did buy some new around ear cushion  the original had better sound isolation but i preferred a set that held went more fully around my ears and that also hold them farther off my ears for more comfort      
445,5.0,                       i have had the non bluetooth model for years and have been very happy with them  i like to stay up and watch steven colbert every night  but my partner would rather sleep  so  bluetooth headphones were the answer  when i saw the at    was now available in a bluetooth model  there was no hesitation to buy  these sound great  they are very easy to pair  and battery life is incredible      
446,5.0,                       oh my goodness  the sound separation in these headphones is phenomenal  for the past eight years i ve been using a      pair of bose noise cancellation headphones  similar in size  shape  and cushioning as these   i couldn t believe how much better the audio technica sounded  even plugged into a      walkman  personal cd player  especially at less than half the price of bose headphones  i was delighted and really impressed  i know a lot of reviews have already been written on this item  but i wanted to add my endorsement  as a long time audiophile listener  mostly to ambient music       
447,5.0,                       i was scouting a new pair of over the ear headphones for awhile  i was looking at shure  behringer  sennheiser and audio technica  i have a small studio in my home and write my own albums  i have quite nice equipment so i decided it was time for a good quality over the ear monitors simply based on reviews alone for these headphones i decided to give them a shot  held onto my receipt of course in case it was all hype  these headphones are hyped for a reason  they are awesome and give incredible sound  they isolate outside noise very well  the audio coming through is very crisp and bright and it has incredibly good bass  i had been using skullcandy in ear headphones for years and am incredibly glad i made the jump to these phones and this brand  these phones make my mixes sound so much better and writing music is simply more enjoyable      
448,5.0,                       i cannot brag enough about these headphones  i ve been consistently using them everyday since i bought them  i use them to watch tv and play video games quietly without disturbing other people  i m a night owl  they are super comfortable  there s no sound leakage  and i swear the soundscape is fan freaking tastic  i never considered myself an audiophile before  but these headphones are on another level  i used them with music  because i was curious  and they basically ruined all other headphones for me  and they re comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time  which i ve done watching tv and playing video games  with video games though  they re good enough that i can pinpoint where noises are coming from in games then follow the noise  they re that good  if that makes sense  anyway  best headphones i ve ever owned  thousand times recommend      
449,5.0,                       feels great on the ears and head  not too heavy  not too light  construction feels quite sturdy sound is phenomenal for a headset under      seriously  these are great  i go through headset almost yearly and have been trying many different types over the years  my last set were the sony mdr close to the same price as these  and these things are clearly better in every way  the highs sound cleaner and bass fuller with a little more thump feel to it  no distortion in playback at all hearing noise outside of the headphones is less also  so that s nice  i m very impressed with these  if i can manage to not break them for a year  i ll for sure continue to go with audio technica      
450,5.0,                       these are very good headphones  i had a pair of beats pro headphones that i really liked  i m not really an audiophile i just like to casually listen  i like the beats for the bass and they were louder at the same volume level  the worst thing about the beats is they were the most uncomfortable headphones i have ever worn  after just   minutes of listening they became annoying and not enjoyable to wear  the audio technicas on the other hand are super comfortable  i can wear for hours at a time and no complaint  the sound quality is great  not as loud or bassy as the beats  but with proper tuning and eq adjusts can be everything you want it to be and more  i would highly recommend these  plus the pricing is great      
451,3.0,                       as someone who honestly owns way too many headphones  expensive and cheap  i think these are overpriced for what you re getting  the highs are just too sharp and they have exaggerated bass  there are so many better options  i d recommend the audio technica ath ws    is over these by a mile  the akg k    is also a better option      
452,1.0,                       like many others on this list  the device simply never worked for me  i gave them the opportunity to send me a replacement  and that one never worked either   the device shows up as  ble ath m  xbt  in the pairing  but it responds with  try connecting your device again   occasionally  a second  unknown device  will show up while this is going on  but attempting to connect to that one yields  we didn t get any response from the device    i thought maybe it was my pc  so i paired to another set of headphones  and they worked just fine  idk if the entire line is faulty  or if it s a software issue  or what      
453,5.0,                       see other reviews for audio quality  i only want to comment on comfort  i was very hesitant to buy these for fear they d make my ear tissue sting like my older wired audio technicas  or give me headaches from clamping pressure  they don t  they re snug  and the first time i wore them i thought they gripped too tightly  but i have now had them for a couple weeks and wear them for hours at a time  in bed  working out  running  or watching stuff on my laptop  and they re great  the clamp is snug but not uncomfortable  and i appreciate the grip when i run or lift  if you were literally just going to sit at a computer  and then  why buy wireless   i d say get something bigger and looser  but for moving around  i d likely prefer these  i m a bigger guy and imagine i have an above average sized head      
454,5.0,                       ok   i never leave reviews but these are too good long time beats solo   user  recently discovered tidal for hifi quality streaming  way better than spotify for audio quality    wanted a great set of headphones to fully appreciate the audio quality   first tried a pair of grado    e s   crazy uncomfortable   i didn t think it would bother me but it did   the grado highs mids are beautiful but sometimes a bit harsh   low end was virtually nonexistent   i was also in a conundrum with the huge grado cable and its weak clamp force   would these fall in the sink while i m doing the dishes   not secure at all insert the m  xbt best of both worlds   wireless when you need to be wireless   very subtle audio quality substitute for that portability wired when you have the chance to just sit and enjoy tunes great clamp force   very comfortable   great low end  these phones put a smile on my face and made me want to dance if you really want to melt into your tunes  add in a dragonfly black and these sing ath  xbt   tidal   dragonfly black   happiness you re welcome      
455,5.0,                       i have  for the longest time  settled for cheaper headphones and opted to replace them more frequently my purchase of the audio technica m  x is my first investment for a high quality set of studio headphones  they have excellent build quality  the ear padding is extremely comfortable and allows for extended gaming hours without  fatigue  that commonly comes with headphones  the padding around the ears is firm yet soft enough for glasses to be worn without feeling like they are being pressed into your head  a common problem with other headphones  the sound quality is excellent  the only problem is once in a blue moon  a song will have too much bass  although  this is rather subjective sound quality is        very impress with durability  i would recommend these headphones to anyone looking to have a first entry into high quality studio headphones      
456,5.0,                       oh my god  i expected these to be good  i just got them  and i just started listening to them  i m not an audiophile  i haven t even broken them in yet  but  i ve read that s thing  i tell you what  though  i can sure as hell tell the difference between these and my sol republic v  headphones i got a few years ago  those  and  i imagine many of the same ilk  needlessly boost bass and people think that s a good thing  listening to sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band  i m loving how clear everything is  i have them plugged into a fiio e  k usb dac and headphone amplifier  https   www amazon com gp product b  lp amc   that s only     right now  i literally don t think i can listen to anything else now if i want to listen to music  this is absurd  it s amazing  do yourself a favor and add this to your cart      
457,5.0,                       i sold at headphones when i was selling instruments and professional audio gear  i have a pair of   s that were     back in the day  here s something people get wrong about these headphones  these are reference monitors   meaning they have a flat frequency response   most headphones have a boosted bass and treble and scooped midrange  so people s ears are used to hearing that frequency profile   these reproduce sound as it was recorded  they do not color sound   what you put in them as close to the original recording or sound source as possible   the sound is balanced   the bass is tight as it should and not flabby and eating your other frequencies up and it doesn t have jacked treble to kill your eardrums  the bluetooth works great  the mic does a great job with phone calls  the battery life is amazing  they are comfortable to wear  as far as being  cheap made  all headphones are made of plastic  so unless you re throwing them around  they will last a good while   it s basic   take care of your stuff and it won t break  these are worth the price tag   great balanced sound   not harsh or shrill   buy them       
458,5.0,                       simply amazing  been hearing the hype about these headphones for years  finally got them and it s simply insane  i ve tried bose  sony  and these are king in the crisp clariity you get but if you value noise cancelling then these won t do it for you  don t get me wrong they have more then solid isolation but nothing like sony or bose with the active noise cancelling they provide they do have a version of these with noise cancelling but it messes with the profile and ruins the whole sound signature from what ive read online      
459,4.0,                       robust sound profile  sturdy and luxurious feel  wide sound area i have a huge head and these headphones feel pretty tight  but i think with time they will clamp less  i hope  clamping pressure is my biggest complaint so far they sound nice and flat on a desktop sound card but i like bass and take the liberty of using an equalizer to make them sound how i like  even with an extreme bass setting  high hats in music still sound pretty shrill and piercing  i m not sure why that is i think these headphones are going to take some getting used to  they don t have any detriments that would make me return them yet but i didn t love them immediately    stars      
460,5.0,                       these headphones are the perfect size for my head didn t have to readjust anything  they fit comfortable over my glasses which isn t common for me  i can wear these for hours without discomfort i d say about   to   with glassesi mainly listen to edm and dubstep and some rap i think these sound great especially for someone coming from some beats solo hd which were uncomfortable didn t sound as great and cost more than these i think these are a great pair of high quality and good priced headphones i got mine for just over      and i have seen them as low as           
461,5.0,                       well  you need proper equipment to make these monitors to show what they can  they are much better that anything else i tried  including sony mdrv   but with a good player only  for example with macbook  samsung s  etc  i wasn t able to get good results      
462,5.0,                       i have had this set for a good time in the beginning i were hesitant about them as others complained about  warmth built up around the ears  due to the ear covers this headset surprised me with a massive overall sound spectrum   all the way from the bottom frequency to high the base is there in a pleasant way without overpowering  same with the high ends m  x is a great unit no matter if you listen to classic or rockn  roll the latest ac dc album power up  released just he other day  is a true test for the headphones delivers a crisp sound all over as a drummer  the drums sounds exceptional through the phones if you are keen to get good a headset without spending to much  try these out      
463,3.0,                       having many years ago purchased the wired version of athm   which i absolutely love  i found this wireless version to be quite a disappointment but not enough of a disappointment to return them   the sound quality is noticeably worse than the old wired pair by comparison and i can hear some distortion in some songs such as chandelier   the controls on the earpiece of the headphone are difficult to find and use  not very ergonomic in terms of use   unlike my sony wireless phones  you cannot easily switch from connecting from one device to another   the documentation  such as it is  for this product seems to indicate this is possible but i have only managed to change devices once by accident by first removing the earphones from bluetooth on the device and then reconnecting   so if you plan to buy these headphones  you better be prepared to attach them to only one device and stick with it rather than to think you can easily use it to connect to multiple devices   so i am using them solely with my ipad and they are the best bluetooth headphones i have for that device   fortunately  i have other bluetooth headphones of slightly less sound quality that i can use to easily connect and unconnect from all my other devices   so overall  these have been a disappointment   i didn t feel bad enough about them to return them but i would most certainly never purchase them again and am generally sorry i purchased them in the first place      
464,1.0,                       these came new and one of the speakers was semi blown out  couldn t turn my computer over halfway up without them adding a ton of distortion  i produce music   even the beats by dre i ve had in the past blow these out of the water  for production the had tons of clicks and pops that aren t being cause by my daw  my tracks sound great on my monitors cell phone iphone headphones any other headphones or in the car  but like trash on these  idk if they suck or if i just got a defective one  but either way i ve used these when my friends had them too and those pair  also ha dalit of harshness to their frequencies  i d just get something else  returning mine for sure and getting sennheisers instead      
465,5.0,                       i have to say that these are the best sounding headphones i ve ever used  and i have used a lot of headphones  now i tested them on my laptop  as well as my phone and they are absolutely beastly on my phone  s  edge  build quality the whole headphone construction is plastic  aside from the aluminum frame that hides nicely under the leather  the frame is very  very flexible  and the headphones are easy fit  despite having plastic constructions  these headphones feel premium  another place where i d give some remakrs is that the cables they ship with are just too good  they are thick with the right amount of rugged feel to them  you get   cables in total  one     meter straight cable  one     meter coiled cable  the one i m using right now  and one     meter straight cable comfort now usually you d expect the headphones to be heavy  as well uncomfortable  well the good thing is that these headphones are extremely comfortable despite being a bit on the heavier side  the fit is extremely snug  and the easily accommodate your ears within the generously spaced ear cups  the padding is really  really soft  and doesn t warm your ears at all  i spent about   hours wearing them constantly  and surprisingly  didn t have to take them off to adjust  or to scratch my ears  the headphones use faux leather as the padding  and it s really  really soft  though for those who want  there s custom made leather padding available too sound quality now comes the most important part  i was really scared despite all the positive reviews i ve read  and watched  however  the phone remark that sealed the deal for me was when my friend working in studio told me that he uses these headphones to mix and master the amazing ehl e rock music  the sound on these is just    too good  more like phenomenal  these don t ship with an overpowered bass  or an overpowered treble  they have a completely flat frequency response that gives them the ability to adjust themselves to pretty much any genre of music you listen to  i tested several different sub genres of metal including heavy  thrash  and progressive  and i was surprised how these headphones were solid even when i used the  flat  equaliser  as well as my own  there is an amazing amount of noise isolation that s completely passive  to test it out  i sat in my parent s room to work  and listened to slayer  opeth  alter bridge  and a couple of other bands on max volume  and there wasn t any sound leaking final thoughts it doesn t matter if you are a metal head  these headphones treat the music like the music was tuned for these  it doesn t matter if you are listening to mp   or flac  the sound will still be as refined as it gets  i am going to an extent of saying that these are the best sounding headphones i ve ever used  and thanks to their low impedance  i can use them on my phone without sacrificing on anything      
466,5.0,                       i originally ordered the sennheiser momentum which sounded very good but were so uncomfortable i had to send them back   emusic enterprise sent me an open box which contained used headphones  fulfilled by prime anyway  these m  x s are wonderful  my macbook air handles them quite well  due to their relatively low impedance  not so much on my ipad but i listen to them on the macbook     of the time  i think the sound is at least comparable to the momentums if not better  i say that because there s slightly more separation with these and a more opened soundstage  the bass is less muddled and they re much more comfortable  so yea i just convinced myself that they are better  to my ears  than the momentums i wouldn t hesitate to recommend these to anyone that s looking for a pair of headphones under          the legacy continues      
467,5.0,                       wow    these are amazing sounding headphone   they blow beats  bose  and even my bang and olufsen out of the water   i really can t explain to you how good they sound   but here is my breakdown looks  well  lets just say they are not lookers   they re not bad  but people aren t ever going to say that these look good on you   lots of plastic  and some of it feels cheap   however  i can tell that these will hold up under excessive use   i would recommend a hard shell case if you travel a lot comfort  again  not the best in this category either   my b o and bose are more comfortable  but they are not  by any means  uncomfortable   the cups are large enough to fit over my larger ears  and they don t press too hard on either side   plus  you can stretch them out by pulling on both ear cups   they did get a little hot after using for       minutes  but my ears tend to get hot in any headset sound  these are the best  most balanced headset i have ever heard   i have much more expensive and higher quality cans  but i keep going back to these for my daily use   the sound stage ins t that wide  i ll say that   but the highs are crisp and not too hissy  the bass is firm and not fake  the mids are mild and smooth   everything just sounds the way it should and not processed   my b o which cost three times as much  can t compare with these  neither can my beats or bose for that matter    you almost forget they are on  until my ears get warm  as the sound isn t harsh at all   everything just blends nicely   jazz music is especially nice in these   get yourself some good flac files and enjoy these babies   for their current price of       its a steal overall  i was hesitant to buy these  because i already have a few pairs of cans   i listened to all the reviewers on youtube  and when i saw they were only       i went for it   i am so  very happy that i pulled the trigger   go for it      
468,5.0,                       i have had many pairs of headsets from logitech s flagship the g     steel series artis  to sennheiser s game one and the gsp     and expect for the sennheisers not much can come close to being comparable with this headset  from the build to the amazing sound stage  it is by far my favorite headset ever  my volume is normally at    plus with other headsets but with these  i can barely go above     even at     it s loud and super clear      
469,5.0,                       this is my  st bluetooth headset   i have been a wired person for years and i finally decided to go the bt route since i like to just listen untethered and be able to move around and not have to disconnect   did alot of homework and the at headphones came out on top   the separation between left and right is amazing   and i am able to hear notes and instruments i never heard with cheap ear buds  headphones and i hate to say it   even my bose headsets    the original cups on the headset are a wee bit small and i feel a little trapped in them   i did buy some aftermarket cups but have not yet put them on   battery life is awesome and lives up to the specs  button placement is a pain especially if i want to fast forward to the next song  but its something i can get past  definitely well worth it considering the price point   although not active noise canceling  the cups do a great job masking out the external noise      
470,3.0,                       these headphones have decent but not great sound   they make a slight buzz noise all the time   they are no better than headphones that cost half the price   maybe the wired version is better than the wireless version   i m talking about the wireless version      
471,5.0,                       i had considered purchasing these headphones in the past  but ended up getting the v moda crossfade m     s instead  also from amazon  after losing my v moda s  i purchased these  then i found my v moda s  but decided to keep using the ath m  x as my main set of headphones the headphones sound fantastic  while the v moda s have slightly more bass  it s not by that much  one thing that i will say is that the ath m  x do require a bit of burn in time  out of the box they sound good  but not overly impressive  after a couple days of solid use at work  the difference is easily noticeable  the sound is balanced  and the bass is punchy and has some depth  the mids and highs are more noticeable than on the v moda s the build quality feels quite solid  although they may not be quite as sturdy or as stylish as the v moda s  which feel indestructible   see build quality update below they are noise cancelling   i don t hear anyone around me unless i have the volume set very low finally  i bought the amazon warehouse deals set for      and to my surprise  there wasn t any damage to the headphones  not even a tiny scratch  all cords were present  quite a deal  so give that a try if you re up for it update  these have outlasted the v moda m     for build quality  my v moda s started to fall apart around the metal hinges and are no longer wearable  or repairable  unless maybe you weld or duct tape them together  i have had absolutely no issues with the build quality of the ath m  x and i use them every day at work in front of the computer  still very happy with the purchase of the ath m  x a few years later      
472,5.0,                       i really like these headphones   not the best of its kind  but for the quality you get for the price  it s hard to beat the materials are very comfortable and construction seems very solid   they fold up nicely for storing and the multiple cables are useful   sound is great   very clear and detailed sound on a monitoring like flat eq   soundstage is decent and provides full sound without an exaggerated range drowning out other details i use this mainly for listening to music and my computer   the     jack i ll use to plug into my keyboard or electric drums for quiet practice and sound quality is nice   don t work with my guitar amps though     only play sound through one ear piece i got white to be different  and dirt will build up on the head band  but just pay attention and clean it occasionally and it ll be fine overall  these are a great set of cans  for me at least   would definitely buy again      
473,1.0,                       i wanted good wireless headphone yet i wanted the m  x so this was a easy decision  but i was so wrong  as soon as i connected via bluetooth to my phone i had issues  i tried my pc issues     even my bluetooth rx tx thing issues  this is honestly a joke and wired they don t sound to different from my older m  x headphones like come on audio technica whats going on right after i summit this review ill be returning these headphones and go with some beyerdynamic headphones     
474,4.0,                       the cord they come with is very heavy and it makes an audible vibration sound in the headset whenever it bumps into anything which is usually my desk  the default cord also comes directly down out of the left ear piece which collides with my shoulder frequently enough to notice  but it s not the end of the world these are not comfortable to wear for long periods of time  i wear headphones for   hours at work and then i come home and wear headphones for another few hours  i can only wear these for around   hours before they really start bothering me and i am adjusting them constantly or just taking them off entirely  prior to purchasing these  i used some steel series gaming headphones at home and work for many years and did not experience such comfort issues  i only stopped wearing them because their fake leather padding was making a mess everywhere and many were complaining i can t quite put my finger on why they re just so uncomfortable  i want to say it is the ear cups and the pressure of the cups pressed on the side of the head  they seal really well  but just something about the texture and pressure is driving me bonkers  maybe i should try the alternate ear cups you can purchase the audio is not the issue  and is covered in enough detail by any number of other reviews      
475,5.0,                       switching to these from multiple  gaming  headsets is insane  i have tried logitech g    s  corsair void pro s  astro a   s  and probably    more at least  over the span of looking for something with great bass  sound  and a mixture of everything  i had actually got recommended these headphones from an acquaintance  who is an audio engineer  i told him i originally that i wanted something wireless  with simulated     surround  for a while i didn t want wired  only wireless  due to moving around a lot  and in the past wired headset s wires have been very annoying but after a good sale went on these  i knew that i had to pull the trigger on them to at least see if i would like them  these are the single greatest headset i have ever owned  the sound is mind blowing  something that you definitely need to try  these being wired have a ton more range audio wise  less latency  and more balanced sound that is not emphasizing the bass like those gaming headsets  these bring out true audio appreciation  i denied buying them for so long because i didn t believe they could be better  i was so wrong  honestly the wires on these headphones i barely notice is there a lot of the time  also not having to charge headphones feels so great these headphones will change the way you think about audio  but also can be used for almost anything  gaming  music  etc  the quality of these headphones isn t just the sound though  the quality  durability  design  and  compatibility is what makes these headphones so amazing  the earcups swivel  flip  and being collapsible makes them so amazing  they don t feel bulky or big when sitting around your neck with the earcups flat  it feels very nice out of the box audio technica gives you a variety of cables you can use with these headphones  and also a very nice little carrying case is included to keep them safe  and neatly packed during travel  another key thing about these is sound isolation is very great with these  but after a little while of use the cushions can become very uncomfortable  i have been looking into getting aftermarket ones  but the cushions aren t to bad for me overall if you have been in the market looking for a pair of new headphones  audio technica s headphones will not let you down  if you even think about purchasing these do it  you will not be let down by the quality of this product in every way  you ll be very satisfied and impressed with what you get out of these  you can find these headphones on sale if you patiently wait  that is another main reason i could not push myself to buy these  but after using them definitely do it   i would definitely recommend these to a friend or anyone interested in a new pair of headphones that won t disappoint them at all  i hope if this review helped you make a decision  i hope you ll be as impressed as i was      
476,1.0,                       brand new  absolutely love this headphones  zero issues after   months of use update november  th  something is broken on left speaker  when i play some music with high bass it started to rattle like there is no tomorrow  my favorite headphones are now broken   s     
477,5.0,                       so  you could say i m a bit of an audio technica loyalist  i ve been comparing their products to other sound companies since         music really helped get me through my first trip to afghanistan  none of my purchases with them have gone over       so as far as a company like sennheiser is concerned  there s some limitations    but whether it be akg  sony  bose    i ve had a history of buying two products from different companies around the same time to do a comparison  why  if i m going to be deaf by     i want to make sure i enjoy the sounds up to that point either way  i recently decided to hit the refresh with what goes over my ears  i m guilty of actually returning to a using the audio technica ath ad     not with the x  the most over the last decade  since my original purchase forever ago    you know  the flashy headphones with that beautiful pink open air siding  they re great headphones  still  either way  to this product    strap in folks  i m not gruntled by what i ve seen from other reviews when looking over the critical reviews that seem to get helpful votes  they seem to float around the   star mark  but for weird reasons  i read one that said too many of the headphone components were plastic     what do you expect     did you take the headphones apart to examine the components that are actually producing the sound     not all plastic is junk  and while    sure    i can expect increased durability from a headphone frame made with nickel or whatever other metal alloy    if you can get at least three years out of your plastic framed headphones  almost every headphone has plastic on the market  without a break  that s a victory i read another review that was critical of the bass for these headphones  saying there was none  that review floored me  while this is not a   to   comparison  i m at the point with my current car that the sound system is worth a couple thousand more than the car itself  i have a great deal of appreciation for good clean bass that doesn t obstruct the mids and highs that make musician s music  shine     y all  these headphones have bass  they have bass not only where they are supposed to have bass  but in pleasantly unexpected places that in my opinion make relevant recent music better  for instance  for lady gaga s stupid love  you can tell that it is supposed to have a persistent and pleasant bass kicker going throughout the song  these headphones when not wired  accomplish making that kicker immersive    on their own    as in  you don t have to play around with the bass settings of whatever machine you re listening to music on  and i think that s effing fantastic this is when i m going to talk about why i m actually really appreciative of these headphones  i originally wasn t going to leave a review yet because the first set i got in the mail was defective  one of the ear pieces was facing outside  which of course would make listening to music with both ears a bit difficult  either way    i said  screw it   to give the quality a check after confirming getting my replacement through amazon   thank you amazon customer support    bezos needs to pay all you folks more than you do get paid   if we lived in some alternate dimension where i was a sports  caster only being able to used a headphone and mic set on one ear  leaving the other exposed    i would write an angry letter to audio technica demanding why they made all other headsets disappointing in comparison  i say this while also letting you all know that i recently purchased audio technica ath adg x headset with mic   don t get me wrong  it s a solid headset that is built specifically for gaming and not studio production    but the m  xbt sound quality is in a different league  whatever  besides the point these headphones are great  i haven t tried listening to music with the aux cable in use  i think i read another review saying there is a difference in quality  as if that s a bad thing  y all  of course sound quality through a cable is going to be improved compared to something sent through the air waves  do you think the music your listening to on the radio is going to be the same quality as when you listen to it via disk  flac  or wav  come on    please  appreciate the care that has gone into a good set of wireless headphones that still lets you plug in so  yeah  i m disappointed that i got a defective product from audio technica  i m not going to hold it against them though because even if defective  i can still tell that it s a superior product  and i m just going to treat this like a practical joke  like   hahaha  dillon  first time buying our wireless headphones  huh  you re late to the party  idiot  if you ve made it throughout this entire review  you re a champion of patience also  i m writing this review  june    right now  a lot of people are hurting across the world for various reasons and the united states is not immune to the trials and tribulations of human struggles  however  some people experience unfortunate dispositions by being treated differently  and in many cases inhumane  just because of their skin color  i want to applaud bezos for his firm stance on black lives matter  although  i think he can definitely afford to not only donate more money to the cause  but also pay his freaking employees more  while being employed is far better than unemployment  that doesn t always guarantee people will thrive or that their struggles will be greatly relieved dude  you bald lex luthor looking jabroni  pay your people more tldr  black lives matter      
478,5.0,                       came with   cords and a carrying bag    sound amazing  bass isn t overwhelming but they are capable of some crazy bass with eq adjustments via your output  treble is nice and bright  dead on  midrange is very present  love the sound signature on these isolation is about     where      would be complete isolation from outside noise and or sound leak from the headphones themselves  in a silent room there is some sound leak  and in a loud room i can hear the outside world at lower volumes  the isolation is sufficient for my uses  may not be for yours overall this is a great headset  looks great  build quality is great and most importantly it sounds great      
479,4.0,                       man    i so wanted to give these   stars   if you ve read many of the reviews  you will see quite a range of opinions on these   from the best things i ve ever heard  to total junk   the build quality is absolutely top notch in my opinion  pretty comfortable for an hour or so  but after that my ears were getting sore  i may just need to get used to them   and they may form better to my head width and shape as time goes on   i found the sound a bit  muddier  with more bass color than i was thinking hoping   but i m getting to really like listening to a variety of music on them  also using with my small studio with daw and virtual instruments  drum machine  etc   not exactly neutral sound for mixing  but i wasn  t really expecting that  from reading the reviews   from what i ve read  the m  x would probably have flatter response for mixing or studio work  but i wanted the larger drivers and better build  a trade off   love the removable cord  and selection of cords and carry bag  like the swivel cups and folding design too  overall very happy  i m no audiophile  and just wanted something better than the        phones i ve been using over the years   no regrets with these cans  and liking them more all the time i think      
480,4.0,                       these headphones are pretty nice  at first i was disappointed with the sound because i was so used to low quality earbuds screeching at points and being too quiet in others  but these headphones are the same volume throughout a song after listening for a few weeks i started to love how my ears were never ringing after spending hours at a time using them you know how some people in youtube videos apologize for the microphone quality  or comments saying  rip headphone users   i d wonder what they were taking about  haha   these headphones protect my ears from that my siblings are always stealing these headphones from me and watching shows on them because they sound good there re two reasons why i give these headphones a   star and not a   these headphones don t do a spectacular job of blocking noise  the main reason i decided to buy these  i commute by bus to my campus for    mins to and back  yup  pure torture  but i can still here the engine of the bus and outside noise  but it drowns conversations and tries to help me forget the guy snoring next to me the second reason why i give this   is because i think these headphones can have a stronger bass  i listen to pop  kpop  r b  and for some songs i want to jam hard  i love how the instruments never overpower the artist  that s my pet peeve in headphones  but it would be nice if the bass was stronger the sound doesn t leak until you go past     volume  if the room or library is dead quiet  having     volume is loud enough and no one can hear you  my siblings and i tested this for awhile  trust me  the removable cord is a lifesaver  my cord ripped so i replaced it with one of the extra cords i got in seconds last thing about comfort  i wear thick framed glasses so i d give it a      in comfort  they feel great without glasses on but that can t help me one bit  cause i m blind as a bat  i feel a little pressure where my frames are after an hour or two of use so i take them off for a while i wish this review was more professional  but i m a broke college student who got her very first pair of good headphones   hope this review helps      
481,3.0,                       to be clear  i purchased these specifically for their wireless bluetooth functionality  and because much of the hype around these had to do with the sound quality and comfort   both of those things are important to me  and that s why i was finally willing to step up into a set of headphones that cost more than i m comfortable paying the sound quality was good  but if i m being honest just not good enough for the price   according to some reviewers  it is much better in wired mode    but again  i specifically purchased these to be a great set of wireless headphones and then the real deal breaker  at least for me    this is quite possibly one of the least comfortable sets of headphones i ve ever owned   i have a cheap set of bluetooth headphones  made by some private label vendor that sells them here on amazon  and that cheap set is   x more comfy than these   the ear padding on these is ok  but the real sore spot for me was the padding that goes on top of your head   super thin  and it irritated me every time i tried to use them   it did not take me very long to realize that this wasn t going to be a long term commitment these things combined were just too much for me  and i ended up returning the headphones for a refund   i am going to continue my research and try and find that perfect set of      headphones  but these just weren t it      
482,5.0,                       these have been rated as best choice by scores of reputable review web sites  i ve worn them for   to   hours per day for well over   years   have enjoyed every minute  to get a better pair of headphones  you ll have to spend upwards of       they re that good  if you don t have  golden ears     deep pockets  these phones can t be beat  very comfortable   the sound is stellar  after heavy usage for   years  the replaceable cable developed an open ground but the phones come with two cables   the other being  considerably longer   i bought the newfantasia replacement upgrade cable model at   because i wanted a shorter cable   it has proven to be a bit better than the original  you can buy these headphones with confidence that you ll be very pleased  highly recommended      
483,5.0,                       i love these headphones  they re my go to at work  the addition of a microphone is great  i owned wired m  x before so i knew what to expect  however these have a bit more bass than my previous ones  they also are a bit more comfortable  battery life is    hours as advertised  which is nuts  even when i forget to turn them off  it auto shuts off for me and saves valuable time that i would have to spend charging them instead      
484,2.0,                       in terms of sound quality  these headphones were certainly a step up from my     sony pair  they do offer substantial isolation from outside sound  this was in evidence when i wore them outside and felt the sounds of the bypassing traffic to be muted  but this isolation comes at the cost of significant physical discomfort  the earpads clamp down on the sides of the head with enough force to make wearing them for more than       minutes at a time a chore  if worn for too long  they are apt to give me a headache  maybe it is possible that in time  they will stretch out a bit  maybe at the cost of some isolation   but no one should undergo so much discomfort along the way  i find myself switching back to my cheap sony pair often  in light of this  i see the benefits of active noise cancellation  maybe headphones earphones with anc won t need to clamp down so damn hard to achieve sound quality      
485,5.0,                       best headphones for gaming i have ever had  it isn t super bassy but provides an adequate amount that satisfies  i ve played doom  bf   witcher    cs source and go  and they sound phenomenal  i came from the dark corners of gaming headsets  using a  s  razor s     tiamat  and turtle beach and none of them hold a candle light to these  sound is crisp and can hear the softest of sounds  the soundtrack to the witcher   sounds amazing giving it a different feel then before  if you are crawling out of that dark corner that i once resided in myself  ascend to greatness and buy these  it s well worth the buy  and for a mic you can always buy an attachment for like    bucks so you re good there as well      
486,5.0,                       i bought these headphones at the beginning of       over the past   years  i ve taken them to   different continents  hundreds of plane rides  thousands of miles on the road  and they are still holding up the sound quality hasn t faded  even when i went though my edm phase bass  it s balanced  you won t be vibrating in your seat  but you ll definitely feel the music treble  clear and crisp comfort  wearing these for    hours can become tiring  taking about a    to    minute break usually helps the ear pads have been deteriorating for about a year now  but there are replacements that can be found here on amazon  i just had some shipped today and am excited for another   years of use      
487,1.0,                       these things sound terrible  excessive  bloated  woofy bass  distant thin treble  with nothing in between  and poor efficiency  no difference using bt or the cable  except there is some constant background hash added when the bt is active  was looking for a decent wireless alternative to my shure srh   s and i guess i will keep on looking  if people are making music with these then it would explain some of the regrettable mixing results out there  if you want boatloads of unintelligible bass  but only at levels your grandma would enjoy  these might be for you      
488,5.0,                       super satisfied with my purchase   i had previously purchased several v moda products  they make stylish products  but after my last set of headphones broke just after a year  i was pretty dissapointed  id say these headphones sound about the same  very good bass  definately more comfortable  and the actual headphone swivel is a superior design  and it s wired    music transmitted over bluetooth using codec is never as good      
489,5.0,                       this was an  open box  purchase from g w  really  new in box  with original packaging  sleeves  etc  pristine  great looking  wonderful sound   comfortable for extended periods  easy to adjust tightness  i use these for music of all types  great sound   be it classical  choral  piano  classic country  abba  queen  etc   e g  my primary source is a sansa clipzip  playerwith rockbox firmware installed  love it  fab sound      
490,5.0,                       just about a year ago  i purchased these headphones used  but in good condition on amazon   recently  one of the buttons stopped working  so i sent it to audio technica for repairs  i expected to have to pay for the repair since i was not eligible for a warranty having paid  unfortunately  the pcb was cracked  so the whole headphones had to be replaced  so the headphones had to be replaced  which audio technica did at no cost to me as if they were under warranty  audio technica excellent customer service indeed  i would recommend to anyone however  most people should not get these particular headphones  instead  get some other ath product  they have a very flexible full year warranty and are of high quality  don t get me wrong  the m  x bt s are very good headphones  and i love mine  but they are more made for professional reference and audio mixing  if you want casual listening there are numerous other products that are more suited  the m  x s sound great and have very sterile and flat sound  which is good for technical applications  warmer and more rounded sounds are better for casual listening  i don t have specific recommendations  but other reviewers have given some headphones in the same price range      
491,5.0,                       i initially purchased both these and the m  x to do a side by side comparison and ended up keeping these  the m  x are fantastic headphones  especially considering their price point  the m  x s are extremely neutral sounding  very flat   their bass is audible  though slighly relaxed   that said  i prefer a little boost to the low end of my music and though it s not a night and day difference  the m  x offer a similar sound signature as the m   s but with just the slightest bump in the lower frequencies   to me  this makes the music sound a lot more robust and enjoyable  i also found the highs to sound just a little more crisp with the m  x  also  doing an a b comparison between the two models with the same source and music  it was quite obvious the m  x were more easily driven  as well as driven to louder volume  than the m  x  likely do to it s higher sensitivity rating   this may also explain why i found the m  x to have greater clarity at all volume levels  making them plenty adequate driven by just an ipod or phone   also  the m  x were better at reproducing a wide range of music   i listen to the most extreme of extreme death metal  think hideous divinity  to the hardest hiphop i can find  gotti  boosie  etc    but i also like kelly clarkson and hank williams sr   literally all these different genres of music sound fantastic on the    s   i can t say the same of the m  x  which can sound harsh with certain genres of extreme metal   you would he hard pressed to find a better jack of all trades headphones at this price   i can t recommend them enough      
492,1.0,                       i d like to start off with i m sure these headphones are great  however  the ones i received were an absolute nightmare  first off  when i opened them and tried to connect them to my pc via bluetooth the only sound it produced was a crackling and popping every now and then  after that i tried to use them plugged in  they worked slightly more in the way that there was far more snapping and crackling  after messing around with it for a while i ended up getting music audio to play  but no voices would come through  i thought that was weird so i googled and found a  solution  that required me to go through my sound properties and mess with the left and right audio levels  i messed around with different numbers and i figured out that     to   respectively got them to  work   i say  work  because it was quality worth about     tops  would i recommend this  probably not  i wouldn t want to be responsible for my friend getting a poor product  i will not be purchasing from audio technica again  however  they did a great job at noise cancelling  so if you don t wanna hear anything at all they re perfect      
493,5.0,                       i bought this from a friend s recommendation after i was about to purchase a third turtle beach px   unit  the px   s plastic headband kept coming apart   the ath m  x unit has a thick and sturdy metal headband that still maintains a firm grip on my head even after a few months of use  also  the sound quality is muuuuuch better  i was listening to one of those     kbps songs from itunes that i d swear sound the same as any other     kbps mp  from the     s  it sounds much better  i think i know what audiophiles are on about  i could close my eyes and almost see the individual instruments being played  usually multiple instruments just kind of    smear into eachother  if that makes sense  my friend says there are headphones that are much more expensive and even higher quality that this one  but this is the one he uses for mixing music for events  love it      
494,5.0,                       i tried these headphones at a friend s and really liked them so bought a set for myself   after only a couple of days i am extremely pleased with them  the sound quality is really excellent   very good bass and very clear sound across the frequency range   listening to vocals last night i noticed i could hear the words much more clearly   they also block external sounds very well   the earcups are large and well padded   in general the headphones are very comfortable to wear for long periods   highly recommended      
495,5.0,                       the quality  features  and sound quality are amazing  truthfully  i initially bought into beats by  we know who      years back  and sure    they sound great too  but they do not showcase the full sound spectrum  only around       hz   so the base is pronounced accentuated to hip hop  etc    this would be great if i was okay with only that genre  but i love all music types     beats doesn t readily publish their headphone specs  a truly painstaking search online or their website   these aths range from             hz  along with other enhancements  the second time around i m a bit smarter and refuse to be fooled      
496,4.0,                       the audio technica ath m  x is the upgraded to the very popular audio technica ath m  s with an improvement on sound and cabling system  they are one of the most versatile headphones on the market while being competitively priced  whether you are video editing  doing music product  or just enjoying music  they will provide you a good experience due to the balanced sound  the lightweight and comfortable design provide hours of use with little to no irritation one of the most important criteria when evaluating a pair of headphones is the sound quality  the m  x s provide an upgraded modern compared to the originals  the sound is clear and balanced which is one of the reasons why these headphones are so functional  they have a significant amount of base that can be slightly overpowering at times  however  the base provides a great experience when playing video games  watching movies  and listening to most music  overall  the m  x s sound quality is excellent and it is one of the best sounding pairs of headphones on the market one of the biggest positives of the m  x is the design  they are an over ear style headphone with large rotating headphone cups and a flexible leather top band  the large ear cups and the flexible top band provide a comfortable noise isolating fit  a key feature of the design is the emphasis they put on portability  the headphones can fold into a small compact shape that allows for easy portability with the included mesh carrying case  while the headphone cable does have a proprietary locking mechanism allowing you to only use audio technica headphone cables  it does come with three headphone cable variants including a     meter straight cable  a   meter straight cable  and a     meter coiled cable  it also comes with a    mm audio jack that can screw onto all of other cables for professional equipment use arguably the biggest criteria when evaluating a product is the price  at first glance  one hundred and forty nine dollars might seem like a lot of money to spend on some headphones  however  they offer better sound quality  overall design  good build quality  and comfort than anything else comparable at this price range      
497,3.0,i recently needed to replace my pair of over the ear headphones so i began my search for a good pair of headphones in the           range  immediately senhiser  beyerdynamic  and audio technica stood out  i first received a pair of the audio technica ath m   x which had good sound but were very uncomfortable if worn for more than an hour or so  then i picked up a pair of the beyerdynamic dt      these headphones had amazing sound quality and comfort but the passive sound isolation was mediocre at best  which is why i ordered a pair of the beyerdynamic premium     which are open back  i figured that the sound quality and comfort would be similar but the open back quality would allow me to talk with others while i played music  unfortunately the     s had worse sound quality than the      a bit harsher sounding and not as clear  and were very uncomfortable even after only a couple of hours  during this time i also ordered a pair of senhiser hd     headphones  while these headphones have a significantly different sound signature than the others i have tried  they were of similar quality  overall the hd     s were slightly less comfortable than the     s but the open back quality was convenient and the sound was quite nice  i would have been satisfied with the hd     s but they were the only pair of headphones i could not drive with my desktop  they produced terrible static  this did not occur when i used the     s on other devices or when i used other headphones  even those with similar impedance and spl  driven by my desktop computer  this prevented me from keeping them  i have attached a breakdown of my thoughts below               sound quality              beyerdynamic dt         ohm    winner highs   quite good representation  much cleaner than senhiser mids   quite good representation lows   a little closed sounding but overall they are handled well overall this is how the music should sound  they perform the most similar to my pair of martin logan motion    s  bookshelf speakers   beyerdynamic premium         ohm  highs   similar to the     s but rather harsh sounding mids   nothing special  no major issues lows   not as powerful as the     s but more spacious  seemed a bit washed out due to the open back design  senhiser hd         ohm    close  nd best highs   not quite as poppy as they should be  they are a bit muted in the sound signature which can make them less fatiguing than other  more analytical  headphones  mids   a bit to high level for me  it tended to make punk rock music sound very close and muddied lows   a bit boomy but very spacious  audio technica ath m   x highs   quite good representation  a bit cold though mids   nothing special  no major issues though lows   too over emphasized                   comfort                 beyerdynamic dt       winner perfect  i wore these on multiple occasions for more than   hours and never noticed any pressure points or discomfort  the headband is larger than average to distribute the pressure  the clamp pressure is also a bit more than average but this was not an issue due to the soft  replaceable  ear pads   beyerdynamic premium     i could not wear these for more than a few hours  the headband is made of a much harder material than the     s and causes a painful pressure point on the top of my head  i believe this is made worse by the lower clamping force since more of the weight is on the top of your head   senhiser hd     i could wear these for several hours as long as i moved them around every       minutes  more comfortable than the     s  significantly less clamping force than the     s   audio technica ath m   x these were the least comfortable  i could only stand to wear them for an hour or so before i had to take them off  all of the discomfort came from the top of my head                   usability                 beyerdynamic dt     these come with a permanently attached   ft cable  that was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time i got up from my desk  the cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average   beyerdynamic dt     these come with a permanently attached   ft cable  that was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time i got up from my desk  the cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average  the open back design was also a plus for me since i work in a semi quiet office environment and i could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music  but i could not hear others quite as well as i could with the hd     s   senhiser hd     the interchange able cables with different lengths worked perfect for home listening as well as on the go  the cable is also thinner and more flexible than the beyerdynamic cable  the open back design was also a plus for me since i work in a semi quiet office environment and i could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music  the only downfall is the issue i had with compatibility between some devices and this pair of headphones where i would hear static or computer noise when driving them with a computer   audio technica ath m   x i really love the long coiled cable that came with these  to me this is the best option since i dont have to lug around a long cable or risk losing extra cables  with that being said  it also came with a    ft straight cable and  ft straight cable if the coiled cable is too much for you 
498,2.0,                       i was very excited when these came out to replace my well travelled momenentum headphones   i do video conferencing most of the time and a lot of music listening at home and on the road i have a wired pair as well that i ve enjoyed for several years     single bluetooth pairing at a time   i guess i ve been spoiled by headphones that do the right thing with multiple devices     unreliable connect   disconnect cycle     not noise canceling   i really missed this     poor build quality  the button for talk on mine is jammed      
499,5.0,                       i got these to replace my jbl everest another great headphone set if you want to stay with the jbl name    i love them there isn t any bad that i ve had so far    the range of the bluetooth is amazing    the battery life of outstanding    the quality of the material is good too    the noise cancellation is pretty dang good too    the bluetooth range is better than my everest set but that s because the jbl s were only the     bluetooth not       i have it at a medium level and did the brake in period and that extends the life of all my audio greatly    look it up if you wanna know more     
500,5.0,                       arguably the gold standard for  don t buy a gaming headset  buy these and a mic   they are a great quality set of headphones sound quality is fairly bass heavy  with an emphasis on listenable  enjoyable audio as opposed to a totally neutral monitoring  they don t require an amp to drive efficiently  tried with my phone  macbook pro  and finally with a basic headphone amp  but will certainly benefit from one  these are not a studio quality reference set of cans  as the aggressive  v  shaped audio signature is not ideal for mixing or mastering they have a good soundstage for a closed back headphone  with a tasteful if not slightly  tight  midrange  they really are the last stop before headphones worth           more as for build quality  it is probably my least favorite thing about the ath m  x   the plastic  while it is certain that the heavy use of plastic inevitably leads to their cost efficiency  i find them a little light and with little metal  i know they will have certain joints that will fail before others outside of that  they are great  they have stayed reliably at the top percentage of headphones for a while and will invariably stay there unless there is a huge shake up  if you want neutrality  look at the sony mdr       if not  this is a great place to be      
501,4.0,                       i originally had the ath m  x and none of the new headphones on the market really matched the sound quality  even the expensive sony or bose  so i figured i would give these a try  i was concerned the sound wouldn t be as good over bluetooth and i had read about some issues with a faint buzzing  i ve had them for about a week now and they sound exactly the same as the original so that s a huge plus  their is a very very faint hissing but only when no other sound is playing and it s so minor you may not even notice it  however  their are two issues i have with these headphones and one other minor thing  firstly  i don t understand why audio technica didn t use usb type c  it s been out for years now and it s extremely annoying especially because the headphones will definitely last a couple of years  secondly  their is a software glitch where if your listening to music and then open a video  the second sound won t play  it will pause the original audio but not play the second  the last thing is not a real gripe but i m just saying i would prefer if ath included a hard case and charged a little more  especially since these are obviously targeting mobile listeners  people aren t bringing bluetooth headphones to the studio  the next iteration should really fix these issues      
502,5.0,                       the quality of this was great  it is comfortable  very clear audio without a dac  even clearer audio with one  i did a mod on my headphones which removed the locking cable so i can use a normal shorter cable  i also  d printed a holder for a wireless reciever that makes this a wireless headset  cannot complain because as it is big and your ears can get slightly sweaty  they are the kind that are easily wipeable and they stay cold over the ears      
503,5.0,                       i m by no means an audiophile  i just appreciate a set of high quality and comfortable over the ear corded headphones to listen to music  i am a software developer  so listen to     hours of music every day  and sometimes    when working on a deadline a few times i ve had to pause my music because i thought i heard a crash outside  after pausing my music  i figured out it was just the headphones and the way it distributed sound that made it sound like a cymbal crash or drum sound was actually outside my headphones  sound quality is amazing  there are probably much nicer headphones out there  but  for the      pricetag on this set  i wonder if there is anything better my wife got tired of hearing me complain about how uncomforable my sennheiser hd     headphones were  i wear glasses while i m working on my computer  and the hd    s clamp my head pretty well  and put inordinate amounts of pressure on the temples and earpieces of my eyeglasses  so  she went onto amazon and found this pair of headphones that had amazing reviews  especially from people wearing glasses while using them  i was a little nervous about the cost  they would be  by a long shot  the most expensive headphones i d have every purchased  then i thought about how many hours a day i use headphones and it became a no brainer if they were as good as the hundreds of positive reviews claimed i can vouch for how awesomely comfortable they are  a perfect amount of pressure to keep them on my head  but loose enough that even though the earpiece of my glasses are underneath  it doesn t cause discomfort  see the attached picture  you can see that the frames of my glasses are pretty wide i also really like how the cord works  it is a thicker cord  but much lighter than other headphone cords  there is a long coiled cord  a long straight cord  both with screw threads for the    mm       component stereo jack adapter  and a third shorter cord  the short cord is the perfect length for me to have plugged into my ipod sitting on the desk next to my computer  i measured it out to about    long  there is no      adapter threading on the short cord  i always hated how i had to coil my sennheiser cord or rubber band it since it was    feet long  but  if i ever needed a longer cord  i could also use the straight or coiled cord amazing value  highly recommended      
504,5.0,                       let me first start this review by saying i am by no means an audiophile or anything  to be honest i probably wouldn t even be writing this  or have gotten this  if it wasn t for my old gaming headset finally breaking  i would rarely use that headset for anything other voice chat also  very rarely would it be used for music or game sound  i decided that i would replace it with something that i could use to listen to game sounds more clearly sometimes  along with music and voice chat  but really  anything is going to be step up from the game headset i have to say that i m fairly impressed overall with this set of headphones  i m picking up things that  even with a decent     system hooked to my computer  i never noticed before  like water on the other side of walls in games  or a drum beat in the background that kind of faded in before  it really makes me excited and i can t wait to continue to explore these in use now i should also mention that i bought a pair of      jbl synchros s    powered over ear stereo headphones  black                        at around the same time  thanks to a good deal in a local store that didn t carry the m  s  and had those for a few days before the m  s arrived  so i did some of the same testing and exploring on them as i did on the m   when it arrived  i have to say that even to my untrained ears i can hear the difference in sound quality and profile between the two  i believe it was said that these were the most neutral sounding phones on the market now  or at least in this price range  and i have to say that that is really the best way to put it  the    s just seem more warm and rich  which is a plus for them in a sense  but ultimately i feel it comes down to having the right set of headphones for the right job  and something more neutral is going to be better for being able to tweak things down the road with equalizers and stuff speaking of tweaks and equalizers  in my  nowhere near exhaustive  testing one thing i was hook these into my computer  duh  and play around the sound card s built in equalizer and its presets features  while by default the bass does seem to be a little lacking  though i can kind of tell it s there  it doesn t take much to start bringing it  just a few little tweaks on settings  maybe enabling the virtual surround  and you ll see some nice differences  it wont get to the same level as others  including the aforementioned    s  but i again feel like that ability to tweak is what really makes these a good pair of headphones in this price range in the end i m going to be keeping both of them i believe  at the moment i m not      sure how much i like the m  s for music  where that warmth and bass can really shine and help  but i feel for use in gaming and the computer use i do that the m  s win hands down  maybe this shouldn t be much of a surprise though since  in hindsight  it feels like the    s were more made for music and smartphone media player use  look at the cord  and the m  s were designed for audio mixing and the like  as the saying goes  pick the right tool for the job  but if you only had to pick one pair of headphones for everything  i would highly suggest this      
505,4.0,                       spending for expensive headsets when the last three went into the garbage before they were even six months old is getting to be a pain technicia for the most part gets good reviews  is half the price of what i ve been spending so i decided to give them a try  the headband is made for big heads  my head is not small  nor large  it s medium  i m thinking about super gluing padded fabric to make it more comfortable the sound is kind of flat  but i will play with it for a while longer to see if i can get bass properly adjusted  does anyone know if there are software programs available for mac to adjust the sound      
506,4.0,                       tl dr   upon plug and play  the left side was louder than the right  i gave the right side two love taps and that fixed the problem  i rate it      if i did not experience any issues  i d rate it    when i received my unit  i plugged it first to my phone  pixel xl   and the left side was noticeably louder than the right side  i tried plugging it into   different audio sources  my phone  pixel xl   my desktop pc  and a laptop  hp    au   wm   the problem persisted in the   sources so i went and searched on google if this was a normal quality of the ath m  xwh  after all the research  i decided my options were to either let it break in  as advised by someone in a forum  or get an rma  i tried to let it break in first  but i got too irritated by the imbalance of volume after a few minutes  so  being the caveman that i am  i gave the right side two love taps and immediately  the right side started to modulate the same volume as the left side  a hilarious experience  i know but that should not be an experience of a consumer that purchases a pair of       headphones  i would rate this   stars if the purchase did not include the anxiety and stress of contemplating if the left side being louder than the right is normal or was it just me receiving a unit with a defect  so i rated it   stars  nonetheless  i ve had lots of gaming headsets  both expensive and cheap  but the ath m  xwh definitely kicked their butts after  fixing  my issue      
507,5.0,                       i ve had these headphones for about   years and they are very comfortable   although i have recently moved up to the very accurate psb m u   red headphones  available on amazon for about       the m  x s have done me well and i will keep them   they are a warm sounding headphone that basically have a response curve that goes from roughly   db at   hz to about   db at   khz   but there aren t any serious peaks or valleys in the curve so they are very easy on the ears   they seem to be tough and reliable   i m glad i purchased them way back      
508,5.0,                       i have a giant head  it is over an    an employee at lids measured it once and said he had never measured a head that big  another customer that was watching just said   daaaaaang   looking on in awe any way  if you have a head as big as mine these headphones will not work  i did a lot of research and purchased them because sights i read said these were great for big heads  the band pushed down on the top of my head and i had a headache after five minutes or so so  why the five stars  while i had m jammed on my head they sounded terrific  take that with a grain of salt as i am not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination  great sounding to me is not having static if you are looking for headphones that will fit a big head  these are for you  if you have a gigantic head  you should probably avoid these      
509,5.0,                       i had been researching for about two weeks on which headphones were the best choice for me  after reading hundreds of audiophiles reviews  i decided to give these a try  i ordered the ath m  x and the ath m  x  the m  x are a better choice for people looking for an amazing balance in listening to all genres of music  the bass isn t overwhelming like the beats and the m  s are more a studio recording headphone  the m  s sound more clear  but your bass is essentially dead  if you just want to hear the singing and any high pitched string or synthesized  sounds then go with the m  s  if you listen to everything like most then go with the m  s  you wont be said    the greatest part about them is that they really seal well so that noise around is cut out as much as possible  its not as good as the bose qc   active noise cancelling  but better than any of the beats active noise canceling  the best part is that you don t have any batteries to worry about as well  also for those that want an inline mic  you can get one that works with the m  s m  s  they have ones for the iphone  i haven t found any for the android yet  if you have an android  buy the iphone inline mic ones and usually the only buttons that don t work on the inline mic are the volume buttons      
510,5.0,                       first of all  i have never liked big brands like beats and skull candy simply because i feel that they hardly match the value for the money we spend  saying that  while going for brands  i considered brands like audio technica  sennheiser and bose while choosing the headphone  checking through the headphones at the local store  i found these best for under       being on student budget  that was the best i could spend   following are my views on it pros    great sound quality and bass effect  for someone who is an edm fan like me    the padding near the ear is really comfortable with a cushion kind of a feeling   noise cancellation is one of the best   the price has decreased almost       i bought it for      cons    the headphones being a little bit heavy  the ears hurt after prolonged use    it doesn t have an integrated microphone   no volume control on it so to wrap it all up  they are the best for their price range  audio technica is a great brand which gives you a good value for money  my recommendation would be to also buy the protection plan for     more so that you can have a warranty for two additional years      
511,5.0,                       i ve had these for   years  and they have been through a lot  it s safe to say they will probably last me a lifetime  i ve dropped them at least a hundred times or more  they still work perfectly fine and they are surprisingly really good for gaming  highly recommend these for any use  whether for mixing audio  gaming  or just media consumption  the cups have worn  but over the course of   years that s okay  they sell replacements on ebay for very cheap  buy these  you won t regret it      
512,5.0,                       personally these sound exactly like my sony     s  multiple pairs over last    years   with a tighter fit to my head  of course over time they ll probably stretch but they sound great  one of the main reasons i bought these was because my      cords always glitch out after     years  i love the fact that i can replace the cords on these as well as the bluetooth adapter function  i really do like these headphones      
513,5.0,                       after years of ir headphones i finally decided to try bluetooth  my tv doesn t support bt so i had to also get an external transmitter  i chose an avantree     model for that  setting everything up was quick and relatively easy  overall i m happy with the headphones after a month or so of use  i have them on around   hrs a day through the week and i typically get about a week between charges  i occasionally notice a slight lip sync issue but usually i have to look for it to realize it s even there  they were a little tight at first but but i ve either gotten used to it or they have relaxed a bit over time  i don t use them for any other purposes so i can t comment on the other features they support      
514,5.0,                       the sound quality these headphones produce are probably the best you can get for this price point and probably all you really need  the music and sound is balanced down to the middle  so you hear everything as recorded  these headphones are very comfortable when you break them in  if you have bigger ears these might not be able to fit you however  as my ears are just small enough to fit right in the center of them  so if your used to something as big as razor krakens these might not be as comfortable  however the cushions are very soft once you break them down  audio technica are a big brand for a reason  these headphones really sound like they were meant to monitor sound  ive also seen popular internet figures wearing these headphones as well after i noticed the silver pieces on the corners of the left and right on the headband  so all in all  these headphones are perfect for people who enjoy quality music  without any biases in the sound      
515,5.0,                       this is the second pair i ve owned after the first one broke  my previous pair was used daily  or technically nightly for about   years  during chemo  i d had horrible tinnitus and developed a habit of needing to listen to something via headphones to drown out the ringing  chemo and tinnitus are long gone  but the habit remains  so  they are comfortable enough for me to sleep in but they do take a while to break in  until then  they do feel a bit tight on the ol noggin  the sound is amazing with and without an amplifier  but i reccomend one if you re particular about how your music sounds      
516,4.0,                       i love these headphones and i knew what they could do when i bought them  i love studio headsets and how they feel on my head when listening to music  they do have a good mix of bass in there  so unless you want your brain rattled you really won t be disappointed i also love the blue tooth features for this  since i just have to flip the switch and they work quickly with my phone  which is perfect for working out the downside and why i give these a   star  are the tiny cords these headphones come with  they need a   foot    mm jack minimum  they just come with two insanely short charging cords which was a bummer      
517,5.0,                       great sound quality  good fit for my small head although i did buy a better and larger set of ear pads  external noise silencing is only about half  also phones could use a battery indicator  i personally have no trouble   easy set up  easy controls light enough to use at the gym  i ve use these for about three months and have enjoyed them immensely           i ve had to rewrite this recommendation because the head phones  after only couple months  will no longer take a charge  this is no longer a quality product if  in my estimation  it will not last for more then a couple months  do not buy  especially with out the extended warranty  i have to ask   why do i need to discard this      expensive item because it will not take a charge after only a couple months of normal use     i wish a response from the vender since i no longer can get a refund      
518,5.0,                       i am currently narrowing down my studio headphones to one set  i have narrowed it down to three  and these are currently in the lead here s my breakdown lows  goodhighs  greatmids  close to perfectoverall  they re in the lead for a reason i never even considered to be a serious consideration  most brands have two cords the always annoying  at least to me  coiled cord and the unnecessarily long cord  these include a third cord that isn t very long  but it s the perfect link if you re sitting in front of a pc  laptop  mixer  etc these headphones eliminate the hassle of getting tangled in the cord like a      rotary phone  and i have never really found it imperative that the cord reach another county      
519,5.0,                       the ath m  x is a headset for those who do not want to buy beats  skullcandy and all of the other name brand headphones that make up the portable audio market today  but want an all purpose headphone for use at home or on the go  i would recommend these in a heartbeat  over any other headphone i have tested previously      
520,5.0,                       i have beats and these audio technicas ath m  x are  x better  do some research and you will find     pref these headphones over others  and i didnt have to pay      to      dollars like i did for the beats  i got mine for      during christmas sales      
521,3.0,                       one of my favorite pair of headphones i ve used  i wish they included the longer spiral cable that they include with the non bluetooth  but not really a problem  i typically use these either wired to my piano or wireless for zoom calls or music  the sound quality is great  whether wired or wireless  i do like how they don t need to be charged to use them wired many headphones with active noice cancelation require a charged battery to listen  even while on wired mode  these headphones are also very comfortable  i have worn them for several hours without any problem edit  dropping it to   stars  my problem is the cable  at elected to offset the    mm cable slightly on the body  now  i see no purpose of this except to limit the number of compatible cables down to    previous headphones i have owned with    mm connections  one could simply buy any    mm cable that fits their purpose and it would work  however  audio technica essentially sunk the port into the headphone body  meaning every    mm cable i ve tried gets blocked by the plastic  rubber cable housing  do  rather than use my         inch to    mm cable  i must use that cable in addition to a coupler  which reduces the sound quality  very annoying      
522,5.0,                       first  i am not an audiophile  so this review is for us mere mortals with normal ears   i understand there are super tasters  and probably super listeners   i am not a super listener  and am willing to accept that my ears are  normal    if you are an audiophile  or  super listener  just move on   please don t buy these and leave a negative review   leaving a negative review is not useful to the other     of humans   accept that you have an incredible sense level that most of us don t have i gave these a   star audio quality because a normal person can easily tell the difference between these and a gaming headset  for example   this is an important quality for normal human use   a lot of  high end  headsets are indistinguishable  for normal people  to a headset like these   for listening to music and sound accuracy  these are simply amazing   they are not insane bass headphones   the bass is good  but it s normal good  it is not amplified to ridiculous levels like some headphones   the sound seems neutral and relatively balanced   the sound is much more detailed than any other headset i ve used in the past   there are smaller details on a lot of the music that i listen to that i never noticed before   again  this is from the perspective of a normal human with normal ears  so there is a good chance you will be able to have the same results noise cancellation i gave a   star because they do block a ton of sound but are not active noise cancellation   so there is room for improvement but they are still very good   normal people won t have an issue with this i don t think   one thing to note here is if you have ears that stick out these will be uncomfortable   the pads are comfortable enough  but the foam over the speakers are irritating on the ears   this doesn t bother me because my ears sit close to my head   your mileage may vary here for gaming i gave these a   star   it s hard to rate these for gaming  because gaming is not the primary purpose of these headphones   they are a   star for me  personally   it honestly depends on what you are looking for in a gaming headset   if you are looking for sound accuracy these are amazing   if you want massive explosion booms with overly loud bass in call of duty  these might not be for you   if you want overly sensitive and loud treble so you can hear footsteps from a mile away  these are not for you   to be clear  these do both of those things  but they do so in a balanced and accurate way   these are not  competitive  level for gaming   however  if you play casually and not competitively  these are an amazing set for gaming   these will produce a more natural sound  which is something the vast majority of gaming headsets do not do   most gaming headsets focus more on treble for competition   they do not offer a natural sounds   one could argue this headset is closer to how the sound designers intended you to hear their games than a gaming headset  counterintuitively who are these for   these are not for professionals or audiophiles   these are for mortal listeners   if you are a mortal listener  you can easily tell the difference in sound and appreciate what these have to offer   you absolutely cannot say that about a lot of  audiophile  headsets that cost a ton more   this headset is good enough for anyone to appreciate the difference in quality   these are not for people who need a non balanced sound   i am not criticizing the need for those kinds of headsets at all   they perform their function well   this is not one of those to sum this review up  these are incredible headphones for the value if you want a balanced  accurate  sound profile   these are  just buy it  quality for normal humans      
523,5.0,                       these are just so good  the sound is amazing  but beyond that  they are the only headphones i can wear for hours on end  i work in a relatively noisy environment and these block out a nice amount of sound by simply putting them on  furthermore  the soft feel of the cushions is just so good i recently got a second pair of these for my home office and while the leather on the cushions is still being worn in on that pair  they are just so comfortable to wear the cord is detachable  and three cords are provided  long  good for connecting to the rear of your pc and having room to roll away from your desk   short  for mobile devices     coiled  like an old telephone cord       
524,4.0,                       after a week of daily use for commute the battery is still at     the sound is perfect  clean and true bt  works as expected  i d say there s a bit more intermittent disconnects than with my     bt  running in ear pair  but it only happens on very busy street corners in ny from major interference which happens with all bt headphones so i wouldn t send them back to for that  if they ever come with an updated version maybe shield the receiver better from interference      
525,5.0,                       many moons ago  i used to dj as a hobby and of course had wire headphones   great sound but of course life changed and at work  i found the wireless noise canceling to be very much my peace and comfort that stripped all the noise away which was honestly godsend   recently i started doing more video work and of course that meant  noise cancelling headphones weren t exactly the best quality listening device never mind what i wanted to hear through my sony a r iii during a shoot the box  the packaging  three sets of quality cables that are thicker but soft so i can enjoy them at my computer without a short cable or use the short cable on a trip   granted  there will be times i ll use my bose wireless so it isolates a lot of the background noise but with this studio monitor  i can still hear the background noise when i don t want to be startled  yes  i can turn off the noise canceling in bose as well i know  the sound is just amazing   i didn t think it would make this much difference   i can only imagine how great some of those         headphones can be   in either case  for the money  i don t think you can go wrong even though if you re an audiophile  you already know everyone has different hearing so it s just one of those things you may like it or prefer another set of headphones i ve always preferred the design that cups your ear as i can wear it for hours   definitely worth the money for this pair        
526,4.0,                       i initially purchased this and then had the dreaded  buyers remorse  for not buying the v moda lp   which had awesome reviews   so i ordered the lp    well the lp  is about  x more sexy awesome cord  awesome packaging  seems more robust  but the sound is muddy compared to the ath m  x  and although i realize others disagree  to me the bass is actually not better and if you are buying a headphone it is not about the packaging  it is about the sound quality   i am critical  have probably        k in stereo gear perreaux amps  pre amps lots of vinyl  etc  so maybe i do not represent the typical buyer   the audiotechnicas are accurate  at least for an inexpensive headphone  and i would highly recommend them   period end of discussion      
527,4.0,                       these a solid pair of over ear cans for under       if your budget was       then i d recommend the v moda m    over these i had the m   s for over   years and needed to replace them  long story  so i bought the ath m  x after reading the reviews the m  x is a geat headphone  build quality is pretty good  sound reproduction is very good and they are fairly light for their size  they also fold up and cups rotate and fold     degrees cons of the m  x   proprietary cables  meaning you can t just replace these with any    mm cables   comes with cheap faux leather case  a lot of plastic  thin headband  oddly  the headband is thicker on top of the frame rather than the bottom where your head touches it      shallow earcups earpads  my ear touches the driver i give the v moda m    a     rating compared to these due these advantages   superior build quailty  more metal and still relatively lightweight     mm input allowing any generic cable to be used  on either earcup   look amazing and are customizable    mm drivers  more bass heavy sound   comes with high quality hard caseif all you care about is sound and are on a budget  then you can t go wrong with the m  x  if you have a      budget  then i would definetly suggest the v moda m    over these      
528,5.0,                       i m really pleased with these headphones  the sound quality is really great  they re not      at noise canceling though  so with voice over work  you ll hear outside noises while recording  they definitely deaden outside sounds  and you can t hear anything else when listening to music they re pretty comfy too  i did wear them for several hours with my glasses on while working  though and i got a bit of pain above my ears where the headphones pressed my glasses into my head  i don t know if that s avoidable they re very good looking  and come with three long cords for what you need overall  i think i could have gone with a cheaper set  as i m not a total audiophile  but even i can tell the difference in sound quality between these and my cheaper ones  so i m happy with them  here s hoping they last      
529,5.0,                       these headphones are very good quality for the price  better than a lot of higher priced ones too   ultra reliable and sturdy  and very versatile depending on what application you re using them for  i just bought these after one of the hinges broke on my first pair   a pair that i have owned for over   years and put thousands of hours of audio through  the pleather earpads and headband will wear down and deteriorate over a long period of time and make your ears very uncomfortable  but there are fortunately many different replacement earpads out there after perusing around for something new for a few minutes  i came to the conclusion that my money would best be spent on a second pair  by far  these are my favorite headphones of all time  and their sturdiness alone makes them a good investment      
530,5.0,                       these are literally the best headphones i ve ever owned  and i ve owned a lot of headphones  they re the most comfortable  they fit my big head without any problems  the sound quality is the best  i can even use them while playing vr and they still work great  i honestly don t have too much to say aside from these are basically amazing  of you re considering buying them  then you should buy them      
531,5.0,                       i have a working pair of logitech g   s and decided to buy these headphones for my birthday present  wow i had no idea what i was missing  i wasn t blown away at first  but after a couple days of using them i am completely in love with them  i literally hear noises in music that i couldn t before    if you re on the fence about whether these are worth it   they are  everything sounds so crisp its hard to describe they frequently drop to           
532,5.0,                       any audiophile audio engineer music producer worth their salt knows that audio technica is a top brand for studio monitor headphones in both quality and price  and therefore value  this model is no exception  they are a classic in the audio world and continue to live up to their name  you can find the hard data on this set of can s frequency response and whatnot online  and i suggest that you do since you probably have unique needs for your headphones if you re considering one of these  they re not      flat and do have a little extra bass but for my purposes this works as a compliment since i use other sound references too and the boosts aren t extreme   i use these primarily for making and mixing music but also for recreational use  the sound is clear and loyal to the source  just listen to a variety of professionally made music with these for a while first so you can get used to its  personality  and from there you should be able to make great mixes that work well on all types of speakers headphones  these headphones are still very comfortable after hours of use   and that s with me wearing glasses  fatigue is minimal  especially compared to other headphones in this price range  and they do not weigh down on your head or crumple your ears to fit in the cups  they also look and feel great  so the aesthetics match the quality  having a detachable cable to the headphones is a huge improvement and both of the cables that come with this product are quality and of generous length   i can listen to music and dance around the studio with these still connected to my computer  no problem  the jack is      but there is a      adapter included which is very useful  i ve used these headphones for listening  making  and mixing everything from jazz to rock to rap to electronic to country to reggaeton to pop to    you get the picture  definitely check these out  they re the best set i ve had the pleasure of using in this price range since they perform at a level that would be competitive at higher prices  it would sincerely surprise me to find out that someone did the research on these before buying and were not content with their experience afterwards      
533,5.0,                       i use these headphones for pc gaming   i recently switched to these from  gaming   branded headphones  and the difference is mind blowing   i have a      steelseries headset  as well as similarly priced headsets from other brands  sennheiser  razer   and i can t believe what i was missing   there are sounds in games that i didn t even know existed in these games   i ll avoid the more studio oriented review parts as there are plenty of glowing reviews of people using these headphones in amateur and professional settings i did a ton of research on headphones and audio  and finally settled on these due to the overwhelmingly good reviews across the web   a lot of review sites put these on par with high impedance headphones that are several times the price   the thing you need to understand about monitor headphones is that they are designed to play audio as unbiased  true to performance  as possible   most consumer headphones  especially gaming headsets  have very distinct v shaped sound  which means they put a lot of emphasis on the highs and lows and reduce the mids   the most noticeable example to describe what monitor phones do is that the vocals in music will be much clearer and easier to hear  and the whole audio track will sound more  balanced    you ll notice this in video games too  as you ll hear a lot of things much more clearly and distinctly  and you ll actually hear sounds that you didn t hear before  this is due to the smoother signature  if you are looking at these headphones for gaming  stop thinking and hit the buy button   i won t sugar coat it  the sound these headphones put out will come as a shock  and you may not like it at first   i personally loved it  but i have some experience in recording studios and knew what to expect   if you have mostly been using gaming headsets or common consumer headphones these will sound really weird for a while   but listen to some of your favorite songs on them for a while  or play for a couple of hours on your favorite game   and then switch back to your old headphones   you ll realize just how terrible sounding your old ones are  and will wonder what else in life you are missing out on i only have one major complaint about these headphones  and that is the ear pads   i don t know why headphone manufacturers refuse to invest in good ear pads  but they just don t   luckily  there exist after market ear pads that i would recommend and use even if these ones were awesome   no matter what headphones you use  pick up some brainwavz hybrid memory foam ear pads  they are life changing    if you are a hardcore audiophile  these will slightly alter the sound stage  but not necessarily in a negative way  another consideration worth noting is the intended use of these headphones  studios and djs with dedicated audio equipment   these headphones will work fine just by plugging them into the back of your computer or iphone  but they will absolutely shine if you put a good dac or audio interface between these headphones and the audio source  i use a roland rubix     highly recommend  obviously these are headphones  and not a headset  so they lack a microphone   if you are considering these  you may need to consider an external microphone in your budget   as you can imagine  between a good audio interface  a mic  peripherals  and these headphones  you can sail right past the      price tag on these headphones just to get to where you were  functionally  with a similarly priced gaming headset  i spent almost      to replace my      steelseries arctis   s    so my final thought would be to thoroughly research the entire audio set up you want before hitting the buy button on these   you ll need to get good equipment and properly budget to maximize your sound experience  but it is a life altering experience  so if you can swing it  do it      
534,5.0,                       i listen to music all day at work  i have a   hour period every day where i can have both ears occupied with headphones  i ve been using skullcandy titan s for the last couple years  i ve always wanted a good pair of over the ear headphones so i can completely zone out my surroundings and get lost in the music i did a lot of research and kept on finding myself back to these  i did want the   x over the    s for the detachable cord when i first put the on and listened to the music through them i felt they sounded great  but didn t feel like the quality was overwhelmingly better than my silly little earbuds  boy was i ever wrong   i got to work the next day and first thing i did was throw these bad boys on and listened to music for   hrs  it was amazing   for the rest of my work day i take calls out of one ear and listen to music out of the other ear  i stuck my earbuds in and listened just for a comparison  my earbuds sound like garbage   seriously   listening to them back to back  the difference is night and day  the quality these things posses is miles ahead of my silly little earbuds  they are super comfortable for   hr  listening sessions as well  and when everything is said an done  they fold up painlessly and fit in their little bag great while i do like that they came with a carrying case  i will most likely get a hardcase to transport these in eventually  the case is good for what it is  but the headphones take up a lot of space and it wouldn t protect them in the slightest if they were to take a tumble in the case i love them though  very impressed      
535,5.0,                       first off  i would like to point out i have not had much experience with higher tier headphones  so my review might be a little biased before owning these beauties  i had a pair of sol republic tracks  when i owned those headphones  i thought they were very good  the bass was way more punchy than the m  x  but they were still clear and sounded great  i thought they were high quality  that was before i had these those eventually died and i found myself on the hunt for another good pair of headphones  one of my friends had recommended these  i read the reviews and they were good but they were       as the broke college student i am  i did not want to pay       but after quite a while of looking i narrowed my scope down to the m  x or the m  x  i saw a lot of reviews saying that the m  x has a better value than m  x and that there are not many differences between them  i should note that this pair comes with a reasonable size cord for like your phone or a laptop unlike the m  x which only come with   long cables  i have never tried the m  x so i cant compare the quality of the two  i obviously ended up buying the m  x these headphones are very good  the built quality feels very nice and sturdy  and the headband and ear pads are very comfortable  i love the lockable and removable headphone cord  the sound quality is great  the highs are clear and crisp with no distortion at all  the bass in these pairs of headphones will not be punchy and you will not  feel  it  however the bass is very clean and noticeable  these headphones in my opinion is a damn near perfect balance of the treble  mids  and bass  these headphones are also able to collapse  this feature i honestly think is a blessing  it allows me to store it in my backpack so much easier than my last pair  and makes my life easy when i need to put them away quickly  the ear cups rotate    degrees each way which is very helpful if you wear headphones around your neck a lot like me  i do not regret buying these what so ever  they blew my mind and exceed my expectations  if you are looking for high quality headphones without going too expensive  i recommend these  they are great for pretty much anything and i do not think you will be disappointed  these headphones have sold my soul to audio technica  as sorta a techy geek i knew audio techinca was a good brand  but god damn  they make some great products overall  the headphones are great  they sound amazing and feel great  i recommend to anyone looking for a great pair of headphones  at      they can seem a little pricey but i will tell you with confidence  they are well worth it      
536,2.0,                       the bluetooth stopped working after a month and a after couple months the pads got worse and the sound deteriorated a little  i have had these headphones since july and while they sound amazing  the bluetooth stopped working after a month  the reason may be because i hooked them up to an amp during that month but these headphones are expected to be used with amps from what i have read so i personally feel it is not my fault especially after using them for months  on top of that the pads clearly need some work as i now have dents in the right pad and i have read that they will eventually flatten  lastly  i noticed that the sound has slightly deteriorated  but i will be nice and say that is my fault for constantly using them with an amp  i really wanted to give   stars but the fact that the bluetooth stopped working after a month is a big no no and i spent extra on these instead of the standard pair of these for that sole reason      
537,5.0,                       i did a lot of looking around for headphones outside of amazon reviews and this set kept popping up in forums as one of the best  others costing a lot more than these  i m not an audio technician  just somebody who appreciates stellar audio quality  it is amazing how well they perform  almost too good that i can hear background sounds not meant to be heard in recordings of music or audio books  the build quality is great and i am a big fan of the detachable cable that can easily be replaced if it wears out or breaks  on that note they came with jack size adapters and extra cables based on needs of the user  different lengths and a stretchy coiled style cable   the way the headphones rotate and fold up for storage was cumbersome at first but has become second nature in how they unfold and fit on my head  and the rotation helps them fit any shape or size head you have snuggly and comfortably      
538,3.0,                       i use my wireless headphones for phone calls  music  and playing books while working  these headphones were to replace a pair of beats that recently broke on me  however the microphone made phone calls impossible  still capable of listening to music or books  but never usable as a handsfree phone option  which was very disappointing      
539,5.0,                       tight on the head but once you break them in it s fine  the sound quality is phenomenal  there is a little bit of a buzz when the recording you listen to is off  these are meant to detect faults in recordings and they live up to that exactly  they have a very balanced sound and do not compress or amplify anything  if you re looking to record these headphones are perfect  and stylish  they are not meant for casual listening but i do it anyway and it still sounds good for the most part  unless there s a bad recording  these go over the ears  and the padding stays on well  and doesn t chip  it comes with a little drawstring carrying case and   different cords you have to lock in the cord to the headphones  and it stays on great  cord is very thick and sturdy  i ve used them everyday almost for months and i haven t had a single problem  i will update if i do      
540,5.0,                       before i bought these i used the m  x s for about     months and i really wanted to upgrade my audio from there  so i decided on prime day when they were for sale for          that it was the time to buy them  they came in the mail  right before i had to leave for work  i wanted to get a feel for them so walking into work i listened to a lot of the music i play all the time and i legit said  holy shit  the sound difference is night and day  the blows are low but they are just the right amount  the highs aren t too tinny  and you can just get a fuller sound out of them  i use these for basically everything i do as well  gaming is awesome and i can pick up on enemies walking around corners and i ll be able to accurately depict where they are  for music production these are fantastic as well  it comes with three cords  i haven t had problems with them so we re squared there  they re comfortable  stylish  and they have a very attractive sound signature      
541,4.0,                       i m just getting into really listening to music and listening to vinyls   i have a friend that is an audiophile and recommended several options for getting great sound and these were just one of the   i read many reviews on here and other locations about them and decided that this is a great place to start   i love them except for the fit but a little bit about me  i m not a huge fan of things putting pressure on the top of my head   these don t because i can wear them extended out a little and they float about my head   the sound is great and again  i m just learning to hear music so i love what i m hearing through these   i listen to them on my cell phone and through a receiver and there isn t a lot of difference   i love that they come with several types of cords and plug adapters      
542,5.0,                       i produce music and podcasts and love these headphones  the audio quality is absolutely amazing  you hear everything very clear and crisp  the build quality it great  comes with a bunch of cords to use for any audiophiles equipment and perfect for all editing or looking professional during virtual meetings the cushion is a little small for my ears and can start to hurt after long periods of time  i have big ears       
543,3.0,                       disclaimer  i m not married to a conehead  but my husband s head almost burst after wearing these headphones for an hour  not being one of those who gives up easily  he tried stretching them overnight on their box  two nights in a row  when that didn t help  back to the box they went the sound quality is ok  the material feels nice  but keep in mind that they are extremely uncomfortable      
544,5.0,                       first impressions here  fantastic headphones  my wife was stressed out and worrying about stuff  and i stuck these on her head and played a few songs she likes  jane monheit  ingrid michaelson   um  josh groban   she doesn t get all excited about premium sound quality  but she said she might not give these back to me i m spending the night  now that the kids are down  playing through my library  i have stuff ranging from jazz to pop  rock  bluegrass  country  classic rock  acapela vocals  rap  ish   ok  not really  rap  per se  but with some beats   christmas tunes   you name it  it all sounds really good  great spread out sound and realistic reproduction couple thoughts i m still working out    i have a pair of etymotic hf  s  in ear  that were the most shocking discover after years of apple ibuds  that s basically my ideal sound signature   very flat curve and true  tight reproduction of lows  these ath m  x s are more  fun  to listen to in general  but i am a little overwhelmed by the heavier bass  a little louder and looser than the ety s  this might take some getting used to  but it s not distracting  on some stuff  it sounds really killer where you want to feel that deep punch  the ety s don t inflate anything   they just give you clean  accurate bass  clearly  these are not as unbiased    one of the main reasons i bought these was to have a better pair of headphones for our digital piano  roland hp      i was using some cheapo     headphones that sounded really blended and distorted  it was like one big messy note even though i would be playing a chord on the piano   these ath m  x s give a much more distinctive sound to the notes and the sound reproduction is nicer  however   because these are so clear  i now notice the reverb effect i was using  and it s a very echo y and hollow sound reverb  i turned off the reverb to give a fuller more realistic piano sound through the headphones  in other words  these are so clear that the artificial feel of some effects really becomes apparent    for the digital piano discussed in     the headphones are quieter than the cheapos  i turned the volume dial on the piano board all the way up just to get it to a good volume  i think this means i may need  eventually  some sort of amp  dac    to power these drivers a bit more  i want to get the impression that i m playing an acoustic piano  i think i m partway there  but just need more amplification to get it right      
545,2.0,                       i m anise device lover ever since but i was tempted to try the m  xbt being not made in china   to my disappointment bluetooth connection won t word even with amazon staff trouble assistance   constrained to return and purchased anotther bose head phones for me and my wife   sorry but i can t hide my disapponment      
546,5.0,                       the audio technica ath m  x headphones certainly have a lofty reputation   this is my first experience with them   i ve previously owned a pair of onkyo cans that have wonderful sound  but faulty cabling undercutting their desirability   the foam on the ear cups adorning monster s dna pro tears easily  so they re a nonstarter for me   i love grado headphones  but they re openness makes them unsuitable for use in public places  lest you want the world to know you like listening to abba   alpha design labs makes two headphones  the fine adl h    and the upscale h    and the latter is an absolute knockout   still  the h    s metal design and circumference doesn t lend them to portability   i ve finally succumbed to purchasing the ath m  x after reading effusive praise from both connoisseurs and laypersons   the acclaim is well deserved   the headphones are comfortable to wear  compact and sound splendid   the sound is bright with mildly accentuated treble  decent midrange and good bass  but not overpowering  i d resist deeming the ath m  x as neutral sound due to their inherent brightness  but they clearly won t engender listener fatigue as other more dynamic cans do   the soundstage i was hearing using lossless files was quite expansive   the ath m  x also seems versatile  able to handle a variety of music genres   the cables are proprietary  but audio technica thoughtfully provided three different variations so they ve got you covered   it s easy to see why everyone likes the audio technica ath mx  x   after listening to them i said to myself  what s not to like      
547,3.0,                       i haven t seen anyone mention this  but for some reason while in bluetooth mode and there s a brief moment of silence of about       seconds  the very next sound will cut out and there will be a slight static noise  as if the headphones are coming out of sleep mode  this is the case for both my pc and my android phone  i ve managed to mostly eliminate this effect by using voicemeeter  however  unfortunately you cannot use the headset mic at the same time as the headset while using the program currently  i use the v moda boompro mic in conjunction with this headset and it works great  however this makes the headset wired  the headset sounds a bit better while plugged in as compared to wireless  though the wireless mode still sounds great  i d imagine some people may not even notice the difference  i also didn t notice any delay while wireless  i rated   stars because i currently don t have any reason to use the headphones in bluetooth mode due to the issues i mentioned above      
548,5.0,                       i am venturing into the dj   composer arena  so i thought it would be a good idea to replace my old sony mdr v    s  and am i glad i did   after a quick web search i discovered that the audio technica ath m  x always ranked very highly in it s price range   in fact  many reviews suggested that you get more for your money with these than other brands   i tend to take a function over form approach with most purchases  but i feel like i m getting the best of both worlds with this purchase   all i can say is wow  they re great     i had no idea what i was missing in sound quality   i can now hear details that went unnoticed before  so these headphones will definitely enhance my ability to generate quality results      
549,4.0,                       isn t as high tech as a wh     xm  but that is ok if you don t need noise cancelling  the stock pads are meh  i suggest getting brainwavz lambskin or suede or even a cheaper alternative is gesongzhe pads which are on par with brainwavz  i personally use the gesongzhe microsuede and they are super comfortable  the bass is reduced but present  i also have the protein leathers and the bass is increased with those  my work mate uses the brainwavz angled lambskins and they are also very nice and make everything smooth but i am not a fan of the angled hybrids sound  overall better than the sony s or any of the anc headphones range  the sony s win but it s still decent range with these build  these are plastic but good quality and roubust  they feel more solid than the sony s noise cancelling  not really here but ok for a closed back to sum it all up if comfort and music quality is what you want then these are it once modded with better pads  the wh     xm  are kind of the tech king right now and if you need anc then get those  these will wipe the floor with almost every bt headphone out there for music quality and i haven t noticed any lag watching videos      
550,5.0,                       i would say that i m a semi audiophile  i had been waiting a while to jump on a new pair of headphones because i wanted to make the right decision i can honestly say that these are both comfortable to wear and sound fantastic  they are very true to sound and don t have a particular lean when it comes to trebles  mids  or bass which is great  that said  if you care about sound stage  these might not be for you  although they aren t terrible  you could get a much better sound stage with open back headphones since i plan on using these for normal listening sessions and traveling  i did not want open backs  they also have a pretty sturdy plastic build  which is great in my opinion because they are light and comfortable  and are great to travel with  i don t have to worry about them being fragile or accidentally breaking while traveling style wise  i think they look pretty cool and it s a nice break from the  trendy  beats style that you see everyone wearing as for the cords  i loved that it came with three different cord types  as i previously mentioned  i ll be using them when i travel  so having an extra cord or two laying around is a great plus      
551,5.0,                       this was probably one of the best purchases of my life so far  extremely versatile  comes with a lot of cords to match different occasions  the sound has just the right amount of bass to where you can feel it  but are not overwhelmed by it  i have just purchased the sennheiser    c and these headphones in terms of versatility outclass the     s  i use these to play games and listen to music on my pc and i am on this thing for hours  never really feel any discomfort and after   years of fairly heavy daily usage  this thing is still pumping the jams  can not recommend these enough  especially if you are looking to get a nice starter audiophile level headphones  perfect price range for performance       
552,5.0,                       ok  this is a bit long but i m so happy listening to my entire music collection right now  and here s why    so i bought what i believed were a good set of headphones a while ago    feb of      actually  it was a deal of the day  and an impulse buy  spent a bit more than i had wanted to on a set of headphones  but with the deal on amazon  decided it was a good price and a fraction of what i would ever spend on a set of beats  the audio technica ath m  x headphones arrived and i never opened them  i put them to the side  maybe because i was having remorse about spending the   on a set of headphones i didn t really need  maybe i d gift them someday  they sat nib for more than  yrs  this past weekend i finally decided to unbox them and give them a try    omg      wow   all the reviews i had ever read that swayed me to buy them in the first place were dead on    these are simply amazing  if you own a pair of these  then you know exactly what my reaction is  if not  then it s like completely rediscovering your entire music collection  you ve never really heard your music until you hear it through a set of these    why did i wait so long to open and use these          
553,4.0,                       i had a pair of m  x s before and ended up buying a  rd party bluetooth adapter for my commute  worked great for almost   years until they broke  saw the bluetooth version for the m  x and had to try it oohh wweee these sound nice  what a nice upgrade  i didn t notice that these have qualcomm aptx audio chips in them until i got it  so you get true hd  d surround sound  i have an lg v   and it has dts x  d surround sound hi fi quad dac and it makes aac lossless and wav files sound amazing  i listen to heavy metal  deathcore  hip hop  r b  rap  house  drum and bass  you name it and it all can sound amazing with the right adjustments and enabling those features  i love the optional    mm audio cord that comes with it  can use it on my switch and other devices so the headphones become very versatile the app kinda sucks on android  you need location services and bluetooth enabled for it to work if it decides to even open  and then find your headphones    takes about    tries  but when it does open  it can be useful to adjust numerous eq settings and configuration the battery is fantastic  i spend about     hours a day commuting on the train and i can go about    to    hours without charging these  however for some reason the headphones will report to my phone that it is almost dead about     of the time  yet i can go    hours without charging  not sure what s going on there but not an issue for me really since it will say  battery low  when they are actually dying  you have    to    minutes left   a plus is even if the headphones are dead  you can use the    mm audio cord that comes with it  another note about bluetooth is the mic  sometimes when you are listening to music and answer a call  the bluetooth mic won t work unless you switch your call mode  bluetooth to speaker and back to bluetooth as an example   rarely does it happen  but annoying when your boss calls you   the headband is comfortable and can be worn for a long time  however i am not a fan of how firm the cups are  so i usually buy third party foam cups that are a little softer  and they do a better job at noise cancellation in my opinion  i take the train so the noise cancellation is about        stock  but with  rd party foam cups i would say it goes to        since these are passive noise cancellation  active is like bose where there is a switch  overall  i love these headphones so far even with the slight issues it has  they feel well built and the sound quality is superior  replace the foam cups with something more comfortable and these will do the trick  if you have a device that has dts x or hi fi quad dac then i highly recommend these to get the best music sound experience  i wish i could give it       stars but i gotta give it the lower end due to the rare mic issue  battery status issue and the foam cups     pros  long battery life     to    hours  superior sound comfortable  stock       can be        optional    mm audio cable  d surround sound ready  dts x and hi fi quad dac  qualcomm aptx chips  true aac and wav  great passive noise cancellation with  rd party cupscons  foam cups can be uncomfortable for some  i recommend  rd party ones that are softer  stock foam cups do an ok job at noise cancellation the audio technica app gets       stars    battery reporting status to android bluetooth     is funky bluetooth mic is ok  doesn t work on some calls and requires switching call modes  rarely does this happen but annoying when it does      
554,4.0,this should be fairly self explanatory to anyone who uses tech in their day to day life  but i see a lot of people dogging these headphones and there is literally no reason to   while slightly annoying  its not a major hindrance worth a   star review   if on windows pc and bluetooth audio is cutting out but have   issue when plugged in with wire     power headphones on and let them connect to your pc laptop    open windows bluetooth settings    click ath m  xbt under  mouse  keyboard  and pen  and click  remove device     click ath m  xbt under  audio  and click  remove device     pair and connect headphones to cell phone or other available device     disconnect bluetooth connection to headphones on cell phone other device    re pair with windows pc  sorry mac users  i know nothing of your os but would imagine similar steps should help  hell this should work for anything that has a bluetooth transmitter that isn t failing   personal opinion after almost half a year of use  a solid buy that i don t regret   audio quality       better sound in high end of frequency spectrum  lower frequencies are not as present as the wired model  significantly less volume than their non bluetooth predecessors   material quality       light  cushioning is sufficient on headband and ear cups  headband feels durable enough  included travel bag and wired cable with in line mic are a nice addition   bluetooth range       able to move roughly   ft away from pc before cutting out  connecting asus maximus hero xi mobo  bluetooth     
555,4.0,                       loved my ath m   x wired headphones so i decided to upgrade to this  all the features i loved about those headphones are present here as well  great passive noise canceling helps me focus  can operate wirelessly or with a classic headphone jack  m  x required a special chord  these use a standard male male chord  good change   when i turn them on they connect to my phone immediately  only downside is that when my phone is in my pocket the audio connection occasionally drops out briefly  it doesn t disconnect  just gets gaps in the audio  curious to see if this will improve when i upgrade my phone      
556,2.0,                       there are a lot of the great  external  reviews on the ath mt  xbt  which highlight the excellent sound profile of these headphones  i was quite impressed by the crisp sound  this is particularly noticeable when upping the input quality  such as the lossless flac  such as a feed available at on online radio site  such as radioparadise  you really can hear details in familiar tunes you never heard before  extended battery life is also a strength weakness major issue  present on both original and exchanged pair the major issue i have is that there is a static noise that can be heard out of the right ear when using bluetooth  not present when wired   it is heard when you turn it on and when the music volume is low  considering the likely user is purchasing ath mt  xbt for quality sound  this issue is likely to be something that bothers a lot of users who value sound quality  sound is not really noticeable if volume is elevated communications with audio technica help support through email resulted in a fast reply  they suggested to exchange the pair  upon receiving the second pair  the same noise issue was present in the right ear   communication with a t about the same issue being present in the second pair was   this is unfortunate  consider the ath sr  bt wireless   wired headphones instead  looking deeper into online reviews as well as several within the amazon reviews reveals other users have noticed this issue  sharing their disappointment for the presence of such a static background noise issue in an otherwise quality sounding headphones  for those potential buyers who feel they have sensitive ears capable of hearing the full spectrum  e g  capable of hearing soft noises such as the slight buzz of led lights  you are likely to be bothered by this background noise when using bluetooth      
557,5.0,                       i would call these very subtle flat response headphones  will take gobs of power  if you re looking for bass heavy ones  these are not the ones for you  like i said  very flat response update  after about a week  i have noticed lifelike sounds i never heard before  i watch a lot of youtube  now i m noticing what used to be inaudible sounds like a phone ringing in the background  kids sounds and animal sounds like never before  it s like   worlds  what the videographer intends you to hear but life happening in the background that wasn t intentional  i never heard these sounds on any other of my headphones  that s a fact but   i also have a cambridge dacmagic xs inline  so  it may be the   together that s making the difference  i don t know but as i said i never was not able to hear these other sounds on my other cans even with the dacmagic xs inline  i heard the phone ringing  took off the   x s and went to the phone  guess what  my phone wasn t ringing  a number of times this has happened with other sounds as well  almost uncanny  now there is a play on words i didn t mean to do hope this helps      
558,1.0,                       so i have had a set of m   s from at for a long time     and i loved them when i wanted to step up to bluetooth headset  and i needed another set of headphones for my home office  i considered other brands but still pulled the trigger on the mx  xbt s    looks  build quality all what i expected from audio technica  great connected to my phone with bluetooth prefect one app i use iheartradio   for podcasts has a weird but very annoying bug  the audio while listening fades to   volume  and then comes back up     it happens enough to be not acceptable  it could be iheartradio  no other apps on android have i noticed this issue  youtube might be the only other one i have used to test with  but the iheartradio app doesn t do that if i wire the headphones  then it sounds great working at home  covid    i have been using them for conference calls   and i have been told my mic is not very good    last issue   the headphones pair with both my linux and windows computers     but neither consider it a headset    so no audio no microphone   in other words  useless on a computer found some other threads on the interwebs with people having the same issue on computer bluetooth  with no resolutioni might research a little more  but looking like a return for me
