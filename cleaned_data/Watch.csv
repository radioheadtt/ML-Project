0,5.0,                       this is exactly what i wanted for a long time  that would tell me to getup and walk when i have been sitting for too long  that would stop me from overdoing the exercises when my heart rate goes up too high  that can even monitor my sleep and breathing  has a fair battery life  for me one charge every other day  comfortable to wear  has some pre designed exercises that it walks you through and teaches you the proper form and duration sets  overall very well worth a buy      
1,1.0,                       i bought this watch in may  it worked for one month and wouldn t charge or turn on anymore  sent it back to samsung and they wanted to charge me      to fix it  they said the waterproof watch had water damage and not covered under warranty  i ll never buy a samsung product again  waste if           
2,5.0,                       this watch works well  i would like to see it have a second timer ability so i could use it when teaching my yoga classes and time each side to the same length of holds  but for my own personal fitness tracking it works really well  i notices when i am exercising if i forget to input or begin a workout  it reminds me to get up if i have been sitting too long  i can t seem to get used to wearing it while i sleep so i don t use it for sleep tracking      
3,5.0,                          december       review for the galaxy watch active  with a galaxy s  phonethis watch is holding up nicely   no issues  the battery life has not been an issue at all   i ve left the watch in my purse for up to two days and the watch s battery was still providing power   this is a lovely watch and a smart purchase    november       review for the galaxy watch active  utilized with a galaxy s  phonefirst  i want to mention  the aqua black color is exactly that   i was hoping for a black watch but this watch is a dark blue  had i realized that  i d have gotten a different color but i can t mark the watch down for my mistake   just know the aqua black is really a dark blue color   aside from this  the watch is beautiful  easy to set up  and works great   in   hours my watch has drained from      to     battery life   i don t feel that this is very good battery life   i have not been heavily utilizing the watch or using it to control anything   the watch is connect to my phone via bluetooth and receiving a few notifications but nothing over the top   the watch does have some nice watch faces that are classic and look great  the band was easy to take off to install a different band   there are some nice features this watch has   overall  i am happy with my purchase   i plan to review again in the future with battery life and how the watch holds up

5,4.0,                       i work in a nursing home  so washing hands is a must  and having a watch that is water resistance is a must  the galaxy watch active   is great when it comes to water resistance features  a water lock for locking the screen to not worrying about wrist calling someone or sending some message to a random contact  the ability to control music while walking or jogging is a good feature  oh  getting notifications on the wrist makes it easier not to pull the phone out the watch has made it easier to maintain a productive and active work day  the watch also provides daily briefings to provide updates on your day i have not tried the sleep tracking feature much  however  i have given the heartbeat a try  and i have to say it seems to be decent with the tracking  i wouldn t go so far to say it is       but close to     i would recommend this watch to anyone who is active  productive  or both      
6,5.0,                       love this watch  i recently swapped over from iphone to android and was missing having a smart watch  overwhelmed by the large assortment of brands out there for androids i was hesitant on which ones were actually good quality  struck gold here  i love the watch  its comfortable to wear and i love the design of the straps  the tutorial makes learning how to use your new watch super easy  i ve only had it for a few weeks but i m in love  and the battery life is amazing       
7,3.0,                       fit  finish  form   fantastic software   not great if you have an android phone that isn t made by samsung  tizen works best with a samsung phone and some of the great apps aren t available to a non samsung user ecg   not without a samsung phonev   max   not without a samsung phonethreaded texting   not without a samsung phonei therefore returned it despite the great price i got on prime day and intend to try out wearos so if you have a samsung phone i highly recommend this or the galaxy watch        
8,5.0,                       i am really enjoying this  and it s my first smart watch  i got it for the sleep tracking as well as stress checker  reminders and calendar  it is so cool all this watch can do  syncs up with my phone  lets me read and send texts and show off pictures of my cats  easy to set reminders and calendar events i didn t think the alarm would wake me up since it s quiet and i usually set my alarms max loud and obnoxious  but it does  very useful when you and your partner keep different hours and you don t want to wake each other up the customizable faces are a lot of fun  can be as creative as i want      
9,3.0,                       i really wanted to love this watch    i put in a lot of thought into the watch i was going to purchase  one of the main things that i wanted was the sleep tracker  i have had nothing but trouble with the sleep tracker on this watch  i kept thinking that maybe it was me  i have to clean the back of the watch and shut the watch off and turn it back on every night in order for the sleep tracker to work and then it doesn t work every time  everything else seems to work fine on it  regretfully  i don t think i would purchase this again  just shy of      is a lot to pay for something that doesn t work the way it should      
10,5.0,                       before i get started  i am not by any means an expert on smartwatches nor do i even use all the features i recently used a samsung frontier s   i really like the size of it and i liked the dial around it that spins to move the screen around and i felt the dial or bezel whatever its called added a layer of protection here we go pros  i bought this watch for one reason only  the ecg which if the fda doesn t mess this up will be activated via software update to detect irregular heart rhythms  because i have atrial fibrillation and the fall detection because of hypoglycemia  in cas i pass out from low blood sugar  i am hoping this will be beneficial to me  if not  ill have a cool watch battery life is amazing cons     the   mm looked to big or just weird in my opinion which it should have compared to my frontier s     the   mm looks a little small on my wrist but i can live it    the apps don t seem that much different than the ones on the frontier  i don t use the apps often just timem date and heart rate so don t take my word for that   i will say it was nice that the icons and all looked nearly the same so i didn t feel like i was learning a whole new system    i miss the bezel from the frontier but this watch was designed for activity so i can live with it don t take all my cons and think this isn t a great watch     i don t know much about smartwatches     i really loved the frontier s  design     if samsung comes out with a watch like the frontier with ecg  this watch will be for sale i think its a great watch for those who are using it for the reasons it was designed for  the sale price i got this one for on amazon made it hard not to buy it all in all its a great watch despite my bias towards the old frontier edited to add the following the battery life on this watch is amazing i wore it all day and around       pm i took the watch off and still had     battery life left it was connected to my phone the entire day      
11,3.0,                       not an overly impressive watch  the distance portion of the step counter doesn t always work and the battery life is aweful  third part apps are also mostly a joke  basically  it s very expensive for the functionality it gives  i wouldn t consider this a valuable purchase though it is way better than fitbit  if it worked with the play store and google pay instead of samsung s line of applications then i d give it five stars      
12,5.0,                       let me tell something  i was always skeptical into buying a smartwatch no matter who was the manufacturer  because to me it always seemed like a gimmick  like a trend that we all will get over it  but sometime has passed a little over   years  and boy i was wrong  so this      i bought the s    which i already left my review  i love my phone but i was curious over the smartwatch experience that so many people now were having  so i started looking for one  and review after review i noticed that there is many more options available for people on android than ios  there was fossil  fitbit  huawei  lg  samsung and others  but i realized that the quality of smartwatch made my samsung was overall the best  i looked for reviews for the galaxy watch and the galaxy active and was undecided over which one should buy  until the galaxy watch active   came out  after reviewing it online i decided that this is the watch i should get  i ve been using it a little over a month and let me tell you its awesome  it completely changed my view of smartwatches and usefulness of owning one  the build quality is great  the features great  design is awesome  battery lasts   days  i can use almost every strap  the health apps are precise  it can play spotify standalone without having to be connected via bluetooth to my s     this is the best smartwatch you can buy for non apple users  get it now      
13,5.0,                       i got the   mm and i was a little worried it would be way too big  i also have thinner arms   but it looks perfect and i m glad i picked   mm its a bigger display and easier to touch items on the screen  i haven t been able to stop playing with this and getting it tweaked the way i love  but its fantastic and am glad i purchased it  it s worth every penny      
14,3.0,                       i bought this watch after returning a fossil gen   carlyle  while i loved that watch the battery life wouldn t make it through the day  the active   on the other hand has great battery life and is smooth  unfortunately the active   really tries to force you to use samsung apps  they force you to use samsung email in order to respond to emails  they force you to use samsung pay  they force you to use bixby and doesn t give you an option to use any other assistant  i have a galaxy note    plus so i figured this would be a good pair but unfortunately i m more into the google ecosystem   i have a google home  chrome cast  etc  if you are heavily invested in the samsung ecosystem then definitely go for it  as for me i ll have to wait until a decent google wear os watch comes out      
15,2.0,                       my watch did come sooner than anticipated which was great  however i immediately knew something was off  from all my research  here in america  i knew that only the lte version of the active  came with a stainless steel case and leather band  so when i saw my bluetooth wifi model have these i had some questions  called breed to see if they could send me a sports band since my model did not come with one like i had anticipated and they were unable to help  amazon was able to work with me and will refund my purchase of silicone bands  fast forward to setting up my watch and i notice that i am unable to use samsung pay  a major reason why i bought this watch over others  turns out my model was made in vietnam for  latin america where samsung pay isn t supported  currently tinkering with firmware to change region but this was certainly not what i expected and am disappointed  the marginal discount on the watch was not worth this effort  really hoping i don t have to go through the hassle of returning it and waiting for a new one      
16,4.0,                       i do like this product   the profile is much smaller than any other watch and i love the round shape making it look so much more like a real watch   the always on feature is nice to quickly glance at time and i really see potential on what samsung did on the active   with the edge bezel being used for your finger to move thru menus   there is a learning curve and the app support is very small   all that said  for now i am getting    days of battery life and i was able to download a  rd party app to sync my company calendar   oh  samsung tech support went way above and beyond assisting me to get the device working so   stars to them   only two issues so far are     there doesn t appear to be an app that will sync corporate g suite account   as my company doesn t use imapi or pop   there simply isn t a way to log into gmail from the watch to receive email   bummer since in a pinch it would be useful to check receipt of critical emails     since the bezel finger gesture is so new to samsung  it isn t yet fully realized   my example is in calendar instead of navigating to a date on the calendar by pointing to the tiny number for the date on the calendar  it should utilize the ring gesture to scroll   i opened a feature request so hopefully this will improve all in all  this is a very attractive watch and good fitness device with a few additional business benefits   again  app support is very small so bummer there but hopefully samsung will incent the ecosystem to grow   things like lyft  starbucks and navigation like waze   google maps for starters oh  i also installed the iq shield screen protector  st thing very easily   the pack i got had   shields so not yet sure how quickly they scratch however the watch still is relatively responsive and help protect the screen of this      computer on my wrist consider this   not perfect but especially if you don t like the square screen like the apple watch and if you are on android  this is the best out there  in my opinion  as of nov           
17,5.0,                       i wasn t sure if i needed a smartwatch  i ve always been a fan of watches and in need to replace my old one i decided to give this a try  the first one i got was fossil gen    and despite being a beautiful and useful watch the battery life is way too short  making it very frustrating where you need to constantly control the use or charge it twice a day  return it and got the galaxy active    and i m impressed  the battery lasts for almost   h and that includes wifi bt always on  sleep tracking  and    min of music plus exercise tracking great product  great battery life  beautiful and useful      
18,1.0,                       i had pretty high hopes for his watch  but it didn t live up to any of my expectations possibly the biggest disappointment is the fact that the only way you can convert your speech into words is by using samsung s voice recognition  which is subpar  a lot of times it only gets half of my words correct  google voice does an excellent job on my samsung galaxy s   but you don t have the option to utilize google services on this watch another huge disappointment is the speed of the watch  the watch face constantly lags when i flip my wrist to activate the wake up gesture  sometimes it s so slow that the seconds completely freeze up once the always on screen switches to the normal watch face i definitely would not purchase this watch again  it doesn t even have any decent apps  and you have to purchase all the actual quality watch faces      
19,4.0,                       just   stars because i didn t receive the gift from amazon  i pre ordered the watch  and because with the galaxy watch   i had   straps one small and one big with this one i got just the big strap so i had to make a hole in my new strap      very sadbut the watch is awesome      
20,1.0,                       the accuracy of the sleep tracking is very poor  i could be out like a light and it will record me as awake  not very helpful if you are trying to accurately track your sleep data  i was very excited to buy this watch because i used to have a gear s  and loved it  maybe i will try an apple watch  i ve heard good things      
21,1.0,                       the watch lacks any interested features and is grossly overpriced for what it offers   the battery barely lasts more than a day brand new and takes forever to charge    hours    probably one of the biggest wastes of money ive had on amazon   will likely just resell on ebay since this watch is utterly useless as anything other than a glorified paperweight      
22,4.0,                       it might be the best android smart watch  but trust me when i tell you  as a user of samsung  and one that doesn t have a single apple product  this product does not compare to the apple watch  if you are looking for a watch that rivals the apple watch you will be disappointed  still way behind in software capabilities  but i look forward to the next few generations that i think will be a lot closer  this isn t a terrible watch  looks great and the battery is decent  and its definitely still functional  although i am an avid runner and this is not a fantastic running watch  i traded a garmin for under     for this and let me tellvyou the garmin is wayyyt better  this is very simple  too simple      
23,5.0,                       my daughter has heart issues and basically uses this for health concerns   she also uses it to connect to her phone and is happy with those features   the battery life could be better   wristband is comfortable and doesn t stain easily  easy to charge   overall  very pleased and worth the money   be sure to buy screen protectors  as the screen sticks out and is very easy to scratch if not covered   we also bought and extra off brand charger for convenience   recommend      
24,5.0,                       just got this watch absolutely love it  i got the   mm  i thought that i might be too big at  st because i have a very small wrist  but it fits perfectly good battery life so far have had it on for    hours and is at     still   definitely worth the money i have it paired with a samsung galaxy s   plus  does everything you want it to and more  i do also have the case that also covers the screen on it that i bought on here for like   bucks     
25,5.0,                       i originally had the samsung gear sport   lasted   years and died   just stopped working  turning on  anything   so  i went with the new active      i like the sleek design  digital bezel control  and the better battery life   i great product thus far   i wear everyday and workout   days a week with it   running  swimming  works well for it all   one critique  the weight lifting tracking is crap   need to just have a single setting for tracking while lifting   currently  i just use the  other  workout selection     it works i guess      
26,5.0,                       i caved and bought one of these after purchasing a fitbit for a family member as a gift  i was primarily interested in the sleep and heart rate tracking  but the galaxy watch active  quickly became more entertaining with it s bluetooth enabled voice and text linking functions with select galaxy smartphones  the pairing was seamless and the app lets you take full advantage of the watch  while an unnecessary purchase  i will admit it is fun to play with  i could question the accuracy but what do you expect from a device that is hanging from your wrist      
27,1.0,                       be careful with this  active  watch   it lists activities such as swimming laps and has a swim mode   i swam laps in the pool and the watch broke while i was swimming in swim mode    samsung charged me      too fix it bc the watch can t go in the water      
28,5.0,                       i love everything about this watch  i have stage   cancer and am on in home hospice so i love that it reminds me to get up and do the suggested exercises and stretching throughout the day  i also really love seeing my sleep patterns and adjusting meds and foods to improve my sleep  the notifications help me not miss calls and texts as much  and being able to respond from the watch is amazing  i only have to charge it when i take it off to shower which is also so great to be able to wear it and use it all the time  i have yet to find anything i do not like  great purchase as i also bought it at a discounted price from amazon  there is nothing wrong with it and it even came with a band when the description said it was the watch only  such a great price for a great smartwatch      
29,2.0,                       for   months i loved this watch  it is sleek  the apps are similar to apple  etc  then  it started acting glitchy  and the touch screen quit working in the center  i was able to occasionally get it to answer the phone  but i noticed water would spurt out the speakers  i did wear it in the pool since it is rated at     meters  my pool is    deep   i put it in rice for a week to dry it out and i was able to get it to come on  but i cant answer calls texts  or use the workout apps  so  i just did an online search and others had the same issue  unfortunately  samsung doesnt honor the warranty for water damage  even though it is rated for swimming   so  now  after   months   i m having to purchase a new watch  don t buy if you plan on sweating  wearing in the shower  or swimming      
30,1.0,                       update          i recently have been in a back and forth with amazon and samsung  turns out that the product was a refurbished international model  so therefore it was not covered under warranty  samsung called me and said that they can send it back without repair  i decided to contact amazon and tell them the situation  they said they would give me a refund with a stocking fee since it is out of the return window  i told them it was unacceptable and i was thinking of taking legal action because it was falsely advertised  seeing as it said the us version and was an international model   they ended up giving me a full refund  the seller needs to do a better job of advertising and not having false information on the amazon site  do not buy this watch on this website  go to an authorized retailer so you do not run into the same issues that i did i bought this watch as i wanted to upgrade from my old samsung watch  i have been loyal to samsung for years  after several months of usage  i started noticing when my phone was having difficulty connecting to my watch it goes into standalone mode  which drains the batter in about   hours as opposed to     days  i turned off all the apps that i do not use  it still will drain quickly and also has difficult connecting after troubleshooting  it is sad that it is marketed as a longer lasting watch but after a couple of months it dies so quickly  i have reached out to samsung and they are saying ordering on amazon may not be authorized for a warranty repair  i like the watch but this is getting really irritating      
31,4.0,                       i have been using this for about   months  and it is overall a good watch  i liked everything about it  the only drawback is the battery life    days at most   something i noticed is that recently it started to work slowly for some reason  i optimize it  close recent pages often  but still i notice that it sometimes works slow or freezes  except that everything is great  and it works the way it should      
32,5.0,                       the first one i got wouldn t connect  but  i got a replacement in   days and i want to say thank you for that  i am so excited to use it as  have heard as read p many great reviews on it  so far its working fantastic  took literally    seconds to pair it  already customized  thankfully it s easy to use because i m not electronically savvy      
33,1.0,                       be careful about how you handle this watch   the back plane fell off so i returned it for repair and they said that it was out of warranty because the back fell off   if they had made it more sturdy  then the back would have not fallen off   they charged me         to get it repaired   after complaining they lowered it to          funny that henry the supervisor did give me a discount when it should have been under warranty and no charge   what was i going to do   they had me by the   be worried if the back plane falls off because you will be told that it is out of warranty because you caused the problem not samsung   so in the end i have now paid           thanks to samsung and amazon   amazon you let companies like samsung take advantage of your prime customer ed     
34,3.0,                       i absolutely hate that silent alarms are not the default and there doesnt seem to be a way to make it the default or even change it quickly  it it such a hassle that i have to manually scroll through pages of settings to adjust each alarm independently and if i forget one  easy to do as i have a variable schedule  i m jarred awake by the loud  annoying sound coming from my wrist  the only reason i bought a smartwatch was for the things it can do that a phone can t  such as a silent alarm  i can t even ask bixby to set a silent alarm  because it replies that it can t name alarms  what is bixby even for if it can t do simple tasks   this watch can do a lot of things  but it misses the mark on some of the basics  i m thinking about returning the watch and going back to my fitbit because of this      
35,5.0,                       i love this watch  i was looking for a fitness watch  while this might lack a little in that department it makes up for in smartwatch features  i don t know what i would do without this watch  i change watch faces daily and love the detail  i can control my smart devices outlets and play downloaded music without my phone connection  spotify  or you can add your music through the app      
36,1.0,                       do not buy     i bought thinking that i would be free from carrying a phone but it has been nothing but a nightmare dealing with the technical issues from samsung  the watch doesn t even start up anymore  i now have to contact my phone carrier to try get a refund and disconnect my line  this is the second time i have returned      
37,2.0,                       i really  really wanted to like this watch  in the    days i have had it  i have spent hours trying to figure out basic operations  it seems like i would have been better off with another fitbit  samsung has removed the pulse ox reading  now it apparently reads it in the background and calculates some sort of mythical  stress score  instead of simply showing oxygen saturation  you apparently need to download a previous version of the app to restore it but i can t find it  and i m apparently not alone   sleep is also off  and other reviewers say the same   somehow  it shows i am only asleep   hours out of the   that i was  asleep  and in bed  given that even my broken fitbit is more accurate  i am declaring this feature to be sadly inaccurate  for bp  you need to get a  rd party app and calibrate with a separate bp device  i am not optimistic about the potential ecg in development either  step counter is questionable  i find some features easy to use  like the watch face choices  but a lot of features are cumbersome and not intuitive  i will continue to check it out  i have another       weeks to return it but definitely considering a return  disappointing   so sad      
38,5.0,                       bought this earlier this year  had a cheap on from walmart that was not the best at anything  biggest reason for needing one  was to monitor my heart rate especially while i was sleeping  also needed it to help keep track of my workouts and activity  i will say  i was worried at first about the sizing because i had previously owned an apple watch that was a lot smaller and i have pretty small wrists  but i don t find the size to be uncomfortable  its comfortable to wear all day and even at night  works well with my galaxy note   phone  tracks everything like it is supposed to  would definitely recommend to others  its worth it      
39,2.0,                       this watch left me very conflicted  the purpose of me purchasing this watch was for tracking my heart rate  daily steps  and sleep  the device failed to accurately track every metric  the watch could never hold a consistent reading of my heart rate while doing cardio  lifting  or even sleeping  and yes i tried adjusting the placement and tightness of the watch and cleaning the sensor   also the steps calculated would always be crazy high  sometimes       steps higher than my girlfriend who followed the path as i  but  the watch as an extension of my phone worked wonderfully   it s a beautiful watch that has a big bright display   it holds battery life for days  it s user friendly and super customizable  i wanted to like this watch  i was very conflicted about returning it   but i can t justify spending the money on it when i intended to buy it for fitness tracking  i don t understand how this watch is called active when it doesn t do anything to aid in your healthy lifestyle      
40,4.0,                       so i have the s  frontier i am a guy and i love it so i wanted my wife to have a samsung watch but feared that her job she gets her hands wet all the time thinking that my watch would work but not the best choice so i bought her the active   pink   mm it is a nice watch but my biggest complaint is that the samsung pay feature only has  x sensor and the s  has   sensors and the s  works almost everywhere while the active   dont even work in the biggest mart chain on the planet but does work at less known grocery chains  so if you do buy it look for samsung pay on the screen kind of annoying compared to the same brand watch but different model      
41,4.0,                       the galaxy watch active  is a beautiful smartwatch that pairs nicely with the galaxy s    it s been about a month now since my purchase and i have no regrets so far  however  as a longtime fitbit wearer  charge  charge ii  charge    i guess you could say i had high expectations for some of its advertised functions the short  if you re looking for a sleek fitness tracker that can monitor your steps  sleep habits  heart rate  and incoming text messages phone calls  there s likely a cheaper alternative for you that ll do a more accurate job  if you don t mind spending extra money for gps functionality and a fancy screen with mediocre fitness activity sleep stats  buy an active  the long er   as a person that s obsessed with stats  i was really excited to finally get my hands on a flagship smartwatch that doubled as a fitness tracker to pair with my galaxy s    my fitbit charge   was serving its purpose well  but it was finally time to fork over some extra    and get my hands on  what i thought was  a more detail oriented   stats driven smartwatch  originally  i was going to purchase the latest galaxy smartwatch  but the idea of having a less bulky watch that would accurately measure my activity during the day sleep at night was far more appealing to me  if this is your first and only fitness tracker  it s possible that you could be blown away by its results  however  having owned several fitbits over the years and comparing my experiences  i feel like the smartwatch functionality of the active  diminishes the capability of its fitness tracker  if you re looking for a stylish smartwatch that can handle your standard smartwatch needs as well as a basic overview of your activity for the day  the active  will not disappoint  if you re looking for accurate statistics on heart rate  sleeping behavior and daily steps  perhaps consider going the cheaper route and getting something that s centered around exactly what you re looking for   it does look cool  though  so that s nice      
42,5.0,                       this watch replaced my fitbit charge     sooo worth it  i mean it  it actually lights up in the sunshine   my fitbit did not  it does so much  the reminders to move each hour  the tracking of my steps  heartbeat  everything is so good about this watch  i cannot brag enough about it      
43,1.0,                       i bought this watch february of this year   recently  the watch started getting horizontal lines across the face   gradually the watch face disappeared replaced by lines  i reached out to the seller who advised me to contact manufacturer   i did   only to be told by samsung that my watch was manufactured outside the us therefore the us warranty does not apply   contacted seller again and he never responded   i paid        for it only to be burned  buyers beware      
44,4.0,                       great watch overall  i had the gear s  beforehand   the only issue i have is with the screen  got a deep scratch it from   sleeping   my gear s  took a lot of abuse and survived like a tank  this one   not so much  you should probably get a screen protector  with this one      
45,2.0,                       i bought this watch to use on the golf course   i ve stuck with it for a couple of months but i am giving up and buying a different watch   it kicks me out at least once a round  which means turning it off  restarting the watch and restarting the golf app   at least once a hole it sends a code that i have to approve to keep it working    it vibrates until you approve the code    if you are looking for a watch primarily for golf yardage  this isn t it      
46,2.0,                       i had been a fitbit versa lite wearer but i had a samsung watch so i decided to spoil myself with the samsung watch  big mistake and here it is   days too late to return it and that is on me  first  it does not hold a charge for even two days   pitiful   it does not come on when you flick your wrist like fitbit does   it does not show your heart rate and steps unless you go scrolling through the faces to find it  it is attractive and comfortable on the wrist  but i would like it to be as good or better than the fitbit and it is far from it  now mine is shutting off for some reason and unlike the fitbit pushing the button on the side does not bring it on  i could have bought one of the cheap off brand watches and had a better experience  if you do get it  be sure to watch your return date so you do not lose      like i did      
47,2.0,                       after a short time it stopped working  touch screen      
48,1.0,                       i enjoyed this watch while it lasted  only   months and a few days   within a month of really careful use  some of the pixels in the    o clock area died  if that was all that had gone wrong  i would still have given this watch a solid   stars because it performed well in quite a few areas bluetooth pairing with my cellphone was very reliable and the galaxy wearable and samsung health apps were very functional  the samsung health app provided detailed analytics on sleep patterns   heart rate and daily step count during workouts  the audible reports of distance  heartrate and elapsed time were very useful for adjusting my pace and made it easy to achieve fitness goals  notification of meeting the daily step target was always motivating  a tremendous number of watch faces was available to suit almost any mood or purpose in the nine months i owned this watch  i never once showered or swam with it  i did have on a watch protector which retained some moisture when i would wash my hands although most times i would remove the protector and dry off the watch  i am very disappointed that a     dollar watch that claims to be water resistant ended up with the bottom falling off      
49,1.0,                       do not buy  i have been a samsung user since galaxys came out  love the phones  loved my watch that i bought last dec until battery life kept decreasing to the point i could not complete a run or wear more than   hrs in just watch mode  since under warranty i sent back to samsung  they say warranty is not valid as it has water damage  i have never used it swimming  left on showering etc  only light splashes during hand washing and then dried immediately  for a watch that is marketed to  atm waterproof i do not understand how washing my hands could have ruined the watch      
50,1.0,                       i ve had this watch for   months and it randomly stopped working   i sent it into samsung service as it s still under warranty and they responded that it would cost      to fix the watch because it has water damage   this watch literally has a swimming mode  which means it should have pretty good water resistance   i have never been swimming while wearing it and i ve never worn it in the shower   the only way it could have gotten water damage is from my sweat   an active watch that is damaged by sweat   and then not covered under warranty   absolutely not worth the cost      
51,3.0,                       battery life is really bad  i have to manually enter running mode  rather than the app  knowing itself  when i do it is kind of clunky to navigate  not really  super easy to use  overall   the watch display is neat  and i like managing my spotify from it  but not the best product in my opinion      
52,5.0,                       i had few smart watches  mostly android and this one is my first tizen watch  i would like to say that this watch easily became my no   watch  it is not too heavy and not too lite but just perfect weight  fits very good on my wrist    mm  and the band is great  it is very easy to operate with it and the tutorial helps very much  the watch faces look great  however they are not that many like the android faces  i have a samsung phone and it takes perfect advantage on that  though i can not say how this one would work with other android branded phones      
53,1.0,                       absolutely horrible step tracking  floor counting and sleep tracking  multiple hours with samsumg customer service who couldn t get it to work right either  they admitted the floor tracking has terrible issues  this thing said i climbed     flights of stairs when i was sitting on my couch for half an hour watching tv  ridiculous  it logged a three hour nap while i was washing dishes and cooking  there is no point in keeping a fitness tracker that doesn t track right  sending back   the only fun thing was music playback on its speaker while i was walking dog      
54,4.0,                       i love the watch  so comfortable and tons of features and options  i love the sleek look  it does everything it says it does   i got it for all the health options  sleep tracker  beats per minute   workout features  and tracking  it does a great job con  it can take   hours to fully charge when its low  very slow charging station  so if your counting steps  make sure it s full before you start your day     
55,1.0,                       after the latest samsung wearable update the device has stopped working on many phones  hence the influx of   star reviews of the apps in the play store recently  now i don t even know if my device i received is defective or if it s just their incompetent buggy software  forced to waste resources and so many hours of troubleshooting again  also so many hands will touch this on it s way here and back  so much unnessesary risk because someone can t do their job  it s probably best to avoid samsung watches until they can get this fixed      
56,5.0,                       i decided to purchase after having a gear s  frontier for years in order to have better swimming function  better water proofing    i really like the s  but i like the active   even more  it has better water proof rating  it s much lighter  the stock band is more comfortable   i ve always liked a watch with a mechanical bezel but the swiping on the active   is great   understanding it s a different style than the s   that is  less like an analog watch in appearance and obvious much more a watch competing with the apple watch  i think it s a great upgrade      
57,3.0,                       diary of a fitness watch addict  my name is joe and i am a fitness watch addict  so far i have owned a garmin vivoactive    garmin venu  huawei gt      of them   fitbit blaze  galaxy active    apple se  and a host of watches for under      that promise the world  but give very little  lets talk     garmin watches  neither garmin watch that i owned could ply music direct to earbuds  no matter what i tried  for some reason  everytime i tried to set this feature uo  it failed  it will get you outside though becuase you have to go out there and gain gps coordinates in order to listen to music  i don t know why  as an addict i just did as directed  it never worked  i purchases earbuds garmin suggested and    nothing  every once in a whil it would work  but only briefly and then     time to go outside again  the vivoactive screen is as washed out as any i have ever seen  battery life is metsa metsa and that is if you don t do much  i imagine if i was able to get music it would have cut the battery life even more  the venu has a much better screen   however  the cost in battery life is significant garmin watches remind me of microsoft computers  spend more time diddling with them then using them  sold mine on ebay the huawei gt    now there is a watch  well made  beautiful to look at  battery life forever  syncs music flawlessly  i would love to have kept this watch  unfortunately i don t live in china where this watch works  in the usa this watch will only count active calories and is extremely arbitrary and capricous regarding how many you are going to get  frustrating as hell  don t bother with customer service  when you tell them you are in the us you will be sent to hold purgatory  the one thing that this watch could do is estimate treadmill distance  i mean accurate to     th of a mile  garmin was    percent off every     mile and no matter how many times i would enter stridelength or the correct distance traveled on the treadmills display it would again display a significant error  like i said  if you like dicking around with your fitness watch fitbits fitbits  i lost    lbs when my wife bought me one of their first models  that wrist wife had me up walking at night to finish my goals before midnight  now   eh   i mean monthly fitbit fees  i don t think so galaxy active    here is a watch that does everything nothing  again  if you like dicking with watches  first is the calorie counting which is horrible on every watch i have had  this watch is so horrible at it that  wven though it is monitoring heatrate and sp   your results are a joke  don t believe me  take the watch off  start a workout  and watch the unearned calories start adding even though you are doing nothing  a million workouts to choose from  try adding boxing or a host of other workouts to the watch  not going to happen  also  because their calorie counting is so flawed they removed total calories burned from the watch so you can t view them  sold mine on ebay so  let me save you  the apple watch se  thank you god  battery life is crap and promised to be crap so no disappointment  syncs to apple se phone flawlessly  like without your help  every workout is listed and has a specialized formula for calorie count that is amazingly accurate  frankly i am so happy with this watch i could go on for hours  so if you feel that you are burning     calories a day in frustration sweat while you are trying to get your newest fitness watch to monitor your health  try the apple  pay a little more save yourself the aggrivation      
58,3.0,                       i am a tried and true samsung fan  but i have to say  this watch still has a long way to go   it is leaps ahead of the original active  but there are a lot of incompatibilities and issues the watch forces you to utilize all samsung native applications which is great if you are the    of the world who does that   i use apps like  google assistant  not available   gmail  not available  google calendar  not avaialble   android messages  not avaialble   amazon music  not avaialble   google maps  avaialble if you pay for a third party tool   and many more i purchased this for the golf option which looks like it would work great   its a little clunky but it would definitely do the trick   it is also great for exercise as it has a ton of options and sensors  but in my option  that doesnt out weigh the lack of integration with applications i use day to day     
59,4.0,                       like its preinstalled apps  sleep track not tested yet  but the battery life needs to be extended  recharge every   days now   if you add some apps the recharge interval becomes   or   days      
60,2.0,                       i had used the watch for just over a year  there were some minor issues here and there  but overall  it was a good enough experience  it had a lot of features that i now am missing because  my watch died for no reason  it died just one month after the warranty expired during a software update  reading customer service experiences and the cost involved to repair it  i didn t even bother contacting samsung i should mention that unlike many other reviews here  i had no issues while swimming with the watch  either in pools or at the beach  the watch died months after i lastly swam or got the watch wet  so  that was definitely not the cause of the watch dying i will still share my overall experience below   my most used features were sleep trackingstep counterworkout featuremic for callsviewing whatsapp messagescalendar notificationsi mostly had no issues with the above  the watch itself was generally responsive  but at random times it seemed to slow down or freeze a bit  i do not like slowdowns  so  because of this  i would have rated the watch   stars  it packs good features the issues were mostly with the phone app  sometimes the watch had issues syncing with the phone  galaxy s      i suspect this is what killed the watch during updating it as well  because it lost connection  and then the watch was a brick  nothing works  it s just completely dead but because of it dying just shortly after it becoming out of warranty  i simply cannot recommend this watch  and i give it two stars  normally  this would be getting   star  but  i like its features i am looking to get something else now  because i don t want to spend      every year  and i am apparently very lucky that swimming with the watch or washing it didn t immediately kill it  samsung s reputation with customer service doesn t help either      
61,5.0,                       i bought this watch specifically because it advertises spotify offline  it is supposed to be able to download songs and playlists for offline use  i was able to get this to work exactly one time  they has been no communication about a fix for this problem  if you planned on buying this for that purpose don t      
62,4.0,                       i really like this watch  my only complaint is the step counter   it is way low  i  compared it to my fitbit zip and the zip always has a higher count   i ve determined that the problem is that any time i walk without moving my arms  mowing the lawn  pushing a shopping cart  etc   the steps are not counted  if i walk around the block with nothing in my hands  the step counts are pretty close   i doubt the problem is unique to samsung watches   all watches probably have the same issue      
63,1.0,                       i purchased this to replace my fitbit charge     samsung calculates sleep stages differently than fitbit  because of this  it states i never get any deep sleep   the stair sensor doesn t work in the us because it is set to detect    feet between floors  ours are    feet so i never get any stairs  the main reason i purchased this watch was the ability to have a non apple watch that did ecg and fall detection   samsung promise  in writing this watch would have it but they still have not released an update to turn it on      
64,1.0,                       i purchased this galaxy watch active   on may           for         within   months the watch had stopped working  i contacted amazon who put me in touch with the samsung service center since the watch came with a   year warranty   i sent the watch to samsung to make the necessary repairs and received the watch back the same condition that i sent it totally black and saying that it was charged        i again contacted customer service and requested a refund  i was told the repair dept  needed to make two attempts to repair the watch before my refund request could be considered   i reluctantly sent it back again for repair    after a few more days  i received an email  informing me that the watch could not be repaired and that they were sending me a replacement watch   i called immediately and again requested a refund it was denied and i was told that they did not do refunds   i received my new replacement watch but they failed to include either a new charger or my old charger  so now i have a phone and no charger   placed another call to customer service and i was told that they would send me out another charger in between    and    hours    that was on a thursday    monday i called to ask for a tracking number and i was told that  there was no tracking number    what   i am just beside myself if you know what i mean   today is thursday   th  and as of      pm still no charger   i contacted amazon and they were willing and able to rectify my issues and they made me a happy amazon customer   thank you amason customer service for your commitment to providing excellent customer services sincerely d  jackson     
65,5.0,                       i like this watch more than i expected to  i had the samsung gear   and it was just ok  the active   is sleeker  thinner and works better with my phone  samsung galaxy      i bought the   mm model and it wears smaller than the dimensions indicate  the strap that comes with the watch is comfortable and long enough for big wrists  any after market watch strap in a   mm width will work with this watch  so there are lots of options  my only real issue is the sleep monitoring  which isn t as good as the fitbit  i believe fitbit does a much better job of reporting your sleep  this isn t a deal breaker for me  and maybe samsung will update or tweak the softwear  for android users  this could be the best smartwatch out there      
66,1.0,                       the watch is ok but certainly not worth       i bought this for its workout features but it pauses all the time while you are working out and will not resume  many people have posted to samsung s community asking for a fix but ehy have been ignored  i stayed on hod with customer service for a half hour only to be told i needed to be transferred to someone who could help but i was transferred to an automated message saying i had to call between        so i am not sure why i was transferred   anyway  its big for me  unattractive appearance and uncomfortable when i sweat  its metrics are also way off   does not measure sleep correctly   says i am sleeping when i am awake and vice versa  so i just don t see what the watch does for       so its going back     
67,1.0,                       i order this direct from amazon as brand new and it came with a cosmetic scratch     
68,5.0,                       i get so many compliments on this watch  i love that i can show it off with the always on display  i manage to get   days or so with a single charge and it works surprisingly well with iphone too when i switched from my samsung  speakers are loud and it s very responsive  also  it s a lot more scratch resistant than my apple watch series   was  i hit the face of the watch head on onto the hinge of the vault at work with no scratch  dent  or damage  i for sure thought it broke      
69,1.0,                       i tried it for about   weeks and had to return it  as a health watch it did not live up to the hype at all  while i did love the look size  customizable features  bixby routines  and integration with samsung phone  it was not what i was looking for to replace my fitbit blaze  after a couple of days i realized that the step tracking and heart rate was way off  i went into the samsung health app and updated height  etc and decided to try a couple more days  that did not fix the issue so i got in contact with the samsung customer service where they essentially told me i could try rebooting it completely but it would likely not fix the problem  i rebooted the watch and sure enough the problem remained  i decided to wear alongside my fitbit for a couple days and the difference was huge  on the samsung watch my hr was    on the fitbit  and manually taking  hr was    and stepwise samsung read     s for the day while fitbit read     s  if i tried taking my hr on the samsung health app in phone  it was accurate and would sync to accurate hr on the watch  but who wants to do that daily when the watch is marketed to do it automatically  if i was just looking for a smart watch to integrate text messages  music player  weather  pay  etc  this would be a great watch  simply not what i was looking for to replace my current watch  i might look into the new fitbit versa as their health monitoring programs seem much more accurate      
70,5.0,                       love this watch  it came pretty fast and easy to set up  it works better than the fitbit that i have  wish i would have gotten a smartwatch for my samsung phone sooner  the only downside to this watch is the battery life isn t great  it lasts about a day to a day and a half  my fitbit lasted   days  but this watch also does a lot more than my fitbit did      
71,1.0,                       item was returned  it was advertised by samsung as having ekg ability and so sense my apple watch did it very well i expected the samsung watch would also  upon receiving the watch i came to understand that samsung still has not had the ekg function cleared through the fda and therefore it is not functional  that was the whole reason for upgrading so i returned it because it did not do what they promised that would      
72,4.0,                       i guess i had bigger expectations   i imagined this as like a mini close to a smart phone or your wrist but it s more like a smart switch for example   does a heck of lot more than a regular watch and works with your phone the samsung health features are nice   step tracking w o your phone plus monitoring your heart rate  stress  and sleep   it s also nice to have your calendar and weather on your wrist   i really like how you can use it as spotify remote as well they shouldn t be bragging about the battery life  it lasts maybe   days   bixby  galaxy s virtual assistant  is garbage compared to google assistant  alexa  siri  etc overall  i like it and am glad i bought it just can t wait for new and improved versions to come out in the future since the tech is somewhat new      
73,5.0,                       this watch is amazing  had the older gear watches before and this one has the sleek design and fully touch screen  very easy to use and very responsive   packed full of features you wouldn t even think you d need but once you set it up you ll use everyday  has ecg feature and heart rate monitor built in and the watch faces are sweet and you can customize to you style and liking  tracks sleep and steps very accurately and the battery is lasting me   days with constant notifications and usage which is amazing from my old watch that only lasted a few hours  if your looking for a samsung watch then look no further   i was between   models and chose this one but wow am i impressed and i have worked in this industry for over    years   great buy and highly recommend      
74,1.0,                       with the most recent samsung watch update i can t connect to the watch from the samsung wear or fitness tracking app  my phones bluetooth settings  oneplus   pro  says i m connected but i can t pull up any data  i ve rebooted both phone and watch  and done a factory reset on the watch no luck watch is pretty much useless      
75,3.0,                       having used a fitbit charge  for years  i wanted something that was a little bit more stylish and capable while still tracking my fitness stuff well   the active  is certainly a well made and nice looking watch  good looking interface  watch faces  and the tizen os and battery life is leaps and bounds better than the top end wearos devices  i actually returned a fossil gen  to get this samsung active     the watch however needs some serious help on the fitness tracking   while i find step count and heart rate sensors to be accurate  the gps distance comes up short  the treadmill estimations are even shorter  the calorie count is absurdly short  about         for me   and the  floors climbed  tracking is completely broken   samsung s own samsung health app will show     s of feet of elevation gain during a run and credit you for  maybe   or   floors  if you re lucky   if you re going to bill it as a smartwatch   fitness tracker  you might consider having the fitness tracking part work   buy some fitbit products  samsung  study  em  and fix your code and algorithms   easy enough   and then it would be a   star watch      
76,2.0,                       operation wise the watch works well  tracks sleep time but don t necessarily believe it s measurements of the stages  records distance and speed accurately  the phone apps are a little annoying and samsung health on the watch is missing some activities  but overall it s good construction wise  mine had a major flaw  when i went to high altitude low air pressure  the glass face popped out of the metal housing  i pushed it back it  contacted samsung for a warranty repair  sent it in  and they wanted me to pay to replace the lcd which wasn t broken  so i got it back unfixed and unsealed so probably isn t waterproof anymore  don t expect samsung to uphold their warranty      
77,5.0,                       bought the active   golf edition  love the game app has every course near me  watch seems fast and all the health apps seem to work well  i also love the appearance of the watch  battery life seems pretty good as well     
78,1.0,                       samsung will not back their defective products  sent my watch i had for less then   months to samsung for repair  they would not cover it under warranty  very diisappointed  website states can be worn to swim  i did so watch stopped working immediately  samsung will not cover  horrible customer service experience  hopefully amazon will step up and help me  we shall see      
79,4.0,                       i got this watch for my girlfriend around   weeks ago and she loves it  always telling me how useful the watch has been  the style looks very cute on her and fits nicely on her small wrist  she really enjoys the sleep tracking feature as she suffers from occasional insomnia  so far she seems to get pretty accurate results  she wears it all the time and pretty much only takes it off when charging it  the rest is pretty standard  she can check and reply to her notifications without having to look at her phone  change the songs  check her heart rate and stress levels her two main complaints are that she wishes the bezels were a little thinner and for longer battery life  it easily last through the day  but has to put it to charge everyday bottomline  i would say it s a great smartwatch      
80,5.0,                       i went back and forth after the new galaxy watch was just released   i ended up going with the active   after reading and watching tons of reviews   this is my first smart watch   it s really great and not too long after the new galaxy watch  the active   got an update with a bunch of the functionality   i ended up choosing my budget over the latest release and i m really glad i did   the sleep tracking is good and i have loaded music on for going on a run   like that it reminds me to get up from my desk and move too   it s really easy to forget   overall  i m very happy with my purchase      
81,5.0,                       i ve never been much of a jewelry wearer but i have really come to love this watch  i got it for christmas       i carry my phone in my back pocket and so many times it is inconvenient to use it  i can check the time  of course   use it as a phone  send texts with it  track my daily steps  have the outside temp displayed  and also be able to change the look of the face display with more choices than i could ever use in a lifetime  i can also access my contacts  measure my heart rate  there s an event calendar  alarm  and i get notifications  there s really nothing to not love about this watch      
82,4.0,                       love this watch  especially the long battery life  i can get almost   days out of it with normal use  i use it about    to    minutes when taking walks  i got this after i had bypass surgery as a way to track my heart rate and when the feature is available using the ekg feature  outside of the features the watch looks great and fits great  i ve had more compliments on this watch than others  i have had some issue when sweating a lot and the heart rate monitor doesn t read  i need to take it off and wipe it down then it s all good  maybe i just need to tighten the band up  this would be a full   stars in all areas of it hand android wear  i miss some of the functions on there i can t get on this watch especially since i don t have a samsung phone      
83,2.0,                       the active   is sleek and stylish and comfortable  the lte version offers ability to use basic smartphone features from the watch directly without having to have it tethered to my smartphone so i can leave the phone at home while going for a walk or jog or in the car or locker while doing other workouts  that is a godsend it activated just fine through verizon and it linked up easily with my samsung s   plus through the galaxy wearables app  i hear these watches work best with a samsung phone for best functionality the phone is fast and responsive to inputs and while i haven t owned it long yet  it can easily last well over a day on a single charge  i basically upgraded from a samsung gear fit  and the interface is familiar to me  so the os is basically an evolution  which is nice so the learning curve is reduced it is lightweight and has low profile buttons and no thick surrounding bezel make it unobtrusive for general every day use and especially nice for working out there is one glaring flaw with this watch  however  that is the paltry   gb of  storage   of which with a clean  new os  only about    gb is usable  that may have been sufficient for a basic smartwatch from four or five years ago  and on my gear fit   with its  gb of storage  it had over    gb of usable storage for music  but for a top end smartwatch with lte capability  having only    gb of actual usable storage is laughable you can free up a little bit of space by deleting watch faces  and maybe a handful of apps  although most are pretty useful and don t use much space to begin with  otherwise there s no way to gain more storage  with the available space you might be able to store     songs at best  but that leaves no room for adding apps or other options in the future  you shouldn t have to be storage restricted on a device like this and juggle music constantly on and off the device  plus  just hope future os updates don t make the installation size larger reducing usable storage even more it does support spotify streaming  and if you re a spotify user that is a good feature especially if you have a decent data plan  but otherwise you will be quite limited in the number songs you can store locally on the phone  i use a lot of ripped live concert albums which isn t readily available on spotify  and not about to add       year subscription on top of an already      year add on for adding my watch to my data plan overall it is a very nice watch  just for a top end smartwatch in      the  gb storage almost makes it unusable  i am considering the galaxy watch   instead because it comes with  gb ram and otherwise same specs  i just prefer the sleeker look of the active        
84,4.0,                       i ll keep it simple positives   beautiful shows notifications can respond to text the time and date  tracks workouts tracks sleep  idk how accurate  tracks heart rate  stress levels  idk how accurate  tracks steps and calories  idk how accurate  lots of widget choices charges fast negatives  ive been able to cancel and accept calls but not actually have the phone call on my watch  could just be me  horrible battery  it last a day or two  a day and a half maybe     
85,2.0,                       got this watch for my girlfriend  this is her review as an active person  i teach multiple fitness classes throughout the week  i like pink  and my boyfriend wanted to give me a birthday gift to match my personality looks the watch looks great  it s lightweight and the pink is pretty  the face of the watch is also easy to use  that s why i gave it   stars  but  unlike other reviews  i did find it uncomfortable to wear  i have a small wrist and it s very noticeable when i m carrying something on it  it also left marks on my wrist  i tried wearing it a bit more loose but then it won t track your movements properly  which takes us to the next point functionality if you re familiar with samsung  they have an  active  phone line  which means it ll withstand moving  getting wet  dropping it  etc  it doesn t necessarily mean it s for fitness people  i know that the watch advertises  advanced fitness tracking  but it won t track your fitness as it relates to your weight or heart rate  instead  the watch will track your moves based on average data they ve gathered  from somewhere   so imagine  your calories burned in the aerobics workout you just did is an average of the calories burned in an average aerobics workout for someone else  not you  also  i found that most of the time this watch didn t know when to start tracking the workout so i had to start it myself  many of the workouts that i teach aren t included on the workout list you pick from  hence why i had to say it was an  aerobics workout   whether it was zumba  toning for legs or arms or abs  circuit training  pilates  mat pilates  i think it does have yoga but it s not like it matters anyway because it ll give you an average of a light  medium  or high intensity yoga class that someone else took  not you  it doesn t have many workouts to choose from  also  i found that the option to choose your workout and talk you through it doesn t work very well either  in addition  my watch maybe was broken because i d be standing up and walking but as soon as i sat down  it would say  time to get moving  because i d been inactive for too long according to the watch    needless to say  i wasn t impressed  you can turn off this option as it s annoying but then you won t know if your watch is working properly or not battery life had to charge it every other day smartwatch functions this is a smartwatch you ll pair with your phone  you can get text messages  take phone calls  check a few apps on your watch  see if you got an email  and have quick replies  however  i didn t think this watch was that advanced  i didn t even turn on bixby because i ve heard that it needs a lot of improvements  when the watch  talked to me  during workouts  the voice was extremely robotic price for the functionality it offers and the sleek look  you could buy this watch but i found it expensive  it doesn t do what it advertises very well  i don t think it s worth it  maybe future versions will be better bottom line if you re looking for fitness tracking  don t buy this watch  if you re looking for smartwatch functionalities and a samsung watch  try a different one  this one isn t worth it      
86,5.0,                       this watch is absolutely stunning   the clock faces to choose from our endless and i am just in awe with this watch that my fiance just bought for me and i bought for him the black one the heart rate monitor is very inaccurate  it consistently stays around     even when i am just sitting at my desk  but when i check it on the blood pressure cuff it s           
87,1.0,                       the watch is fine  however it is not very water resistant  it became water damaged  but i never swam with it or submersed it  washing hands and showering is the most it ever got wet  sent it to samsung while under the warranty period  they refused to fix it under warranty  they wanted        to fix the watch  refurbished ones are cheaper than that  very disappointed in customer support  samsung has lost a customer      
88,1.0,                       misleading false advertising and warranty denialabsurd on its face is the fact that samsung markets this as being able to be used swimming  see attached photo  and touting a  water resistant based on  atm rating  which means submersion up to    meters per iso standard              i sent this in under warranty after gentle use in water  i e  relaxing in a pool not swimming nor diving  claim was denied due to water damage  obviously misleading advertising at best if not outright false and deceptive marketing  needless to say i suggest any potential purchasers find a more reputable manufacturer  those who have had the same experience i encourage to lodge a complaint with the better business bureau as i ve found that samsung is not particularly interested in rectifying the issue on their own      
89,5.0,                       i have tiny wrists so the   mm looks fine    it gave me a little trouble to sync with my phone using the gear app  but i figured it out and since then i had no other issues with it   is a good watch for active gym goer sport person  it will look good to flex too  but i would get the rose gold for that only purpose lol  is comfortable to wear all day  i never in my life have taken a shower with a watch or slept with a watch on   and that s not about to change  so i cant talk about those features      
90,1.0,                       i see no benefit in comparison to my android wear watch aside from better battery life  i will make some quick notes on my problems with the watch notifications   i can t imagine anyone preferring the notification system of samsung in comparison to android wear  it is significantly more annoying to handle many notifications on samsung than it is to do so on android wear both reading and discarding phone battery drain   this thing uses so many apps and services that i have noticed a significant increase in battery drain when switching from android wear to samsung phone audio problem   in some situations this watch can some how disable the phones loud speaker so for example if you have an app that plays audio through the loud speaker like for example youtube or a  rd party alarm app it will either not play any sound at all or play it through the ear piece on the phone      
91,5.0,                       i ve had every version of the samsung watch and this is definitely my favourite  my second favourite was the gear s  but at times it seems rather bulky  i like the minimalistic feature of the original active but no touch bezel and the screen was quite small  this is the perfect size for me and it looks damn good on my arm  smaller than the gear s  while having a bigger size screen  i was a bit worried because the cloud silver looked rather blue in the images but it is actually a matte finished silver and the band is grey      
92,1.0,                       bought it used   said it had scratches on the back of it  turns out there s no scratches just a small speck sized chip in screen  love the watch but feel  i totally got taken advantage of as i haven t been able to wear even notice it until it s too late to return   i had great luck with my previous s  frontier watch from amazon just got hosed this time  buyer beware     
93,4.0,                       this watch has made things so much easier for me  i don t have to carry around my phone in my pocket all of the time  i can see who is calling texting without getting my phone  i can read my texts  respond to them  and use the phone on the watch  there are  a variety of watch faces you can download  but i wish they also had more options  for example  some have no option to remove your heart rate on the display or the step count  i don t generally want to see those things every time i look at my watch on that note  i am not sure how accurate some of the measurements are  i got told by my watch to get up and move  because i d been sitting still for almost an hour  but i had only been sitting for    minutes and was moving around a lot before that  although i keep the watch pretty tight on my wrist  it didn t register my sleep patterns very accurately  there were times where i was asleep for a couple of hours and it registered me as awake  if you need precise data  i wouldn t count on this  the battery life is ok  i still charge it once a day  i d say it would last probably   days for the  light to moderate user  i keep the  always on  function on  which definitely drains some battery i guess i am used to having a million options on a cell phone  but the settings on the watch are also very basic  there aren t a lot of apps available  the app on the phone that goes with it is decent  i think it is just a newer technology and they haven t invested as much time in it as they have with other products  understandably   aside from the variety watch faces and easily changed wrist bands  which are cool   i wish this was able to be customized more  the icons are pretty basic looking   the messaging app is not very user friendly  it is difficult to open a conversation from a notification that a message just came in  i find myself fiddling around with it a lot when i want to see the whole conversation  especially if i got two messages in a row from the same person  i have to open the conversation to see both  it is functional enough and i do enjoy the convenience  these are just minor annoyances overall i do recommend this  it just needs a little polishing  figuratively  and more options when it comes to future development      
94,1.0,                       the product is new but with scratches        
95,5.0,                       this watch is straight up incredible  the battery life with normal usage is at least two days  the operation is quick and snappy no lag what so every   having it paired with a samsung phone is a big benefit as they talk the same language and the notifications are on point  this has even made my day to day work more efficient  if you are looking for an android device that can easily rival an apple watch then this is the device for you        
96,5.0,                       ordered this at  am  had it by noon  very fast delivery in my area  the black is more of a dark navy i d say  make sure you get the us version if you want the samsung pay to work  so far i m very pleased  it works great and looks pretty slick  the stock band doesn t breathe to well so i d recommend getting another band  samsung nailed it on this watch  eagerly awaiting the      ekg update to test that out too     
97,1.0,                       as a left hander the heart rate sensor does not work     of the time thus giving me extremely inaccurate workout data  to the point i have to put this trash watch on my left wrist for to work     of the time  thanks for not including a smaller wristband   distance is also a great issue because it is far behind the distance actually  traveled  on a treadmill as with everything samsung couples software and hardware together on  the software is absolutely pathetic  don t bother buying if you enjoy sending messages from your wrist  unless you don t have a samsung phone  which i m not sure how that experience is  or you love the lackluster samsung messenger app   or anything with efficiency and smoothness  and where is the smoothness everybody keeps going on about   samsung s pension for irritating is in full and constant effect  you cannot ever get rid of the intrusive prompt  make samsung messages default messenger app  every damn time you want to use the messaging app  and samsung hasn t and will not put an alternative use android s default messenger which is  as always  enterprise instead of  st semester college level speaking of enterprise  i do not experience a fluid and smooth operating system at all  if you don t use the lackluster touch bezel the os shows you just how poor it performs  then there s the brilliant low battery prompt in the middle of exercise  anything  regardless of importance  that does not go away on its own  ever  this along with all the ads and the intrusive smartthings  avoid         no longer working on a local network while the phone is on a vpn is absolutely frightening all i read when i owned my ticwatch pro  g was how bad wear os is was compared to tizen  that is complete and utter trash because those are just statements and they never back it up with any argument or examples  i ve used both and samsung s watch is crap and lacking severely in many areas  such as openness and choice without consequence  remove the annoying samsung default message prompt   it makes samsung look weak and desperate to force their software on people   and it s damn amateur  if you have a exotic drive for samsung because you feel it s the apple equivalent on android  no      
98,5.0,                       it very stylist and sturdy  it have a a lot of different categories that you can add to the watch face face  i use mines to track my walking  steps  and heart rate  it is very well accurate   i have had it for about   moths now and i have not had an issue  it has a lot of different style faces you can choose from  there are alot of free ones and ones you can also purchase  samsung is a good brand  worth the buy  great gift for those that are into smart watches      
99,1.0,                       received this watch as a birthday gift onjune  th and not even   month later the seal was damaged and the back was not staying on  contacted amazon and they sent me over to samsung vs refunding  samsung stated if it received any moisture which it does because i use it to workout  that i would have to pay for the repairs  it also  states it is water resistant   so after reading horrible samsung repair reviews i decided to try to make it work  now the battery will not hold a charge   week later  called back to amazon  now over    days  and they have   record of me calling before and it has to go through samsung  extremely discouraged  leaving samsung and maybe even amazon all together      
100,5.0,                       batt sucks needs to be charged every night unless you have it in power saving mode then you can get   days out of it  i don t use it for much else than a watch  i know other people were using it to track steps  sleep  calories burned  etc  and said it wasn t accurate  i really like the function of talk to text when responding to a text message      
101,5.0,                       while the battery life isn t what it was claimed to be  the function of the watch is great the other downfall is there s   different text formats for samsung galaxy note      the watch does not support the other messages app although  you still get alerts and you can respond to texts for it being my  st smart watch  not being the newest version  it was worth for the price of it      
102,2.0,                       for starters  the wristband is awful the way you have to tuck one end thru the buckle then under the strap  cumbersome  i bought a new band  another    bucks  i thought getting a watch where you swipe the face to get to functions would be more efficient  it is not  i look for one thing and that is heartrate  you have to go through your phone to reconfigure the watch to enable a screen to only show hr  accuracy and time in an activity are way off   today time should have been    minutes of anaerobic activity  and a hr up near      it registered time as    minutes and hr of     a much better value is polar  i have had two of their watches for years  you can not beat them for accuracy and withstanding wear and tear      
103,5.0,                       i did hours of research and comparison before settling on this watch for my significant other   he absolutely loves it  he s part of the android ecosystem so i knew i wasn t going to get him the apple watch   he couldn t be happier and the watch provides al the features he wished for and more  he uses the fitness features constantly but is also getting used to using texting and other features a bit more regularly furthermore  if i need one for myself i will also buy this watch instead of apple s watch  despite the fact that i belong to apple ecosystem    battery  life is the reason for this choice   bottomline  i highly recommend this watch  it s beautiful on  looks sexy and sporty at the same time  and is large enough not to look ridiculous even for women      
104,2.0,                       it looks nice and it easy to use  however none of the key features are there  it s been almost a year since this watch has come out and there is still no ecg  this was supposed to come out in february at the latest  the main reason i bought it  at this point you might as well buy an activ    very annoyed by this      
105,5.0,                       i ve been thinking about a smart watch for the past year  finally took the plunge and got this one last week  i absolutely love it  it really does almost everything my samsung phone does  one thing i love is that i can actually read the notifications  ie  texts  etc   also it is bright enough outdoors  the band is my least favorite thing because it s not very feminine  but it is durable and comfortable  i ll probably change it sometime  the learning curve on using the phone is just one day if you re are smart phone savvy  it s a wonderful techy toy      
106,5.0,                       i love the features on this smartwatch  the customization with so many different watch faces make it real nice  and the integration with phone  texting  and fitness really are a nice perk  i wish there were more apps for it  but i m happy with what i have  i find i can usually go about   days on the battery if i manually put it into power saving mode at night      
107,1.0,                       initially  i loved the watch  worked well as a smart watch and activity tracker for my needs  however  one day it began flashing and not responding  i contacted samsung support and they had me send it in  the watch was still under warranty  but after they received it  they said it would cost over      to repair because the warranty was voided due to being exposed to water  i explained i only showered with it  never swam  which its supposed to be water resistant to  m   and always had the water mode on  their only response was  there s water damage and the warranty is voided   there is no way to prove water damage is device issue and not user error  so they refused to cover  a new watch can be purchased for less than the repair  they clearly don t stand by their product      
108,4.0,                       i ve only had this watch for three days now  but i highly recommend it  i m writing this in hopes of helping others choose this watch backstory  skip if you don t want to read   i ve had two other samsung galaxy watches over the years  the s  and the s  frontier  i got the s  as a gift and just a week ago  it unexpectedly broke  i bought this as a replacement  the only things i ve only ever used my watches for has been for tracking my cycling  i go everyday  and for telling the time and controlling music  the previous two have worked perfect for this sizing  the s  and s  were    mm and    mm respectively  i always thought the s  looked a little big on my wrist  as my wrist is about     inches in circumference  i had a lot of trouble deciding whether to buy this watch in    mm or    mm  as many people on reddit recommend    mm for wrists below     inches  i ended up buying the    mm  and i think it looks great  the pictures don t show it  but i think it fits my wrist perfectly  the only problem is the band for the watch is on the tightest setting  i might even puncture a hole to have a tighter fit sports tracking  i don t run or do many other sports  but i do go    miles a day via bike  the s  worked great for that  and this watch does as well  so far  the only problem i ve had is with the auto pause feature  when off the bike to take a water break  the watch is supposed to automatically pause   it s very finicky  but that s the only complaint  it takes my heart rate accurately and i synced my samsung health with strava via the phone app to track my biking battery life  i ve only had it for a few days  but these past two days i ve tried charging it to full in the morning and seeing where it was at night  keep in mind that i go cycling in the morning and use gps the whole time  for both days  it drained about     battery  from     to   ish  for a day that was      am to       pm  i think that s pretty good  and i charge it while i m in the shower and wear it to sleep for sleep tracking  the charging is relatively fast  enough for it to almost be     before i sleep after a    min charge durability  waterproofing  i heard a lot of people say that they use this watch for swimming  but i m too scared to take a     dollar device into the pool  i wouldn t personally recommend it  the durability seems good though  but i haven t run into any problems accessories  i have a few recommendations so far  i bought a screen protector and a ringke bezel protector  both are present in the photos and i think it looks great  as well as providing looks  i highly recommend both  as it gives me comfort that i won t break the watch  on my old s   i scratched the bezel a lot  but that one was metal and this one isn t  also  for watch faces  the one i have is called minimal data weather  i also recommend iris    the apps on the store for the watch are cool and all  but they don t serve much functionality in my eyes  the charging base is a little inconvenient as it s just a small disk  so i recommend getting a base that it can click into so it stands like the s  and s  charging bases do overall review  i m very happy with the watch and i recommend this to anyone needing a watch  read the other sections for my personal views on the watch  and i hope everyone has an amazing day  hope this helped update after two weeks of having the watch and using it everyday  the back panel plate came off  the adhesive stopped sticking well  luckily  i was within the return period and i replaced it with a new one  if the same issue occurs again  i ll be leaving a one star but for now  it mightve just been a fluke with that watch  still a good watch      
109,5.0,                       i wasn t sure if i wanted to go with united states version or the international version  i opted to go with the us version  the only difference is samsung pay won t work in the international version and there s a possibility you might not be able to install updates  anyway the watch is very lightweight beautifully crafted and works very well  the screen is super bright and the audio for calls and music is better than expected  probably will buy another band at some point not because there s anything wrong with the silicone band it comes with but i like to have options depending on how i m dressed  the watch seems fairly fast and the heart rate monitor  in my opinion  is extremely accurate  the watch is extremely customizable  and didn t take that long to set up  battery life may not be as good as a fitbit for example but still decent you get about   days if you set up the watch correctly  the touch bezel is very smooth and easy to use  i m currently on a weight loss journey and i m about one third of the way there and wanted to get a good fitness watch  i m telling you right now if you re into fitness don t hesitate to buy this  it works extremely well  also before i forget the watch seems to be pretty waterproof  i actually showered for over    minutes with the watch on and had no issues when i got out  just put water lock mode on so the screen can t be touched      
110,5.0,                       watch is comfortable to wear  easier to read and battery life adequate if kept on power saving mode  highly recommend using battery saving mode while sleeping  after tightening the watchband  the remaining strap slips inside itself  keeps it from getting caught  unique feature  although not included in any instructions   watch updates do take a bit of time and you will have to reconnect it to your phone      
111,4.0,                       so far  i like it a lot  but there s a lot to it that i haven t tried yet   two things that disappointed me   the flower watch face they show in the pictures doesn t stay   after wearing it   day  the watch face changed to one that resembled shifting sands in changing colors   that was actually quite nice but some of the lighter colors made it difficult to read the time in white numerals  i searched all the watch faces shown on the watch and the app that goes with it  but i couldn t find the flower anywhere   the other thing was the color of the band   in the picture  it looked paler   i was hoping for white  but it was grey   that s on me because they did say it was grey  but i thought it would be a lighter shade   in spite of those minor disappointments  it is a good watch and i would recommend it      
112,1.0,                       there is much to like about this watch  it looks nice  the standard silicon strap it comes with is very comfortable  the facer app is awesome    but it is incredibly difficult to figure out how to load and use most apps  the documentation it ships with lacks a lot   a lot  a  lot  and seeking clarification online is also  at best  like chasing shadows  my frustration level in using it from the beginning was very high  i did finally figure out most things  but it was a frustration and equally as frustrating terrible as the samsung provided documentation is the usage of  basically  every app on it  there is no consistency with how they use the watch controls  there is no rhyme or reason about anything about this watch  and i literally hate it  right now  it is a very pretty watch that tells me the time and date and temperature  nice functions  for sure  but not worth       not even nearly worth that even more frustrating  though  is the battery life  they claim it is good for two days  i guess  maybe  if you literally do nothing at all with the watch  but i doubt it would last even close to two days even if you did that i wear it to bed    i like the sleep tracking    which means i have to charge it every single morning  everything about the watch is quirky  just as one  of dozens of examples   i turn my wrist to look at the watch  there s lots of pretty things on the display  but although i ve adjusted the time it should stay on  it is really short and i have to do it   or   times to see all the data on face    except when i m sleeping  i might roll over and it will light up really brightly and disturb me    and then stay lit for literally minutes i truly hate this watch      
113,5.0,                       i love how the samsung watch connects directly to my samsung phone  all my notifications come to the phone  but what sells this watch is the fact i could answer my phone and conversate with someone through my watch  i couldn t do that with my fitbit watch  only thing i was disappointed was the fact i m left handed and i wear my watch on my right hand  it did not ask me what side i use my watch on like the fitbit does  my only concern is that it could be missing some of my steps      
114,2.0,                       battery life is about   days  display looks nice and crisp  i like continuous hr   that s about it  software is really terrible  the worst part is notifications  i want to see the new notification when it s received without touching or fiddling with the watch   to add insult to injury after the notification is received  watch freezes for   seconds  nothing can be done  doesn t respond  also having to press the side button to go back instead of having a back gesture is bad ux      
115,1.0,                       this product supports apps  but almost nothing that you can t find on your phone  which is always on you and the battery life lasts longer on your phone pretty much all i do with this is wear it when i run to track steps and track my heartbeat note  i never have gps or bluetooth on and the battery barely lasts a day if you must get a smart watch  get something cheaper  they all pretty much do the same thing      
116,5.0,                       has alot more features than my gearfit   i like it a lot   has a lot more features apps  settings  and enhanced sleep workout tracker  even the band feels more secure and i purchased a  scrunchie  band for it i have a bumper and screen protector on it as well      
117,2.0,                       be careful getting this watch from amazon   i have been trying to get the samsung health monitoring app and finally had to use a link i found on the internet to get it    it should have shown up in the galaxy store automatically  first red flag    second  once i did get it installed  it did show up in my galaxy store apps  however the app would not find my watch   after scouring the internet trying to find a solution  i finally figured out the issue   so it appears that my software version shows an  xx  in it   after talking with samsung customer service that software version is an international version   the whole reason i got this watch was for the ecg monitoring that  at the time  was fda pending   so here i am a year later with a watch that will not work with ecg samsung health monitoring app   think amazon will accept a return a year later  i doubt it      
118,4.0,                       this is coming from a fitbit versa user  i m really loving this watch  however  comparing it to my fitbit  there s a few things lacking with the active   nothing bad enough to make me regret my purchase  but enough to mention and hopefully they ll improve with the next model   i already knew the battery life wasn t as great compared to the fitbit  i read that from many other reviews  i thought it would still be worth it  however  most reviews did not mention how awfully slow the charging is  which means i either lose out on my sleep analysis if i have to charge it at night  or miss out on daytime use during the day  the battery life wouldn t be as bad if it didn t take an eternity to charge back up    moving on  i wasn t expecting to need   apps on my phone  for all of my info  with the fitbit app  your health info  and settings about the watch  etc  are all combined in   very user friendly app  with the active   there s a wearable app to control the watch settings  and another  samsung health  app that pairs with the watch and that s where you find that info  not a dealbreaker  but something i wasn t expecting and not as sleek as being able to view everything all from   app to access   not to mention the extra storage that it takes up on your phone having   apps    also i ve found that with only the bluetooth option   at the time  i didn t think the lte was necessary   that my bluetooth range to keep my phone paired  is not far at all  with the fitbit i could be on the other side of my average sized house  still paired  with this i walk   rooms over and it notifies that it s out of range    the whole reason for upgrading was so that i could use my phone from my watch throughout my house yard  but i m not confident with this range  regretting not getting the lte for this reason   other than that so far i m loving it          
119,5.0,                       i love this watch    the only thing is the battery  it lasts for like a day if your getting this watch for workouts and your all motivated  and thinking that once you get the watch you will start working out  loosing weight etc  note that you ll fall out of the exitment within days    by getting used to the watch  but i still think you should order it  its a great piece      
120,4.0,                       i bought this over other watches because it claimed to have ecg  it does not  it also has not    detection  even the fitbit charge has this while sleeping  the vibration is not strong enough to notice if you are distracted which is disappointing and the battery sucks  the sleep data is wildly different then the data the fibfit shows  so i don t know which is more accurate   over all i feel disappointed in the amount i spent for what i got  its pretty though and i like seeing my daughter on the customizable face  use the heart tracking along      
121,5.0,                       this watch is so freaking amazing i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in contact when you don t have your cellphone on you cause the lte version comes in handy plus my son always has my phone cause he loves to watch videos on youtube all day but since i have my galaxy watch active   i can answer my texts messages and emails now with out taking my phone back from him cause  he doesn t understand all the time cause he has autism      
122,4.0,                       battery life could be better  i have to charge it in a day or two depending on what i have on  if i have it on power saving mode it lasts for a few days    at most  maybe   or   if no notifications at all whatsoever  i have always been with samsung for years  love the color  wish there was a better blue instead of cloud  pink is cute too  love being able to text on my watch without pulling my phone out  checking the time too  that is also important  big on me  really big  i can slip it off since i have small wrists and hands  it would be nice to have at least two more hole slots  i do like that the band goes inside so there isn t a flap always swinging around  the older versions didn t do that  a lot of functions on the watch that i don t even use  but it is cool that they have for people who do  love the background customizations  there are hundreds to choose from  free and paid  the charger is so nice and small nice  travel size  does not come with a charging block though      
123,1.0,                       buyer beware  not us version  false advertisement  no samsung pay enabled the box label with serial numbers was in spanish and was next to another label with the product information and said  us version   the device booted in spanish and changed to english after initial setup  according to samsung  the samsung pay app is supposed to open when pressing and holding the top button for     seconds  after several hours of researching why this was not occurring  i found out this happens if you have a watch from specific non us countries  amazon will not let me exchange for the same item  so i have to exchange for the lte version  which costs more money and with features needed in the first place  regardless of whether this issue is resolved in the future  i feel this   star rating is warranted for the unnecessary frustration  wasted time  and false advertising      
124,5.0,                       me and my husband have had this watch for about       months so far and its worked perfect    we bought    one for me and one for him  the heart rate monitor works perfectly  it automatically tracls if you re doing excersise even if you dont set it to do so  it s customizable and you can add or remove almost of of the features as you please  fits very well and the battery life  if starting at       lasts about   days with minimal usage and about       days with heavy usage  definately worth the money     
125,1.0,                       purchased this watch four months ago  and thought it was  okay   it sucks battery life and was constantly dying on me  even though i used minimal features to preserve battery life  finally  it completely died  i sent it in to samsung for service  and  after careful review  they determined the repair cost would be       what  they want more than i paid for the watch for the repair  what a waste of money      
126,2.0,                       purchased watch   months ago as my gear fit pro   had a cracked screen   the watch has an app that tracks swimming laps and time exercising in water   after   times in the pool the back cover came off and a few days later the watch stopped working   troubleshooted online and on the phone with samsung   shipped the watch back and a few days later samsung told me the water damage voided the warranty and asked me to pay      to repair it   a new watch only cost        this poor service from samsung is ridiculous   talked to   people from samsung and no one could resolve my issue with out paying for the repair   so frustrated   chatted with amazon about my poor service from samsung and they were able to help   i will always remain a loyal amazon customer      
127,4.0,                       arrived early and in very good  new  conditionwatch works well   everything i expectedthe     black  is actually chicago bears dark blue   wasn t expecting thatback button already showing signs if paint wearing lighter after just a few weeks of owning the watchnot as amazed by the electronic bezel as most people   but i have big hands fingers so that probably takes away from the  bezel experience the exercise apps require you move exactly as they require or you don t get credit for a movementoverall most readings are in the ballpark   not exact  but good enoughtoo many watch faces to choose from   and those are just the free ones no ecg reading available and this model of watch has been out for over a year   disappointingi went with the active      design over the galaxy watch    hoping for the best of both worlds   for the most part it has met expectations   some analog faces probably would look better with the support of the galaxy watch casing bezel   the digitals faces look very nicegetting about a day of battery life but the watch starts conserving energy at        so not actually a full dayoverall satisfied with the watch and it s capabilities so far     
128,1.0,                       had this watch for   months and touch screen stopped working  it basically went crazy  i returned it to samsung to fix it  and turns out the watch that is supposed to be used for laps in the pool is water damaged  guess what the warranty doesn t cover that and the cost was      so i basically throw the      in the garbage      
129,1.0,                       the watch states water resistant to  atm and safe for pools and salt water  i decided to check out the swim function put the watch into water safe mode and double checked that the water drop showed on the display  got into the pool and took   arm strokes then noticed the display was flashing   samsung galaxy watch resetting   i took the watch off and dried it  the flashing continued so i left it in the towel for   hours  when i picked it up the display was black when i got home i put it on a charger  it charged to       when removed from the charger the flashing continued for    minutes then stopped i researched the water resistant problems and found many who have had the same thing happen when attempting to use the galaxy active   for a swim workout  it seems that this is a common complaint  the watch is not water resistant as stated in the documtation samsung was called and they talked me through several things i d already tried  i got a shipping label to return for repair     according to them the watch had gotten wet add to that the warranty is invalidated if you get the watch wet  then the repair costs over      if done by samsung  a new watch costs between      and      depending on where it s purchased and ongoing sales the samsung service was no help  i was sent from one person department to another and the conversation went in circles  you got it wet i followed the instructions for water safe  but you put it in water  it states the watch can be worn in pool for swimming  but you got it wet and that invalidated the warranty  but it says i can swim with it to track a workout  you got it wet      i got the sense that each person was reading from the same scripted response card in short the watch should not get wet  it is not water resistant  and costs as much to repair as a new watch      
130,2.0,                       i purchased this watch   months ago  so i would consider it fairly new  so why does the back of the watch fall off   i m disappointed in the quality of the watch   this should not be happening   some kind of adhesive is used for the back of the watch and it appears that it just melted off   before this happened i really liked the watch  i guess i m buying an apple watch      
131,4.0,                       love this watch  it help me keep track of my caffeine intake and water intake  it tracks my sleep well  steps and bpm definitely can be used to set healthy goals with minimizing your caffeine intake and making sure that you drink at least   glasses of water per day      
132,3.0,                       samsung promised a lot of features on this watch  but failed to deliver as usual  those advanced functions requires samsung phone to work together  i still do not know why google email cannot be delivered as notification on this watch  you have to enable samsung text on your samsung phone in order to get text notification of course  if you want to receive notifications from non samsung apps  good lucks  it may work  but just a simple notification  most of time  it does not work  even a stickers or a gif in you chat app will not be delivered to watch samsung health is ok  but this is the part the samsung over promised a lot of functions and even it is there  it does not work well  i heard people with no samsung phone cannot even get these advanced health functions  i am not sure why samsung cannot put these apps in google play store instead  probably those apps does not meet google play store standard and tracking too  many person info which it should not otherwise  i upgraded it from s  watch so everything is good so far  hope samsung can make these health functions as it promised      
133,4.0,                       it looks great  just wish there were better apps  would like to see more fitness apps implemented  the battery life if you re not using it to workout could be like   or   days  i used the workout apps for lifting and running twice a day and the battery last a day  it feels really comfortable while working out  next generation should have a lot of potential      
134,3.0,                       i like this watch  doesnt come with the best instructions so i had to google most of the information on how to do some stuff with it  i guess i mainly use it for the time at work because idk much else  i can check my hr and stress levels on my note  and not sure how to on the watch  the band is good for all kinds of big wrist people  i m almost at the smallest it will go  guess i will have to do better research next time i make a big purchase like this  i like how amazon is letting me do installments though  that s the best part      
135,2.0,                       terrible battery life and constantly disconnects from my phone  very few apps are supported on the tizen software  which is frustrating  the samsung health app that it syncs with does not give total miles  just  average daily monthly miles  which is basically useless  i regret buying this watch and should have stuck with a fitbit      
136,5.0,                       so far i m happy with it  i have a really small wrist so i was worried the watch would look bulky  but i think it looks great   i got the   mm   i have an iphone so i can t answer calls or text messages from the watch  but i had a fitbit before this watch that didn t let me do that anyway  so i don t really care about that feature  you ll still get notifications that you re getting a call or a text message and it ll show you the message  i was just looking for a stylish  waterproof watch that would count my steps  and i don t like the way the apple watch looks  i like a round  classic watch the battery life is decent  i haven t had the watch die on me yet but at a full charge i get probably a day and a half of battery  of course  there are ways to save battery by turning wifi and bluetooth off  which is what i do  i just always charge my watch at night because i personally don t really care about how well i slept  the watch has sleep tracking   i ll know how well i slept when i wake up in the morning i also really like how the watch faces are super customizable and there are so many free faces to choose from the only complaint i have about the watch is that the bands that come with the watch are extremely hard to remove  i was chipping my nails trying to get it off  i have a leather band that i bought  not from samsung but compatible w the watch  and it s easy to take off when i want  however  the difficulty of removing the band could also be a good thing   as i stated earlier  i had a fitbit before this and the bands would break all the time so i could have lost my watch      
137,5.0,                       i m seriously trying to figure why i picked pink  or rather rose gold   poof that s why all in all i absolutely love it  i m almost ready to prefer it over my fitbit  only thing i love more is my fitbit aria scale which is no problem to enter into my health app  awesome for fitness challenges with my friends  love the fact that my watch face is now my baby s face  i love it         
138,1.0,                       the sleep tracker has never been accurate   it never starts recording until after midnight  the back sensor fell off after   months and i am told the warranty doesn t cover it because they say impact or water caused it  it was never dropped or submerged in water   customer service wants to bill      to fix the issue  if you do a google search  you can find countless customers facing the same issue  trying to avoid fixing an item that is still under warranty by blaming the customer shows a clear lack of customer service  i do not recommend this product and we will not purchase any more samsung products      
139,5.0,                       love my watch  unlike my old fitbit  i can read the watch in bright sunlight and wear it in the pool  i have a small wrist  but the   mm fits ok  it s nice to be able to answer a phone call on the watch when i am out walking  i wish the volume was a little louder  because it is hard to hear voices on the calls      
140,5.0,                       it is a great watch  i love the fit and i know the battery lasts about one day but that is because of all that it does  it may or may not be waterproof but i haven t risked it to find out  but does a lot  from checking email  you can text on it  i can call on it and was told it sounded like i was on my phone and not speaker  so great sound quality  you can use spotify by using your watch as a remote play to your phone  you can track your health and it has basically a fitness trainer in the watch so all and all there is a lot more but im happy with this watch  very good and very pretty pink      
141,5.0,                       the galaxy watch active   is one of the best purchases that i ve ever made in wearable technology  it delivers with more than adequate battery life  far superior comfort when compared to other products  a feature set that will appease most so called  geeks  such as myself  and the availability to add more features and or applications via the galaxy app store  the new customizable watch face feature makes the creation of customizable watch faces easy and simple  with just a snap of your clothing  and multiple watch faces are created for you that match your outfit  i also appreciate the much slimmer and sleeker design  when compared to the regular galaxy watch  with that  i can confidently say that  at least in my opinion  the watch active  is the most fashionable  functional and flexible   the three fs  as i call it    it is fashionable  due to its sleek glass   in my case  aluminum housing  and unobtrusive thickness that is no thicker  if not  thinner  than your average premium analog watch   it is functional  due to the fact that you have all the basic necessities that any digital watch should have plus  step tracking  workout tracking  heart rate monitoring  upcoming electrocardiogram capability  text messaging  the ability to accept  decline  and create phone calls  pay for things using samsung pay  find your phone  the creation and cancellation of alarms and reminders  the ability to check the weather  and have music playback controls  also including track selection   just to name a few   and i don t think i really need to explain why i think it s so flexible      and just to mention other things i love about the watch active   i love the touch bezel  which is much better than you think it is   i love the samoled display that by default automatically dims to fit the environment that it s in along with providing smooth animations  i love the now larger back button so you can tell that it s different if you re in the dark  i love the ability to triple click the apps home button to send a message to your emergency contact s   and so much more   now here s the part where i would usually explain the cons of the watch device  but there was an issue  i struggled to come up with any  i would usually have a very long laundry list of cons  but i really don t have any  the only part i can say is a con  is that some people aren t satisfied with the accuracy of the health tracking features  maybe it s just me  but i really haven t had any  the lack of feminine health tracking might be a con to some women  but i m not female  so    that doesn t apply to me    that s all i can really say   so in the end  if you are currently looking for a smartwatch to go with your android device  then i say you should absolutely go with this one  it has many a feature that the competition do not supply  has great battery life  a digital rotating bezel that is the best way to interact with it  a decent amount of customization  and health tracking that i believe to be accurate   disclaimer  i am not a health professional by any means  and therefore i am not the first person you should listen to when it comes to advice about health tracking   so  i say it is a very worthy purchase  and i am enjoying my time with it  leather watch band pictured  fullife hybrid coffee suede leather watch band  screen protector pictured  lk    pack  tpu      
142,4.0,                       when i got this watch i was impressed with quality and easy setup i have had it for a few days and i have not used the sleep tracking feature yet due to it needing to be charged overnight since the battery life only last about a full day of continuous use i do enjoy that i can check emails  play games  message my husband and make phone calls  all from my watch and with alarms  reminders  bpm  stress monitoring  and other health features it makes my day to day life easier my watch came in a day early which i loved   and my screen protector came in on time  but the watch i ordered for my husband was supposed to come in yesterday on the feb    th and now isnt expected to come till   pm on mar   nd it is a bit inconvenient  but i know the quality and different features will be well worth the wait      
143,5.0,                       now i have no idea what i did before i had my watch  i can t believe how much i use it  i was afraid that i wouldn t get enough use out of it based on the cost  however i work in a school  and am often using this to not only check the time  but i can also check my emails call or use my text messaging  it also tells me how active i ve been during the day  i definitely did my research before purchasing any watch  this was definitely the best one for any android phone  i also compared sizes and went for the smaller one  i am a female and the larger one looked too big for my wrist  but it can vary for others  i bought   watches  i especially appreciate how discrete they are when you are in a meeting  you can get important notifications without appearing rude      
144,2.0,                       using a pixel phone and galaxy watch active   bluetooth since feb       when the watch works it is easily a   star product pros  when you can maintain connection to your phone  watch is quick and fairly responsive touch bezel works well and does a great job style is great and you can add bezel covers samsung pay works well golf apps available and work very well  very pleasantly surprised by thiscons at some point in the last   weeks my watch has had problems maintaining connection to the phone and or apps  due to the lost connection  the watch constantly looks for a connections and lasts    hours most touch to wake and lift to wake are frustrating  often i find myself swinging my arm up trying to see the time only to find myself tapping on the screen   times to wake it up always on dislpay uses a lot of battery  it is also a bit misleading  if you set a timer with aod on  after inactivity  the screen aod will show the watchface  not the timer this watch would be     stars if the battery connection issues are resolved  the last   cons are a bit nitpicky but battery life and connection for notifications  etc  is what i bought this watch for  if it will not last a full day and have extreme trouble connecting this is an expensive piece of metal on my wrist      
145,1.0,                       within a month of receiving  the screen started going green as in the picture  the watch would randomly flash on and off all night  i could not sleep with the watch on i started charging it by my bedside at night  but it would wake itself up and flash thru apps as if it was being used   it did this every night  all night i started wearing it only during the day  but it continued to act up  difficult to get it to switch apps and it always randomly changed watch faces  i stopped wearing it and left it on it s original charger  when i would try to wear it  it didn t act right i always had to change the watch face back  fight with the apps to work  alarms going off when i never set them   really random stuff  so i gave up i left it on the charger for a couple days and went back to check it and saw that it was  rebooting     when i would remove it from the charger  it would have about     battery  even after days on the charger   a hard restart of the watch did nothing to change it i left it on the charger and when i would walk by  it was still flashing the  rebooting  screen  but never did anything from there  couldn t do anything with it  sometimes it wouldn t even turn on at all even after being on the charger i reached out to samsung and everything the tech suggested  i had already tried  so i sent it to them   mind you  at this point  i only had the watch for about   months   they send me an email stating that it is  out of warranty  and will cost         to fix    on a watch i just spent         to buy   no  thanks   i don t like it      worth   sure  i got a dud  but i won t ever be buying this watch again      
146,2.0,                       everywhere you read this is the best smart watch for android users  total bs  it may be if you have a galaxy phone  nothing works  you don t get the best features because you don t have a samsung phone  it keeps disconnecting from my phone  sometime it reminds me to stand up sometimes it doesn t  sometime you get notifications  sometimes you don t  after a couple of months the case is full of scratches  the screen is really tough though half baked  very disappointed  samsung probably got apple a new customer      
147,1.0,                       samsung won t approve my warranty  i have submitted proof of purchase   times  but they say it isn t verifiable  returning item today  not damaged  just wanting to register the item for the warranty so i m covered just in case  but they won t accept amazon purchase      
148,3.0,                       maybe i got a defective one   i ve used it for   weeks  and it s never seemed right sleep tracking is a joke   i usually read for an hour  or more  in bed before falling asleep  the watch thought i was asleep the whole time  every night   i wake up frequently  most nights  and stare at the clock  tossing and turning  it thought i was asleep the whole time  sometimes rem  sometimes deep   i got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and went back to sleep for   hours  the watch thought i stayed up  didn t detect those  hrs  even though it was within my target sleep window   constant heart rate reading is on  but it doesn t seem to make a difference stay active  move reminder  whatever samsung calls it  where it nags you to get up and move   nope   i watched a    hour movie and it never nagged me to move   several times   min after sitting down from being active for an extended period  it said i needed to move   and upon agreeing to do stretches or squats  it failed to detect my motion   upward stretch  torso twist  squats    the watch detected me doing   or    if at all   when i had done       slowly and deliberately  waiting  watching  begging for it to detect  flipping my wrist this way and that way    i m not a fit person  walking and stretching are my limit  at the moment  and i need the nagging to keep me moving   i m rather sedentary  i m trying not to be    but it only nagged me     times a day  instead of every hour for      hrs a day as i expected   yes  i can just set an alarm on my phone  or a kitchen timer even  but what s the fun in that i have nearly every permission enabled  except contacts  don t need any social junk thank you  for both the watch and the apps on my samsung s   but it just doesn t sense things like i expect it should  after many exhaustive  positive reviews i read  from many sources i was also disappointed with the bluetooth range   my house is small  but going from the kitchen to the bedroom it loses connection  too many walls maybe  but my bluetooth earbuds don t have a problem   so i still have to cart my phone from room to room while i m cleaning  doing laundry  etc   my summer weight pants don t have pockets  winter is jeans  so no big deal  but for half the year  i d hoped to not have to drag my phone around in my own house  the watch is beautiful  the build feels solid  the display is crisp and bright  and far more comfortable to wear than i expected  once i bought a few tapered straps to go with it    the apps  wear and health  are easy to use and worked seamlessly with my galaxy s    i am almost heartbroken at returning this watch  but since it just doesn t perform the way i expected it should  doesn t perform the basic functions i need  and makes me feel rather sick at the cost for not doing all it should  i m returning it   i may try another unit  but i feel a bit soured on it at this point      
149,5.0,                       this has got to be my favorite watch i ve ever had  my roommate who has an apple watch was jealous of how nice this screen is  the super amoled is beautiful  and the   mm is the perfect size  i really love it  beats any wear os smart watch on the market right now  i have a pixel   and it works great with it  i still can t over how good this watch looks  and the band is amazing too  i was going to buy a leather band for it cause i typically prefer leather bands but i think i m going to stick with the original  it s very comfortable and looks great  also i bought this used front the amazon wear house and it came in the original packaging with everything and looks brand new so i m beyond impressed  if you have any doubts buy this watch  trust me when i say it will be your favorite  cause it s mine  oh yeah and i get atleast   days of battery life even when i use it a fair amount      
150,1.0,                       sent it back   months in for a new battery   the screen went crazy    months in  they claimed water damage   they will not fix under warranty google  samsung galaxy watch active   water lock  and see how it s safe to go in the water first time i have been disappointed in samsung   have bought tvs  tablets  phones and watches      
151,1.0,                       update  since i have been using this watch there are major problems with it   the back sensor cover fell off with in    days of use   this is a very well known defect with this product   after hours on the phone with amazon and then samsung i was able to send it to samsung to have it repair for free   the process of sending my watch to samsung for repair was very fast and easy   the watch came back to me with in   weeks and it was repaired last week september  th       the exact same problem happened again   back sensor battery cover just fell off again   i called samsung and was got help from a customer service member pretty quick   the agent said my watch will be sent to repair department and a manager will call me to discuss the problem with my watch by either replacing it with a new watch or a full refund since this is a second service on the exact same problem   however  no one called me   they just repaired it and wanted to charge me     dollars for the repair which i did not authorized i called samsung immediately to let them know that proper communication was not provided to me from repair management team   i got the chance to talk to management expressing my concern about the watch   samsung will be providing me a new replacement watch   i just really hope that i will not run into the same issue again with a new unit   i really do enjoy having the samsung active   watch i might just trade in the new unit to the galaxy watch   titanium model launching in october   i will do some research about the performance of the watch   and if there are any on going problems with the new model i didn t really know or expect anything from this watch   since the quarantine i have been walking a lot and my phone was not always accurate in tracking my steps   this watch have help me really focused on my step counts and other functions such as water  coffee   not sure how accurate the sleep monitor is or the hear rate monitor  since i have nothing to compare it to   i enjoy this watch  i have not worn a watch since high school lol     
152,1.0,                       the design is nice    the weight of it is good  not heavy  the screen quality is has nice clear bright screen   but  my watch  brand new not refurbished  only   months old is constantly freezing  rebooting  and battery life varies  sometimes it go for   days  some    and certain days it will drain to     for no apparent reason  i regret buying this watch     especially for the price i paid for it  my last watch was an asus zenwatch   that never gave me these problems  the saddest part is the window closed for me to return it      
153,5.0,                       i  love  it      it s a dream at work  especially when i wear a dress and have nowhere to put my phone lol i can leave it at my desk and take calls and message remotely  i have the active face that let s me know everything at a glance even the weather and my steps on the same small screen      
154,3.0,                       seriously  no one buys a smartwatch and expects it to be a medical device  but the one basic thing it should do is accurately track things based off of the formulas i weigh     lbs  if i walk      steps  i should burn    calories  this watch says i burn     i have everything programmed and setup properly  but it does not compute the formula correctly  this is the most basic function  good smartwatches take your heart rate o  level gps speed into account to approximate burned calories  this watch does not seem to do that so it is really hard to get an understanding of your true active level above bmr  that is what i am looking for in a smartwatch  it s hard to recommend the product because of this app store is woefully small  samsung is gaining marketshare in the wearables space  so it would be really nice to see them approaching and paying for app development  no nest  no pocketcase  no automotive apps  fordpass   no audible  because of this  my phone has to be with me to workout  i d rather download a podcast and leave the phone at home fit and finish is very nice  i like the velcro bands and i have one coming shortly  i like the universal band style which makes it easier to swap  the digital crown is really nice and useful once you get use to it update         more stari just got my galaxy phone  there is a new setting in samsung health to track activity on both my phone and watch together  when enabled  i see activity numbers more in line with what my apple watch tracked  not   for    but better than just the watch alone  given these all can be off by as much as      i consider that a pass  however  it definitely shows that the watch itself is not a fitness tracker      
155,3.0,                       tl dr version  product only full works if paired with a samsung phone   the watch itself offers the basic features of almost any off the shelf smartwatch of today  for the price tag though  you re not buying any smartwatch  you re buying one of the only smartwatches for the android ecosystem that offers that ecg feature  that is what much of the marketing will inform you  of course  however  this comes with a very big asterisk  you see samsung is very happy that you purchased their watch  but they would be even happier if you also bought one of their phones as well  that is why they lock this key feature  and several other smaller features  behind an arbitrary software wall   i m sure if i was more tech savvy  or knew someone with a proper amount of coding knowledge there is likely a simple back door that would enable the hardware to do its job  all the components are there after all  but the simple answer for me was to just return it  i can t say that i m not disappointed  the product could really be something if the company in charge wasn t so underhanded   i know that many individuals say impotent statements such as this and it always sounds trite and silly to me  but for what it s worth  samsung i know you re intent was to force me to buy more of your products  but instead  i will do my best now to stay away from any samsung purchase  please try to treat your current customers better  i m sure many are fine people who don t deserve such dishonest business practices      
156,1.0,                       i realized after spending an hour with this thing  wasting an hour  more accurately  that it is not for me  uncomfortable and bulky on the wrist  can t imagine sleeping with it on and attempting to have it measure my sleep  wouldn t sync immediately with my phone  apps i wanted were an endless merry go round to download  watch sent me to my phone  phone sent my to the watch  i have to thank samsung  though  for giving me a revelation  i don t need another device that keeps my head down rather than looking up and out at the world around me      
157,3.0,                       still for early adopters   folks who like to play with new toys and tolerate unfinished software for indoors people    screen is beautiful  in low light and not usable on sun if you need check time occasionally   you would use pocket watch or smartphone if you need check time often    you would use wrist watch or smartwatch smartwatch without always on  requiring violent shake to turn it on for a few seconds   is something weird but the battery is tiny and with always on it runs just a day  so you need to charge it every night try to not leave the charger in a hotel room software is buggy   image shifts a few pixels when go between full brightness and low brightness  looks ugly the seconds hand moves smoothly in full brightness mode  and jumps by seconds in low brightness  very annoying      
158,5.0,                       i like the watch a lot   first time with a smart watch  i have a samsung phone so it was easy to set up  get a screen protector right away if you do buy the watch  i scratched mine within the first month  i will say it s disappointing that samsung health doesn t offer a hiit workout to choose  but they have badminton  i think  even yoga  i do like the automatic step detection and counting  but their workout tracking is off  i swam open water about for   hour and it said i swam a total of     yards so that s off by a lot  i also do a lot of jumping rope and the calorie count is off  but i don t care so much about that  i connect to the phone only a couple times week to save battery  i also don t have email setup on the phone bc i don t want the  notifications update on swimming  in order for it to track a swim workout correctly   you must choose lap or outdoor  it does track laps quite well  but if you kick with a kickboard  it doesn t track it  nor does it track one arm butterfly well  and once i selected outdoor swimming   it tracked it closely to a friend s apple watch      
159,2.0,                          mar    update  still like the function of the watch other than the fact after only   months of use the battery life has gone from about   days before charges to only about   hours with minimal use  knowing this  i would not have bought it            i ve been a huge iphone fan for years and also had the apple watch   with dedicated line to go with my iphone    due to frustration with not getting call and texts on both my phone and watch i decided to take the leap to android and traded in my iphone   for a galaxy note     and purchased the galaxy active   smart watch  st the pros for the watch  i found it to be a mutch brighter and easier to read display  i love how easy it is to customize the display and the huge range of display options  the battery life is unbelievable  i charge it about every   days which is longer than they advertise  the round shape i like better than the square apple watch in which i d always accidentally hit the side buttons if i bent my wrist to far back the negatives  it hardly has any compatible apps  or if it does  i haven t figured out how to get the same ones i had on my apple watch on my galaxy watch  i think the apple watch had a wider bluetooth range as it stayed connected to my phone throughout my entire home and my galaxy active   disconnected about halfway through my house my opinion  i ve had the galaxy watch now for about a month now and am still learning new things about it  i don t miss the apps that i had on my apple watch at all because i felt they were pretty worthless anyway and was easier to just use my phone  i think the galaxy active   is easier to use  my calls are louder and much more clear  my texts are easier to read and respond to  it s much more useful and fun  and its cheaper than the apple watch  i didn t get the dedicated line with mine but it is an option my wife stayed with apple and upgraded her phone to the iphone    and stayed with the apple watch  but after seeing and playing with my phone and watch  she wishes she would have gotten the same i m by no means anti apple  i for the  st time in a long time bought a windows pc and i don t believe it is anywhere close to as good as my mac or my macbook  but it will be a long time before i decide to try another iphone or aplle watch again      
160,1.0,                       has anyone else had an allergic reaction to this watch  both wrist have broken out since wearing it   it s crazy i love what the watch is supposed to do but having to charge it everyday makes you not want to use it the way it s intended   very frustrating      
161,5.0,                       this watch gives me everything that i wanted in a smart watch  i bought a cheap     smart watch off amazon  it was junk  i returned it and forked out the big bucks for this instead  i m glad i did  it has all features that anyone could really want  except for a good maps app maybe  but that would the only complaint  i got a variety of watch covers and bands to dress it up or down to go with whatever i m wearing  i m extremely pleased with my purchase      
162,4.0,                       gave   stars because watch is not lte  i guess i should re read prior to purchasing  you will need to have your phone near by for bluetooth or wifi service  however  i did not send it back  this is my first smartwatch so i wanted to give it a far try  watch is nice   sleek  you can also buy interchangeable as far as color faces  new wrisrbands ect   i do like that  all features like heart rate monitoring  sleep and workout monitoring to mention a few i love  it is convenient not having to pull out my phone to see a text or call coming in  this watch has grown on me  i ve had the watch for about   weeks and i m still learning better   new things about my smartwatch      
163,1.0,                       i purchased this watch in mid december for christmas  i ve worn the watch maybe    times max  never have i gotten it wet  today while sitting at my desk the back sensor part of the watch fell onto the floor  i was so pissed  this product is too expensive for this to happen with so little usage i told myself it s okay  samsung will honor this by letting me exchange  oh no no     i tried to return on amazon but i m   days passed the accepted return date  i then contact samsung being there is a warranty but nope  with defects their warranty is only    days  the rest of the warranty only covers software issues  so now i m stuck with this overpriced broken watch  thanks samsung for your outstanding quality and customer service  fitbit quality is better than this  i am so disappointed at how i was turned away by samsung and their lack of interest in resolving the defective watch      
164,5.0,                       i love this watch   i use almost everyday especially at work  i ve had no issues and i m currently even using it with an iphone that i ve switched from using a samsung galaxy  so i ve used the watch on both  of course watch works best with samsung but it s not bad with iphone   i just can t reply texts and such  less options to customizing   but it s okay with me   it still lets me know what s up       
165,1.0,                       tltr  false advertising   it s not water resistant  don t buy it if you re planning on living a normal life i have been a samsung galaxy phone user since       i used to proudly say that i hated iphones and samsung was better i bought this watch to complement my galaxy phone  i went running with it and tracked my fitness activities  i loved that i had whastapp and i received and response notiications  i compared it with my friend who had the apple watch  and although very similar  i thought samsung was better when tracking and responding  the calories seem to be off but it picked up my steps and activities even when i forgot the apps are ok  i sticked to the basic and i was learning how to use it  turning on and off notifications as needed and figuring it out  it takes a bit to get used to it it was all good until i mistakenly took a shower with it  the watch is allegedly water resistant and can track swimming  well  all false advertisement   after the shower the touch screen was messed up  i sent it to samsung as it had only been a few months  i sent it for repair   and i was expecting a quick fix  it was almost new  instead i received a      bill  mind you  ibought the watch for that amount  the reason  it was out of warranty because water damage  at this point  in tears because this was my birthday present   i called samsung  spoke with a nice lady but nothing was done  it was deemed and so was i clearly samsung doesn t care about its customers  but i m moving on  my new appliances will not be samsung and my next phone will either be an iphone or a google pixel  i m very dissatisfied with the product and with the brand update   they called me and offered me to repair it for      ultimately i m pissed but i paid it  i m still mourning      
166,1.0,                       the watch is branded as ip   however  there is no possibility to claim warranty with samsung if there is water damaged  it doesn t matter if you never submerged the watch in water  i spend   month claiming the warranty but it wasn t possible  plus  the reparation cost is impossible  just     less than the watch new for a lower price you can buy a nice huawei sport watch with the same samsung warranty anyway  if you still want this watch i recommend you not to use it for any water related activity   even when there is a swimming mode           
167,4.0,                       bought this to replace my fitbit blaze  which had cracked across the screen for the second time in the years that i had owned it   apparently the blaze design has a weakness in skew flexing of the housing  so far i am liking it it does have some problems and drawbacks battery life   so far it seems like it is about the same as my old blaze       days  i m still playing with some of the settings which i m sure will impact battery life such as the wifi being enabled disabled app   fitbit has samsung stomped on this  they have a single app  for this device you have to have the gear app plus the samsung health app  really   stairs   if you re looking for something to count stairs go find a different product  this thing not only doesn t count stairs accurately  it rarely if ever counts stairs  not a deal breaker for me but a lot of people have complained about this and none of the  solutions  work   the documentation hints that it takes climbing     feet to trigger one  stairs  count but a lot of people say even then it doesn t count  the only thing i cannot comment on yet is an experience with riding a motorcycle  the fitbit would count thousands of steps and hundreds of flights of stairs while riding but i have not ridden since getting this  i ll look to update once i have and can see what happens      
168,5.0,                    apenas me llego de usa a colombia  pero llego en tiempo record  es genial el servicio de mensajer a que amazon presta para envios internacionales   felicitaciones        
169,5.0,                       this replaced a fitbit ionic which i really liked  i really wanted a smartwatch just to use for notifications and catch calls when i couldn t hear or feel my phone vibrate  this watch has worked flawlessly for that  i also like the selection of watch faces in the samsung app  there s probably thousands to choose from  i can get through a couple of days on the battery without a charge  it s also very comfortable and light  one neat thing it does is when you receive a text and you turn the watch toward you it will automatically show the text message without having to tap or swipe the screen  i really don t have any negatives to say about it      
170,5.0,                       i bought the all black version of the samsung galaxy watch active     i wasted money on an extra watch band   i didn t need it because the band that comes with the watch is perfect   comfortable  waterproof  and looks nice   i read reviews that said this watch was almost as good as the galaxy watch    and that has turned out to be true   this watch is much less expensive and works just fine   setup is very easy using the galaxy wearable app on my phone the coolest feature is the ability to answer phone calls on my watch  and it works really well   also  i like the hourly chime  which my last smart watch didn t have   my first experience with a smart watch was the moto         that didn t go so well   i ended up returning it and got this one instead   i am really happy with the decision  as i love this galaxy active   smart watch      
171,4.0,                       full suite of features that work very well  i track hr  sleep and stress full time  has an emergency feature to notify one selected person of where you are at all times and if you ve fallen been in an accident  if this function is active  it uses gps on watch and this kills the battery life  i only turn on for bike rides  be prepared to charge  x day  with hr stress sleep and gps turned off   i charge  x day   and  x day    seems to use less battery in my case when adjusted pretty snug  yet still comfortable  on wrist  very wide selection of watch faces and color combinations to customize as you like  samsung needs to allow gps readings from connected phone when bt or wifi connected to conserve battery  since there are quite a few negative reviews as to water damage  i have chosen to not even test this  closest it comes to water is handwashing and sweating  and i haven t used the water setting yet   the charging dock is a good design and magnetic so it doesn t require delicacy to get watch on dock  does take       minutes from dead to full charge  i use a samsung fast charger   if you have a samsung account  when you first connect and activate watch  warranty is already in place on your account  overall very useful for my needs of hr tracking  star removed for poor battery life when desired features are used and inability to use gps from connected phone   for clarification i have a samsung note    it should be easy to make gps connection work at least within their own lines  if not all android platforms  it is comfortable to wear and not over sized    mm model  on my wrist  i will stick with the band supplied as it is supple and the excess tucks underneath instead of over and a loop to secure  definately better than leather or metal choices in my opinion      
172,5.0,                       the watch is simple and easy to navigate  all smart features are awesome  battery life is good as well can last at least   to   days depending on the features  i have wifi turned off because i do not need it  some of the features i never used turned off as well  that gave me at least   days  even with all features turned on  it will still last you at least a day and a half i returned the other smartwatch because of battery life but this one is perfect for me      
173,2.0,                       i was very excited about my watch for about the first   months  and then it started  acting up   it would not hold tracking a workout  when i started the workout tracking it would last at best   mins and then just stop  i contacted the service people and they suggested a factory reboot  i did that and it worked for about another month and then the same thing started happening again  this time maybe even worse     at times it won t even hold the tracking for    secs  all the other features are working fine  but not this one  i am very disappointed as i really like tracking my hr and mins of a workout  not sure what i will end up doing  likely seeing if they will make good on the warranty      
174,4.0,                       i like this watch better than my gear fit     larger screen more memory and options   good battery life but less than advertised under normal use i get about    hours   takes some time to recharge   no charger plug  is bs   found the band uncomfortable and ordered a metal band       
175,5.0,                       i fell in love with this watch as soon as i saw it  it s simple  classy  and not too big in diameter  the band is a soft rubber which doesnt rub against my skin or move around  everything about this watch is beautiful  however  you do have to download the app to your phone  for me  i particularly like the features of digital    hr clock  heart rate tracker  stress measure  texting with voice  timer  steps  and weight management  there s so much to use on this watch  happy with this gift      
176,5.0,                       i was wanting a more robust smart watch to replace my amazfit  the galaxy active   watch is exactly what i was looking for  it looks nice  not to large  ordered the   mm version   and has so many bells and whistles for the money  the fitness tracking is great  i love the way it integrates into their app  setup was super easy  the notifications are great  it s nice to get get sms  email  weather  and app notifications at just a swipe  there are also some great screen protectors out there that cover the entire face of the watch so you can change the color quickly and not worry about scratching the watch  i now have gotten into creating my own watch faces with the samsung watch maker app  it is so simple to be able to upload a new face to fit the mood      
177,5.0,                       i had the galaxy gear fit and just upgraded to the active    this watch does everything my old watch did  enhanced   the fact that i can wear this swimming the lake this summer is worth every extra penny paid   if you re into having a fitness watch and you want the samsung  pay the extra dollar   you will not be disappointed      
178,1.0,                       i really wanted this watch since i have a samsung phone  was hoping for fitness tracking  and some other options  however every time you add an app  the battery life just drops further and further   i had to take off all the cool watch faces as i had to recharge every day now  about   months later  the battery will go from      to dead in     hours   with nothing running  maybe i have a lemon  but i have not been impressed      
179,5.0,                       i have been looking for a smart watch that is somewhat small  the active   comes in a   mm size  although still a little bigger then i wanted  the round face helps the size seem smaller  the active   paired seamlessly with the s  phone  the apps connected with the watch are easy to use and can be rearranged and removed or added depending on what you want  the watch faces are customizable so you can make the phone fit your style  notifications are easy to receive and answer  the active   also has lots of accessories like watch bands and screen protectors  i would recommend this watch      
180,4.0,                       i really like the watch  i am still learning how to control the mobile app functions so it doesn t spit out my battery time  i put a pic of a measuring tape on my wrist along with the    mm watch so y all can see what i couldn t prior to buying it   the size of the watch on my small wrist  i sleep comfortably with it  heart rate is in line with what my fitbit  was   sleep tracking is as well  the main issue i have is the step count is about     low  i have a short stride  due to physical issues  and there is nowhere i can find to manually enter my stride length to get an accurate step count  so i just reduced my       step goal down to      steps per day  if i ever figure out the samsung health app  i ll amend my review  if you run the map my fitness app with the watch  it counts the same exercise  in my case  walk  twice on the samsung app  the stand alone spotify app completely shuts off when you get notifications  i will get accustomed to the watch and learn as i go as there is no instruction book   only the internet   sometimes it is easier to flip pages rather than hit the back button   just sayin      
181,5.0,                       this smartwatch is sooooo much better than the fitbits that i have bought   used in the past  the mobile app is not very desirable  fitbit mobile app nicer   but the watch does way much more than the fitbit  the run time on one charge could be better though  my fitbits could run   maybe   days on one charge  while this watch runs   to   days  depending on what you are using on the watch  on one charge  however  with all the stuff this watch does  i don t mind charging it more often      
182,5.0,                       i got this for a birthday gift for my boyfriend   he loved it  the mobile app is easy to download and use  the text message feature can read the message out loud for you   he is an electrician and is often in cramps spaces or on a ladder so these features help him stay notified and safe      
183,1.0,                       bought the watch thinking it d work on a normal android device as advertised but the samsung health app has an issue where you login only to be greeted with an infinite loading screen  samsung knows about the issue but their only solution is to  clear the app cache  which didn t work  community solutions ended up being download an old apk which shouldn t be a solution due to security risks from downloading apks from a third party   there s no point in owning this watch if i can t have any of the data properly saved and tracked in app  why even have the app available to download if it isn t going to be compatible  returned  samsuck      
184,4.0,                       i love this watch  great purchase  it does everything i need it to and more  i highly recommend getting a screen protector or case because the watch face does stick out so i have scratched mine already  i did expect more from the battery but it does pretty well  it will last for        days  i wish it was   so i can charge it at night and not worry about it dying on day    but i think i have too high of expectations haha  i highly recommend this watch      
185,1.0,                       my active   watch stopped working after one week   the watch reset and would not  re  pair with my phone no matter how many times   the watch is not qi compatible   it would only charge with the charger in the box and would not wireless charge with my samsung or  rd party wireless chargers      
186,2.0,                       part of the reason i got this was so i could better see my schedule while at work without getting my phone out  i m in a lot of back to back meetings    but  there isn t a clear way to switch the calendar from the google calendar to another server  in this case office        sending my work calendar to my personal google calendar would not only be a security violation at my work  but would clutter up my personal calendar with work crap   will probably return the watch   a google search wasn t helpful      
187,5.0,                    llego en perfectas condiciones  lo amo  es mi primer d a con el y la verdad no soy de reloj inteligente pero este me encanta  despu s les contar  como me va con el  sobre la bater a y las otras aplicaciones  bueno ya tengo   dias con el reloj  cada dia aprendo m s de el  es muy  til y facil de usar me encanta  la bater a le dura   dia y medio  carga rapido  y es muy bonito  ya tengo una semana con el y estoy enamorada de mi reloj es parte de mi           
188,4.0,                       a like the samsung active    looks   and could and  display  was extraordinary   i cycle and walk  count daily steps    while cycling the samsung recorded miles cycled and would also record steps as if i where walking   i wore a my garmin vivoactive   and the same time  heart rate and sleep monitoring where about the same    the samsung would better account for long breaks in sleep    i would have preferred the samsung except it didn t provide the promised ecg monitoring so i returned it to amazon within    days   i am considering purchasing the samsung watch   in the future   for ecg  i purchased an  omron complete   combination ecg   bp monitor   that works well for ekg   since using this device on daily basis i am doubtful as to whether the samsung watch ekg would benefit me measuring  my type of afib    the battery life was terrible      
189,1.0,                       the international version does not allow samsung pay  item is mislabed and should be corrected  very frustrated      
190,2.0,                       bought the watch for my wife  she s using it for three months now the good watch looks really great and has a good build quality loved automatic activity detection there s a feature that will push drops of water from the watch and it actually works the bad number of steps can go out of sync between app and the watch  the most weird thing is that the app in such case will show more steps ux when doing custom activities is weird my wife was able to enter some sort of weird engineering recovery mode without her user settings recovered automatically within a couple of hours  a lot of other minor bugs as well the ugly after the last ota update from the mobile app  watch wasn t able to boot  fortunately i was still able to reboot it by long pressing home key while samsung support forum advised to bring watch to qualified technicians overall i m very disappointed with the software on this watch  it has a ton of bugs and strange design solutions  i would be able to tolerate the latter but the software just doesn t work reliably      
191,1.0,                       the only good thing about this watch is the battery life  after using it for a few weeks i realized the watch is horrible at tracking steps  tracking exercise and tracking calories  if the window wasn t closed i would return it   my roommate has a fitbit and comparing the    that seems worth the money      
192,5.0,                       great battery life so far and the size is just right at   mm  the first active watch was a little small   one thing to make sure is if your phone has the latest version of android       released in september       the samsung watch app that goes on the phone doesn t work with android    yet      
193,1.0,                       as the title says  went swimming and the watch stopped working  sent it back for warranty and they deny it arguing liquid inside the watch even when it s all over their marketing material that it s rated for  atm  buyer beware if you plan to go into the pool remove the watch from your wrist  it s sad because the watch can track swim so their software is designed for water but their hardware is not waterproof      
194,2.0,                       i use to have a fitbit versa and moved over to the samsung active   watch  i ve had this watch for about   months and the only feature that seems to be reliable is the samsung pay   sleep mode is not accurate  battery life is horrible and it fails as a fitness tracker  if you want something that will track sleep and fitness don t buy this watch      
195,5.0,                       i have this smartwatch for almost a week and it is great  even i got the bigger   mm it is light weight and super comfortable for exercising  i dont have a big wrist but the   mm fits perfectly  the heart rate monitor is accurate  the resolution of the screen is amazing and using the touch sensitive bezel makes navigation easier the active   works perfectly with samsung phones  i have a note     it syncs quickly with the health app and the galaxy wearable app the only bad thing about this watch is the   days of battery life  but it s still better than the apple watch s battery life      
196,3.0,                       it has all the basic features you d expect of the smart watch like heart rate monitor  being able to take or make a call  calculate burned calories during workout  etc pros   it s reasonably priced  i paid      for   mm bluetooth model which is noticeably cheaper than apple watch series    yet i hate to admit it  but it s not as good and convenient as the apple product   light weight  i don t really notice its weight on my wrist   battery life is decent for it s weight and size  usually lasts me around   days   nice looking design   colorful and bright screen  the resolution is a bit too low though  cons    very limited apps  it s not an android the watch is running on  so there is a very limited selection of apps that you can use  most of which you also need to pay for    no notifications for apps like viber  telegram  messenger  skype  probably because there is no app that can be installed on the watch   you can read text messages and outlook emails  not gmail emails though  perfectly fine  the problem is i can check my watch for all notifications and think that i ve read it all  but i still could have a missed message on viber on my phone  and the watch will not show it    selection of workouts is not as good as on samsung phone even though it should be the same health app    low resolution screen  you could definitely see pixels on the   mm model screen  i guess i just expected a little better from the company that has the edge in display manufacturing  it s not terrible though  you can still read all the texts perfectly fine    blood pressure monitor is a joke  it s very inaccurate and only can be used as a toy    sometimes the watch lags a little bit  not to much  so not a big deal    bixby is okay  but not as good as siri or google assistant overall it s worth the money  but don t expect it to be as good as apple watch   series which was released at about the same time      
197,1.0,                       the watch was advertised to be able to use it during the swim  i used it a few times and the watch stop working  i sent it for repair and i was told that my warranty is voided because of the water damage   the malfunction watch allow the water to get inside and now i am responsible to pay pretty much the same price as the cost of the new watch to be able to repair it  i m not spending that money   i am not buying anymore of samsung products and if you are looking for something that you can use during swim do not look at samsung watch because their watches are not good with water and it s not just my opinion  if you look at the reviews you can find a lot of similar complains online      
198,1.0,                       it s a stunning watch  i was really excited for it  i had a apple watch series   before this and only sold it and switched because i went to a android phone  i literally began thinking once i really figured this watch out and it s lack of capabilities and inaccurate step counting    why the heck did i ever even switch phones  honestly this doesn t compare to a apple watch  i expected to much of this watch and it actually made m realize i needed another iphone so i could get a brand new apple watch  i sent this and my android phone back and when pack to apple products  now if you have never owned a iphone or apple watch and don t have anything to compare this too this may be a great option  but seriously if you ve ever had a apple watch there is no comparison  hope this helps someone      
199,3.0,                       from the moment i opened my  new watch  i questioned whether i had received an  almost new  item   the inside packaging where the charger was housed appeared to have been previously opened  i shrugged it off as   maybe a quality check   i then powered on my  new watch     the screen instructions were in spanish  hmmm  that s odd  for that to be the first language displayed  so i accepted the reality that this was probably a return  i didn t really feel like going thru the hassel of a return  so i completed setup and immediately fell in love with the watch itself  the fit was perfect  set up was easy and the hardest decision for me was  which watch face  i liked best  then  two days later as i sat in the bright sun  i noticed for the first time deep scratches on the edge of the dark screen  that was the final straw  this  return  was getting returned  the   star rating is for amazon sending me a used item as new  in their defense they have said they will send out another one immediately  i will revisit my rating when it arrives      
200,1.0,                       worked flawless for   months  then one function after another stopped   returned it to samsung for warranty repair   samsung said it was the motherboard and operating system problem   samsung would not cover it under warranty due to water damage   i never had this watch in water and besides it is supposed to be waterproof   also be sure to check other buyers with this exact same problem   should be a class action lawsuit against samsung buyer beware     
201,5.0,                       i love this watch  i purposely waited a while to write this review so i could use the watch and i love it  im not an excercise person  but still love the step counter and bpms the watch provides  i use the timer often too  ive talked on this watch and ive been told the clarity is great  texting is hard to do  but i like that i can get texts  i would recommend getting a face protector  i had hit it a few times when i just purchased it  lots of great choices on amazon to dress this watch up  the band is comfortable  i got it dirty while working outside  easy to clean up too  the watch faces can be changed and personalized which is fun  overall i love this watch      
202,5.0,                       well  just received this watch yesterday before work  it s very comfortable to wear  this is my second smartwatch since       most definitely a huge step up from my fitbit  so many ways to upgrade this smartwatch  i m very happy so far with my decision  almost forgot to mention i d purchased this as a bundle  so it came with samsung galaxy buds plus  not bad price for what you get      
203,5.0,                       i love this smartwatch  but   i had a fitbit versa prior to getting the samsung galaxy active     i could go    sometimes   days between charges   in my first few days of using the galaxy active    i had to recharge it less than    hrs after giving it a full charge   i did some research as to what i could do to prolong the battery life   when i made a few tweaks  i can now get almost   full days out of each charge there are so many ways to customize almost everything about the smartwatch   find what works for you and it will be your favorite as well      
204,1.0,                       at first the watch was great  i will say my first complaint was the battery life was horrible  i say was because i have returned this watch i noticed after purchasing this watch the the step count was never correct  and the battery life sucked  literally   having worn this watch daily for almost   months i started having some issues with my left arm with pins and needles feeling from my elbow to my finger tips  i didn t think anything of it  i just figured my shoulder or elbow was out if place  i was wrong  i took the watch off to charge it one night and realized the issues went away  i tested it out again after charging and the issues returned  i thought the was no way possible my watch could be causing this  i turned to google thinking i wouldn t find anything about this and i found page upon page of complaints with this same issue  and they weren t all with the active   watch  it was across the whole watch line  since taking the watch off completely last week i have noticed some other issues i was having going away  my heart rate has even dropped back into it s normal range  of course these were all issues on my left side since that s the arm i wore the watch on i m not sure what the deal is  or what caused these issues to happen with my watch  all i know is i am glad i figured out there was an issue with this watch  and that my issues are now fixing themselves people purchase these types of watches to track our health and activities  not to cause health issues  be careful with the samsung active        
205,4.0,                       good watch   only thing is the battery sucks really bad and only really lasts for maybe two days if that   and it takes a while to charge   i had a fitbit that lasted for almost   days before this one that was much cheaper   other than battery being retarded   it s an overall good watch       
206,1.0,                       the watch was great except it is not waterproof or even water resistant and samsung does not stand by its warranty   i was floating in my pool with my   month old watch when it died   samsung wanted      to repair it  claiming water damage      
207,4.0,                       gotta say as a samsung product user i was pretty pleased with this smart watch until i went to the gym today and found it can t track you for bench press or lat pulldown exercises  at all and as an athletic male late   s i do those alot    safe to say i was disappointed by that and deducted a star  no other issues besides that if i find more issues expect more deductions in the future      
208,1.0,                       product worked ok  golf app kind of a pain as you have to pair with your phone and also cannot really start it until your on the first tee which holds you and your playing partners up  after   weeks wearing  and not even every day  i started to get an irritating feeling on the top of my wrist  after looking closer there was a small burn hole directly below where the heart rate detector is  its been   days and the sore is still healing  i dont have the box anymore so now stuck with a      paperweight  do not recommemd buying this watch      
209,3.0,                       for a smart watch it is good  notifications  apps  and ability to store music is nice  but it does not accurately track steps  calories  or stairs flights  it only notifies you if you have been in active for    minutes  no reminders about steps per hour or ability to set it up  very disappointed considering its supposed to be a fitness watch  that being said for a smart watch its good but not fitness      
210,2.0,                       tl dr i loved this watch until i wore it while wading in the water and it broke   samsung said that water damage voided warranty   now i m buying a garmin   didn t last a year i bought this watch  the   mm version  over   months ago and loved it   i m a fairly loyal samsung customer so it seemed to fit nicely with everything   battery life was great  if i did not use the  always on  i could charge it while driving to from work and keep a full charge easily   notifications were great  it meant that i could keep my phone on vibrate and not fear missing a message   i rarely used many of the  smart  features of the watch   i tried using it to reply to a message a few times and it did not work out well  but i did not expect much either as far as fitness tracking   the sleep tracking was interesting  i found that it tracked the duration of time i was asleep relatively acurately  although it could get fooled if i was just laying in bed quietly  but would sometimes catch my afternoon nap too and include that   no idea about its accuracy re  rem deep light sleep  but i wouldn t put much stock in it   step counting was great   i loved using it for workouts i loved the vibrating alarm clock   maybe a stupid thing to love on a smart watch  but it vibrated well enough that it could wake me and not my wife   pretty awesome as i said  i loved it   i wore it nearly always   i never took it off in the shower   i swam in it a few times without problems   the product is reportedly water resistant to   m   it advertises swimming tracking for heaven s sake   so one day i waded in the ocean with it on  not thinking twice   emphasis is on wading   barely submerged   afterwards it began to malfunction and eventually died i sent it back to samsung  however after diagnosing it they informed me that water damage is not covered by the warranty   i think that this is incredible   if the product is used within its advertised limits  they ought to repair it   however  such is not the case since it did not even last a year  i will not be purchasing another   i m looking into garmin products  and hope that they will last  unlike this product      
211,5.0,                       this is the best watch i have  i love my watch so much  i m literally wearing my phone  i pay with it  text with it  call  track my steps everything i do with my s   i do with my watch    days  of battery life  easy to charge i am ordering different color bands too  i cant imagine life before my watch  it s beautiful with so many clock faces and background choices  by the way  it charges on my charging pad also    brilliant        
212,5.0,                       great watch  i wanted to get this mainly for the health features like the ekg  ecg  blood pressure  fall detection  i read a lot of reviews that mentioned ekg doesn t work  please google and do the required update in the your phone s wearable and samsung health monitor app for ekg  ekg ecg works great blood pressure monitoring works great as well once ypu set up with the mybplab app  i have a samsung s    not a tech savvy person  and all yhe features works perfect except blood oxygen on the watch   that being said my phone can measure blood oxygen so i am all covered  very happy with purchase        
213,5.0,                       i had to get one for myself after i got one for my son   it can answer texts or calls or make them  voice texting is easier than trying to type it in  because it uses the old style texting   letters per number  it tracks your steps   exercise  you can download apps you like to use with it on it  works great to track your sleep quality also  i love it      
214,3.0,                       the speech to text is horrendous and rarely understands me  i said probably and it added promenade   not very good at tracking what s most likely the word we are looking for   it s texting is alright at best but it consistently doesn t know what an a or e are   i ve talked to friends who have other galaxy watches and they re experiencing the same thing   looking like its just samsung   i would recommend buying a different watch because even the auto exercise tracking hardly works   it s better than no watch  but not as good as the more expensive ones i m sure      
215,4.0,                       i decided to switch up my iphone x for a samsung galaxy note     therefore rendering my apple watch useless  i can honestly say i don t miss my apple watch very much  i use this watch primarily for fitness purposes and so far i am really enjoying it  it is comfortable  stylish  and i like the round shape a lot better than the iwatch  the iwatch used to hurt the small bone of my wrist because of the sqaure design  the only reason why i am rating it   stars is because it bugged out when i was first setting it up for a few hours  mainly because i started a watch software update accidentaly during setup  the screen basically went black without any response  i honestly was upset  however i was able to reset to factory settings and i have not had any issues ever since      
216,2.0,                       i hope you really love samsung if you buy this watch  because that s all you will be able to install on this watch there is no app store and no apps from google can be installed on it and for music you better use spotify because i was not able to install any other app either like apple music or deezer  so no music downloads for you unless you use spotify oh and do you want voice assistant  here you go  use bixby and only bixby  the only way to use google assistant is to use a third party and giving them access to your google cloud services  so no thanks if you re really a samsung loving guy go ahead  you ll love this watch with a lot of un installable samsung apps  otherwise just get a wear os watch or a simpler hybrid watch      
217,5.0,                       my question was if the   mm would be to big and bulky on me but i couldn t help but to get the bigger size even with my small wrist it looks a bit big but it doesn t feel like it on my wrist  its super comfortable and if you are worried like i was     don t be  the    is nice       
218,5.0,                       i was worried this would not work with my lg phone but it worked for mostly every function   i could not read sms messages but i read and replied the facebook messages through it perfectly fine   also  the call function works great   the music output it good   i thought it would be too bulky  but it is super cuter  i have no complaints the heartrate monitor on it is good for anyone wanting to keep up with their heart rate   this was my primary reason for buying it   step counter is also great the app   it works on lg   i have had no problems whatsoever i feel more motivated with this watch   way more than i did with other top name brands   highly recommend this      
219,5.0,                         i love this watch  not only does it give me all the notifications that i want such as facebook messenger  texts and phone calls  but it keeps track of all my exercising  i swim and not only does it give me calories burned information  but it keeps track of the minutes  seconds  and laps  love it  i can t recommend it enough  oh  and at the end of my swimming sessions  it  spits  the water out  buy it  i was not not disappointed       
220,5.0,                       let me just say how excited i am about this watch    i have been wanting it for a long time and i finally got it yesterday and i m so in love     it is great  i went for a walk today and it tracked my entire steps and actually motivated me to keep going  when i stopped moving it asked me to keep moving  i love the different faces and i made a call from it  i haven t tried the sleep tracking yet  but i will  it did measure my heart rate  which i thought was pretty cool  i know i have so much other things  to learn and i m looking forward to learning them all       
221,5.0,                       this is my first smart watch ever  it s an excellent watch functionality  esthetically    practically  i am happy with my purchase  battery life is more than enough for me  i usually place it on the charger every night or every other night as a habit   not because it s running out of juice  the heart rate measurement is surprisingly accurate  it matched the reading done by the nurse on a recent doctor visit  one limitation is that i can t get an ecg trace yet awaiting a software update  also  the free watch faces are limited  samsung should make more available overall it s a great purchase      
222,5.0,                       tap payments with my phone and controlling my smartthings devices are really cool  my biggest complaint is sometimes it will randomly start some swimming calorie tracking and it won t let me cancel it  i ve found the only way to get out of it is to click the button to expel the water and then finish and save the workout  maybe there s a way to delete it in the app afterwards but it s really annoying that it starts in the first place and that i can t just cancel it      
223,5.0,                       love this watch  it works well  i got both the   mm and   mm for my partner as a christmas gift  he loves his watch and it basically stays on his wrist      unless he is showering or charging it  it does a great job at tracking steps  heart rate  and is a great little gadget if i want to check the weather or take a quick look at my messages but i m not by my phone  it has a good sleep tracker that i would say is     accurate  i like it as a way to keep track of my health and fitness in one hub and that i can sync it to more than one app      
224,2.0,                       maybe i got a bad one  i don t get many notifications or walk around much since i broke my spine  but after a couple weeks of owning it  not doing much of anything  it uses     of battery life within about    hours  it has run out of battery in less that    hours  it does what it supposed to do   so i ll give it that  but for     bucks  less than a day of battery life isn t worth it  back out goes  feel free to find mine as an open box  like new  repackaged  discount for probably     or so  i wouldn t recommend      
225,3.0,                       after  upgrading  to the galaxy active   from the fitbit versa  it has been very disappointing  the decision was based on connectivity issues with the versa  the versa would ve gotten   stars when new but ended with      that is neither here nor there for this review  the active   looks great  has a traditional round watch design  and is a great sleep tracker  the number of watch faces available is very nice and will probably meet most everyone s individual tastes  the step tracker does not seem to be accurate  i have not measured it but it seems to under count steps  the user interface is where this watch is very disappointing  the touch screen is slow to react so at times it is hard to tell if it will respond or didn t get the touch command  it is also easy to inadvertently go into various aspects of the watch by mistake  half the time the screen won t wake up without tapping it even if you roll your arm like it is supposed to  the battery life is fair and will regularly last   days between charges but i am a light user and do not run a bunch of apps through it  the slow and nonreactive at times ui is the reason this only gets   stars instead of   or        
226,5.0,                       i bought this for the heart rate monitor  and the ultimate selling point  the ambient light sensor being able to see the display outdoors in the sun is very helpful pros way too many to list them all  but i ll call out a few ability to answer calls when hooked up to one s phone via bluetooth ability to use the watch as a speakerphone when answering said phonecalls ability to control music playback  no it does not matter what app one uses for playback so many watch faces and customizable ones at that  that its seriously not funny expandable capabilities  simply add the requisite app to the watch cons the wrist band has a tendency to get slick with sweat and feel all scuzzy and slimy in humid weather  a more breathable band would have been a better choice than this tpu polymer band observations depending on how often long you have the display active and what features you enable  the battery will either last barely a day  or many days i ve gotten almost five days on a single charge repeatedly you will spend days just playing with it  learning what all it can do  and i havent even touched on the fitness features packed into this watch expensive  but worth the price      
227,3.0,                       i would rate this watch between a     to    it has great features for receiving notifications and using your voice to reply back to messages  what it truly lacks is tracking your workouts  it does not have all the workout features that you would find on samsung health on your phone  if you do kickboxing  hiit  etc then this is where the watch is useless  it can not track any of those and using the other workouts is a joke  if you are looking for a watch that can track your workouts then look at fitbit  garmin  or apple  you would think that samsung would want to compete with apple and offer all of the options that apple has but it has failed hard  so before buying this watch you need to consider what you are going to use it for  i hate having to wear my phone to be able to track my workouts      
228,5.0,                       looking for a smartwatch at a reasonable price  well  what are you waiting for  this smartwatch checks all the boxes at almost half the price of an apple watch and as someone who has used both  i would go with this one  both the built quality and software is one of the best on the market  and the price is more than reasonable  the apps available on the phone and on the watch itself is more than enough to satisfy your needs and the many customizable factors of the software is amazing  as someone who prefers to pay for products that can do more for a lesser price  i mean  who doesn t    i would go for this watch even as an ios user  plus  it looks amazing as well  if you re torn between the galaxy watch   and this  i would go with this one and probably wait until samsung releases another watch that is far ahead of both just like i did  don t hesitate and make your purchase especially on the sale price right now  and you won t be disappointed      
229,1.0,                       do not buy this product again for those in the back do not buy this product samsung advertises this as a waterproof smartwatch    there is even a swim mode for lap tracking and the like  however  after being in the pool with mine for   minutes  it locked out and shut down  completely unresponsive to touch  charge  or any button pressing  soft reset   when you call customer service  their response is  no electric device is truly waterproof  so since you admitted to getting it wet  it isn t covered under warranty   when i asked for a supervisor  i was hung up on  do not buy this watch  or frankly anything from samsung  i am appalled at the complete disregard for a customer spending hundreds of dollars on a watch that lacks basic functionality which is literally advertised directly on the box thankfully amazon values their customers and is processing a refund for me  a clear example of a company standing by what they sell  and a stark contrast to the complete disregard samsung has for customers who have already handed over their money  i have to say i will never purchase another samsung product  if it doesn t hold true to basic functionality which is clearly stated on the box  i can not trust anything they say for their products going forward      
230,3.0,                       watch is nice big for a lady  good size for a guy but it is not lte stand alone like it said it was  this is bluetooth only  returning it      
231,4.0,                       i like this watch  it is not a fitbit which does well at tracking health and activity  its a smartwatch trying to be a fitness watch  however it does its best at both  with future updates i m hopeful   i d recommend  as it does what its supposed to except floors  still doesn t work      
232,1.0,                       this is my first smart watch and tbh i think spending over      for a watch is very expensive let alone     ish   so i thought i would give it a try because i needed a decent watch that had silent alarms and can give me notifications  just as an fyi i work in an office and i am not that active so i thought this watch would last two days for sure  here are my experiences on      life without changing the settings  out of the box  it was really bad  lasted a little longer than half of a dayon      life changing all the settings to off or minimal  some you couldn t turn completely off and using the battery optimization tool in the beginning of the day  lasted about a day in a half maybe if i was lucky  i literally was using it as a watch that was it no calls or anything   i am currently having it returned because i cannot do anything on it without the fear of the battery running out less than what was stated and thus not a fun worth having for a      watch     it just isnt worth it  a friend recommended me to go for just the basic older version samsung smart watch  it is bigger and bulkier but if it allows me to use it without having to worry every half day that it will just loose all the battery then i am willing to make that compromise      
233,5.0,                       i bought the   in version and the watch is perfect size  not too bulky and comfortable to sleep with  sleep tracking is decent but there is room for improvements  i use it with always on hr  aod  location and notifications activated and i usually charge it for about an hour every morning when the battery is around        but it can last two days if i forget to charge it overall  the watch is not perfect but it s definitely very  very good and i m very happy with my purchase      
234,5.0,                       honestly  i love this watch  the demands of my job have changed and i was tired of beating up my rolex at work  so i bought a smart watch to wear that i wouldn t mind taking some of the daily abuse that i put a watch through  i love this watch so far  i did not know how much i could love a watch again  there are a lot of reviews on poor battery life  the only way i could see the battery life being an issue is if you are constantly fiddling with the thing  when worn for watch purposes and checking various things throughout the day  i would estimate that the battery would easily last for   days  if you are looking for a watch with a purpose  this is it      
235,4.0,                       really nice watch for notifications from your favorite social apps when you re not right next to your phone or your phone is on silent  however  as far as fitness tracking is concerned  this is not it  the calories and steps i ve taken that it tells me are way off compared to the new fitbit on my other wrist  which seemed away more accurate and help me adjust my macros  the sleep tracking is okay  but i also prefer fitbit s version over this  a couple things i do like about this watch though are how i can use it as a remote to take a picture on my phone  control spotify while i m working out  and have simplified gps instructions always on my wrist whenever i ask for directions on google maps  this watch is pretty much good for everything except for a fitness tracking  hopefully samsung will release new software that incorporates the heart rate sensor into calculating calories and steps and catch up with fitbit in the fitness realm      
236,4.0,                       i am coming from using fitbits for a while   i am not hard core athlete or anything and do not need to gps track workouts  but the watch tracking my activity is just as good as the fitbit   i actually think the heart rate tracking is better possibly   fitbit seemed too low on average   i have the   mm version which seems bigger than i thought and thicker  so soo glad i didn t get the bigger version smartwatch features are great   like to answer and talk on the watch and text i was used to the decent battery life of fitbits  usually around   days   this is   days for me   i charge it every two days   there are settings that would make it longer  like one that turns off the constant heart rate monitor   then it lasts a lot longer   and there is a setting just to use it as a watch and nothing else  that gives you like    days removed one star because of battery life      
237,1.0,                       it s fine if all you want is a smart watch that does sleep tracking   but if you expect accurate heart rate readings  forget it   as soon as i start exercising  my heart rate rapidly climbs to way higher than normal   i can put on   of my   other heart rate monitor and get much more normal readings   i have been using polar products for decades and they are superb at heart rates   but since i have a samsung phone  i thought i would try this  i will not make this mistake again   stupid me  i waited   days too late to return it   i am terrible disappointed at this watch and at samsung      
238,5.0,                       i read reviews  i disect them  then i make a decision  althought there are pros and cons to everything  this was worth the risk  the only  issue  i ve had is that the watch will sometimes unlair when streaming netflix or another movie app on my phone  the way i fixed it was to delete the watch from the app and repair it  haven t had any issues since  everything works  i absolutely love it and when this one does eventually  because it will  i ll but another at that time  the pink band doesn t get dirty or look dirty  the watch itself is sturdy  i ve hit it a few times on accident  no dings or scratches   if you re hesitant  just take the leap and try it  i d you don t like it then you ll know when you find the right one      
239,1.0,                       buyer beware  bought in december      and died overnight in march        black screen   won t even turn on   not the charger as icons pop up for   sec and dissapear   contacted amazon who promptly connected me to samsung  now i have to send the watch in for diagnostics  so in all i will be without my warch for several weeks  wish amazon would take responsibility and just replace it instead of passing the buck   definitely not buying samsung again      
240,3.0,                       beautiful smartwatch  nice bright colors has everything you d want in a smartwatch  unfortunately the fitness side of this watch not what i expected  floors climbed count is terrible  i climb    floors per day usually this watch records   at the most same problem i have with a   year old galaxy watch  fitbit charge   records all floors climbed   i thought by now they would have corrected this issue  many comments on user forums and google about this issue with no clear fix  heart monitor can be wildly off  lucky to get   days on battery  sending this watch back  no sense having   similar watches  have original galaxy watch  with the same problems      
241,1.0,                       if you want all the bloatware imaginable on your phone  by all means buy it  if however you want a functional smart watch with more than just some fancy custom dials you can buy  look elsewhere      
242,1.0,                       first off  the activity tracker does not use heart rate to track calories burned so your numbers will be way off  second  the watch was eight months old when the back fell off and samsung pay started giving it seizures  sent it in for repair and the said the watch was out of warranty because it had water damage  yeah  the back fell off  how do you think water sweat got in  i did not swim with or shower with it  the estimated repair cost was as much as buying a new one  for a watch that you are supposed to be able to swim with how can you void a warranty from water damage  what the actual f     i spent three hours in a excruciating seventh level of hell with their phone support trying to receive assistance only to be disconnected  upon reconnection  no one had logged any of my previous interactions and could not help me as the service order was cancelled  i used to be a big samsung supporter  and i will never buy another one of their products  save your money and buy something else      
243,3.0,                       just wore my watch while on my sole e   elliptical  i was on level    for    munutes  my elliptical said my heart rate was     and i burned     calories  my watch said i hit     bpm max  average was     bpm and i burned     calories  i believe the elliptical because it accounts for body weight and the amount of friction it is set to  not saying i don t like the watch  just don t trust the calorie burn      
244,5.0,                    generalmente he tenido smartwatches m s econ micos o manillas y me han cumplicado bien  esta vez me fui por un smartwatch m s costoso en b squeda de una mejor experiencia de usuario y vaya que lo he conseguido  mi rese a est  siendo hecha usando un mate    pro y un reloj bluetooth  depende much simo del smartphone para funcionar    pantalla e interfaz  muy buena pantalla del reloj  excelentes negros  much sima variedad de watchfaces para elegir  muchas de ellas personalizables y la interfaz de usuario muy r pida y con excelente respuesta  este es uno de los puntos donde muchos relojes quedan cortos  ya que suelen laguear o quedarse pegados en ciertas labores y una de las razones por las que decid  irme por este    notificaciones y respuestas  este era el punto m s importante para m   yo quer a s  o s  ver las im genes y stickers de whatsapp en el reloj  porque infortunadamente  muchos de mis contactos env an todo el tiempo ambas cosas y escriben cada vez menos  por lo que ya estaba aburrido de tener que sacar el tel fono en la calle para todo  en este punto muy contento  el sistema de notificaciones es un poco diferente al de otros relojes  pero me es muy funcional poder ver las im genes stickers emoticones con muy buena calidad y poder responder ah  mismo en el reloj  el teclado es similar al de los tel fonos de antes  por lo que para m  resulta c modo  para la gente m s joven seguro que no mucho  y las respuestas r pidas son personalizables e incluso permiten emoticones  as  que ayudan mucho  el reconocimiento de voz s  me parece malito en espa ol  poco funcional  solo  til para frases muy peque as y no con lenguaje coloquial  las notificaciones guardan un historial  por lo que muchas veces uno ve la conversaci n y no solo la  ltima notificaci n y me gust  mucho que si me llega una notificaci n y levanto la mano para ver el reloj  este  adem s de encender la pantalla  abre autom ticamente la notificaci n  as  que ni siquiera tengo que tocar el reloj para ver lo que me escriben  estos son los detalles que marcan diferencia     llamadas  he hablado un par de veces y muy buena experiencia  de mi parte extra ar a un poquito m s de volumen  pero realmente tampoco es importante  ya que la idea tampoco es que todos escuchen de qu  estamos hablando  con el volumen que hay se escucha muy bien  si usas auriculares  como yo  hay siempre una opci n en el reloj para intercambiar entre el audio mic del reloj con el tel fono  para continuar la llamada desde los auriculares o desde el tel fono con mucha facilidad     mediciones  tiene de todo  las cl sicas ritmo cardiaco  pod metro  gps  sue o  vo  max  estr s etc  pero tiene otras medidas que yo no hab a tenido antes como  ecg  electrocardiograma   bp  presi n  y alt metro  toca bajar la aplicaci n  no viene preinstalada   es de aclarar que el ecg y el bp  para m  que no uso tel fono samsung  sino un mate    pro  result  un poco  tricky  activarlos  pero gracias a xda pude hacerlo y con muy buenos resultados  tambi n es importante dar a conocer que el bp es un lab hasta donde entiendo y que toca calibrarlo con un tensi metro real cada   semanas m s o menos  as  que igual  toca tener el tensi metro en la casa  la ventaja est  en no depender de  l en todas partes    multimedia  solo uso spotify y recomiendo mucho m s usar el widget default de samsung que el widget de spotify  adem s de que el default funciona para cualquier aplicaci n del tel fono que reproduzca algo  funciona mucho m s r pido tambi n  la app de spotify de mi parte solo me resulta  til para buscar la lista que quiero escuchar  porque tampoco me deja elegir canciones  esto me hubiese gustado ver las canciones  pero bueno  tal vez eso ya es mucho pedir     bater a  al igual que los relojes de apple  son los tel fonos con la  peor  bater a  sinembargo  coloco peor entre comillas  porque para el poder que tienen  antes me tiene super satisfecho el tema de la bater a  en mi caso  lo necesito para el d a y para   solo d a voy mucho m s que sobrado    detalles buenos y cosas no muy buenas      no es multimedia pero me sorprendi  tener un cleinte para openhab en la tienda de galaxy  ya que con eso es que controlo la dom tica de mi casa  adem s de los asistentes por supuesto       no todas las aplicaciones est n disponibles para mi pa s  muchas veces la aplicaci n se ve desde el navegador del pc pero no es instalable      el procedimiento para activar el ecg y el bp no fue dificil para m   pero para muchos usuarios va a ser problem tico      tener que recalibrar cada   semanas el bp no ch vere  pero bueno  es lo que hay      en mi caso tuve que instalar todo un arsenal de aplicaicoens para que corra bien  y digo  corre super bien  no se me desconecta nunca  se me reconecta f cil  no he perido una sola notificaci n  pero vamos  tuve que instalar galaxy wearable  samsung services  active   plugin  samsung health  samsung health monitor  ecg y bp  y si le sumo navigator pro para gps  siempre son bastantes  aunque en general me parece que funciona bastante bien porque no comen tanta ram como cre   es bastante decente en consumo de recursos as  que el celular no ha sufrido en nada pr cticamente         
245,5.0,                       been wearing this daily for   months now    as a smartwatch skeptic  and collector of traditional watches  i pulled the trigger on it as a whim  the more i wear it  the more useful it is  the ability to access messages  emails  and notifications in public without whipping our my phone has been a ton more useful than i could have realized it s a beautiful little piece of tech  intuitive to use  and pretty good looking to boot  i didn t purchase it for the fitness functions  but as the months have passed  they have turned into data points i reference daily frankly  a smartwatch is still a luxury that really only excels in specific use cases  but i ve found myself using it constantly      
246,2.0,                       i like the look and function of the watch  love how customizable it is  however i am very disappointed with the battery life  even more desapointed  with samsung claims that it last up to   days   with very little use and most notifications off  i m okay if it lasts   hs  for this reason   i cannot recom end it      
247,4.0,                       i bought the galaxy gear fit several years ago and decided it was time for an upgrade  i like the fact that the charger doesn t require you to take off the band like with the gear fit  and the battery life has been great so far  the sleep tracking is extremely detailed as well which i enjoy the only thing that i m not a fan of with this watch so far  is that the step counter is not accurate in the slightest  my job has me on my feet for     hours at a time  and i m usually running around like crazy  but the steps don t go up   after four hours on my feet at work last night the step count only went up by about      and as a waitress i know that wasn t anywhere close to what i had actually walked so far  after a little research it said that your arm has to be swinging while walking in order for the steps to be counted  which sucks when your arms are full and you re carrying things alot of the time  in my case plates   drinks at work   so in order to get a more accurate step count i have to keep my phone on me as well  which i don t care for  i got this watch mainly because i wanted to keep better track of my steps   activity so the fact that it doesn t track my steps accurately is a huge bummer      
248,1.0,                       this watch cannot handle moisture exposure  and forget getting customer service at samsung to help you without charging you   do not take this watch in the pool at all  it is not waterproof  the advertising about it being able to handle water up to  m for    minutes is wrong   my watch started rebooting after a run  and samsung told me that i damaged my watch    all because i sweated on it   a cheaper fitbit is much hardier and will serve you longer   i am soooo disappointed with my whole experience with this watch   i ve bough samsung phones for years  even own the s    but i will never own another samsung product as long as i live over this incident of a      watch      
249,2.0,                       the only good thing about this watch is the screen  if you don t own a samsung phone  the watch s advertised features and functionality will be crippled  samsung launched the active   with spo  pulseox sensors enabled  then removed them from the app  samsung requires multiple app downloads to use the device  and the apps are a buggy mess  the rotary touchscreen concept is brilliant in theory  but samsung s user interface makes the watch difficult at best  while android users will have slightly better luck using the watch for messaging  iphone users should avoid this sloppy product altogether  additionally  as noted in numerous other reviews  samsung s warranty support is negligible and the company rarely honors claims it stands behind its products  apple and garmin  while higher cost up front  offer far superior products that will stand the test of time      
250,5.0,                       love this watch  battery time last much longer than my fit bit  it remind me to get up and move just like the fit bit but   feature i love the ability to not carry my phone and reply to my texts and read them oh my goodness  can even seen pictures on the watch  not like my fit bit couldnt only get texts coulnt respond  i m still learning more on the watch not enough time to sort it out  but i have heard so much great news about it  get the bigger one the    mm that battery last longer  i got a screen protector for it  that helps  so far i m pleased    enjoy your time piece when you get        
251,5.0,                       great smartwatch  i used to own the grear s   this is a welcome upgrade  i avoided getting a new one because the previous samsung smartwatces were simply too big  this one is a about the same size and the new software does make a huge difference      
252,1.0,                       the device does not calculate calories burned correctly   i contacted the company and they acknowledged this is an issue   i find it absolutely unbelievable that they just released a fitness product that doesn t correctly calculate calories   it s absolutely mind boggling   it s such a shame because this watch is awesome for everything else   i have had samsung phones for years   i was so excited to try this watch   one would think that if active was in the name  it would work as a fitness device   unreal here is a snip from my chat with the first samsung rep me  i just got my new active    i love it so far  however  the calorie count for workouts is very wrong  when i researched a little bit  i found that this is apparently an issue your company has had with several of its watches  is there a fix for this       amsorry for the experience  unfortunately for now the bug isn t still fix after expressing disbelief  she passed me to the next rep me  so  you re telling me you released a fitness product that cannot correctly calculate calories       ami m sorry for the inconvenience caused       ambut i want to inform you that we have no such reported issues yet   which is opposite of what the first rep said and is proven to be false for their watches as you just have to google calorie count issues and samsung to see all of the complaints  this was horrible   i might actually have to switch to apple products which makes me want to puke do not buy this device unless you don t care if the fitness information is correct funny note   when i got a copy of the transcript emailed to me  they deleted the part where their employee said they were aware and it was a bug   just mind boggling      
253,1.0,                       basically a really expensive watch  the calories are way off  and you can t even go in and change them  the sleep tracker is way off  the app is terrible  i switched from fitbit because those are guaranteed to break after a year but this thing has no good specs  worthless      
254,1.0,                       while i had the watch  and it worked  it was a nice watch  i liked a lot of the features  phone locating  notifications  sleep and workout activities  etc   however it requires you to download multiple apps on your smart phone  which i wouldn t have minded  except the watch apps would malfunction and bluetooth on the watch connecting it the smartphone would stop working and i had to reset the watch on a regular basis  finally the watch has actually had stopped working  it is still under warranty  yet samsung is refusing to repair it unless i pay almost as much as the watch currently costs  claiming the water resistant watch has water damage  i have never taken the watch into a water environment  not showering  nothing  so this is rather upsetting  i owned the watch barely   months  overall this ended up being a very expensive failure of an item and i do not recommend      
255,3.0,                         times now this watch is stuck in a  reboot  loop  this is very frustrating and not reliable  trying to get to talk to someone to get help is ridiculous update  apparently the watch i was sent is an  international  watch and the samsung number i was given to call by amazon could not help because they don t have the parts to fix this  i am on the phone with amazon to have it replaced with a new device  nd update  amazon came through with a replacement which has been working great so far  when it works  it s a fabulous watch      
256,2.0,                       what quit charging in less than    days   sent watch in for repair   response was watch part not available so they would refund   i bought a new watch and did not get the refund   called them back and they said they had repaired the watch where would i like it sent to   i wanted the refund since they originally stated this was all they could do and i now have a new watch     weeks later still trying to get resolution      
257,1.0,                       i hate this watch with a red hot passion   the apps are good this thing buzzes whenever it is untethered from its phone   i eventually had to turn off the watch s vibrate feature  i would argue one of the most important since i don t want my watch making noise every time i need a notification   i tried numerous fixes and called customer support the durability is excellent because i have several time taken it off my wrist and beaten it in frustration i bought this to pair with my samsung phone and will by neither phone nor watch from them in the future      
258,5.0,                       i like the product  unfortunately  i did not receive the gift offered for the present order   i am happy with amazon not to keep their credibility      
259,5.0,                       a little over a year ago my daughter love her to death but in a samsung j  prime for one of our friends who didn t actually need a new phone  about a week ago i was informed that my old samsung phone and i mean really old would no longer be supported by my cell phone service  during that time everyone has laughed at me for having such an old phone  but i loved the phone and rarely used it  during that time my husband got an iphone and my daughter gave him a watch that works with it  so thinking that i should probably head into the current century by two but the active to watch that pairs with the samsung phone  i was a bit hesitant initially because i was unable to find any information telling me whether or not the fun that i had would pair with the watch  i did a little bit of reading and went ahead and ordered the watch anyway  suspecting that if it didn t pair with the phone i could at least use it without the phone i am not in anyway a techno geek  but i was able to charge the watch  and the samsung wearable app was already on it  so i followed the steps to pair it with the watch and presto change oh within an hour after starting i was done pairing it and putting information into it that is synchronized with the samsung fitness app which i also was able to download without any kind of hassle  so for all those people wondering if it paired with the j   yes it samsung wearable app was already on it  so i followed the steps to pair it with the watch and presto change oh within an hour after starting i was done pairing it and putting information into it that is synchronized with the samsung fitness app which i also was able to download without any kind of hassle  so for all of those people wondering if it paired with the j   yes it does  i did however add extra storage space to the phone and toggle it to move most of the information into the sd card  i don t know if i explained up properly but initially the phone that i had when it started the pairing process said that my phone didn t have enough storage  but i discovered that i hadn t turned the phone on so it couldn t really pair with it until i turned it on but then after i did magic occurred i did some adjustments on the settings  and slept with it all night and in fact it did track my sleep  the watchband is very comfortable  but i did notice that the one that i bought had a pretty large band on it so i have it on the second tightest hole  the nice thing about the band is that it tucks under the other side of the watch band after you have secured it on your arm  so there s no need really to adjust the band  at least for me  it did track my sleep it does seem to track my activity levels  and the steps that i take and i also track my food intake anyway and so the app actually takes care of that so i don t have to write it down in a journal i gave it a fivethe other side of the watch band after you have secured it on your arm  so there s no need really to adjust the band  at least for me  it did track my sleep it does seem to track my activity levels  and the steps that i take and i also track my food intake anyway and so the app actually takes care of that so i don t have to write it down in a journal i gave it a five for durability  not so much based on the fact that i have had to watch for a little less than    hours but because based upon the design the size the watchband it appears to be made so that it is durable  at least enough to fool a first time buyer  i have yet to discover how to use the voice to text on it  but i am receiving emails weather reports and other things that will probably take up too much of my personal time  but overall it seems to be working quite well and i am impressed because a non techno geek like me was actually able to pair the watch with the phone and carry on without the stress or grief or regrets that i purchased the watch so my daughter was pretty impressed that i was able to do all of that all on my very own  so i guess i m living in the new century now linked to my cell phone as though it was an appendage of my body and wearing a synchronized apparatus that is being worn on an appendage of my body update  so sad to report the watch is in the watch hospital for the second time  i was able to over time use most functions  but i live in a two story home and it wouldn t count floors  i tried everything on line  then the non techno geek in me finally called the company  we tried everything  which included a lot of running up and down stairs so in it went for a replacement for the altimeter  it didn t work after they returned it  i could tel the didn t functionally test it because there were no stairs counted  i called again  same thing  tried all the settings  up and down the stairs swinging arms  now the bad part is that i live in hawaii and they don t cover mailing  it s a bit expensive  all told  the customer service is good  polite  knowledgeable etc  i asked them to be sure to test it functionally before they send it back  we ll see  i have a sleep disorder and it seems to track my sleep  heartbeat and activity level  but one of the main reasons i bought it was to track how many times i trek up and down the stairs  it s been gone over   weeks now  so i hope they got it and fix it or give me a new watch      
260,4.0,                       so originally i was going to get a wear os ticwatch s  by google and mobvio because wear os looked appealing and whatnot and it seemed convenient  originally i bought a pretty lackluster fitbit versa    the tiny screen  lack of apps and mediocre health capabilities and their os was just not doing it for me at all  i returned it and got my money back and spent just a little bit more to get this one  i should note that even while the fossil gen   was on special for prime day i still ended up getting this one  the   mm  the samsung os  apps  albeit a bit lacking in amount   battery life and overall performance and look    i m extremely happy with this one  the truth is that while some watches over      have everything in it  built in gps  nfc  etc  this one has it for just a bit less than your other watches that either have   or the other or none at all  i was genuinely surprised at how it performed and just how many features it had on top of everything  built in speaker  yes please  waterproof  um duh yeah    mm screen  interchangeable bands and accurate health data collection on top of gps and nfc  it s a no brainier honestly some smartwatches are just glorified watches with a few gimics and no real value  if you buy a fitbit you re not necessarily buying the product for the device itself rather the fitbit os and app that comes with it  meanwhile you buy this watch and it s almost like you re buying a mini phone because of all the features and necessities of a smartwatch and a health tracker  as much as i didn t try the fossil gen  and gave it a chance i really don t regret it as i m quite happy with my choice especially with my samsung galaxy phone that pairs even better than expected and i wouldn t get that with a fossil or diesel or ticwatch i was looking at  if you re worried about battery life like i was wary before buying you won t really have a problem with the active   as it charges extremely fast with my anker charger and if you tweak your settings right the battery should last you     days no charge  just lower the brightness as much as you can and keep it so it s active only when you touch it and the battery should last as advertised the watch itself is a bit heavier than the fitbit i tried however the band is really comfortable for prolonged use and i have no problem sleeping with it  also if watchfaces are your thing don t buy them from the galaxy store and whatnot use the facer app and you can get some pretty cool premium looking watch faces for free or less than      that are interactive and adaptive which is pretty cool thing i discovered  what else can i say  if i had a couple cons to this watch it d be that you d probably be happier if you have a galaxy device beforehand maybe i m not sure how well it might perform without a galaxy phone or that not all of my cards worked with samsung pay  maybe also that app selection is a bit bland  however still better than fitbit not sure about google wearos  overall i m pretty happy with it  if you re looking for a pretty nice all around watch this is probably the one for you  there are still many features i ve yet to figure out and it feels a lot like my phone on my wrist  i can think of a lot of cool things to add like a blue light filter but i figured that if i mess with the visibility accessibility setting i can reduce the amount of blue light given by changing the screen color opacity to orange because you can do that and deactivate it during the day but i would like something like that anyways if you got this far  this watch is excellent and definitely in the top         smartwatch lists  right up there with the fossil gen  or the garmin active and others      
261,2.0,                       i ve enjoyed using this watch for the last few months  it s a clean and simple interface   helps me check my notifications without pulling out my phone  allows me to check the time and weather at a glance  tracks my steps  and quickly set timers for various tasks around the house unfortunately  all of this is marred by very poor support from samsung  as a current example of the problems i ve had from that side  the samsung wear app on my phone indicates that there is an update for the watch and it needs to update it  however  every time it tries  it fails to transfer the update to the watch  it continues to retry doing it  and while it is doing that  it fails to update other apps  fails to reliably push notifications  and continues to drain the battery of both the phone and the watch it has been this way for a couple of weeks  and there isn t even any recognition that this is a problem  the samsung community boards are filled with complains and no responses  i would not recommend this ecosystem to anyone at this point      
262,5.0,                       love my watch  its amazing  tracks literally everything  the battery life isnt the best though    days max but i can power it off for an hour or   while its charging and battery life is full again  be sure to order us version not international version if you want samsung pay      
263,5.0,                       i been in the club smartwatch for a long time and has always look for watches that combine style with functionality  and this perhaps the best one in the market  i love all all the fitness tracking integrated into the watch and the bevy of options in the app  i also love low key stylish is  i bought multiple straps to take advantage of the classic look  battery life is impressive with being able to last up to   full days after full charge  although i m sure that if you change the modes you might be able to get up to a week of battery life  i m really love this watch and you can buy with confidence knowing that this is one of the best pieces of technology in the market      
264,1.0,                       update   after the back fell off for the umpteenth time with no hope of staying in place  i called samsung for repair replacement   after finally getting an unpleasant service rep  i was informed that to get service for the watch they would need a credit card number   i asked why i would have to pay for a defect in manufacturing and was informed that i m sol unless i wanted to give a card number   i informed the unpleasant person that i will not do that and i will also never purchase another samsung product probably ignorance on my part but my text messages don t show up on the watch   i am able to accept or decline calls on it   the fitness features are pretty good but could be accessed with a much less expensive watch   changing the watch faces is fun and you can download holiday themes or even a photo   as far as durability  the watch face has two deep scratches and i ve only had it for three months   i was wiping off the sensor part of the watch and the sensor piece slid off      i replaced the gasket and the sensor but i m now worried about wearing it if i m going to get sweaty and isn t that the whole point        
265,5.0,                       i own everything samsung  except fridge  hotpoint    sound bar  jbl  it s a beast    i really like samsung just about everything  this band is no exception    light  clear large screen  take calls  make calls  text  track steps  store pics  samsung pay  sleep tracker  contacts stored  even give yourself an ecg       battery lasts     days on a single charge too      my gf has a fitbit charge  and she is super jealous of my samsung now       totally worth the           range price tag imho     
266,1.0,                       this watch is not water resistant  do not buy it  terrible customer service  don t buy samsung watch  back  button stopped working while under warranty so we sent it in for repair  it was diagnosed as  out of warranty  for having water damage   on a water resistant watch   that was used as specified  their customer service was useless at explaining how water damage could void the warranty and refused to do anything about the      price tag on repairing the watch  unacceptable      
267,5.0,                       love this watch  i think it s the best on the market  i d have a few other active watches and one other samsung watch  classic gear   but this by far is the best  i use it most to track my bike rides and hikes  had it on under my gloves for kickboxing kept track of my workout  also been in the pool with it for about   mins still works fine  definitely does a good job with sleep tracking i like the feature and help me decide what new bed to get  then the battery  for me i noticed i can go  days nearly without a charge  but of i m getting a lot of notification or after a long bike ride it cut that time in down  i used my phone to wirless charge it and it worked fine  overall i love this watch     
268,5.0,                       has an ecg sensor  electro cardio gram   yet samsung neglects to release an update that enable its use  at the very least samsung could be more hands on and let the general samsung consumer and buyer know of any future up dates planned that will eneble us to make us of the ecg sensor  thats the only reason i bought the active watch   and so far many month have passed since it release no update and even more so not even a wisper of one releasing any time in the future  if they would notify us of anything in the works    im sure that would satisfy most us average samsung consumers  and there are a lot of us out there who opt in for samsung devises exclusivle  love ya  but also a little disapointed on that      
269,5.0,                       really happy about this purchase  up until this point i was turned off of previous android smart watches due to their bulk  this watch however  is low profile like the apple watch and has a bunch of features  i went with the   mm and think there s a perfect amount of screen real estate to navigate      
270,1.0,                       does not synch with gmail or messages with google pixel    basically the only two things i actually need do not work  been trying all day  if anyone has any solutions please let me know if not i ll just return it but would rather not because it looks nice     
271,4.0,                       nice watch  haven t messed around with it much but it s comfortable  perfect size    mm  for my wrist  for the people with tattoos on the wrist  the heartrate monitor will not read through the ink for some reason  i ve tested it on multiple areas  new and old ink and right outside the ink it will read  that s one big drawback for me because i bought the watch mostly for that  other than that so far it s great  more features than i ll utilize for sure      
272,5.0,                       one of the best of the year  for me  better than the apple watch   and    very competitive if you have a samsung phone  the experience is excellent  infinite watch faces  a lot of them free  the os is tizenos  very good  beautiful interface with excellent apps  not a lot but the necessary  premium construction  good strap  could be better   good sound and competent microphone  the oled display is perfect and it has a lot of brightness with a light sensor for every moment of the day the battery  normal nothing incredible but competent  in my personal experience after    month    or   days at normal use the best  it s so nicethe worst  for me   a little difficult to learn to use the haptic navigation wheel good choice  i m satisfied      
273,5.0,                       i don t really use the sleep tracking so i don t know enough about it to rate it  but this has been a really good purchase so far  easy to navigate within the apps  good speaker  my friend couldn t even tell that i was on speakerphone   it has a heart rate app  many pretty faces to choose from  it s a very lovely watch      
274,1.0,                       this watch inconsistently charged within a month and by   months it wouldn t hold a charge and then wouldn t charge at all  i sent it to samsung for repair and they said it was out of warranty  by condition   they said there was corrosion on the motherboard  and would charge         to repair it  i tried repeatedly to get more information about how that could have happened in the   months i had the watch only to wait on hold for    min to speak to a technician and finally gave up  it was never exposed to water  not even a shower  i sweat when i work out but i would expect a watch that tracks activity to be able to operate with sweat  don t waste your money on this dumb watch      
275,5.0,                       hands down this is a great investment esp if you are trying to be more active and live a better lifestyle  this watch was more expensive on the samsung website  i def recommend it and it works well with samsung health if you have an android     
276,5.0,                       i am a big garmin fan but i had to replace mine due to it going faulty  so i decided on the samsung active     mm  i wasnt impressed with it when i had it for a few days  battery life just over a day and i am sure the hr sensor on it isnt accurate  the screen is nice and big and the glass with the display is very clear and crisp   i love how you can answer phone calls and write text like using your finger to draw the letters  and get the notifications without missing them   i use the lighted full screen when working out  and put it on gray scale when not using it for tracking my workout  so the battery can last up to   maybe   plus days  even so you can still read your hear rate and get notifications  alarm etc with the battery saver on  i like how you can change the straps which is real easy  i personally dont think the hr sensor is accurate or the treadmill ap as its way off  the only one thing i dislike about the samsung watch is the ap  its not too good you cant see your full gps walk  or heart rate or other health readings    if they updated   made more or a better ap then this watch would be the best on the market   a great watch with a bad ap is its downfall  oh but if you planning on buying one buy a screen protector just in case      
277,5.0,                       bought for my wife  she loves it  it has a speaker and mic on it so she doesn t have to search for her phone while fumbling with the babies  battery is pretty darn good too  multiple day usage on it      
278,2.0,                       i bought this watch primarily to use while running  i m not certain how well it works as a heart rate tracker  but its reported distance is typically at least a mile off even when using the high accuracy feature during my   to   mile runs  when looking at the map it generates it seems to cut through curves in the road instead of following them  it also has a spotty connection on occasion when used as a music player which can be irritating  it does seem to track steps accurately though and functions well overall as a smartwatch  the battery life is pretty good as well      
279,5.0,                       my sister and i got this for my mom last year for christmas  it s awesome because her watch before this stopped working  she loves it and uses it everyday especially for monitoring her heart pulse and things like that  great gift for oneself or for others  almost a year later works like new  also there s a lot of ways to customize the watch faces and bands      
280,4.0,                       i m absolutely love it so far my only complaint is that it came with a very nice blk leather band so if you wanna wear it in the shower or pool you will need to order a different band      
281,5.0,                       well i went and got myself this lovely watch because i had three fitbit s before this and they all had a short lifespan and didn t do everything that i wanted them to  come to find out the app and capabilities of this watch are not up to that of fitbit s  also i am very easy on my belongings in technology and i ve been having problems with this on and off from the start now it goes from      down to    in the blink of an eye and tells me i m not moving when i ve been working out for an hour  some people like it some people that i guess we all have our experiences unfortunately mine was not that grand      
282,4.0,i used this watch regularly for about   months  and found it to be a great all around watch for the price and the features that you get  the strengths of the active watch   lie in its style and its ability to perform as a smartwatch  with decent activity tracking features to round it out  there are definitely some improvements to be made  and if you re looking for a dedicated fitness watch with all the bells and whistles  you should probably look elsewhere  with that being said  this watch does a wonderful job of giving you everything that you need  and perhaps even some things that you didn t think you needed  in a stylish package   i will end up having to return this watch because despite all of my many efforts  i kept getting a pervasive rash where the metal met my skin  i made sure to clean the watch and my wrist daily and kept the watch as dry as possible  i also tried nearly every tightness of the band  but no matter how tight or loose i kept it  the rash continued  looking online  this appears to be a problem that isn t singular  which is unfortunate  were this not an issue  i would make this watch my primary smartwatch   my short breakdown of this watch is as follows   pros  the best looking watch i ve found to date plethora of smartwatch features that are customizable built in gps and music storage is key decent fitness tracking  cons  sleep tracking needs a lot of work manually fixing workout readings can become annoying can cause a serious rash for those with sensitive skin or metal allergies ecg reader still not released  and lack of some health tracking features found on other watches   here are my thoughts on the main aspects of this watch after   months of nearly daily use   build and smartwatch features   this is where the active watch   really shines  it has a huge amount of features that you can tailor to your needs  and the design of both the watch and the software it uses is beautiful  you can wear this watch with just about anything and it will always look good  the bands are very easy to change out  and amazon sells quite a few watch face covers if you want to change the color of the watch itself to better match the bands  they often also double as a scratch resistant cover  which is great   samsung really did a great job with just how pretty and vibrant the screen is on the active    and there are so many watch faces that you ll never get bored looking at it or tailoring it to your outfit  the bezel around the screen isn t intrusive at all like on some other watches  and the watch itself feels very nice and sturdy  i love the scroll bezel as it makes everything much easier and much quicker to find when you have as many different pages as i do  it has a number of different notifications that it registers  and it s very easy to respond from your watch if you don t want to bother taking your phone out  you can set a number of unique quick responses too  or ask bixby to respond for you  works best with texts   also  even though the app store isn t the most expansive  it does have a few very cool  rd party apps  taking calls from the watch isn t the most graceful experience  but it works in a pinch if you can t reach your phone  the built in music storage is something i have never had before in a watch  and i didn t know i needed it until now  being able to download spotify playlists and not have to worry about having to lug my phone with me on runs or even just doing chores around the house was so nice  and the built in gps meant it would still record the length of my runs   health and fitness tracking   i was fairly pleased overall with the fitness tracking features of this watch  the heart rate monitor appears to be very accurate  with the step counter and altimeter being more or less accurate as well  with the altimeter being the far less accurate of those two   the burned calorie tracking seemed to be a little on the high end  but it was more or less on par with the readouts i was getting from my garmin  while i didn t put too much stock into the stress feature  wasn t entirely sure how accurate it is   the breathing exercises were neat and i enjoyed doing them as a way to start my day and wind down for the night  one of the biggest hit or miss things i ve found working out with this watch is that it can take a lot of manual input to make sure the readings are accurate  for any cardio based workout  even something as simple as walking  it s much easier to manually input the start and finish of your activity if you want an accurate reading rather than relying on the auto detection  which can be off by a few minutes  additionally  if you do any workout that relies on counting reps  you re most likely going to need to make manual adjustments afterwards to input the correct number of reps you did  for some of the workouts  you have to have your wrist in a certain position for it to be read correctly  but it s honestly easier to manually adjust it than it is to do an extra    reps trying to get it to register your movements  one good thing about the active   is that you can pre program workouts so that you don t have to go in and try and scroll through all    of the other workouts for each new set of movements you re doing  another is that the animations for the different workouts  especially yoga   are smooth and easy to comprehend  which i appreciated greatly   sleep tracking   this was definitely the worst feature of the watch  i found it to be wildly inaccurate  especially because i suffer from insomnia and wake up several times throughout the night  my biggest gripes with this personally are that it registered me as falling asleep faster than in actuality  didn t register me as awake in the mornings if i woke up and remained in bed  and registered me as still being asleep when i would wake up throughout the night  i even kept a pen and pad next to the bed to quickly jot down the time when i would wake up  and it would take anywhere from    minutes up to an hour for me to fall back asleep   the watch counted all of that time as me having never woken up  i compared these readings to my older garmin watch and found that the garmin was far more accurate than the active    not as accurate as my fitbit  however   if you have a regular sleep schedule or don t care too much about the sleep tracking  you ll probably have a better experience with this feature than i did  but don t expect the sleep tracking on this watch to be the end all  be all   battery life   all reports of this watch getting roughly   days of batter life are pretty spot on  i would extend it beyond that by taking it off and cleaning charging it when i would shower or if i was going to be doing something that i could potentially crack my watch during  like roller blading   which would usually net me another day or so before having to take it off and let it charge for    hours  if you re someone who likes to use the always on display mode  you will definitely have to charge it more frequently  but even with as much tinkering and logging of manual workouts  or using the yoga workout which involves watching a lot of animations  my batter life always lasted at least a day and a half 
283,5.0,                       boy what a difference money makes purchase a cheap smartwatch off of amazon had to send it back it didn t work so decided to save up and get hubby the samsung watch     much better he loves it u can t tell him nothing it works great fast even and no freezing or shutting off came in the original samsung box with charger of course u have to get the piece that goes into the wall but who cares it works great and he is in love that u can charge it on the back of his phone     
284,3.0,                       i had such high hopes for this watch  i read the reviews and thought well  im not going to be using it for everything it offers   only sleep tracking  workouts and maybe a phone call here and there so i should be fine  no  i barely use this and the battery lasts a day at best  i didnt work out today  and didn t use it for texting calling    it was at      when i went to sleep last night and now it s at      also  it takes a long while to charge  almost   hours  ive always had samsung products and have never been disappointed  but this battery is terrible  on a more positive note  the interface is flawless  the movements and going from screen to screen is very easy      
285,5.0,                       as someone who was a past fitbit versa user as well as an apple user  this has to be my favorite  it runs much faster than apple and it tracks just as much  it is a little harder to use than the versa  but if you are someone who is willing to learn and can adjust to new tech  it is worth it  my only complaint is that i liked the fitbit better than the samsung health it was much easier to understand and it sent me weekly fitness reviews once a week  and that the battery only lasts a day and a half  with doing a    min workout each of those days      
286,2.0,                       this watch is not accurate on most of what it is advertised for  it only counts half of my steps at best  it says it counts how many floors of stairs were climbed    i climb up and down stairs all day long and the most it reads is   floor each day  when i am sitting at my shuffling papers  it tries saying i was sleeping during that time  i am moving my arms but it says i am sleeping i am so very dissatisfied in this also the battery life  it says up to   days  but i have to charge every day and a half  that s after i put it on power saving mode the only things i like about this watch is the look  the heartrate monitor  and that i can read and respond to messages without having to pull out my phone out of my purse when i am on the go if you want a watch to track your steps and sleep      dollar watches work just as well if not a bit better i am really bumbed  i was really looking forward to the features of this watch just to find it s not accurate at all      
287,1.0,                       a couple of days after wearing the watch i noticed pain in my left arm and wrist and it would not go away  after researching online  it appears that some people have also suffered from the same thing  i switched the watch to another arm and the same thing occurred  i am returning this because it is affecting my well being      
288,5.0,                    es un regalo de aniversario para mi esposo  se quedo encantado con el  tiene cualquier cantidad de dise os  muchas aplicaciones  se ve espectacular en su mano y fue una buena inversion         
289,5.0,                       amazing watch  tooooons of amazing features but it does have some issues with apps  i ve had sleep tracking run an hour or so longer after i ve woke up  no idea why since i m moving around  only other issues i have are with downloaded apps but those have nothing to do with samsung products  i wish the battery last longer  i ll get a few days depending on how much i use it  heavy use will kill the battery in a day or two while light use will last much longer  but it s not something is consider a  terrible battery   it lasts x   x  longer than my phone so i guess that s great  it will take a while to dial in the watch to how you want it but that s part of the fun  is highly recommend this watch to anyone     
290,1.0,                       i had this watch for maybe   months before it stopped working  it was running slow and the battery life was awful after only   months  samsung claims the watch is water resistant but it most definitely is not  if you are planning on buying this watch  do not take it anywhere near water and do not work out with it on  even though that is basically what it is for  because your sweat may cause water damage  the watch was still under warranty so i called samsung  created a ticket and sent it in  which also cost me       for packaging by the way   they came back with a quote of      to fix a watch i could buy brand new for       they claimed it was  out of warranty  due to water damage    from what   my sweat from working out  water damage from rinsing off dishes and was not even submerged to the supposed allowance of    meters  i also always wiped my watch off and never left it wet  cared for it just like they said      this was an expensive and hard lesson to learn  you are better off buying a cheap     smart watch  hope this review helps  best of luck      
291,1.0,                       made pre order to get a battery for free and never came with it     
292,1.0,                       i m downgrading my review to   star   the manual clearly states i should be able to sync the wifi networks from my phone to my watch but the option is simply not there   i have contacted samsung at least four times for a resolution and nobody even understands what i m talking about   even if this feature worked three stars would be generous   the apps are all trash and since the sync wifi feature doesn t work i can only utilize bluetooth unless i manually enter the incredibly large number of wifi networks i use on a regular basis it s ok i guess  better than a fitbit but nothing compared to an apple watch   no decent apps so far as i can tell      
293,3.0,                       i like the features but the battery life is pretty awful  i have everything turned down for optimal battery life and i can t get this thing to last longer than one day      
294,5.0,                       bought   one for me one for my girl   they came in great condition with about half charge   samsung fast charging block recommended  turned right on easy to set up and get to know   my first smart watch in fact   send sms messages emojis or talk to text and make calls or play music through watch   in order to make calls  or send sms with the watch without a service plan you just have to have your phone within blue tooth range and connected   if you left your phone at home the only way the watch will be able to make calls is if the watch itself has a service plan  i cant comment on the physical monitoring features the heartbeat sensor seems to work well i just dont use the others enough to make an accurate comment    and the different watch faces and downloads are to cool  battery life seems to be about   full days   i dont know were there is a battery saving option that may increase battery life   all in all my girl and i really enjoy them   and dont forget for them to be waterproof you have to turn on the water lock feature before you go jumping into the pool   go to settings   and then go to advanced     
295,5.0,                       i don t usually write a review   but this deserves one   so easy to set up   very accurate    of course i ve only had it for a couple days  i love how it feels and looks on as well  easy to read  mind you i m     years old  and trying to get back in shape during this world wide pandemic   i ve gained a few pounds    it gives me koodos  when i reach each goal treadmill and watch is right on so happy     
296,4.0,                       love my watch and it does seem a little behind on calories burned but you just have to turn on the work out tracker when you re working out and also set up your correct body measurements  then it s usually spot on  i ve had the apple watch too and it s the same issue  the stairs that you ve climbed never seem to be accurate but do i really care about that  no  the steps are spot on as well  i visually watch it count my steps on the samsung health app  what is awesome is now the new bezel feature    which allows you to quickly access other apps and change the volume with music  the music is awesome too because i connected it to my spotify account and it will play your spotify music on the watch when you re away from you phone  the only downside is bixby    samsung has really gotta work out the kinks on that one    terrible voice recognition  however  overall i love it  lots of improvements compared to the last one   p s  i ve boycotted all apple products and couldn t be happier      
297,5.0,                       got it for myself  and i can t get over this watch      i love it and use it almost all the time  fabulous build quality  perfect price  super convenient to use  and looks amazing i thnk this is the perfect smartwatch that everyone should get  i have been using for well over six months  and it has always been an awesome companion  it looks good in any location   wrist  table  even on the wall   see pictures i use it mainly to track my work out activity  and the range of workouts it allows one to track is such a complete list  i only hope they add yoga to this soon  my favorite is to track my biking activity  it motivates me to workout everyday  so that s another plus battery life is two days   easily another great thing about this is the controllability and non dependance on your phone  you can record workouts  control music in your buds  and also watch videos on this   all while staying away from your phone    it has to be in acceptable range though  since this is not a standalone lte watch i think it s the best value for money smartwatch money can buy right now      
298,5.0,                       had a fitbit before this and i am so thrilled with the superiority of this watch  the sleep tracking is more accurate  and the functionality is absolutely incredible  the battery lasts for two days on a charge  which is less than my old device  but considering how powerful this device is the difference is not a problem  the support team here is much  much better  fitbit had no support other than telling me to look it up in a forum      
299,4.0,                       let me start by saying that i have both the apple watch and now this galaxy active     i use an iphone   plus with both watches   hands down the active   is better in every way  except one   most every function works with the iphone except one that might be a deal breaker for some people   you can not answer  a text from the active   using iphone     the apple watch will  allow you to write or speak a reply to a text when using your iphone but the active   will not allow this on iphone   yes the active was made to work with android but even without that texting reply function i still like the active   way more than the apple watch   it is simply beautiful and so bright   the variety of watch faces for the active   are amazing   apple watch faces are so boring and limited      
300,4.0,                       so the main reason i splurged and hot the new active   instead if the original ac ty i ve was because of the battery review  i read the active didnt last but a couple days and the active   was supposed to last about   days  this isnt true  my watch only lasts a couple days  i ve tried making adjustments and nothing seems to extend the battery life  if i had known this before hand i would have saved some money and just got the active      
301,5.0,                       i am a bargain shopper and a researcher   i considered buying a cheaper smart watch  but after looking at various reviews  particularly on cnet and others   i opted for this watch and have not been disappointed   i use with my note       the software is easy to use  it syncs automatically with my phone  has many  many features and is relatively easy to learn   i love being able to change the watch faces   i keep my phone in a leg pouch when i ride my horse  but love being able to answer my phone on my watch without having to get my phone out   really pleased with this purchase   have bought several additional bands and bezel covers for protection and style      
302,5.0,                       i got this to monitor my heart rate throughout the day after the doctor said i have chronic tachycardia  it s also super useful for a bunch of other things and was easy to pair with my phone  my one big complaint is that the product guide and instructions are awful  they don t walk you through anything  which can be distressing and confusing if this is your first ever smart watch  however  the product itself is really great once you figure it out  so i m not taking away any stars i got the cloud gray watch  which i expected to be more of a pale blue based on amazon photos  but it really is just like a cool gray in person  i have a very small wrist and it fits me well at the  nd tightest loop the watch works very well for me and pairs effortlessly with my galaxy note     i currently use the pixel heart wallpaper so i can monitor the time and my heart rate constantly  my only wish is that wallpapers were more customizable  because i really want a simple wallpaper that displays the date  time  and my heart rate so i don t have to flip between widgets  i m not a big fan of how the watch likes to remind me to move every hour    when i have online class  i don t have the option to move often  and i don t know how to turn those startling notifications off lastly  i don t know if i would recommend amazon s delivery service for an expensive product like this watch  the driver didn t follow my delivery instructions   my packages often get stolen if left out in the mail room  which does not lock and has a glass door and no security cameras  so anyone from the street can take packages   so i always request drivers to put the box in the mailbox or in front of my apartment door  which is only around    steps away max   they left out out of the mailbox for anyone to be able to see and take  and didn t even take a photo to confirm it had been delivered  this product cost me nearly      and they did that  but when i order any other cheap package  they follow my instructions to a t and always take a photo to confirm delivery   it s ridiculous  it s probably better to pick this up in person at a store if you are worried about package security  i m just glad i was home to pick it up immediately after it was delivered      
303,1.0,                       i purchased two of these watches based on the claim that ecg would be available sometime in the near future  a year later it is showing up  i now understand that to enable this functionality i have to buy a samsung phone also  i could have bought a apple watch instead if i wanted to be locked to one company and by the way i have an apple phone this was not advertised when i bought these watches they need to fix this or offer a full refund     
304,5.0,                        written by my wife  i love this watch  it has everything i wanted in a fitness tracker  i am a beginner exerciser  wanting to monitor my calories burned and heart rate and it does just that  pairs perfectly with the samsung health app  i don t wear it to bed so i ve never tracked my sleep  comfy  great screen  i got the smaller one and it s perfect  the bigger one would have been ridiculous looking on me  and so many different watch faces to choose from on the watch s wearable app  i ve had it a month now and i m super happy  only downside is the battery life  needs charged daily  by the end of the day the low battery warning comes on  definitely recommend      
305,3.0,                       i purchased this watch in april of       the sleep function on this watch doesn t calculate accurately  i have a dog that wakes me up in the middle of the night  so when i get up to take her out  the sleep feature thinks i m staying up  the battery life isn t great i have to charge it every other day  on july         my watch starts saying it s rebooting  i tried powering it off  resetting it  putting it on the charger nothing worked  i had a black screen unless it was on the charger and then it would only say it was rebooting  on july         i called the samsung customer service number and the representative i spoke with tried some trouble shooting   but nothing worked  i was told to take it to best buy and let their geek squad take a look at it  i take it to best buy to be told you have to make an appointment and they re booked for   weeks  i then chat with an amazon representative who told me that it is out of warranty and they can t replace it  the amazon representative contacted samsung again  only to be told i have send it in to see if they can repair it  hopefully they can otherwise i m out of pocket over          because they won t replace it  this is not acceptable  especially when you pay over         for a product  i had a fit bit watch that lasted over   years  then i had a garmin that lasted at least   years before the battery went out   so to say the least i m not happy with this product at all      
306,2.0,                       if you are looking for a fitness tracker to actually track workouts  don t bother with this watch  if you like data  don t bother  if you want a cute watch  then it s fine  it does not capture elevation gain and lost when hiking  does not count steps accurately  app does not track nearly as much as the fitbit versa      
307,1.0,                       bought the   mm silver cloud samsung watch active   from best buy because amazon was out of stock i bought this watch to replace my fitbit charge   here are the pros a gorgeous watch  overallvery comfortable to wearvibrant  colorful screenvery responsivequick syncing of settings and appsseveral options for watch faces  more available on the samsung store app here are the cons the distance tracking was inaccurate and didn t match up with the step measurements   i walked exactly   mile on my treadmill and this watch showed      miles   it is not possible to adjust your stride length to correct this the calorie calculations are way off  under  as well   apparently samsung doesn t use your heart rate to calculate the calories burned   it uses your height  weight  age  and step count the continuous heart rate monitoring was inconsistent the battery life is disappointing   it used     of the battery in   hours   i only had my calender and the heart rate monitoring enabled  the brightness was set to          
308,4.0,                       i like the large face over the regular activ  it is easier to read  the touch response is very smooth  it does automatically track my steps and sleep  blood pulse is very accurate  i checked it against my blood pressure machine i have at home   my cell phone app samsung health purports to read blood pressure but that is false   maybe it is something they are working on in the future but i don t know how they would do that  wide assortment of watch faces available  i find battery life to be     days  i play music from spotify and pandora  from it  i got one notification a message from my daughter on it and it was clear as a bell      
309,4.0,                       i ve owned this watch for   months now  and so i hope my feedback would provide an accurate and detailed description of my concerns and fascinations with this watch  before jumping in  i have the black   mm active    wifi  watch paired with a samsung galaxy s  e to get straight to the point  this watch does its job well   and that s it it doesn t strive to jump through excessive hoops to overwhelm you with extensive features that will mark it different from the rest of the competition  it is a good watch with clear and abundant watch faces  it lasts for a while  it ll get you notifications  and minor app support  i m not an expert reviewer  but i ll try to touch on these points since they are   as i feel   the highlight of the watch pros   it s a good watch  since the battery management on this watch is fairly good  you can set it up to have a  screen always on  feature enabled  what this does is that when you are not  flicking your wrist  to get the screen on  the screen remains a dim  but fairly visible  colorless version of your watch face  in this mode  some designs would even disappear from the watch face to only show the time  and when you adjust your wrist to turn on the screen  gesture   the whole watch face will come back  i think this is nice since i wouldn t have to keep enacting the gesture just to see my watch  at that point  i feel it defeated the efficacy of its main purpose as a watch    the galaxy watch store  which i believe is just samsung s galaxy store  has a ton of options for watch faces  some are tacky  but if you look through  you can find some of which may fit your style  some watch faces could also be customized to place tidbit of information on the face  information such as step count  weather  heart rate  etc    battery life  the battery is some of the best in the market i would say  it may not last as long as a fitbit versa  but considering what it does  it does it well  with an always on screen  the battery lasts easily   days  without it  maybe     days  there is a power saving mode that may limits features and can give it an extra day  but the ultra power saving mode apparently lets you use it as a clock only for    days  i haven t tested that  but i think it s a feature worth noting    notifications  nothing out of the ordinary here  you get notifications  and you can reply to some of them  i am not sure how well this works on ios   there are quick reply options and then there is that bixby voice thing  eh  it s ok  not always accurate  but if you need it  it can get the job done  you can also limit what app notifications show up on your watch cons   minor app support  i don t think this is samsung s fault entirely  i just don t see a lot of apps on their store that seems   well   good  they are tacky  pointless  or terribly designed  i am not saying that the app is what makes the watch great  but if you are buying a premium watch with money  i sort of expect at least an app store that could provide some users more functionality if they so desire    oximeter  there was a rumor of the watch having this capability  it hasn t been unlocked in my entirety of owning this  i guess samsung doesn t want to release it    heart rate sensor  fitness on this app is otherwise great  i am just a tad bit skeptical of the accuracy of the heart rate sensor  i would use it more as a guide rather than an actual metric  when you check your heart manually  i tend to get it slightly different  hopefully  an update would fix this      
310,2.0,                       got this less than a year ago   i was pretty excited for the ecg feature  but it seems that many of these watches have an issue where it wont work  the sleep tracking is pretty good  but i ve caught it recording sleep when i was definitely awake and the other way around the biggest issue i have though is the battery life  when i first got it  i had to charge it about every  th or  th day and that was reasonable  within a year of getting it i find i have to charge it every other day  i can sometimes squeeze a  rd day out of it when i m less active      
311,5.0,                       i mistakenly purchased the   mm version before returning it for this one  i had the older gear frontier s   and the extra metal on it made it seem clunkier than this really sleek  very understated model  even if you have a smaller wrist  you might well be satisfied with this size as for the watch s functionality  the screen is absolutely gorgeous and the apps work with a speed far beyond my earlier      s  this model is an absolute winner      
312,5.0,                       i bought this smartwatch to replace an older  fossil wearos based smartwatch that did not feature heart rate tracking  i don t miss google s wearos ecosystem at all  i use a samsung phone  which makes coordination between the watch and phone nearly seamless main points   battery life is fantastic  with my old watch  i would be around    percent with moderate use at the end of the day  this watch  with heart rate  gps  bluetooth on  moderate usage  puts me at around    percent  i charge it every night  but fully believe it would last     days with moderate usage   workout tracking is very easy  there are a few quick workouts to tap and go on a page  but for full tracking you have to go through the samsung health app   accurate gps tracking  touch based bezel scrolling is innovative  but i prefer swiping through screens  just how i operated with my old watch   fast and fluid  have not experienced any slowdowns  build quality is top notch  this is more or less a flagship device  and feels that way  the watch feels premium  sleek  and doesn t weigh much at all   samsung needs to update their wear app to make settings easier  there are multiple ways to get to settings  and you may get lost looking for what you want  for example  there are settings in the watch menu itself  in the samsung wear app  or maybe the app specifically for what you are wanting to change  i e  heart rate in samsung health   streamlining will go a long way   voice and microphone are good  sound is loud  vibration does a good job notifying you  people i ve talked to through the watch could not tell a difference between my phone and watch overall  i m thrilled with my purchase  this watch is next level and checks all of the boxes for things i m looking for in a smartwatch      
313,4.0,                       even when i have a screen lock on it  if i cross my arms  stuff starts getting messed with because my other arm is laying on the screen  i have to put it in water lock mode to keep it from doing anything and messing up stuff get the screen protector  there are little marks in my screen like little dots like something splashed on it that won t come off otherwise  i love it  i haven t quite figured out all of its nuances  but it works for my needs  i wish it could do even more stuff with apps and such  it is kind of limited the band is very comfortable      
314,5.0,                       i ve owned the samsung gearfit  pro for about   years and was very happy with it  except for the battery life and also it started to feel a bit dated recently with constant freezing and slow operation at times i ve decided to buy the active   watched as my upgrade and went with the   mm version   st impressions of the watch was good  i like the look and it feels very comfortable on my wrist and even when sleeping   hence taking the   mm over the   mm version   month in and the watch has not given me any concerns or problems  it does the step counting and fitness tracking perfectly  the battery life is definitely better than my gearfit  pro  but  was hoping to get at least     days of use before needing to charge it i currently charge it on a daily basis  but only for a short time frame while i m showering  it s enough to last me again until the next morning i m very happy with the watch so far and would highly recommend it      
315,4.0,i received this watch on     november        i wanted to use for a few weeks or so before reviewing   i got this to replace my aging samsung gear fit   pro   the active watch   is very comfortable to wear and not heavy on the wrist   at       the screen is very visible and easy to read  it can get really bright  so i keep it on       it s very accurate at keeping steps and heart rate  my main reason for this watch as it is my  daily watch     i still use the gear fit   pro for working out  though  guess i don t want to scratch up the active     the features it has leans more towards a  smart  watch over a  fitness  watch  but it will more than suffice for the average person who wants to stay fit  glad to see it can track water and caffeine intake like the gear fit   pro   a big deal for me    the gps seems to be spot on for my needs  walking  biking   the gps turns on  for example  when i turn on the walking app  which the gear fit   pro did  and turns off completely when i end my walk  which the gear fit   pro did not  i would have to manually turn the gps off    built in alarm is a great plus  nice selection of apps and the ability to customize watch faces  on my main watch face  i customized it so i can just press  walk  on the screen and it counts down from   to   and just starts working   no searching for the walking app in the fitness apps   the biggest plus is the battery life  with lots of gps use  i still get     days of use every singly time   even got   days usage once   this is the absolutely the best smart fitness watch i v owned at this point   strange that you can t open the samsung health app from the wearables app as with the gear fit   pro  i hope they fix this soon  samsung did a really good job and i don t think anyone considering the watch active   can go wrong   nuff said 
316,5.0,                    buen reloj  lo malo que no lleg  el regalo prometido  por la preventa         
317,5.0,                       easy to read   i love being able to answer texts from my wrist by voice  i wish i sprung for the cell connected rather than bluetooth because it is so much better than i thought it was going to be that i can go a bit without my phone and still cover my job and family  very pretty design as well as crisp graphics      
318,3.0,                       this is my replacement watch and same thing   heart rate   measure continuously    occasionally if you are wearing it    lower on your wrist like a bangle and shave your arm  and jiggle it up and down and do a handstand  not that i am even all that a harry arm  i wanted accurate steps   mostly great but i think they are giving us extra  time   umm  they all do that right   display and faces   great selection and many of it free  battery   meh  if you are running all the apps you better charge it daily  the standard watch band is average and i replaced it immediately  that s about it  not sure about all the   star reviews but to each their own      
319,2.0,                       i love the idea of this watch   but it s a smartwatch  not a fitness tracker  the calories don t track   what s the point   i wanted a smartwatch and fitness tracker  after    minutes of activity  my calories burned are the same regardless of activity  hiit  running  weights   i love the look and features  but i also want an accurate picture of calories burned  so frustrating  going back      
320,3.0,                       it s a smart watch  it has a touchscreen and connects to your phone  you know this  here are the problems i ve had with it paired to my galaxy s     sleep tracking is indeed as bad as other reviewers have noted  i replaced a dying fitbit charge   with the galaxy active    and the tracking is night as day different  the samsung will almost never record deep sleep  and every once in a while it records nothing  it doesn t matter whether let it auto detect or start your sleep manually  it s bad    it frequently stops recording my heart rate during exercise  no rhyme or reason about it  i just get to the end of my workout  check my watch  and see that most of my workout wasn t recorded  this isn t me doing a hard to track workout  or waving my arms around wildly or anything  this is walking down the street  it s bad    galaxy watches are locked in to samsung fitness  if you have another  rd party app you like  or you want to keep using the app for your other watch form another manufacturer  you can t  samsung fitness is pretty mediocre and comes with it s own set of problems    besides samsung fitness  you need the galaxy wearable app to configure the watch  often  gw will open itself and knock out any other app i happen have open  this presents a problem if you want to keep a music or sound effect app running overnight  or walk around with pokemon go for instance  i keep gw disabled  but again if you want to make any changes to your watch you need it running    a minor annoyance  but i can t find a watch face that doesn t include an unnecessary complication i don t want  my favorite is  premium analog   which is free  it included   complications    of which are configurable  and one of which is a stopwatch and only a stopwatch  don t know why anyone needs a stopwatch always front and center on a watch with scrollable screens  but someone at samsung thinks you do i got this watch for only about     more than another fitbit charge  and it does have more uses  so i m mostly satisfied  but it s disappointing it fails at the very things i want a smart watch to do  if i had paid msrp i would have returned it      
321,3.0,                       i needed a replacement for a samsung fit  pro i lost  i was reluctant to spend this much money but the reported performance improvements  the positive reviews and the promise that blood pressure monitoring  along with some other features  that would be added in the very near future  persuaded me to go head  the watch shipped quickly  the packaging was very good and it s a very nice looking watch  out of the box the watch set up fine and synced with my existing samsung heath app without missing a beat  the ability to make and take phone calls on the watch seemed a little gimmicky  but i have to admit i use it a lot more than i thought i would  so my first impressions was very good  unfortunately  that only lasted about   weeks  that is when the announcement that the blood pressure features were finally available for download  oh but only if you used a samsung phone  which i do not  that same week the pushed watch and samsung health app updates happened  several features were removed  the biggest being the weight management feature  it s gone  and the target daily calories has to be reset every day  which is annoying  but more annoying is the do not disturb feature will turn off the announcement to the watch per the schedule like it should  but does not turn the watch face off  you have to manually turn the good night function on and off  i not sure were samsung is going with their update  but it appears they are leaning more toward a smart watch and less of a fitness watch  i will more than likely continue to use the watch and hope the next updates will get those features added and useable on a non samsung phone      
322,1.0,                       this watch is probably the best option for an android user so i bought it  but it s samsung at the end of the day so expect poor product support after purchase the watch has the hardware for an ecg but didn t activate it for a year after the launch  even now the ecg works only for samsung phones and not for non samsung phones  i bought this watch for the ecg only to wait for a year with still no guarantee that the feature will ever roll out  also now that the watch active   has been released  i doubt samsung would bother with updating the software for an older model  samsung s continued efforts to sabotage their hardware with their pathetic software makes their product not worth buying or recommending will probably never buy a samsung branded mobile or accessory again      
323,5.0,                       first one i bought was through a  rd party seller  it arrived with spanish labels and upon startup  the menus were in spanish  come to find out the country code for this watch was mexico  therefore i did not have access to some features such as samsung pay  i reached out to the seller and was able to return it for a full refund  i purchased another one from amazon direct a few weeks later after receiving my refund and it was the us version as advertised   very happy with my watch and happy i was able to get the mix up straightened out      
324,2.0,                       several of the sensors and calculations were way off for me   altimeter  heartbeat  gps  calories  and footsteps were all inaccurate  often by a large margin  i ve been a samsung fan for years  but this watch was a disappointment  i returned it to amazon as not working as advertised      
325,1.0,                       it s not been a year and i already had to send this to service center in texas twice  the back side of the watch fell apart twice  had software issues the heart rate is not accurate  i compared it with apple and fitbit and found that samsung watch heart rate is always    beats higher also their support process is really bad  everytime you call the support center   each representative would have a different answer for you   it s all depends on whom you get over the other end of the call  anyway  i am never going back to samsung watch again  they are just bad products       
326,1.0,                       i loved this fitness watch  and i really wanted it to work out but the battery issues seem to plague this model   won t charge after normal and careful use over just a few weeks  update  samsung claims warranty is invalid for this device   less than two months old   doing nothing but running with this watch for three weeks straight   and they claim  water damage from sweat  buyer beware  samsung does not honor its warranty for normal use of their products i do not swim  i only run     miles per day   i wore a fitbit on one arm  for two years  and now attempted to use this watch on the other arm to compare   apparently  the samsung product cannot be used for sports activities even though they like to use  active  in their product description samsung has lost a customer for life      
327,2.0,                       got this for my wife for christmas     it lasted a week  it s not even close to being water resistant or anything like that  samsung claims you can indeed swim with it in up to   feet of water for    minutes    well my wife activated the water lock and it still suffered water damage and watch is useless  had to send it back   think three times before you lay down any money of this device    it also has problems being connected to its own smartphones  my wife connected it to her a    g and it had all kinds of issues syncing properly and staying connected to bluetooth    etc spend more money and get a garmin or something better    never again will i even think about getting one of samsung s smart watches      trash      
328,1.0,                       as a lifelong samsung user  i feel that i have to warn other fans such as myself  i have everything from their tvs  appliances  my s   and this watch i purchased this watch last black friday  i  upgraded  from my gear s  to this product which is arguably inferior  but i ll spare that review my watch inexplicably died one day and would not charge  i used multiple samsung chargers and it would only display zero percent  no problem  its still under warranty and it was returned for service   or so i thought after wasting my valuable time on hold  hung up on redirected    i was told that there was water intrusion and that their warranty specifically doesn t cover that  i pled my case that i have no where put this thing through the rigors that samsung claims it can withstand  so it must have been a defect from the factory  the only time it got wet was when i showered  you are supposed to be able to swim with this thing  it is an  active  watch  just rinse it off if you get seawater or chlorine on it  yeah  right with no resolution  my options were to pay      for their repair or go without  i chose the latter i doubt anyone from samsung will hear my plea s for assistance  an honestly  i dont care  through my ventures  i have   s of thousands of dollars in their products and have been a vocal fan boy  no longer  keep my money samsung  however  you won t be getting anymore  way to lose an avid lifelong consumer over      buyer beware      
329,4.0,                       i am a android pixel   owner  i previously had a fitbit  my second one that stopped charging correctly so i gave up and decided to look for an android watch  i love the design of this thing  the watch strap itself is super comfy and cool design which is important if you are wearing it all the time  including to bed for sleep tracking  i love how you can change the watch face but there is almost too many designs to chose from  the major problem i have is the whole app use  first as an android user for my phone  should be setup super easy  i had to install like   different apps on my phone to get it to work fully  samsung health app is ok and it looks like it integrates with myfitnesspal but i just wish all this stuff would work together  i hate having to create a samsung account to go to their app store instead of just google play for apps  i am a heavy google user so i got youtube music to work on the watch but why doesn t google photos work  some samsung crap photo app   also why can t i use google pay on this  i m not putting all my credit cards into another samsung pay app so i can use it on the watch   so far the battery life is pretty bad  seems like i have to charge it every other day right now and i m not heavily using it  charging is easy except it forget it on the charger  would be better to wirelessly charge it somehow while it s on my wrist  seeing as this is one of the main reasons i gave up on my fitbit which would normally need to be recharged only once a week this is a big fail  other than that great device      
330,5.0,                       after almost a week with this watch  i love it  battery life wasn t great the first   days but after a couple charge cycles it now last a full   days  tested out the hr monitoring against a polar chest strap and the numbers were spot on with little to no lag while doing hiit  haven t messed around much with any  rd party apps but the basic functionality is great and looks good as well      
331,5.0,                       battery last barely   days on power saver  last little over a day without it  and barely being used small downside sleep tracker   i m not sure but once in a while it says it couldn t monitor my sleep and to tighten it after i tightened it as tight as it goes comfortably and still left marks it still did not read  other times it does maybe      times it did not         
332,1.0,                       bought for use in a health care setting  the  second  hand turns off if the watch is not activated  when you flick your wrist a certain way the  second  chronograph disappears  this means it fails to be a useful watch  which is the most basic of tasks a watch should be able to preform also samsung does not allow any google apps on its watch  meanwhile      of samsung phones run google apps  if you use apps like youtube music  google maps  google calendar  google fit etc  do not expect them to appear on your watch app list  so not only does it fail at being a basic watch  it also fails at being a smart watch if you use google apps   services   if you use google fit with strava  be prepared to buy a  rd party app to link them with samsung health  the compatibility are not nearly as smooth and seamless as what my gf s iphone and apple watch have  why samsung chose to make their watches restricted is beyond me the heart rate monitor seems to work fine  if you use kettle bells or other workout equipment consider using another device to avoid damage i ended up returning the watch and am now looking at garmin or just keeping my analogue watch while purchasing a heart rate monitor for use during workouts      
333,3.0,                       i liked this watch at first buuut i don t like the exersize settings  they don t track your calories very accurately  i put it on run and sat down for an hour  it thought i was running  burning way to many calories the watch also stoped working about   months into use  screen just went black one day  made sure to charge it and tried rebooting but it wouldn t get past the boot screen or connect to my phone  luckily i was still in the return window     
334,5.0,                       i m in love with my watch  i love that i can answer calls  read and respond to texts  that was most important to me  but the other apps that this watch has is awesome  i downloaded the ekg app just for fun and it worked great  i love that i can track my sleep patterns and my heart rate  and i bought several different colored bands to switch out  very happy with this watch      
335,2.0,                       i was excited to get this watch  but i was utterly disappointed  i returned it after   weeks  was it malfunctioning  no  it was simply a disappointment  it has the typical features that you would find in a smartwatch  and that s about it  i got a xiaomi mi band   instead and it can do pretty much anything the active   can do for one tenth of the price unimpressed      
336,5.0,                       i went from a fitbit versa   to the samsung galaxy active   and i am so happy   love that it has so many more features than my fitbit  but it didn t break the bank like an apple watch   i am constantly losing my phone  so it is nice to be able to read my texts and even pick up phone calls      
337,5.0,                       this is my first time buying a refurbished item and i am pleasantly surprised  the watch i received honestly looks like it s never been work before  i also received it in the original box with the manual and samsung charger of course since it is a samsung product  it is a great watch  i m not a big exercise person  but i have been happy with the step tracker and sleep monitor  both seem to be very accurate i also enjoy the fact i can make   receive calls on the watch  respond to emails  and  receive respond to texts  when i am at work i can leave my phone at my desk and still be able to text or call while walking around or with customers the battery life seems to be good  compared to the other off brand watches i have owned this one does not last as long  but this watch also has a lot more features than the others i ve owned  it takes about    minutes to completely charge  and it usually lasts about    hours overall i am very satisfied with the product      
338,5.0,                       i am absolutely in love  the watch is amazing  you can do so many things with it  my favorite would obviously be the fact that s it      water resistant so i shower with it all the time  i sweat with it on while i work out and i never worry about damaging it  the silicone straps make for an easy clean and the watch has many amazing features itself  i love the sleep tracking  however  my favorite thing would definitely have to be the stress meter and heart monitor feature  it always reminds me when to beathe and calm down relax      
339,2.0,                       not the watch for fitness tracking      i ve wanted this watch for awhile now and i m so sad it was a disappointment the watch itself is beautiful and has awesome features   i wanted an  upgrade  from my samsung gear    i run daily so i know how many calories  on average i burn in a certain time span    this watch severely misses the mark when it comes to calories burned    when i run for    mins i burn an average of     cals  approx      cals every   mins    after a    mins run with this watch    it only counts    cals burned which is ridiculous for    mins w  heart rate of       i decided to keep the watch because i like how it looks and the other features like being able to take calls  the full texting capability and the vibrant screen etc   i have not tried it in water and don t plan on it    its just upsetting that its not up to par when it comes to the fitness aspect  if your wanting a watch for fitness     this is not it at all  save your money        
340,5.0,                       okay i did it and i m so glad i did  this watch has everything and i did my homework before i purchased and i m actually blown away how amazing it is in person  my only struggle i had with buying was   mm or   mm  i went with    since i have a small wrist and the screen is perfect  probably could have gotten the    and it would have been just fine  your choice your wrist lol but do yourself a favor and get it      
341,5.0,                       i replaced my asus zen  watch with the samsung active   watch primarily for longer battery life  swim safe  and pulse monitoring  so far it has lived up to expectations  finding your app on the phone is much easier than with the zen  but still a little clumsy  i have spend lots of time in pool with this watch and no problems so far  i use the pulse monitor for workouts which is easier than using a standalone unit  the battery life is a major plus as it can easily go   days without a charge and it can do a     recharge in about   hours  the apps are colorful and easy to read  responding to texts and emails is very easy  it answers phone calls with a decent speaker and the microphone seems to work well  it has ekg capability which has been approved by korea and is built into this phone but will not be active until regulatory issues dealt with  it will involve placing your finger on a button which will act as a   lead ekg   overall  this is a great watch   the much more expensive lte version sounds good but cannot justify especially as you have to get a separate account for it from your cell carrierfinding apps on this watch is not always obvious but once you master them  they are really good   the exercise monitoring functions are great   especially biking and swimming  the biking function monitors heart zones and duration in each zone  milage  speed  and maps your ride on a map and then transfers it all to your phone for storage   swimming keeps tack of number of laps automatically as well as strokes and calories  it even has a little pump function that pumps water out of the watch after you are done swimming   bixby is hard coded in but you can ignore it  it displays pictures surprisingly well and music sounds not terrible on its little speaker      
342,3.0,                       if it breaks and you bought it on amazon  samsung will void your warranty  samsung has the worst possible customer service  the back cover came off  i just needed them to put it back on  after   months i asked them just to send my watch back  they did and didn t include the back   they then refused to send the back cover to me  now i can t wear it      
343,5.0,                       i have the   mm bt version  this is my first smart watch and so far i like it a lot  it s very comfortable on my wrist  i tried out the sleep function and it was comfortable to sleep with  it interesting to see how much actual r e m  i m really getting there were a couple of small updates out the box that were available to address the gps accuracy and a newer version of tizen  i tested the gps with another phone and a   mile run was just as accurate as the phone for some reason the weather app on the  watch couldn t find my location  after some digging on the internet  i ve found that the gps needs to be turned on the watch  it was off by default on my watch  once you ve turned gps on  go to the samsung wearables app on the phone and go to the weather function app and select your city  then refresh your samsung watch tizen weather app and it will pick up your weather location i have this watch primarily to keep an eye on my ticker  i know that the echo cardiogram like function for the watch will not be available until early       but it s nice to have an android watch that eventually will have it battery lasts about     days with heavy usage    days with minimal for all that this watch does it s a great value      
344,5.0,                       best watch for diabetics to see continuous bg readings  i love it  i had a fossil watch first but with the g watch app it is perfect also the phone option is awesome  i work at a clinic and with covid we have to keep locking the door when people come back into the building    needless to say someone gets locked out and i can use my watch to call for help back in what i wish is that samsung would allow all apps to update bc i would rather keep this as a widget      
345,1.0,                       i bought the lte version and i couldnt get it up  plus i dont have t moblie or sprint that is the only compatible service in the us that this watch takes  i tried to connect through bluetooth on pc and it wasnt doing anything  i am disappointed  waiste of money      
346,1.0,                       i m an adult male of normal height in good shape  and the band that comes with this watch is too big  even at the smallest size the watch flops around on my wrist apparently the   mm watch face comes with a small band  why not ship that with the   mm watch face as well  now i either have to return this watch  or buy a separate band  which i feel that samsung or amazon should be reimbursing me for  apple watch comes with a smaller band  ticwatch  wear os  comes with a smaller band my first foray in to galaxy watches has started off on a terrible foot  and that s before i even have to try to deal with developing apps for tizen      
347,5.0,                       so i was pretty skeptical about buying this watch here due to it having no reviews but i went ahead and ordered it anyway  shipping was extremely fast and i got the watch the next day and i must say  i love it  its totally official  everything a out this watch is amazing from its looks and feel down to it s functionality  samsung did a really good job with this watch  if your on the fence about buying it go ahead and pick it up you won t regret it      
348,5.0,                       i purchased the galaxy active watch   in order to keep up with text messages and sleep  it is very worth the purchase  the battery lasts     days with basic use  watch is extremely customizable with the app which is amazingly easy to use  this watch can handle a lot  although it is water resistant i have not gotten in wet  it fits all your needs from an excellent workout tracker  water tracker and more all in a small watch  it did not disappoint
