0,3.0,                       this is a nice but i can t possibly give it more than   for not completely working  the ethernet works fine but the hdmi causes our macbook to constantly flicker  we have have a separate usb c to hdmi adapter and it works just fine     
1,4.0,                       i needed a c hub for my daughter when she is doing remote school work with her chromebook  i love the small size  great product for the price      
2,5.0,                       this adapter is great even tho it is small  it has all the ports necessary  i use it with macbook pro which only have usb c port so this was a must need for me  and trust me this work very good and fast  i usually use this to connect my mac to external monitor and to charge my samsung phone also  so this is so helpful to me and works great      
3,5.0,                       this item did the trick for me  well made and does what it is supposed to do      
4,5.0,                       first  the tech  adds usb     ports to your usb c macbook pro  in my case   adds wired ethernet  and it matches my space gray machine  recommended      
5,5.0,                       this item is small and compact and does what it supposed to do   allows multiple input sources   great to add to a laptop or even a tesla vehicle      
6,5.0,                       after you get the hand  open it to see the appearance  you are satisfied  you can feel the hand when you hold it  it feels good  the quality of the product is very good  the performance is very stable      
7,5.0,                       a nice affordable hub for my macpro  it worked well so far      
8,5.0,                       like it because it has ethernet connection which most others dont     
9,5.0,                       i am already very pleased with the product  it arrived well packaged   i must not have read over the details too much before purchasing this but i m trilled it is made of metal and not plastic like so many other dongle products  feels solid   durable  i use it primarily for power  usb c  and ethernet  but appreciate having the hdmi   usb a ports for the rare instances that i need those  i highly recommend this product      
10,5.0,                       all ports work  ethernet  usb ports  hdmi  great product      
11,5.0,                       this is everything i wanted i m a usb c hub for my pixelbook  it s thin and gets the job done  love that it can charge pixelbook at the same time     
12,2.0,                       it works wonderfully so far haven t done any high capacity transfers yet  so i cannot comment on the speed however  i have noticed that it will emit noise after the target device is fully charged and pd is connected because said noise is unbearable for me  i have brought the rating down by two stars otherwise  i am currently happy with this product  and if the noise wasn t a thing  i would have given   stars update  after being used for a while with power delivery turned on  the hub will stop working  and must be disconnected and reconnected  i would assume that stops working due to the generated heat going across some threshold  and works best cold  as it is still functional for periods of time  it gets two stars  not one      
13,5.0,                       it works as it listed and more   it able connect to external monitor in extend mode  windows   samsung dex    apps open   and nintendo switch  heat despesation is good  not burning like other      
14,5.0,                       this usb c multiport extender contains the perfect amount of ports and does an amazing job of clearing up wire clutter the input usb c is used for power supply  there s an hdmi  and the two usb a ports are used by my wireless keyboard mouse and harddisk  perfect for my setup     
15,5.0,                       switched to the macbook air  which only has   thunderbolt ports  i use two monitors  one usb c and the other hdmi  this adapter helps me use   monitors  charge my device  plug in peripherals  and ethernet  speeds on the ethernet are equivalent to what i get on my windows desktop without a usb adapter  great build quality and does not overheat      
16,3.0,                       i am returning this item because both the original and replacement products i was shipped did not come with the advertised carrying pouch  so if you need the pouch  look for another product  hopefully they can update the product listing      
17,5.0,                       i had two problems until i purchased this usb hub  i have extra lcd monitor but i can t connect it to my notebook computer because hdmi port has malfunction  and my wifi speed is so slow because my laptop is placed far from wireless router  i can solve these two problems with this device  i really like to connect my extra monitor to my laptop using this hub  i can expand my screen and so cool    and then i can use wire connection for the internet instead of wifi  my speed upgraded hundreds times  i am very very satisfied with it  moreover  it has two usb     ports  the usb ports on my laptop has been used fully because i used extra keyboard and mouse and usb external hard disk  it was so inconvenient  but two usb     port on this hub makes me so comfortable  i can used any usb device anytime  i am really satisfied with this hub with reasonable price  so goooood        
18,1.0,                       opened the box on oct     connected it to a lenovo thinkpad  powered it with a usb c    w brick  hdmi  to the monitor   and both usb a ports  for mouse and keyboard  were used  the setup worked for two days  sometimes the monitor would flicker but i didn t mind  today  oct     however  no power were coming out from the hub anymore  monitor went blank  the whole setup simply failed for no reason  the same set of equipments were moved to another hub and that worked just fine  so the fault has got to be this aukey   port usb c adapter      
19,5.0,                       turned my samsung s  phone into desktop computer with monitor  keyboard  mouse and plugged in charger  future is here        
20,5.0,                       works perfect for macbook pro and surface laptop  when charging  it s hot and i believe it s a common issues for small usb c hubs      
21,5.0,                       been using this hub for charging  ethernet and usb a usage for several weeks now  works consistently well  no issues at all  great value for the price      
22,1.0,                       the usb c connection to the laptop is very sensitive  the slightest move will disconnect everything  hdmi monitor connection will be lost  ethernet connection drops and usb peripherals would also stop working  the device itself looks and feels great but very poor quality connection to computer  i tried it with one macbook air  a macbook pro and a dell xps and same issue      
23,5.0,                       this is an amazing product which i bought for my son  the adapter connects much faster to the monitor than my previous adaptor and is exceptional  i highly recommend this product for anyone who works for a long and hard time      
24,4.0,                       used this to plug an external drive into my macbook air  while plugged in and transferring data it would inexplicably disconnect midway through the transfer  it also slowed or sometimes completely stopped my wifi connection  spend the extra       for an anker hub updating review because customer service reached out to offer a remedy      
25,5.0,                       i have struggled for a long time to buy an adequate usb adapter until i found this  my institute bought me a dell usb c adapter which costs around     but only has one usb     port and no usb c port  to get one more usb ports  i communicated with my supervisor and it staff for a long time with more than    emails  they all hesitate to find a better alternative or are unwilling to spend more money on it  luckily  i found this product which immediately solved all my needs  it has two usb     ports and one usb c port  so i can connect my mouth  keyboard  and disk at one time  moreover  this adapter supports hdmi and wire network and is quite small and light  so it s my best choice for business trips and conferences  i highly recommend it      
26,5.0,                       great productworking perfectly for my xp s     use usb aukey omnia charger   w for power up your laptop     
27,5.0,                       i ve had the aukey hub for a week now  and i m really satisfied with the quality  i was looking for something with an ethernet port and some extra usb ports for my laptop  but nothing too expensive or too big  the aukey usb c hub is compact  but has a nice heft to it that makes it feel sturdy to use  all of the ports work fine  and i have not run into any problems  one usb port creates a lot of lag when i plug my wireless keyboard and mouse  it works fine with any other task  the keyboard and mouse work perfectly normal when plugged into the other usb port  so i m still satisfied with my purchase      
28,4.0,                       works well for our chromebook and laptop      
29,4.0,                       i ve only used this for a few days now  but overall it works well  i ve used it to connect a higher powered usb type a device into a usb c port on a dell laptop and had no issues the construction of the hub seems solid my only negative comment is the device does get warm  even when it there aren t downstream devices plugged in      
30,4.0,                       very nice simple  compact design  hdmi connection was very strong  providing a crisp image and no lag  unfortunately  i was disappointed to find that the usb     connection was not strong enough to support my amazon basics wireless mouse  which i have since used successfully with a vava adapter  maybe i just got a dud  not sure   update the company has contacted me and offered a full refund  from amazon  and a replacement usb hub  very prompt and friendly customer service is always appreciated  i m looking forward to testing the replacement because i do like aukey products in general      
31,5.0,                       when i opened it up  i was surprised to see how small it was  compared to other adapters  this one is pretty small and the build quality is great  i ve had no problems so far     
32,1.0,                       worked fine exactly for one month and then started malfunctioning  first it began giving intermittent  slow charger connected  via usb c power delivery when connected to my surfacebook    direct connection with charger worked fine   now the usb peripherals are constantly disconnecting and reconnecting  making using an external keyboard and mouse useless  these also work fine with directly connected       
33,5.0,                       edit  customer service is excellent and they are making this right  looking out for satisfaction with their products goes a long way   does not work with samsung a  e which is what i was hoping to use it on  only usb ports work  built in ethernet and hdmi have no response  may just be a samsung compatibility issue  very solid  feels high quality in the hand      
34,4.0,                       i really like this product  it works very well and i really like how many ports it has  one thing i did not like was how the on the second day i had it completely failed on me  i got a new one and they instantly shipped one out to me  they had great customer service      
35,5.0,                       works like magic  i was a bit worried at first if the hdmi connection caused any input lag via an adapter  but it soon proved itself to be lighting fast  above all  it s incredibly portable and does not take much space at all on my desk      
36,5.0,                       the appearance of things is beautiful  small and convenient to carry  it solves the problem that the usb jack in front of my host is broken  it is recommended to buy it if necessary      
37,5.0,                       i am a remote worker  with a     macbook pro with only usb c ports   my home setup only uses this for connecting to a solid ethernet connection   but when i go in to the office from time to time i can connect to keyboard monitor and mouse at a loaner desk easily   and the    w pd passthrough is so convenient   only one cable to connect and disconnect when i need to pick up and go to meetings   i normally don t need more than the ports on this adapter  and i m happy with the metal shell and solid build quality of this one      
38,5.0,                       i bought this to replace my current usb hub  that one was lacking a ethernet port  i wanted to have the ability when i work from home to just have   cable plug in and have my laptop up on my monitors  this works mostly well for that  i can connect basically everything to this and just plug this in and it works    i still have to connect   cable i have a  nd hdmi   but this is very useful for work from home  if your pc has a usb c port i definitely recomend trying this  could help you work from home or even connect your phone up to your monitors or hardwire to it      
39,5.0,                       the package is tight and compact  the products are fine in workmanship  small and exquisite  and easy to carry  there are few usb ports in the notebook  which is not enough  this expansion hub is selected at a glance on the internet  after trial  the notebook data reading speed is very fast  plug and play  and data transmission is stable and smooth  compatibility is very good  very good  satisfied      
40,4.0,                       the build quality is good and generally works ok but    very hot even when the only ethernet connected  i would guess takes a lot of current from the battery    sometimes stops working until i reboot my laptop   not frequently    my usb microphone when connected to it stops working randomly  never stopped to work when connected directly to the laptop     
41,5.0,                       i purchased this usb c hub for use with a keyboard and mouse and am very satisfied with the product s functionality  the product is on the thicker side  but i find that it doesn t take up too much space on my desk and in my electronics travel bag      
42,5.0,                       adapter is solid  good quality  and easy to use  with a flexible end  i m not concerned that it will broke if the ethernet cable is accidentally pulled  it s comparable to more expensive products from other manufacturers like apple or samsung  like other aukey products that i ve bought before  this one does not disappoint      
43,5.0,                       the usb hub does exactly as expected and has many port options   i have had no issues and it performs as expected      
44,5.0,                       worked right out of the box with no problems  i have a usb mouse  external hd and hdmi monitor connected  all working properly at one time  haven t tried the pass through charging  because i haven t needed it yet  it s a nice solid enclosure that doesn t feel like it s going to fall apart with some use and travel  for the price  i m very happy      
45,5.0,                       works just as expected  buy this      
46,5.0,                       i bought this so that i could accessorize my chromebook with an ethernet connection  more usb ports  and an additional monitor  it s working great for that  no complaints here      
47,5.0,                       i was hoping this would work for my lenovo duet for ethernet  but it does not show up  i have a hootoo usb c adapter that shows up fine  but this does not show up  it does allow me to charge and use the other ports on it though  i know the adapter works though  because it works in my xps  so probably just an issue with the chromebook and whatever drivers it cannot obtain yet      
48,3.0,                       have had to replace this product twice  the first was an exchange  the second was a return  it overheats and after a few weeks and barely works      
49,1.0,                       used with hp chromebook and dell laptop  can t charge battery fast enough while using device s   leading to system shutdown when least expected  forget about using keyboard or mouth with it  lag in response will drive you mad  garbage      
50,5.0,                       needed an ethernet to usb c adapter to connect to my laptop  i came across this hub for about half the price of a comparable one at my local big box store  this works perfect and also has a few extra inputs in case i may need them in the future  it s slim and lightweight  sleek  and the material matches my laptops finish nicely      
51,3.0,                       i have a mac and a pc  i have no issues with the mac  but the hdmi port doesn t work for the pc  i have reloaded drivers  changed cords  changed settings and it just doesn t seem to work      
52,5.0,                       this hub comes with ethernet port and this is a  k  i bought this for the microsoft surface laptop and it works fine gives me excellent picture quality and i can plug in my wireless mouse   keyboard  pen drive and this is type c so refresh rate for my monitor is good  best value for money     
53,5.0,                       fits great for my macbook air  fits w a case as well      
54,4.0,                       used to project movies and charge the ipad in one go  it worked great only issue had is it gets extremely hot  but otherwise works fine      
55,4.0,                       i m using this for my microsoft surface go  and it has been a lifesaver   i take my surface go  everywhere i go for presentations  documentation and if it isn t for this device my life with my surface would be unbearable   most other usb c hubs and this tiny size do not have an ethernet port and the addition of it to this device is the main reason to pick it up   i highly recommend pros  portability ethernet port sturdy feelcons  gets hot after an hour of use the metal shell might cause scratches on my surface since the cord isn t long enough to rest on the table     
56,5.0,                       love this product for being able to connect my side monitor onto my macbook pro  allows for your macbook to do more  great product and really recommend if you looking to maximize your mac capabilities      
57,2.0,                       attempted to use with a qhd      x      monitor work and experienced random black bars and red pixels everywhere  then tried with a     p monitor and it worked fine      
58,3.0,                       i like the portability of the product  it is decently built  but i have the following issue  it gets too hot  i have tried it under different scenarios    only power   power  ethernet cable hdmi   power hdmi  power ethernet cable  ethernet cable onlyin each scenario the hub gets really hot  i may have received a defective piece since i purchased it right around launch  i m past my return period  else would have requested for a replacement      
59,5.0,                       works as advertised  perfect for my needs  mouse and keyboard  monitor  and the lan connection is fast      
60,5.0,                       i was surprised at how small it is and i like that cause it makes it easy to carry it around   it s compatible with my mac book so off course makes my work easier due to the new apple s designs  pretty much i use it to connect my work headphones and they have work very well  so far i m very pleased with this purchase      
61,5.0,                       this is my second device and with the recent usb c only gadgets you will need this  it has a really chic design  my dell laptop and samsung phone matches perfectly  i bought it because of the ethernet port and i already used the port to configure my router  it may be warm a little bit when you use but it is not a problem for me  recommend it    people found this helpful     
62,5.0,                       i love the great size and material  my laptop does not have an internet port so the only way to get the internet connection is to use wifi which is not stable and affects my online meetings a lot  i was not sure to buy an   in   hub or   in    the only concern was that i worried about it will be too bulky so i bought this   in    the hub really surprised me with its smart size  it is a little larger than my airpod which is very portable and the surface color is silver grey which i love the most  overall  it is nice and i love it so much      
63,5.0,                       this product works perfectly we use it for online school for a  st grader on a chromebook   hdmi to the tv     works perfectly  and hardwired to the network which works perfectly      
64,5.0,                       great value hub for those who need one of the usb c variety  it s lightweight but study  and has a small assortment of ports for those who need them  i d recommend      
65,2.0,                       ordered one and it didnt work well it would disconnect my light and other items  i returned it for a replacement thinking it was defective  same thing with the replacement  it doesn t seem to be able to handle the power required by items connected to it  so it will dim or disconnect  i buy less expensive things on amazon all the time but for this just spend the extra money   its ok if you plug in one thing but thing or   that doesn t require a lot of power but it does run very hot      
66,5.0,                       i have a chromebook that only has usb c ports and nothing else   this usb c adapter hub has become the perfect way to connect everything quickly   i use it to plug in my hdmi monitor and for plugging in usb a devices   i even plug in my usb c charger into it and it will charge my chromebook through this hub it s the reliable usb c hub that will handle everything you need from it   best part is that it s affordable      
67,5.0,                       the appearance is simple and generous  small and exquisite  and does not take up space at all  compared with the appearance of the materials used for workmanship  it is indeed the best value for money  there is no jam in the transmission  which is very worthwhile to start with      
68,5.0,                       for some reason my son s acer chromebook does not stay consistently on wifi  there is a network drop in all the rooms in my home  but i could not plug in a usb c to ethernet adapter into his chromebook and still charge his chromebook at the same time  until now  with this adapter  i have been able to plug his chromebook into the network drop in his room and plug the charger that came with his chromebook into this as well  now he has a stable internet connection and can charge his laptop at the same time great adapter and reasonably priced too  happy with my purchase      
69,4.0,                       despite buying this product for my samsung s  lite so i can use my keyboard and mouse  i believe it provides the nescessary ports that i need in the future when i decide to upgrade my laptop  since usb c is becoming the standard  finding the necessary dongle i personally need is important      
70,5.0,                       my lenovo has the sd port    hdmi    usb  but i wanted another hdmi  more usb     ports  and internet plug  and to be able to charge my computer via the usb c  so the aukey has all the additional ports that i wanted    power is good   lenovo flex   charges fast through the the hub      
71,4.0,                       easy to connect not work with ipad mini   when used with lighting to usb c adapter the ethernet gigabit not working  when connect to my ipad mini or iphone note    using over wifi only fully functional with mouse n keyboard when using samsung dex  to tv monitor easy to  mirror to tv to play game n watch movies     video resolution  look good       
72,3.0,                       i had this product for about   months and it worked very well  i am using it on my macbook pro and decided to connect it via ethernet since it had an extra port  now  the network cable is showing that it is recoginzed on the hub side  the green light is showing  but isn t detected on my mac  tried it on another machine  and it had the same issue  then unplugged the ethernet cable and plugged it into my work computer that has an ethernet port built in and it works  not sure why this just broke  as the usb spots and hdmi is still working  disappointed but you get what you pay for i guess      
73,5.0,                       i ordered it for the ethernet mainly  but am grateful for all the extra ports  it s all i need to bring with me when i take my laptop out      
74,3.0,                       ethernet  hdmi  usb        but not power through and hdmi at same time       macbook pro     which has   w usb c power adapter  with ethernet  hdmi and   w usb c power the ethernet stopped working  disconnected  let cool down and tried with just ethernet  hdmi and one usb   device connected  that works  if i add the   w usb c to power through this is gets hot and things eventually stop working  if aukey wants to send me another one to test while i hold onto this one  as i need it to be productive with ethernet  that would be great  i can t have downtime running with only wifi      
75,4.0,                       bought this to use with the tivo stream  k to add ethernet and fullsize usb  works great out of the box      
76,5.0,                       it charges my  m   macbook air while providing a solid ethernet connection  it does not provide power out through the usb a connectors  however  i expected it would  but that s okay  it comes with a cool little carry bag and will make a good travel companion once we are able to travel again  unlike another brand i bought  this one has never failed to work in any way i have tested it      
77,5.0,                       i needed this for a very specific purpose   linking a mifi hotspot  usb c  to a mesh router system via ethernet  it magically works  amazing and during a pandemic with my kids remote allowed us to actually have internet in a very rural area  probably not what it was designed for  but the fact that all the gates worked and whatever internal connections  eg  usb c out from router communicating with ethernet out of the aukey and into the router  is impressive  overall i was astonished it worked  and am super impressed      
78,1.0,                        nd aukey dongle i ve tried that s been defective  the design of this one is better than most    but it didn t work      
79,5.0,                       i was surprised just how easy this hub was to use on my samsung phone  dex came up quickly and without the annoying  not a samsung device  notice  any i was able to use a keyboard with it  great device      
80,5.0,                       i use the device with a dell xps      and an ipad pro           i get  gbit upload download through the ethernet cable  hdmi works great  usb works great the device gets quite hot but nothing unusual  the unit is quite small overall  which is great  highly recommended  especially for the price      
81,5.0,                       the quality of this product is much better than i expected everything is fine  i am in a good mood with this product  when i plug in my phone  there will be no delay from plug in to recognition on the computer the phone will start charging and the computer will recognize it this is a great product     
82,5.0,                       my office needs an adapter  my friend recommended me to buy this usb  and i have been using it now  i feel the effect is great  it converts a usb c into five ports for data transmission  internet connection and charging   the function is very versatile  and it is very convenient to use  it is completely different from what i imagined      
83,5.0,                       works as expected  looks nice  compatible with everything i ve plugged it into      
84,1.0,                       i ordered this a couple of months ago because i needed the extra ports  i used usb and ethernet and they worked fine  i just tried connecting an hdmi monitor and it doesn t work at all  the return window is closed now so its useless      
85,5.0,                       this one recommended by a friend is very small and easy to carry  it is very convenient to go anywhere  it is also a lot of mobile phones and ipads at once  the style is very cute and very practical  especially now special mobile phones  ipads  and computers can be done at one time      
86,5.0,                       great product i needed it for all my dj connections on the newer macbook pro computer  everything g worked     
87,5.0,                       my laptop only have   usb c port   this little thing allow me to add  extra usb ports  hdmi and  network adapter   all ports worked perfectly   the device looks well made and fit my needs      
88,3.0,                       i bought this to enhance my chromecast with google tv  the one with the remote    despite aukey usually being pretty trustworthy and reliable  this hub simply doesn t work like it should   it causes my devices to just go into a constant reboot loop  unusable   buy with caution      
89,5.0,                       great quality and it works well with a dell precision      as well as a      macbook pro      
90,5.0,                       i love this product i use it with my s  plus for dex as well as my lenovo ideapad   to add gigabit ethernet and additional ports     
91,5.0,                       bought this for my macbook pro and it is excellent  nice and compact  sleek design  i ve tried it with ethernet  flash drive  hdmi  and a mouse adapter  i even tried it out on my ipad pro and it works great  it does get a little warm  but that s to be expected  warm  not hot  if you need a usb c hub  this is a great value      
92,5.0,                       this hub works   i initially purchased a different power pass delivery type hub and it did not work with my hp spectre x       inch   it kept connecting and disconnecting   this aukey hub  however  works perfectly   i can now power my laptop without losing a port   i am a happy customer      
93,5.0,                       was very handy in this work ftom home situation  was anle to connect my projector with my laptop and stream     
94,5.0,                       i was looking for small usb c hub to travel with and this one fit the bill and was pretty cheap  finding a small usb c hub that can accept and pass on   w or more was an issue  most seem to be able   w  but  this one does  delivering full power from the charger  and providing more usb and an hdmi port in a compact packet  no issues using them      
95,1.0,                       adapter is super hot  only ethernet cable is connected loosing the connection at least three times a day     returning     
96,5.0,                       the workmanship is very good  the texture is very good  it s very convenient  it s not big or light  it s very textured  and the materials used are also very particular  compact and does not take up space     
97,1.0,                       normally i am quite happy with aukey products but i must have received a bad unit  hdmi out does not work  neither do the usb ports  the usb c pd port does work and i was able to charge my macbook which is good  but without the other things working there is no point in using this nice and slim and easy to transport  disappointed this didn t work      
98,5.0,                       i bought this usb c hub for my surface pro   and it worked great  i ve been trying many usb c hubs from other brands  some of them didn t last long and some of them were big heavy to carry  although this model is small  it has all the functions i need and its small size makes it so much more convenient to carry around  it actually makes my business trips a bit easier  definitely recommend this model      
99,5.0,                       perfect  exactly as described     
100,5.0,                       it has the basic things you need  i have been using it with a single external monitor and it works fantastically  the pass through power works great as well  other usb c hubs often have slots for an sd card but this one sacrifices card readers for its small size      
101,4.0,                       bought it for dell latitude       the i  version w  thunderbolt usb c   the usb hub works fine  but the pd pass through and ethernet doesn t the ethernet controller is correctly recognized by windows    if the hub is powered by laptop  but with an external pd power source connected   powering the laptop  the ethernet controller disconnects  or sometimes shows up as an  unrecognized usb device   meanwhile the hdmi port works like a hit   miss        
102,4.0,                       the hdmi did not work with my lenovo laptop  the company was very good about sending a replacement  but it didn t work either  probably a compatibility issue  promptly gave me a refund   the other ports all work great  probably works fine with a mac      
103,2.0,                       the good  i really like having all the variety of ports  all the ports work and it arrived quickly  cons  this product works but it has developed a high pitch ringing whining noise and it s only been a few days  i cannot comment on longevity or durability because i haven t had it that long  i m hoping  the noise isn t and indication of what s coming      
104,4.0,                       customer service aukey has reached out to me and offered a refund or replacement  satisfactory customer service       i bought this for my macbook pro       honestly thought it was pretty good until the other day  when i plugged in my external display with hdmi  did i realize it did not output the audio through the monitor  quite annoying that the audio was only coming from my macbook instead this is still a decent adapter if you don t need that  though      
105,3.0,                       after only a month of regular use this thing surges and is a      paper weight      
106,3.0,                       doesn t work with the new chromecast for ethernet connection  others do so it s dumb this doesn t  if you use it for something else i give it   stars      
107,5.0,                       i ve been looking for accessories for my macbook so i can have ports  this product does exactly that  works great for what i need      
108,5.0,                       hub works great  the aluminum case is nice and hefty and it seems like it will hold up well  the only thing i would change is to make the cord to the computer detachable so it could be swapped out for a longer  shorter option  no complaints though  would recommend      
109,5.0,                       the product quality is excellent  the appearance is simple and generous  convenient to store  does not take up space  the other is cost effective  very affordable  very good  will continue to support  beautiful appearance  suitable size  easy to carry     
110,5.0,                       i use this at the office  we have an open office plan  so i take my computer and find a different place to work frequently  i need to plug in my headset and keyboard dongle repeatedly  so i just leave them plugged in to this so i can attach all my usb type a devices and an hdmi monitor all at once to my laptop usb c connection  saves wear and tear on the usb dongles  and i never break one off in my computer any more  this device looks well made and feels very solid  no  twist   and seems like it will last quite a while      
111,5.0,                       used with power block to add devices and storage to chromecast   works perfectly      
112,5.0,                       this usb c hub is great to take anywhere  it is light and feels very durable i chose this one since it had all the ports i needed  most of the other usb c hubs have the sd card readers which i do not use at all so i was happy i was able to find this one works great and transfers data quickly     
113,5.0,                       very good product  really satisfactory  easy and simple to use  no issue connecting usb s and a monitor using hdmi port  makes it smaller and the addition of the ethernet port works for me  this one is a little bit more solid than the other ones i ve used      
114,3.0,                       desperately tried to set this up to work in conjunction with our fire stick  but it just simply would not work  had to purchase the usb adapter too  but it would not pass good ethernet and no matter what we did  it simply would not work      stars for  quality design  though      
115,4.0,                       it works  it is compact  does not pass power to intel compute stick with core m   type c   sometimes it works with intel compute stick  but     of time it does not tested with hp folio g    power delivery works i have totu   in    it is more expensive  but works better      
116,2.0,                       whenever my macbook pro went to sleep and then woke back up  the ethernet function of this device did not wake up as well   you have to unplug and replug it over and over   other usb devices attached to the usb hub worked fine  i have solid  gps ethernet throughout my office with cat  cables  switches etc but this device would only support     mbps or less the aukey device makes an irritating hissing noise when ethernet was in use      
117,5.0,                       i like this hub very much  it is very convenient  good traveling  good quality of material and the thickness is very thin   i recommend to buy this      
118,5.0,                       very well made  it does the job it was designed to do   looks good too      
119,5.0,                       good quality and works great specially i like the idea of having ethernet slot as well  the aluminum case is always great      
120,5.0,                       for some reason  the trend these days is to reduce io  no extra usb     ports  no ethernet  etc  this device mitigates all the problems with my laptop  with extra usb ports for my controller and external hard drive  a usb type c to charge my phone  an ethernet port for faster internet  and an hdmi port for using an extra monitor  the product has a very good build quality  and it looks sleek  couldn t be happier with the product      
121,5.0,                       great tool to have for all it techs     
122,5.0,                       it is really useful      
123,5.0,                       the usb c hub is easy to use  just plug and play  has the necessary slots for my son who is in college one thing i would suggest is to remove the sd card slots since most laptops have built in slots anyway the hub did not get hot after consistent usage but i did find something   when powered by an external power source for power delivery  the hub had some strange vibration humming from inside  not sure if this is due to insufficient power    w  as opposed to the    w requirement overall  a good purchase  i have used aukey products before and never been disappointed by the quality   longevity of their products      
124,5.0,                       i purchased this for my ipad pro        it allows me to connect a hard drive so that i can download and upload pictures  it has also allowed me to connect a usb wireless mouse  this also has the ability to be connected to a tv allowing you to display your tablet or phone screen on a  k tv  i haven t used the internet connection option so i wouldn t be able to tell you how that works  if you have a device with a usb c port then i highly recommend this item      
125,5.0,                       i m an it professional  and i cannot afford to have problems with my computer or peripherals when doing work for my clients  i need my hardware to be compact  light  and reliable  i look at the technology i use with a critical eye  and i have high expectations when it comes to the technology i purchase  that being said  this hub meets and exceeds my expectations i m using the qgeem   in  usb c hub on an hp envy x    laptop and a samsung s  plus phone there have been no recognition or connectivity issues on either device  the hub connects flawlessly to both my windows and android devices while it is not likely that i will ever have the need to utilize all   ports on the hub at once  i did utilize   out of the   ports on my laptop   all but the hdmi and usb c pd  and had absolutely no issues at all i ve been using this device for    hours a day  and have had no unexpected disconnects or hiccups at all if you are looking for an affordable  compact  multi function hub  this is a very sturdy and reliable choice  don t hesitate to buy      
126,5.0,                       i picked a good seller    quality is same as what i expected  quality is good  fast shipping  prefect for my surface pro      
127,4.0,                       this has been working great for an extra monitor and the ethernet connection but having the extra usb ports are really coming in handy for my wife s computer      
128,5.0,                       small and compact   my laptop only has   usb and i m always losing my mouse usb from changing it out for other items  this hub works great and solves that issue      
129,4.0,                       this is a great hub  both usb ports  ethernet  charger  and hdmi all work at the same time without any lag that i have noticed  it is portable and nice looking  with a nice aluminum feel to the outside awesome one stop shop adapter for a single monitor setup  the one issue is when i restart my mac  it will not actually finish booting up if this adapter plugged in  in other words  when i restart  my mac gets stuck showing the apple logo on screen forever until the adapter is unplugged  this is annoying for a monitor setup because it means i have to open my computer and unplug this every time i restart to switch to bootcamp windows  this has been the case for the past two osx updates      macbook pro other than that one mishap  this thing is amazing and i have no idea how all that data is coming thru a tiny usb c      
130,5.0,                       does exactly what i needed it to do     
131,3.0,                       ethernet dosent work with google chromecast tv      
132,2.0,                       updated  ethernet port stopped working so i returned it perfect for what i need  my new laptop only has two usb ports and i needed   plus an ethernet port  this provided exactly what i needed and works great      
133,5.0,                    excelente hub con una construcci n muy s lida  materiales de caldiad por el precio  las entradas usb  hdmi  ethernet y usb c funcionan perfectamente el empaque simple con lo justo         
134,3.0,                       i was not able to use a usb c power adaptor in the usb c port to power my chromecast w  google tv      
135,5.0,                       it s ok to use it for a while  but you can connect to a lot of usb devices  such as usb drives  keyboards and mice  lights  etc in addition to the poor charging capacity  other applications are quite strong usb devices are a lot of must haves      
136,4.0,                       very small and portable  tested  ethernet   power through with macbook pro       thunderbolt    and with lenovo ideapad     the ethernet   usb ports works  but hdmi doesn t for some reason  didn t find any drivers for windows to fix this     
137,5.0,                       you have got a new usb c laptop like a mac book pro  and you want use those old ports from your old computer stuff like regular usb hdmi ethernet display port all those old connections that you used to use everyday then you gonna need a usb c hub  i would highly recommend this product since it has an port for any kind of input      
138,5.0,                       i bought this to use with my new macbook pro  which only has usb c ports  works great  i use it to charge my iphone and also my backup drive  but good to know that the other types of ports are available in case i ever need them

140,5.0,                       like everyone i am adjusting to working from home  and wifi for virtual meetings just is not cutting it  enter this wonderful aukey product  it gives my laptop so much more functionality and i can connect it directly through ethernet causa sadly many laptops lack this port      
141,5.0,                       all plugs at once   usb c pd port  hdmi port  gigabit ethernet port   x usb     data portsthere is no need to change the plugs regularly  i really liked it because it has a usb c plug  it s very organized and easy to use      
142,5.0,                       the state is stable  the workmanship is exquisite  the periphery has a metal texture  and the design is very good  the speed is very stable  it can be used when plugged into the computer  very very satisfied      
143,5.0,                       this usb c hub is great  it s the perfect size for travel  but it doesn t sacrifice quality  the ethernet port is super fast and there s no latency between usb hdmi devices      
144,1.0,                       stop working after one month      
145,5.0,                       good quality product  would buy again      
146,2.0,                       great size for traveling and solid build  low rating because the hdmi doesn t work on it  shows image but i ve run multiple tests and machines and it just flickers in and out  bad design or faulty product      
147,2.0,                       i purchased this to upgrade my    mbit insignia to gigabit  but this unit too caps out at     megabit    it s not user error    gigabit switch  cat  e cable  macbook pro etc    also  it can t seem to proxy signal to my monitor through the usb c port  so i have to connect directly to my laptop overall  disappointed  but it does simplify my setup a tad      
148,4.0,                       this is a great hub  it gets the job done  all ports work perfectly  get a bit warm but that seems to be normal  cable could be a little longer  recommended      
149,5.0,                       high performance to price ratio  very satisfactory  good quality  good color  good effect  the whole is satisfaction  small and cute  no space  just put it on the back of the computer      
150,4.0,                       works well for what my wife needed since her hp laptop didn t have built in ethernet   we recently had fiber optic service installed   my desktop consistently gets      mbps   the well equipped  sufficient ram and has m  ssd  laptop using this device gets    mbps or less   not sure if it s a limitation of the device or limitation of the laptop  but i would be surprised if it s a limitation of the laptop      
151,3.0,                       this hub was perfect when it worked    i use it for my macbook pro for ethernet  hdmi  and power via usb c  recently the power has been cutting in and out making the hub unusable for that purpose  waiting to hear back from aukey s customer support regarding replacement refund        
152,5.0,                       bought this hub because it had the perfect combination of ports for my macbook pro running big sur   ethernet  hdmi for a monitor  and two usbs for mouse and keyboard  the usb c power delivery was a bonus  but not necessary for me because i have two usb c ports i ordered this hub because my old ethernet to usb     adapter stopped working when i updated my macbook to big sur  driverkit update   this hub  however  works with big sur and lets me use ethernet again  i m getting my normal speed of     mbps  so i don t actually know if the adapter provides gigabit ethernet  but it definitely seems to work at speeds over    mbps  the hdmi lets me do     p    hz  i m not sure if it will do    hz with a different computer  but i think that s the maximum my mac can do it gets a little warm  but that s to be expected with the power delivery  and it has not gotten alarmingly hot yet  the exterior is metal and looks feels pretty nice  which probably also helps with heat dissipation      
153,5.0,                       love this product    purchased to help k    kiddo who is learning remotely this year  worked immediately as a plug and play device for her acer chromebook supplied by the school  no more slow wifi connection     speedy ethernet connection will ensure she is the first to answer the teacher s question  did not attempt the power delivery pass through  but the usb    and ethernet connections worked perfect with no downloads or updates  couldn t be happier  thanks aukey     
154,5.0,                       works great out of the box with huawei matebook x pro  gigabit connection is fast and reliable  usb and hdmi connections work perfectly without any issues  the power pass thru is probably the best feature  since it lets you connect everything to a single usb c port on your laptop  the cord is a little short  but on the other hand  perfect for keeping in a laptop bag and mobile use   i keep this plugged into my desk with the laptop s power adapter plugged into it  a wired ethernet connection  and several usb devices  including usb hubs   and i can keep all of those cords out of the way by just using a usb c extension cable between the adapter and the laptop  there are even several that match the finish  the adapter also looks nice  feels high quality and well designed  and the space grey aluminum finish matches  many current laptops very well  apple  huawei  etc   this also works out of the box with linux      
155,5.0,                       this hub is perfect for transfering and data to from my pc laptop to my phone  usb memomory  and displaying my phone pc via hdmi to an external monitor  works flawlessly and does not skip a beat  i have used with my microsoft surface go as dual screen set up by connecting it to my portable monitor  easy on the go set up all fits in my backpack and can work from anywhere  also  charging capabilities are a perfect pass through  also  can be used my with my samsung note    plus to transmit my samsung dex to my portable monitor for another on the go set up when ever i dont pack my laptop  this is the perfect addition to my tech bag  i would definitly recommened to any one looking for a hub and also can provide internet via ethernet port since my surface go table only has a usb c port      
156,5.0,                       for drone racing in the field we need a computer for our laptimer  it s connected to the laptimer over ethernet and i use a single port macbook  i d tried a usb hub and a usb ethernet adapter i had but it was broken and or wasn t working but this does the job and will keep us timing our races out in the field without having to unplug the laptimer between heats so that i can charge the laptop      
157,2.0,                       hdmi has intermittent black screen then back  gigabit ethernet did not come on sometimes  after a while it became very hot  something must be wrong internally      
158,5.0,                       i purchased this to replace a lenovo travel hub that i was using to hook up all of my peripherals as i teach my online classes  i have to use an ethernet cable  an hdmi  a microphone and a writing tablet via usb c  all of these devices work better with the new hub   the writing tablet in particular  it is no longer glitchy with the new hub because of the much higher transfer speeds  it has made teaching my online classes way less frustrating      
159,4.0,                       not a connection issue  only a device  otherwise it is a solid item      
160,3.0,                       it feels a little cheap and the plugs are tight   too tight   it s functional and will work for travel  but it s not something that i would use on a daily basis      
161,5.0,                       it has all the ports necessary  i use it with macbook pro which only have usb c port so this was a must need for me  and trust me this work very good and fast  i usually use this to connect my mac to external monitor and to charge my samsung phone also  so this is so helpful to me and works great      
162,2.0,                       plugged device into usb c port  recognized as a generic hub  attempted to plug an hdmi cable in  result is no signal on monitor i review the instructions included  which for a small hub such as this  there should be none   the instructions tell me to give up   of the   ports to power the device  which means that this is really a   to   usb hub  and i would lose the usb pass through  which it clearly states is available  i attempt this anyway  still no signal on monitor  no change on how the device registers on my laptop i verified the usb c port with a thumb drive and it works fine i am attempting to contact aukey support  but based on the instruction guide  i expect i ll be returning this product as it appears to be not as advertised  i require a hub with hdmi  at least   usb c port  and at least   usb a  the ethernet would have been a nice bonus      
163,1.0,                       just got a new macbook and it fried the computer  return the computer and fried the battery of the other one too  this thing kills computers      
164,5.0,                       works fine     
165,4.0,                       i purchased this hub adapter to add wired internet to my daughter s laptop for her zoom meetings at home  the hub is well built and compact usb c hub  the hub is powered by the laptop s usb c power cord  when the hub is powered  the ethernet adapter works  when the hub is not powered  the ethernet drops out and the laptop reverts to wifi  this is not a big deal for at home applications but complicates using this port when on the road      
166,5.0,                       the dongle is plug and play  just connect and it is ready to use  very convenient for everyday tasks     
167,5.0,                       quality product that adds   usb a    usb c   hdmi and ethernet port to my tablet  great to dock my tablet when working at home or office and very light compact design and easy to travel with      
168,5.0,                       the hub is quite compact and is made out of solid materials  so i don t have any worry of it dropping and breaking  it is quite convenient and instantly sets up with the laptop  no software needed  overall a quality product      
169,5.0,                       the appearance design style is simple and generous  the product quality is good  the safety is guaranteed  and the performance is stable  very easy to use  satisfied  highly praised      
170,5.0,                       this product works great on all my usb c devices  having    w usb c pd is a blessing  and allows my devices to charge at the fastest rate while adding tons of functionality  it also allows me to download media quickly onto my pixel   via a wired ethernet connection  this is a great addition to my every day carry      
171,5.0,                       really good adapter for usb c  i needed a hdmi port and the other ports are really useful  the aluminum body feels solid and the quality is good      
172,5.0,                       i am very pleased with my usb c hub adapter that i purchased for my ipad  love that it is small and portable which allows me to take anywhere to connect when in need  definitely recommend as i was able to carry it in my purse and pull it out as often as i needed  i ve been able to connect my hdmi to it to view my phone on a tv  perfect to connect macbook air to internet when there is only an access via an ethernet cord  also can use the usb to connect zip drive to save memory space on my ipad      
173,1.0,                       i recently purchased an m  macbook air  seeing as how the m  only comes with   usb c ports i wanted to get a dongle that would allow me to dock the laptop and plug in a keyboard  monitor and power  the build of this product isn t bad  the case almost feels the same as the macbook aluminum  the wire is typical and the usb c end feels good when plugging it in  no complaints there  however  when i try to use the hdmi on this dongle i can only get   hz on my monitor  this is a known problem with the new macbooks though  however  my anker usb c to hdmi dongle works just fine at   hz so there must be something specifically wrong with this dongle  if you want to use hdmi on an m  mac  do not buy this dongle  another issue is the hissing  when you plug a power adapter into this dongle there is a very noticeable hissing that comes from the dongle  while this isn t the most uncommon thing for anything running power through it  i d expect an easier design like this to not have coil whine  so if you need to plug the power adapter into this dongle and you don t feel like hearing a terrible  constant high pitched noise  do not buy this dongle  i will give props to the ethernet and usb   ports though  no issues on this  overall     stars considering this product is     and only   out of the   functions work properly  very disappointed and will be returning      
174,2.0,                       it runs hot even when no devices are connected to it   when it s just connected to my mac i ll be returning it      
175,5.0,                       i like this product very much  it is sleek  easy to carry  and uses high quality materials  it works with both my macbook pro and macbook air  it is used to connect external monitor  ethernet  microphone  mouse  and keyboard  highly recommended      
176,5.0,                       love the size and functionality      
177,5.0,                       i have ordered a few different thunderbolt   usb c hubs for my machine  this device is easily the most well made and the best value for price  everything worked right out of the box  i currently have a monitor  mouse  keyboard  and gigabit ethernet connected to my machine through this hub      
178,5.0,                       i needed a usb c to ethernet adapter  and made the mistake of buying a cheaper  less familiar brand that just didn t work at all with my macbook pro  i returned it and ordered this aukey adapter like i should have done in the first place  it cost a little more than similar adapters  but the build quality is solid and performance out of the box is great   good ethernet and usb speeds  i can plug my macbook power adapter into it  and it has nice touches like led lights to indicate power and ethernet activity  a great choice      
179,5.0,                       i keep this in my backpack and it is my go to hub when on the road      
180,1.0,                       used it without any problems  till i needed to use the ethernet port  never was able to connect to the internet without wi fi     
181,5.0,                       the product has been used for two days  the quality is very good  it s compact and portable  it has four sockets  it basically meets the needs  it s easier to use than the ones i bought before  it s very stable  it won t drop off  if you need it  we recommend you to buy this one     
182,5.0,                       love it  works great and does what s advertised  gets very warm when you are charging  transfering files to usb and using the ethernet port all at once  but that is to be expected  cools down very quickly      
183,5.0,                       i am happy to say that this hub works perfectly with the new macbook  i had ordered several hub s until i found this one   some of the hub s that are sold on amazon  only have one working port at a time  so make sure you test it out before the return period expires      
184,5.0,                       does what it s supposed to do  plugged it in  connected monitor  everything just worked  nice and small  can take it anywhere  much cheaper than buying a dedicated dock  great purchase      
185,5.0,                       i was mainly impressed with the metal casing  it feels much more expensive than it is  functions really well  it also securely holds the cords like the hdmi which usually has a tendency of slipping out over time  with this though  not moving  great product overall also a reputable brand that makes a lot of other good tech products     
186,5.0,                       it has ethernet port  hdmi and two usb ports  what more could you want     
187,2.0,                       i have had to return two of these hubs because both corrupted the hdmi signal from my new      macbook pro  the image comes through with thousands of dropped pixels  which display as either green or pink  i have a different brand hub connected now  and the issue is gone the other ports that i used  all except ethernet  functioned as expected      
188,4.0,                       it seems well built and has the ports i wanted  once in a while the monitor goes blank and i have to unplug and replug the hdmi cable  i know it s not the cable so it must be a quirk of the hub      
189,3.0,                       after   week of using on my macbook pro     overall it s a good all in   hub meet my requirements   however there is   issue  the hub is getting really hot after hours of using   i noticed this issue because my mouse started getting laggy because of it  after removing it from the hub  the mouse is working as expected  however the hub is still so hot that i cannot touch it         
190,5.0,                       mini product is very convenient to used with ipad  computers   high quality and very sensitive  this product looks very high level  and i love its silver case      
191,5.0,                       pass through power works well on chromebooks  hdmi and ethernet ports work well  provides power to usb ports since it s a usb pass through  seems quite sturdy and is a handy little device      
192,5.0,                       strong sense of design  exquisite workmanship  especially some details  simple and generous appearance  exquisite workmanship  rich and powerful functions  good quality  moderate size and stable performance  very satisfied with small items     
193,5.0,                       aukey has continued to become a reliable brand in tech accesories especially when compared to cheaper competitors  their products are reliable and work like advertised      
194,1.0,                       doesn t work for macs     
195,4.0,                       i bought this specifically to use for the google tv to add ethernet   but it isn t giving it enough power using the google tv charger or with an aukey quickcharge     charger   the instructions don t mention anything about how to power the hub to get it to work   returningupdate support got back to me and returned my money  but also shipped out a replacement   support is great  device seems good  just not for google tv update i received the new device and while it still doesn t work with my google tv  it works as expected for other devices   support has been very quick to respond and have done their best to help      
196,5.0,                       lots of hubs out there  in different sizes  with different outlets  in different numbers and combinations  this one is sized just right  with the right mix for my needs      
197,5.0,                       it has novel appearance and unique design  it can be used in computer expansion or desktop charging  from the appearance  the workmanship is fine  the touch is not firm  and it has weight in the hand     
198,5.0,                       i have been using the hub during the last   months  such an incredible buy  the transfer speed support usb      the rj   works as expected and the device is compact and is constructed in aluminium  giving them a durable worklife      
199,5.0,                       i know aukey is a reliable brand as i have had one of their power banks for about   years now  since i have been remote learning for school  i considered connecting my laptop to a spare monitor i have to get more screen real estate  however  my laptop does not have any hdmi outputs for an external connection  i considered on purchasing a usb c hub that has several usb a ports for peripherals  a hdmi port  and an ethernet for when i can get direct internet  the aukey usb c hub   in   checked all of those boxes and i am extremely satisfied with the product      
200,5.0,                       product feels premium and is great for traveling  will easily fit in a pocket bought for college and very happy with my purchase      
201,3.0,                       this product overheats when i use the ethernet port and hdmi port at the same time  that s all i m using it for   in addition  my ethernet cable needs to be placed at the right angle in order to work  so moving it may cause it to stop working again  overall  i don t trust the heating issue not to damage my cables and laptop ports  using it with a macbook pro   and will likely return it      
202,1.0,                       bought this to hook up my second monitor to my laptop  monitor consitently cuts out every       seconds  it s not the cable  because the cable works fine using a different usb hub  its not the port on my laptop  i tried using a different device absolutely waste of money  do not buy  had to get a refund immediately      
203,5.0,                       thank god i only have to plug in   cable only  now i get my ethernet  more secure than wifi   hdmi responsive and works with the laptop closed too  usb     works well  and charge pass through  ill see if i can update after some use      
204,2.0,                       works fine  solid build  when using the stock charger for my samsung galaxy tab s  connected directly to the tablet  it says   hours until fully charged  connecting the same charger to the tablet through the hub with nothing else connected  it says   hours to fully charged      
205,5.0,                       aukeys usb hub is well built and gives you everything you need in one small package  it s really easy to carry around and it s made out of metal      
206,4.0,                       i love that this adaptor has an hdmi port especially  sturdy device  but not the best at staying cool  heats up a tad bit even after just   minutes of use  highly recommend buying the insurance for it      
207,3.0,                       i love the idea of this and if it fully worked  it d be a dream  mine has issues with the ethernet cord and the usb ports  one works  but with a wireless mouse  it definitely has a lag to it  i wish it worked fully      
208,2.0,                       won t able to charge my      macbook pro   battery percent go lower over time  i use both usb ports for my wireless mouse and keyboard   when the hub is plugged into both hdmi  and ethernet  usb ports will malfunction  and the keyboard and mouse won t work gets extremely heated  without any reason very disappointed with this device     
209,5.0,                       the workmanship is very good  the appearance is not rough at all  it is very beautiful  the wire is ok  plug in a few usb devices  it doesn t matter  the transmission speed is still good  it s a good choice for people who don t have any extreme requirements  there is no problem with the quality and performance  and it has a good performance price ratio      
210,5.0,                       like how it makes using your cellphone with a bluetooth keyboard much easier      
211,5.0,                       i purchased this for my home office to make it easier to connect my laptop to my peripherals at home   great to see reliable docks coming this way     
212,5.0,                       the item arrived very quickly and well packed  i used it to connect my thinkpad t series office laptop to my home monitor keyboard muse and wireless headphones  it works like a charm  the display quality of the monitor doesn t drop a bit  the usb hub is very sleek and looks very premium quality  very please with the product and will definitely recommend to my all      
213,4.0,                       this is a good quality hub and i would recommend it for most people  i was able to hook up a  nd monitor and hardwire my internet to my laptop  internet speeds were very good with fios gigabit however   stars because you can not hook up two additional monitors  i had hoped you could hook up a monitor via hdmi and another one via usb c so if you have no need for two additional monitors i would highly recommend this product      
214,3.0,                       the hub appears to be well built and the selection of ports is just what i wanted  hdmi and power delivery worked well  unfortunately the ethernet connection continually disconnected  this would often occur for no apparent reason right in the middle of reading a web page  other times it would disconnect when i was trying to access items on the local network  device manager would show the ethernet adapter as disabled and it wouldn t re enable by right clicking and selecting enable  re booting would fix the problem for a few minutes but then it would disconnect again  i will be returning the hub      
215,3.0,                       i m not sure if i love it yet   when i have it connected to my macbook air and step away so the computer screen goes dark or it goes to sleep  when i come back to wake it up    it doesn t always wake up my monitor   sometimes i have to unplug it and plug it back in before it ll connect correctly   plus it s a little warm  not horribly but still      
216,5.0,                       i recently purchased this for my new macbook pro      and it works perfectly  i tested the product and each port  everything works perfectly fine      
217,4.0,                       it s got   usb   ports which is fantastic as well as a usb c for pass through charging  however  the usb c can only be used to charge the macbook laptop you have the hub connected to  i tried using the usb c port on the hub for charging my phone  or attaching a flash drive peripheral and it just doesn t work with any of those  so the usb c port on the hub is only for charging the laptop      
218,3.0,                       first one i got started smoking and never worked  replacement worked fine
