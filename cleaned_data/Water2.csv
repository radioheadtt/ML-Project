0,1.0,                       i tested the ph of icelandic water  the result is same as my house tap water  around ph    but the advertisements tell us the ph is      at the same time  i also tested the ph of avian  the color is even darker than icelandic s and they only mark the ph         
1,5.0,                       initially i was hesitant about this product and actually did not initially rate it well but i gave it a second chance and the very next day i drank more of this water than i ever have any other  i have now drank this water for an entire week and just feel amazing   the taste is pure and neutral  you don t taste anything  it s water   i used to drink evian and fiji on the regular  but i have drank other high ph waters for many years but none of them were as easy to drink and tasted as neutral as this water  i ve now also subscribed to this deliver because when i worked out the current price  it came out to only       per bottle u s  dollars which is insane for water this good and high quality  normally i pay            for other brands in the   liter size category in this ph category of spring water as well  i gave it a chance and i drink way more water now than i have which was what i really needed to do for my health   oh and unlike some reviews you see on amazon now  this is not paid for sponsored  i never get paid or approached for any reviews  so this is just me loving this product       
2,5.0,                       this is quality water and very affordable  during my mothers chemo treatment i started buying the ph water in our local stores  then looked on amazon to see if i could get a better price  i read a lot of the reviews and looked at my cost per oz  and found icelandic glacial water  the water has a nice taste and smooth texture  very pleasant to drink cold or at room temp  as i stated above  i started having my    yr old mother drink ph water during her rounds of chemo  we can tell a tremendous difference in her stamina  little to no nausea and her hair has thinned but not falling out  she has chemo every   wks and comes home with the neulasta onpro  so she is having very strong treatments  i am amazed how much this water is making a difference in her skin color  stamina and over all well being  three variables that have made the difference  pray  chemo and the ph balance water      
3,5.0,                       as someone who has been to iceland and was given a tour of the icelandic glacial water facility where they bottle this water  and has seen the source of the water  i can assure you there is no false advertising with them  it is bottled at the source and they keep their facility so clean that we had to be covered from top to bottom before beginning the tour  they make their own bottles and it is directly from the source  so much so that their bottling process is designed so that the water is never exposed to the open air until someone buys a bottle and opens it for the first time  if you shake up a bottle of dasani and shake up a bottle of icelandic glacial water you ll see and taste the difference i ve been drinking this water for     years and won t have any other bottled water in my fridge  not many stores near us sell this water so it is nice to have the option to order it by the case here      
4,5.0,                       ok i know its a bit  exotic  and the marketing will be the first thing someone criticizes  i suffer from a life long gastrointestinal immune disorder  acidity is a byproduct problem and admittingly i m not as disciplined as i should be with my diet  i tried this    ph water as a recommendation and i have to say it helps me a lot  i was so skeptical  when i make coffee i use it  normally coffee for me is not a great idea  but to beat fatigue i have to go for it  when i do  i brew my own and use this water  again i m not one to be a nut about any food  especially since i ve been told by the best doctors there is no one diet that can  fix  me  but this water helps  i swear by it  i have made it a habit to use this water at least when i first wake up and go to bed  i have seen my usage of proton inhibitors drop from daily to     times a week and sometimes   for   or more weeks since i started using this  i believe it is assisting my gi tract with digestion  or at least reducing acidity without aggravating the already overactive nervous system  evidence for that for me would be simply drinking something more acidic  when i do  an increase in flair ups is guaranteed  i try to balance a slightly acidic meal or liquid with this and well   i feel better  in addition  this water tastes amazingly clean  anyone i ve given it to  without explanation they love it  so for me worth the cost      
5,5.0,                       this is my favorite water but unfortunately it is way over priced here on amazon  i was able to get a couple of the   liter cases of    for        each once but since then it never dips below     and is mostly     and up  these smaller     milliliter    count cases are outrageously priced      and change is just way too much  i finally settled on fiji water at sam s club that runs     a case for    of the      oz  bottles  you an occasionally catch them on sale cheaper than that at sam s too  amazon has the fiji     liter bottle case of    for     which is a good deal if you are ok with the large size  but back to icelandic  it is hands down the best tasting water and it tests out really good on tds and akalinity  only buy when you can find it reasonably priced and that just doesn t seem to be in amazon s plans  look elsewhere for icelandic unless you just have the     to afford it      
6,1.0,                       i ordered   cases of the plastic bottles from amazon  i have always purchased the glass bottles but thought i would try the less expensive plastic bottles  there should be a warning that this product can cause kidney damage if consumed in plastic bottles  this product gave my family the worse back pain ever  we found out that it was our kidney s and to stop drinking the water  after reading in several blogs that the plastic icelandic uses is one of the worse on the market for plastic microfiber contamination by the world health organization  who   i usually purchase   cases of    glass bottles       each and never had a problem  but this is unbelievable   these bottles are killing your customers and the environment amazon is only allowing one refund  and will not take the opened or unopened box back  i literally have to waste product and my money      
7,5.0,                       excellent  excellent water  i just wish it was more affordable  has a crisp clean taste and best of all it is a high ph and fluoride free      
8,1.0,                       i have an auto immune condition   higher ph is better for me than lower   was excited to receive this   tested it as soon as i got it   registered at         that isn t good for anybody   at the very least it should be    i have no idea what went wrong   plastic  heat   light  nevertheless  save your money and your back   ordering a case is not a good idea unless your a  weight lifter    very heavy  returned for a refund      
9,5.0,                       doesn t have a funky minerally water taste  taste very refreshing  enough minerals that you can tell it s not crappy re filtered tap water   the bottles are bpa free  so if they are shipped in a hot truck  you re not gonna end up tasting the plastic in your water either    just all over amazing water  i ve bought it twice already  my daughter and i can t get enough  and i usually can t get her to drink water at all       
10,5.0,                       i am grateful for this water  for  yrs since diagnosis of gerd  and ibs  it s been a battle of combination of different pills  none of those combinations working effectively   when i started doing research on ph levels and alkaline for the relief of gastrointestinal issues   and this water being listed as  of top   well i thought it couldn t hurt   from my first   ounce cup   i noticed relief right away   a week later and no more need for the acid reflux pills   or the anti spasmodic pills for the lower gastrointestinal system   i only drink   ounces daily  and this has been a godsend for me  no more flare ups of gerd or ibs  controlled naturally   forever grateful        
11,3.0,                       i ve been drinking this water for several months now and i have very little or no plaque  i can t wait for my doctor appointment on may         to see what my dentist will say  significant reduction in plaque however my october      water received tasted flat  i went to a store in our area that get their products from iceland  i bought the same bottle of water from them  see the difference in the pic  i think the one on the left  bought from amazon is a knockoff  the upc code is larger and the writing above is way to the left  look at the words carbonneutral product  there is one line of writing underneath while the bottle on the right the upc is smaller and the writing above is over the upc code  and under the word carbonneutral product  there are   lines of writing  amazon i need an explanation   i will be buying my water from another store      
12,5.0,                       i love this water   it doesn t have a  soft  taste but it is also not overly mineral y   it just tastes clean and fresh  exactly the way water is supposed to   i have tried many other brands of premium and non premium bottled water  including fiji  evian  voss  volvic  smart water  and others  and i like the taste of icelandic the best   i also find that i drink more water when i have it on hand   the slim  square ish bottle shape allows me to pack more bottles into my refrigerator  but it still fits in the cup holder of my car      
13,5.0,                       it s absolutely tasteless and wonderful  i m usually a fiji drinker but i have to admit fiji tastes like day old spit   i cannot actually verify this claim because i don t actually know how a bucket of day old spit tastes  this is merely an opinion  what i do know or at least have been told by people smarter than me   which btw you are the average of the   people you hang out with the most  that s why i only associate with rocket scientists      but i digress   what i have been told is fiji is bpa free and contains silica which binds with aluminum and flushes from your body   i digress yet again   this is not a review for fiji   what i m trying to say is this water is fabulous and without the    coupon i would not know that because it s priced above my pay grade  therefore if you can afford it i can t believe you would be disappointed but as for me when these    are gone i will return to a bucket of spit aka fiji and live by the mantra if it tastes good it is not good for you   unless of course it s from iceland      
14,1.0,                       the box was busted open    liter was missing and a couple of them were mashed up      
15,5.0,                       best taste  conducted a taste test with friends of premium water and icelandic hands down winner  i bought a digital ph meter and tds meter to check out various waters  the ph and tds  total disoluved solids  checkout  in fact the tds was below     one of the few natural waters that has high ph  excellent hydration   non acidic  and low tds      
16,5.0,                       first  i do not like the taste of water   over the years  all types of health care providers have told me to drink more water    try the flavored drops   they said   i am very sensitive to artificial flavors  colors and chemicals   all of the drops i tried gave me headaches or worse   finally one health care provider suggested i try this particular brand of water   i was skeptical   she assured me she did not get kickbacks from the company  nor did she sell the product   she said in her opinion  it was the best tasting water she had ever had   okay   it s a little pricey   but i need to drink more water  so i tried it   it actually tastes better than any water i have ever had   no bubbles  just water   i don t know any kind of magical thing about the ph  but they do make mention of the ph of the water being      i believe   don t know enough physiology or whatever to tell you anything about that   all i know  it s good  i am drinking water like i never have before   i have this on subscription   you might want to try it if you have trouble getting water down like you should  just sayin       
17,1.0,                       water arrived in a torn box with only   not    bottles inside  box inside box did not look like it could hold    bottles     
18,5.0,                       it s refreshing  it s delicious  and nutritious  junior mints  i mean icelandic waters this was on my recommendations and i jumped on the deal some people gave one star because their bottles leaked never had a problem ordering these many times  bottles are strong review the product not ups  underpaid package smashers  ph not    who cares  water is naturally a    want alkaline water buy alkaline water anyways  the bottle design is very unique with a see thru pic of iceland icelandic water tastes much better than most waters i ve tried   no plastic or tap smell won t give you an aftertaste or gritty teeth or dry throat      
19,3.0,                       my second order of icelandic  the water is great  icelandic is   star water     but    packaging    shipping from amazon terrible   first order  had a fair size  ding  on outer box  but  cosmetic  contents fine   second order  entire side ripped open on outer and inner boxes    bottles out of inner packaging  loose  three  leaking    my last icelandic water order from amazon  will just pay the slightly higher price at the local store  at least theirs is in one piece  not leaking  and      already cold      
20,5.0,                       i have compared this bottled water with a like product  also fresh spring water  with ph of      while both are very smooth tasting  i prefer the icelandic because it is slightly less costly than the figi water   i need to drink at least a full bottle every other day for my electrolyte balance according to my physician   the best i have found is this icelandic water because of its great taste  reasonable cost and ph factor      
21,5.0,                       water becomes an essential purchase in our living these days due to lots of pollution  whether if we are getting quality water becomes a basis question through years  i always believe getting filtered water from our sink refrigerator is the source of good water  however  with minimal research  you will discover depending on the cities you live in  the water filtration system varies  and some undesirable components stay in the water with the help of subscribing purchase of this icelandic water  we could enjoy full of natural minerals as a portion of our intake water the only downside on the package of this brand is the  package  compared to a rounded shape  the squared bottom makes it hard to fit into a cup holder  or for small children to hold them in hands and the thickness of the bottle makes me believe that each package consumes much plastic materials overall  great taste of water  price is acceptable if you consider with a minimal reach  we could all enjoy the natural icelandic water thanks for amazon subscriptions      
22,4.0,                       so i bought this water after watching zac effron traveling through iceland on his new netflix show  starting crushing hard on both him and the country    decided i  too  needed icelandic water in my life  he made everything look so clean and pure  except my naughty thoughts about him    ok    so the water  it s crisp  it tastes great cold  it s water    i did feel like it had an aftertaste but it s probably the mineral content   which is a good thing according to zac and company  i also appreciate the fact that it comes from a country like iceland that is just so so good at sustainability and being  green   i d much rather support them than our gross u s  companies  looking at you nestle   anyway    happy with my expensive scandinavian water      
23,5.0,                       water should have no taste and that is exactly what a bottle of this water gives you  also like the fact that the water has a higher ph and comes bottled in bpa free plastic  have bought six    cases of this water over the last month and will continue to buy      
24,5.0,                       excellent quality water  i am a first time user of ph water myself  i bought this ph water based on the fact that the source of it comes from an volcanic stream that has natural filtration and is not in contact with outside air which can pollute water  so the only contact it has with outside air is when you open the bottle  it is a bit more expensive the others  but a company that makes there people wear protective scrubs  gloves and given the source of the water  i ll be a buyer of their water because of the care and quality in which they handle something so precious and important that we are putting into our bodies      
25,5.0,                       like many others  i need to drink more water  bottle water always bothered me because i felt stupid for purchasing what could be free  but after a trip to iceland in       this water was was amazing after a long hike i used to laugh when people talked about the taste of water  now i owe them an apology  icelandic glacial has replaced my need for a soda  i m not sayin it tastes like a soda  i m saying it s is the most refreshing thing i have put money on i subscribe monthly to receive icelandic glacial and wish i could make it twice a month      
26,5.0,                       so i ve tried many different spring waters but until i tasted this one i don t think i ever really knew what springwater should really taste like  this water is awesome worth every penny  i did a test myself to make sure that it wasn t just my imagination because it tasted so clean and refreshing next to normal spring water   so i put regular springwater and the glacial water  in two of the same cups    same room temperature everything was the same  closed my eyes and switched the cups around so i wouldn t know which water was in which cup and tasted  it from each cup  every single time i chose the glacier water  try the test yourself  i will never go back to drinking regular spring water now that i have tasted glacier water     
27,1.0,                       i miss the old  iceland spring water   i ve read that its the same company behind that and icelandic glacial only difference was the icelandic glacial was more expensive and a fancier bottle i prefer the first so  i ve been stuck paying a premium for this fancy bottle    fine but now they jacked up the price    for a    l    pack not to mention the price scale of the small bottles    just not even worth it i loved this water  but congrats    you ve made it unaffordable good by icelandic  i ll be looking for a new brand  you priced yourselves out of the market ps   try to stop leaving water in the warehouse for so long  when you do  the ph level drops and it becomes a steady   on the scale   you need to move product faster    maybe    i dunno    lowering the price would help me with that     
28,5.0,                       i really like the very clean pure taste   i truly believe i feel that it helps reduce inflammation with my esophagus  i have a condition  when i drink this over regular filtered water   i got core water before i got this and they are about the same as far as i can tell  core is a little cheeper to buy  taste is the same and ph level is about the same   i will most likely continue to buy both and alternate each day and i get the largest size for both    l and    l   i read all of the reviews on both and there were some criticisms about the ph level both claim   so when i researched taking ph level of water  you will not get an accurate reading using litmus paper testers which is what most people seam to be using   i wouldn t go by those reviews   i feel much better drinking this water knowing how clean and pure they are and will not drink any other bottled water anymore  i will start to mix filtered water with this water though  maybe a     ratio  to save money and still get the benefits      
29,5.0,                       i am guilty of using plastic bottled water but have been unable to break myself   i really like the convenience of a grab and go bottle  i drink lots of water here in hot arizona and always have water with me   i do buy the larger bottles for a little less waste  that said  this is my favorite water and i order it by the case despite its hefty price   at least i am not drinking sugared water or sodas      
30,4.0,                       this water is excellent   springwater in a statue of state is the best for our bodies with naturally occurring minerals and the ph is just right   my two issues are the prize which i understand why it cost so much but i am an ssd and the fact that the bottles are plastic which is not good for the environment the kangen water machine i do not own because it is so expensive and my friend who owns a health food store would deliver it to me in class gallons at our store them in the closet   well  i do not live  in the same place any more therefore i do not get the water is on this water has been awesome i just wish i wasn t throwing bottles into the environment period it has naturally occurring minerals which is amazing and it is very good      
31,5.0,                       this water is just what i would expect in heaven   seriously  it reminds me of very  very fresh spring water i tasted as a child  before human beings had a chance to contaminate it   it is invigorating and has a spirit in it that is truly remarkable   the quality is far superior to other brands claiming to be bottled  at the source  prior to being touched  by human hands    icelandic glacial natural spring water is very special  indeed      
32,5.0,                       i am a water junkie and if my advice counts for anything  this is one of the best tasting waters i have ever had  its so clear and smooth its unbelievable  now i talk about water like its a cocktail or can of soda  and maybe water is water  however this water really is a cut above the rest  and in its category  its cheaper than some other brands i have tried  if you are looking for a nice quality bottled water that will be refreshing as jumping in the pool on a summers day  this maybe for you  i have trouble keeping other peoples hands off of these in my home      
33,5.0,                       earlier this year i was in iceland for about    days  i fell in love with their pure  clean water  i was happy to find out that i could buy this water back home in the us  i have been buying the icelandic water since my return from iceland in february of this year  the ph is     which is a little higher on the alkaline level which i like      
34,4.0,                       i didn t know what to expect when i got these  i drink regular purified water all the time and i m just so tired of that iron ish taste  so i thought i d try these  at first i was like well it just tastes like water  had a little after taste  put one in the freezer for like    mins and then i tasted the difference  it s crisp and clean  nothing like aquafina  dasani or any old store brand purified water  now it s only day one so let s see how it goes  definitely try it cold  and for around a buck    per bottle i think it s ok      
35,5.0,                       i don t care for water  unless it is really clean and pure  my body inhaled this water  so i know it is good and i really like it  i have switched to this brand and put it on subscribe  a little pricey  and i don t much care for the bottles as they tip over easier and thinner   but the water is worth it      
36,5.0,                       this type of water is so sexy  there s only a few brands i trust and sofar i like the balance and ph of this water the best   not too high  not too low  and from what i ve heard it s handled with care  with this  you get a balanced ph level that isn t too high to ruin your stomach or fatigue you at all  like those cheaper higher ph brands  it s right in the     to     range which is great  the water is allegedly freshly taken from some iceland glaciers and has a very nice quality to it  it might just be water but if i were to buy any bottled water  then i want to know where it s coming from  and know i can rely on drinking it  there have been cheap brands where it tasted way too acidic and almost contaminated or recycled to me  it s good to know you can find a quality source that takes it seriously      
37,5.0,                       i really like this water and i m going on my  th or  th purchase  so refreshing when it s cold  great customer service as well  my order was delivered with the box being destroyed and taped and it had a bottle missing  they sent a replacement within a few days  much appreciated  definitely worth trying out if you want a fresh clean tasting water      
38,5.0,                       i use this water exclusively for our conference room and presentations      the water is awesome   i ve had some great comments about the taste  you can immediately taste the difference between this water and regular brand bottled water found at the grocery store     the design of the bottle is very attractive and looks great in our conference room   i like the design graphics on the bottle   overall this is the best tasting water i can serve to guests      
39,5.0,                       awesome water  very clean and pure tasting  i bought it because i was looking for a high quality above average ph water to be a candidate for a subscribe and save to make my daily go to water  the price was excellent when i started a few months ago and remained steady  but it has fluctuated as much as     a case for the   liter bottles  i can understand fluctuations of a few dollars  but     is a bit much when i m ordering between   and   cases  one other note  the box these come in is extremely fragile and often bursts at the seams during shipping  i assume the strength is weakened from possibly too much recycled material      
40,3.0,                       this water is wonderful in all regards   however  i received a box that was supposed to contain    bottles  but it had only      the curious thing is that the box seems properly glued and sealed  with no sign of having been opened or tampered with   and there were no traces of a possible spill or damage that could explain a missing bottle   thus  i must assume that  instead of a baker s dozen  i simply got an icelandic dozen   slenskur tugi        
41,5.0,                       if i was rich enough to buy this on a monthly basis  this would be my go to water  sweeter than other waters  incredibly smooth  and fresh      
42,1.0,                       love the water  amazon prime price doubled the day after i received first shipment      
43,2.0,                       i bought this because it was supposed to be alkaline  with a ph of       i opened two bottles and measured the ph with two strips   the ph on both was      which is not alkaline but acidic   i understand that the ph might be slightly less than     due to bottling  shipping  etc  but i specifically bought this because i needed an alkaline water and this was the highest measured ph available      
44,1.0,                       lately i have been buying water with electrolytes  i ve purchased core  essentia    ten alkaline spring water  so i decided to give this water a shot  it has the most nasty aftertaste   i should ve never bought it since i ve never had it before   it s also non refundable          
45,5.0,                       this icelandic glacier brand water is very good   it has excellent flavor  very smooth taste   i ve noticed that  some ph neutral waters taste a tiny bit sweet when you re really thirsty  this does not  it s just a really pleasant   refreshing taste  has a ph of      i will buy it again  they had a    off coupon for a bit  but i missed out on it  it lowers the price to     per case  i highly recommend it  thanks      
46,5.0,                       the box came broken i reported it to amazon and they will replace   this is great water  i love it   no bad after tastes at all this box of    is usually packed inside another box  this time it was not   do not know why  however it will make me think twice about it from now on   i do not know  if amazon shipped or another vendor  but i have ordered this several times and have never had this happen      
47,5.0,                       i am an essentia   aqua panna water kind of person  only     waters i have purchased is the past two years  but when i couldn t get my regular delivery of essentia  i tried this brand   wow  didn t know that i would be this impressed about the great taste of this water  this water performed great  tasted fresh and clean  it almost had no taste at all which i like  reminded me of my aqua panna  i also liked that it is also an alkaline water and the small size made it very portable      
48,5.0,                       this is the best water i ever tasted  i was so surprised at how refreshing and smooth it is  i love it so much i drink like five bottles a day  i ran out out of icelandic water a few weeks ago so i drank another type of water that is  supposedly spring water   the difference in taste was obvious it tasted chalky and not nearly as refreshing  i have at least   cases delivered a month  i have nothing to gain from reviewing this i just want people to know how good this water is  my husband hates water but loves icelandic       
49,5.0,                       i love this water  have been buying it now for several months  it is by far the best tasting water i can ever recall drinking  but as i logged in tonight to order more  i found that the price had gone up  way more than i m prepared to pay  so sadly  i ll not be buying any more  a shame  they could have had a regular customer  probably for years to come   i m giving it a   star review because it really is good water and if the price is not a concern then for you  i can highly recommend it      
50,5.0,                       purest taste of all the bottled spring and artesian waters i have tried i especially like the design of the bottle  it is substantial and unlike some other brands  the bottle isn t thin and  flimsy  in your hand it is relatively expensive  but it has a perfect  neutral taste profile and is well bottled and packaged      
51,4.0,                       i love this water  it s crisp and clean with no weird aftertaste  the packaging is really cool  but i would be more than happy to drink it out of a less attractive bottle if it brought the price down   the water is expensive  i know it s imported   so i buy it only occasionally  when i originally started purchasing it a few months ago  it was     for the     liter    pack   now it s almost       i haven t purchased it since the price jumped up      
52,5.0,                       great water but with some serious problem  the water was very tasty and fresh  i can feel it every time i drink  but the flavor really hit my wallet a lot on this values  by this value of water should has some pretty unique taste  i m not saying they don t but they missing some taste for this value   the build quality are great  lots of people always ask me where do i got this water  ture  even is a great looking gadget in your refrigerator  overall  i will say if you are the person wants a strong alkaline water taste don t buy it   because you will disappointed  but if you just like a normal filtered water taste with little bit enhanced taste and great looking bottle  go ahead you won t regret  for me  i like how the way this water taste so i will keeps buying more      
53,5.0,                       to understand a bottle of water it can be helpful to try it at room temperature first and then refrigerated later  i say this because i tried this water at room temp multiple times and while it was interesting  it has a subtle fullness to the flavor that when i compared it to fiji i felt more drawn to fiji  but then i tried icelandic in it s chilled form and the difference was clear  this is the caviar of waters if you have a suggestion for a better bottled water  please comment on this review and share the intel      
54,5.0,                       people don t think that water has any taste but it does and this one tastes great  no after taste or funkiness to it  just clean  clear and crisp   the only down side is that it is a bit on the pricey side   i usually prefer deja blue but it isn t available to order and only one store in my area carries it and that is hit and miss without it being a pandemic      
55,5.0,                       best water ever  people look at me strangely when i tell them this water is different than your average bottled water  but after i make them do the comparison taste test they always understand what i m talking about  this water is clean  crisp  and doesn t have that weird sweet or chlorine like aftertaste you often get from other bottled waters      
56,5.0,                       this is the best water i ve ever had  it s worth the high price tag  the taste is clean and delicious  there is no fruity or metal hints that i have found in other expensive waters  i did find this water to stop the acid reflux my son and i have long suffered      
57,5.0,                       the icelandia water comes out to just under       dollars per gallon depending which size bottles are purchased       most people would balk at spending such an exorbitant amount on water but i figured why not give it a try      being from new jersey you never know what surprise tap water may bring  sometimes you may encounter the new jersey effervescence fart odor when turning on the tap      whether the water does contain any beneficial properties is unclear but the taste is truly exceptional  i m sure there are those who would not find the taste exceptional  but one may want to brush their teeth prior to drinking the water      
58,5.0,                       my favorite water so far  this water is not only tasty and refreshing  it has helped my health condition  i m no doctor  i don t know how it has helped exactly  but my doctor said it has and i will continue doing what works  this water is more expensive than fiji  which i thought was on the pricey side already  as they say  you get what you pay for  i will pay a premium if it means having great health  this helps me  i enjoy it more when cold too  some brick   mortar stores use to carry it  but i don t see many now  it might only be directly from the company or amazon      
59,3.0,                       horr ble packaging i almost cut myself trying to open it  not easy to open  and was a ridiculously heavy package wth on they send it in   more manageable boxes  who o they think is going to be able to lift it without help     but also due to the bulky size of the box  i will not be ordering again at least not in the large bottles  case of        
60,5.0,                       wonderful water  but i m not sure about its continued availability  especially at a reasonable price    i subscribed  but they were unable to fill the subscription this month  and some of the prices that i saw were bizarre  apparently set by a mindless bot    we shall see  but if it becomes ordinarily available again  it is an excellent choice      
61,5.0,                       wish they were less expensive or offered a better discount   aside from that loyal and will pay the price for it because of the overall quality and taste   every other water tastes funky and not as fresh or crisp   perhaps it s just a personal tastebud preference  but everyone i ve introduced to it loves it   they just can t justify paying that much for water      
62,4.0,                       excellent product  well worth the asking price  sadly amazon is failing miserably at shipping this product  item has arrived scattered in the box with one bottle clearly broken open  this is a little too costly of a product to take a hit of     bottles bought      
63,3.0,                       this case of icelandic glacial natural spring water    liter     count was left outside of my property fence   if i wanted to carry a case of water  i would not need to have it shipped   the water itself is awesome      
64,5.0,                       my wife and i have bene ordering icelandic water for   months straight now  best tasting water and we are glad to incorporate it to our daily lifestyle  we typically purchase costco brand purified water prior to this and it is night and day compared to icelandic water  do your self a favor and pick a case up      
65,5.0,                       this water is great  i am currently   months pregnant and it s the water i prefer  it prevents heartburn   acid reflux when i drink it  which is a miracle   it tastes great  and i appreciate that it s untouched by human hands  if that s really true  and doesn t have anything added to it   the price is a little high  but i think that s to be expected for a good quality water       
66,5.0,                       most bottled waters i don t care for  the one i buy when i m at starbucks  comes from italy  i love the best but i can t find it anywhere on the internet to buy for home use and starbucks charges too much for it to buy in quantity from them  so i tried this and while i still like the starbucks italian bottled water the best this is still very good and it s a lot cheaper  i ll be buying more of it      
67,5.0,                       first tried this water on iceland air and wow best tasting water  pure and clean  makes me want to drink more water and normally i m bad at keeping up with the   glasses at least a day  but with icelandic glacial i can drink    ml within an hour no problem  so happy to find on amazon  free shipping and awesome to find at     off      
68,1.0,                       price and taste this water is not special it is also expensive  if it tasted great i wouldn t mind  i will not buy this water again  it tasted just the my water machine      
69,5.0,                       wonderful water  the flavor is fantastic   crisp and clean  you really can taste the differences in waters  it was packaged well with no movement in transit  i ve found this price to be the best value for the money  i only drink water and icelandic is one of the best      
70,5.0,                       i love this water  while its pricier than some other bottle waters  it s well worth the price  you ll also be supporting a carbon neutral company      
71,1.0,                       i ve been trying to find a water that s cheaper than evian that has the same zero taste level that evian does  this isn t it  it tastes very mineraly  my daughter and i both didn t like it  i ll be using it to give to the animals while i wait for my evian order to come in      
72,5.0,                       best water on the planet  hold up  best bottled water on the planet  if you don t believe me put a bottle in the fridge and get in down to about   degrees above freezing and drink it  this is what water is supposed to taste and feel like  its healthy live water   hands down it s the best      
73,4.0,                       look  the water tastes excellent and it comes in a great cool looking bottle  there s a lot of to love here but the price isn t i can go to the gas station and buy    pack of dasani or aquafina for       while this cost    if you have money to blow  you won t be disappointed but don t buy this thinking you re getting a deal      
74,5.0,                       i am hooked on this water i know some people don t think water has a taste  but it does   also a lot of companies are using cheap plastic so when you open the bottle water ends up everywhere i hate that   i don t have to worry about that with this packaging   it is a bit expensive     
75,5.0,                       hrafna fl ki vilger arson this was a great settlement you found the water at     ph is a real investment for all   this water is the golden seal of royal waters i give it a   the icelandic spring water     never lets people down only enhances their health i love glacier waters it s my favorite  anthony     
76,5.0,                       i love this stuff  helps with acid reflux and keeping the body alkaline  good for coffee drinker  cigar smoker  etc      
77,4.0,                       medicinal water  i can feel the effects  just wish they were presented in glass bottled containers  i think a lot of good water nowadays become contaminated by the material that they are stored in   plastic poses a threat to our health and the toxic is very harmful to the environment     
78,1.0,                       this very heavy box of    big bottles of water was left far away from our front door     it weighed       lbs   it was not left in our mailbox or even near it     our mailbox hangs on the wall beside our front door      
79,5.0,                       this is the best water on the planet  ph      full of necessary minerals  as you d expect  i ve been fortunate enough to travel to the source  iceland      times so am very familiar with how clean   healthful this water is  and it tastes great  the only water i will drink  they are now adding fruit flavored waters to their line  in case you like waters with an extra oomph      
80,5.0,                       i have tried many natural spring waters   the whole gamut from poland spring  to fiji and way beyond   there is nothing i love more than this   try it     
81,1.0,                       the icelandic water i bought made me nauseous   maybe it was a bad batch due to an inside job      
82,5.0,                       i like how it tastes   as a real water from my childhood  also  i liked that it came through the mail as it was promised  on time  yes  it is the most expensive water on the shelf  and  i will welcome some reduction of price in the future  however today it is what it is and it worth every drop of it      
83,5.0,                       save your money go to walmart it s cheaper note   for that   dollars you only get one bottle  rip off         
84,5.0,                       i really do enjoy the taste of this water over other fancy brands   crisp and a fine ending taste  such a term     water from some expensive filters can do the same but there is always something missing   like the thought of drinking water from glaciers in iceland  viking water   yes  the water is slightly  contaminated    it has a little nitrate   but it tastes darn good   the only complaint is the cost   in the market at times much cheaper  even the company sells it below amazon       litre doesn t stand up in the fridge   so i wait and then i pounce on a sale   haven t tried all the rest      
85,5.0,                       this is the best water i ve ever had and i love this deal      packs of liter bottles for   bucks each  with the amount of tea i m drinking in fear of covid     this water is a godsend      
86,5.0,                       i purchased this product on a whim never tasting it and i thought i d give it a shot   boy was i wrong   this stuff is amazing   i thought i was gonna be cheated out of something either the taste quality or flavor   i was wrong on all three   this product i give a triple aaa and definitely will be purchasing it again      
87,5.0,                       this is the best tasting bottled water i ve ever had  and what i d expect from an icelandic product      
88,5.0,                       it s water  what else can i say  k don t drink anything alchoholic  nor do i drink anything carbonated  etc  i mostly drink water  just pure cool water  i like the pretty bottles this comes in  it tastes great chilled  or cool      
89,5.0,                       this is a really nice water  it has an almost perfect aftertaste  it s like fresh stream water that is delivered to your door      
90,5.0,                       i have a huge problem with remembering to drink enough water  having a fridge full of these beauties makes me not only remember to drink water  but i enjoy it so much more  this water tastes fantastic  i have tried a wide variety of alkaline bottled waters  and this one tastes the best to me  it tastes like you re drinking it out of a glacial ice luge  the faceted bottle evokes refreshing images of crystal clear ice  making it not only aesthetically stunning  but also thirst inducing  i only wish it were less expensive  since i often switch to a different  more cost effective alkaline water  i d rather just drink icelandic glacial      
91,5.0,                       i did a lot of research about spring water  this one always  was on the top of the lists  so i thought i would splurge and try some out  wow  this is the best tasting water i have ever tried  i will definitely buy again      
92,5.0,                       this water is a bit pricey for my budget  but i am quite hopeful it will be worth every cent   health benefits galore   or so it is advertised  and the taste is excellent   if i can nw drink as much water per day as needed  this is going to be my best shot   no chemical taste or smell      
93,5.0,                       i order this water  because first and foremost  it is the cleanest tasting water i have ever had   the square bottle is easy to handle and is sturdy   i like to put it in the freezer until it is partially frozen  squeeze the bottle to break up the ice  and it is so refreshing   yes  it is expensive but worth every penny      
94,5.0,                       first had the icelandic water from an out of the way convenient store technically an in convenient store  hahahahah  sorry      near a small town i used to live in    a c had gone out in the car  and it was a ridiculously hot day and the water was ice cold  it was the best tasting  most refreshing bottled water i d ever had  a search for cases of icelandic led me to amazon  and i ve had a multi case subscription ever since        
95,5.0,                       my fiance is nuts about this water  very smooth taste  i hate water but i do drink icelandic when it s cold with no problems      
96,5.0,                       wow  this is the best tasting water i have ever had  clean and sweet aftertaste  pure and enjoyable  my new favorite   between this and fiji  icelandic wins      
97,5.0,                       i loved taste  i had found though other concerns that l i will leave to others making their own decisions  ty for the opportunity to try  i did expect full refund a z however was not the case so l will leave this as it stands     
98,5.0,                       one of the best waters out there  quenches your thirst better than most  crisp  clear and perfect travel size      
99,5.0,                       tastes great but it s beyond overpriced  i switched to other brands      
100,1.0,                         different times i ordered this item  first time no problem  the second time both boxes had gotten wet  the water smelled and tasted moldy  i guess the boxes sat outside in the rain somewhere  i will not order again      
101,5.0,                       i have sampled  chugged down or sipped so many other premium waters   there is no doubt that this is the best that i have ever tasted   i might say  but probably shouldn t  that it is like finally breathing clean air   it is refreshing and the ph level is ideal      
102,5.0,                       i ve traveled quite a bit in my life time   iceland is the only country that i drank water from a forced   it taste like water from the good old days     
103,5.0,                       this water is free from anything other than water  hands down  the best on the market      
104,5.0,                       i m on chemo so things taste bad  but this water is excellent and pure for my palate  it is also affordable in the plastic bottles and the taste is not compromised because it is not in glass bottles     
105,5.0,                       i have tried waiakea  mountain valley  fiji  evian and many other waters   i recommend icelandic glacial water for its clean taste   the ph is higher than most waters at       i m hoping it will alleviate some of my gi issues being more alkaline   it s a bit pricy but i cannot get a case of it delivered cheaper than on amazon   even going directly through icelandic with a     discount that they offer      
106,5.0,                       people say water is water and there is no difference between them  but they are wrong  fiji has nothing on this water  i just wish it was more widely available at a lower price      
107,5.0,                       i really enjoyed this water i am one who do not like drinking water it cramps my stomach horribly i usually drink propel but i am trying a detox called  the detox    day healing cleanse it is really working out for me i m very satisfied this is the only water i can drink outside of propel i ve tried them all this is the best besides prolel  this is really good because i m drinking   bottles a day  and for me that is accomplishment      
108,5.0,                       we hate plastic bottles  but love this water  in the us glyphosate is in everything  even the rain and all underground water  it causes all disease we see today this comes from a glacier that is pesticide free  i wish i had this stuff on tap      
109,5.0,                       and i ve used a lot of them  icelandic is pure  pleasurable taste  not the slightest sense of anything that interferes with that  i order the        bottle case twice a month  alert  i dislike the sparkling version of icelandic      
110,5.0,                       this is great tasting water  but i bought it to offset reflux issues   it s definitely working for me   i made coffee in this water and had no side effects   unheard of for me   meal with red sauce for dinner the next day   no issues   it seems to work for me  so i m hooked   interestingly the people who have said ph was not high enough didn t say if they tried it and got what they expected out of it   i recommend for sure      
111,5.0,                       we pay for a water treatment system that is about   grand and this water beats the taste of that  i love this water more than life it s  self and i def will continue to keep buying      
112,1.0,                       this is entirely different from the    mlby far  this    ml smells and tastes old like water that s sat in bowl or glass too long it is too bad is like to get replacement they can have this back  it also arrived in poor packaging      
113,5.0,                       i like drinking this water  i don t aways drink enough water  but when i do it will be icelandic glacial natural springalkaline water         
114,5.0,                       love this water  it s crisp and clean tasting      
115,5.0,                       i don t like the fact that the water package is easily brake  the box that it is in is so dry by lifting it break  the money value is great  flavor it tastes like water comes right out of river bank or stream   it tastes like water just out of under ground  it is very light   the only time i remember tasting water like that is back home straight from the river  i enjoy it  i will purchase it again for sure  it doesn t taste heavy like other waters i ve drink     
116,2.0,                       i really am not finding any difference in this and a standard water  i don t care for it  i find the taste harsh  not smooth nor pleasant  i hate that it i sc in plastic     
117,1.0,                       the replacement box i got had water that smelled like sewage  it s very disgusting and just undrinkable  what a joke      
118,5.0,                       i was purchasing fiji water for a long time  but it started tasting off  tried out this one  and i m sold  its super smooth  which makes me end up drinking more water      
119,5.0,                       really good water  that quenches your thirst while hydrating the body  better tasting cold  room temperature taste takes some getting used too  read the side effects for drinking     alkaline water on a constant basis      
120,5.0,                       this is the best water  if you think all water tastes the same  you re wrong  this is the only water i can really stand drink  it s even good if it s not super cold      
121,5.0,                       i loved the bottles and the water is the best      
122,4.0,                       ever since i started drinking this water my face has cleared up  apparently i ve been drinking too much tapwater and  i have too much acid in chlorine in my system that cause my skin to break out   this water with ph has leveled out my skin and i feel so much better with it   i highly recommend it     
123,5.0,                       we love icelandic water   our first choice   by the way  we ordered   boxes and only   were delivered also  in our previous delivery  one bottle seems to have been opened   we did not drink it for fear it was tamperered      
124,3.0,                       bought this cause of the tx winter storm and water is sold out everywhere  drinkable but really tastes like plastic  and austin tx tap tastes like hose water      
125,5.0,                       this tastes very clean  i definitely would recommend it      
126,5.0,                       i used to get this from thriftway  but in the world of online shopping and ease i have it sent to me now   it s pretty good water  but as we all know sometimes water is just water      
127,5.0,                       very crisp and clear clean flavor  no floride flavoring      
128,4.0,                       love the water  taste great  very refreshing   the price is ridiculous   got   cases of it for      in the store giant eagle   and your charging way to much for online   if you can match the     price  if ve hapto buy more through your site      
129,5.0,                       like the arrival no dislikes     
130,5.0,                       if you love great tasting water you are going to love this water  i describe it as going to a mountain top and having the freshest water you have ever had  it taste refreshing cold right out the fridge and surprisingly just as great at room temperature  side note i ve order different sizes none of them fit in car cup holder  that s seriously my only complaint      
131,5.0,                       this is the best bottled water on the planet   highly recommend     
132,5.0,                       i m very happy  thank you     
133,5.0,                       this is the best to mine on spring water   no one beats this water in the bottle    it is cold  fresh and clean   i also love the shape of the bottle   it makes it so appealing as well   the only bottled water i will use      
134,3.0,                       i would give this water   stars but for the price  it doubled in price in one month  too expensive now  it is just water after all      
135,5.0,                       doesn t contain harmful contaminants and heavy metals which most other bottled waters have and it tastes by far the best of any i ve tried      
136,5.0,                       this water is great  you ll definitely feel much better adding this as your daily water intake  i usually grab a bunch of singles   w mart but they never have the sports cap  great price for great water  despite the pandemic  it arrived extremely fast and in perfect condition      
137,5.0,                       the delivery was on time as promised   the water tastes great  but i had a problem   this was a package that was supposed to contain    counts of     liter bottled water   but there was only    counts  inside the carton when i opened it   there was no damage to either cardboard cartons  the original package box from icelandic and the outside packing box  maybe  from amazon       both boxes were in perfect condition   so how could   bottle be missing    for this reason  i would not order this item again      
138,5.0,                       after traveling around in iceland for a few weeks  one of the first things i did after coming home was to see if i could purchase iceland s glacier water in the u s  i am happy that i found this product  it tastes the same as iceland s tap water   which is excellent      
139,5.0,                       since getting it on our flight to iceland last year  have loved its freshness  the bottles fit nicely in purse and tote and car holder  my splurge in life is bottled water and can t beat this        
140,5.0,                       this is the best water that i ve ever had and i ve tried many  a reputable company with a neutral carbon print  it may be considered pricey  but  in this instance  you definitely get what you pay for  there s nothing like quality water  truly essential      
141,5.0,                       refreshing taste  will order again     
142,5.0,                       great taste  will buy again      
143,5.0,                       i enjoyed these water bottles everyday  it made me feel really good and not tiring  i started to feel really overweighted before but when i noticed by taking a sip of the water bottle  it taste really naturally and i started jogging everyday        
144,5.0,                       very good water and great taste  i bought this because i had a stomach acidity problem and after drinking alcaline water i never had a flair up again  i just worry about the plastic bottles  i hope everyone recycles  recommend      
145,3.0,                       it tastes like   water  but at a premium price  i purchased it to see what the super duper description was all about  but it tastes like tap water in a plastic bottle   okay        
146,5.0,                       i use a filter at home  and try to avoid plastic water  but bought these as a back up for emergencies  very good taste      
147,3.0,                       the new taller bottles fall over easily and general suck balls   i like the older bottles and hope they bring them back      
148,3.0,                       nothing special   it s     more than evian and not as good   i tried it once just to see but was disappointed   for the price  it s totally a no go for me      
149,2.0,                       tested water with ph strips  it is not alkaline  water tastes good  but i purchased it specifically because they advertise that it s alkaline and it is neutral at best  my fridge filter is the same as this water     
150,5.0,                       excellent for bottled water     
151,5.0,                       i had separate sealed bottles professionally tested for ph   one bottle was from an icelandic air flight and the other from my amazon shipment   i had two degreed and veteran chemists independent test a bottle on different days   the ph was      and      respectively   the machine s tolerance is           so the results are consistent and basically within the machine s digital tolerance no insult intended but litmus paper is more a go no go for acidic or basic and store bought tests simply are not that accurate and certainly can in no way match professional results on state of the art equipment i enjoy the taste of the water but will likely not buy more due to the high cost      
152,5.0,                       crisp and clean taste  exactly what you would expect pure water to taste like  ph exceeds my test scale s     limit  putting it somewhere close to what was advertised      
153,1.0,                       total yikes water tastes murky and such a high ppm at    wtf  costs more than fiji which is amazing    my filtered water gets   ppm     
154,5.0,                       tastes great so healthy for you the ph is at a greatlevel packaging is great and i highly recommended this     
155,1.0,                       i use ph meter to test this water  this water is ph     just like regular water  not ph     i also use tds meter to test it  it almost   ppm  drinking water should not be over   ppm  this water no help and bad for health      
156,4.0,                       fyi if you order this half the    bottles came loose and rolled around inside the amazon box   thankfully none of them leaked   the shrinkwrap on the manufacturer packing tore in shipping      
157,5.0,                       i have been a fuji water drinker for years but having found icelandic i m on my  rd case and drink it room temp  lost weight as well and can t live without this amazing fresh alkaline gift from the sky      
158,5.0,                       love this water   so clear and delicious    and i have never been a plain water drinker until i tried this         
159,5.0,                       this water is expensive but we ll worth it  my only complaint is the plastic bottles    recycle please      
160,4.0,                       good water  quite expensive  though     
161,1.0,                       all boxes arrived damaged and burst open    bottles were missing and most bottles cap seemed tampered       
162,5.0,                       ilike to drink water      
163,4.0,                       gave the delivery woman a heart attack  seeing how big the box was  hahaha     i had to go pick up at the post office after an attempted delievery  but  no real issues  a nice  crisp taste  thank you     
164,5.0,                       i love this product the icelandic water is delicious  try it you will love it as i do   i had a hard time finding it locally but it was easy to find on amazon      
165,5.0,                       drinking      as for value   pricing of    oz vs    oz is suspicious if not blatantly deceptive   since when is the largest size of anything     oz   more expensive than the smaller size     oz   only in bezos world       
166,1.0,                       can t drink it  can t stand the smell of it  and since i can t return it  i hope my plants don t die      
167,5.0,                       i needed a way to ensure i drink enough water everyday  i decided to pay way too much for it so i would feel obligated to drink it  worked perfect  i down one of these a day  now i m hydrated af       
168,1.0,                       buyer beware    great product however i ordered   liter bottles but received half liter     
169,4.0,                       i don t think it was worth the money for what i paid  but it s great to have water delivered to your door     some bottles were damaged from shipping but was able to fix them       
170,5.0,                       this is the best tasting water i have ordered  it is very clean and crisp  love this brand     
171,5.0,                       best tasting water and perfect after exercising replenishes the water you need to continue moving      
172,5.0,                       closest thing to being in iceland   i love the water in iceland so getting this was little like being there   so good      
173,5.0,                       there are lots of bottled waters  icelandic ones are the best  naturally pure and high ph      
174,5.0,                       this water is   stars plus  absolutely phenomenal taste  after drinking this water for just a week all of the other big brand bottled water tastes like pool water to me  i will without a single doubt be purchasing this water regularly from now on  highly recommended       
175,5.0,                       icelandic water is hands down my favorite water  can t always treat myself to it for the price  but love having it when i can  super smooth and silky  soft mouth feel  crisp  pure  and clean taste  the lowest tds i ve ever seen    just fantastic water  i ll be buying more when i can      
176,5.0,                       i was really surprised at the taste  it is very refreshing and it jump up on my list ahead of fiji and voss  it seriously tastes great especially when it is cold      
177,3.0,                       not impressed this is supposed to be alkaline water but  on the bottle it says spring water  clearly i feel deceived       
178,5.0,                       ever since visiting iceland about   years ago  i ve been obsessed with how good their water tastes   i love the taste of this water      
179,5.0,                       i just ordered a    pack   weeks ago and had to order more  my family loves the taste of this water  when my grandson takes a break from playing fortnite to eat  he always takes a bottle back to his room with him  try it refrigerated  awesome        
180,5.0,                       love the water  the water makes other liquids tastes better like the osteo fx liquid supplement i take everyday for my bones and joints        
181,5.0,                       thankfully all bottles weren t broken and all    are there probably could have used extra heavy duty tape      
182,5.0,                       like it delivers directly to condo door as i usually order a few cases at a time     
183,5.0,                       love this water  its flavor is subtle  clean  and very refreshing  i also love that it s from a sustainable spring and the company is carbon neutral  cheers      
184,5.0,                       good  it s icelandic water  only bottled water that tastes like nothing      
185,5.0,                       my husband doesn t like ti drink water but for some great reason he loves this work so it s great     
186,5.0,                       delivered quickly     
187,5.0,                       im a huge water guy  tried them all and this water is by far the best ive had  i like fiji water and smart water but this water just has a smooth taste that puts those to shame  i highly recommend this to anyone that wants a smooth clean refreshing water      
188,5.0,                       it s good to have them during the coronavirus break in california  i can keep them during the lockdown     
189,5.0,                       this is the only water that i drink  with the exception of core water   they are very similar in taste and quality   this is a great price  and these are the perfect size for lunches  a great way to keep your family property hydrated      
190,5.0,                       but if you have to buy bottled water this is a good product  still i urge you to buy a water filter and drink tap water if you can     
191,5.0,                       this is my favorite water   there are others with a high ph that are less expensive but this is the water that tastes good to me  it has no additives and tastes fresh and clear   others with the same ph have a hint of salt or an aftertaste of some kind     
192,5.0,                       this is a wonderful natural glacial water from iceland  it has a great refreshing taste      
193,5.0,                       this water has a good taste to it and we went through pretty quick because it was very good     
194,5.0,                       my wife and i only just recently made the transition to drinking alkaline water  water with   ph or higher   but we ve both noticed an improvement in our energy levels since then  this is the only water we stock in our house these days and the price is a bargain      
195,5.0,                       highly recommend this water  i ve been trying out other waters lately such as sno and fiji  this is high quality water  tastes refreshing  i plan on purchasing more in the future  i wish the price was a little lower      
196,5.0,                       it s glacial water and not legitimate spring water  clean water versus water with beneficial minerals  i really like this one because it s not owned by nestle  but  would still prefer a spring water like mountain valley      
197,3.0,                       if it was not for the fact that the bottles are plastic   out of    would have been broken      
198,5.0,                       i love this water  it has a wonderful fresh taste and i can easily drink an entire bottle plus a day  i highly recommend this bottled water      
199,5.0,                       really love this water  doesn t have metal taste  actually has a slightly sweet taste      
200,5.0,                       get icelandic now before this type of water is extinct      
201,5.0,                       finally found some water that i actually like to drink      
202,5.0,                       a bit expensive  but u can taste the smooth from the water and that fiji can t be compare with       
203,5.0,                       literally the best tasting water i have ever had  also my friends have said the same  so much better than fiji  smartwater   voss   i love the square bottles      
204,5.0,                       my favorite and believe me there differences in quality water      
205,2.0,                       don t think it s worth the money it is overrated and the taste isn t up to par it tastes like regular costco purified water    for    bottles i rather drink poland water     
206,5.0,                       alkaline water is amazing  just watched a documentary about water and how we change the ph levels with pollution and it said that alkaline water is the best for you  definitely worth the money      
207,5.0,                       taste is excellent and i like the natural high ph content   the bottle size i got is a bit large and inconvenient to travel everywhere  but i do so cos its that good  i think there s a smaller size i might try   pricey  though  wish it was a little cheaper or they would run specials every now and then      
208,5.0,                       nice crisp water  tasted like a fresh snowfall   was very happy with the water  fun to try   it is a little pricy and will purchase again for a treat      
209,5.0,                       this is really high quality water  however  the value was not good  i found the same   pak at my local grocery shop for        and when i asked the clerk  they said sometimes it is on sale for less  i bought   cases off amazon  won t be doing that again      
210,5.0,                       cleanest water i have ever tasted  i would buy it in a   gallon bottle for my water cooler if they made it      
211,5.0,                       i was given a bottle of this by icelandic airline and found it delicious   much better taste than the bottled water i had been drinking   was very happy to find i could order it on amazon   added bonus was the high ph of     which is great for someone like me who has acid reflux problems      
212,1.0,                       why does cases very in taste  one case will be ok  then the next smells like chlorine and tastes like tap water      
213,5.0,                       my absolute favorite bottled water  the name and the packaging drew me to icelandic  even at room temperature  the water is refreshing   the power of suggestion      
214,3.0,                       just returning from alaska we thought this water would taste like the glacier water we had up there   but no go won t be reordering     
215,4.0,                       great pure taste but getting of plastic water bottle use as new studies show they all have tiny bits of plastic that one ingests as they drink  also bpa contaminants lurk in bottled mwater     
216,2.0,                       i recieved the product with excessive damage to the boxes both outer and inner i accepted the delivery anyway because i needed the extra water  when i use the water i ll have wash the bottles before opening them      
217,5.0,                       while i love subscribe and save  please do not put a case of water and two cases of toilet paper in the same box  first of all the box was huge and it was left outside my garage door where i would have run over it the next morning instead of on my porch but i understand that they may have thought it was easier for me to just move it into the garage  but it was too heavy for me to move and i had to get a neighbor to help me because it was so heavy and the case of water inside was broken open  i am all for consolidating deliveries into as few boxes as possible  but please do not ship gigantic boxes like this to me with   large cases inside it again  please ship my water and toilet paper separately thank you      
218,5.0,                       best price i could find on this item   arrived when promised   would recommend this item and seller to others

229,4.0,                       arrived undamaged and on time   the initial order was a bargain and provided the high ph water i wanted  excellent taste   too bad is is not out of stock and other sources are double the initial order price  as is the price per ounce of the larger size bottles      
230,5.0,                       the best water in the world  you can taste the difference  i love this water      
231,5.0,                       came exactly as described  so much easier getting good water at your door instead of at the store   signing up for monthly deliveries on this       
232,5.0,                       kinda pricey but who wants to buy cheap water when i can get it on tap  has been a big hit with my family and boyfriend  will buy again      
233,5.0,                       this is the most amazing water you can buy

235,5.0,                       my favorite brand of water i am an avid water drinker  since i don t really drink juice nor alcohol  i like to spoil myself with good water  this one by far trumps the rest the taste is different and overall is a amazing product  even the design of the water bottle is beautiful  it is a bit expensive but worth it  i usually clear the isle at my local grocery store when they are one special      
236,3.0,                       not regular size bottles  much smaller      dollars for    small waters is way overpriced      
237,1.0,                       this water tastes horrible  it tastes like chalk      
238,5.0,                       very good because it had no taste     
239,1.0,                       i ve purchased this water at my local store in a beautiful glass   liter bottle   many reviews mentioned the glass bottle manufactured by ocelandic   also when i purchased the banner said i would receive it in approximately    hours  i understood it to mean from the time i purchased it    my order was    small plastic bottles and it took   days to be received      
240,5.0,                       great flavor with a higher ph that is beneficial to your body  all bottles came without any leaks and perfectly packaged      
241,4.0,                       i liked it and bought more of it  i will probably not make a habit of it because it is pricy       
242,5.0,                       it s basically my favorite water  you don t save much money buying it on amazon but the convenience factor is nice   i still pay for the subscription so it s worth it      
243,5.0,                       recently learned the importance of what type of water we drink   love icelandic  taste amazing with ph of       highly recommend      
244,5.0,                         bottles were empty  the packaging needs a lot of improvement  i do love the water      
245,5.0,                       i love this water  i bought the     ml and wish i would have bought the      i will buy the other ones from now on  the taste is great but there is not enough in the      the     seems like a perfect size  the water is very fresh and crisp  perfect with a meal  a snack  or to have on your night stand  i was very happy with it but went through it fast      
246,5.0,                       like the product  water  but the last shipment the box that holds the bottled water was falling apart and opened   look at attached pics   the shipping box was fine   so it makes me think it was packaged this way      
247,5.0,                       i just receive the package so cannot comment on the taste yet   thank you        
248,5.0,                       the flavor and detail of the water is presice and enjoyable   thank you in advance      
249,3.0,                       i m extremely particular about taste of water i did not see a difference between this water and most bottled ones  i was hoping it was better considering the price but it s not worth it for me  my favorite water by far is fiji      
250,5.0,                       it s worth spending  it tastes delicious      
251,5.0,                       i mean  it s water from iceland  what could taste better than that      
252,5.0,                       although there really is no flavor  the fact that it is missing is the positive  i just wish we could buy it locally  it was sold at whole foods  but no more      
253,1.0,                       i was pretty skeptical so i got some ph test strips to test the water  it came out at    it s just normal water  don t bother     
254,2.0,                       has an aftertaste   doesn t taste like spring water   tastes like purified         
255,5.0,                       great water jyst very pricey

258,1.0,                       i get this water delivered monthly  no c o s about the water but somehow the delivery people mess up the icelandic box inside the delivery box  the icelandic box is often torn and the waters are loose and sometimes dented inside the bigger delivery box which looks like it had to be retaped      
259,5.0,                       love the taste and pure natural glacial water     before we polluted our home waters    i use it for myself

287,5.0,                       i love this water but this box is always torn up and handled so rough that the water has gotten out of the original box   maybe use foam or paper to pack the box more securely     
288,5.0,                       outside box needs to be more substantial given weight of icelandicactually it was very damaged broken and the bottles from inner product box were almost broken through     
289,5.0,                       i love this water   i am glad that i can find it cheaper online than in the store   i buy fiji when i cannot find it  but prefer this one

291,4.0,                       water tastes great   i originally bought this to soak my crystals in to  cleanse and charge  them  but one day i tasted the water and it was great  it is not bland like some artesian water  but has a great flavor   must have a good mineral content   a  bit pricey   but if you can afford it i highly recommend this product

363,2.0,                       boxes came mangled  and tape that seals boxes were broken   the water was inside a box in the box   water still plastic ky   not what i thought since i want to avoid plastic going into the water   local store water is better   not worth shipping water to home      
364,5.0,                       love the water  drink it everyday and has helped  alkaline helps with utis

369,1.0,                       the bottles arrived not in the original packaging bur simply thrown in a carton box  the water tastes differently      
370,3.0,                       i bought this water because it claims the ph is  of      i tested it and the ph was of   so it s not     as it claims  the taste is fine  cool looking bottle but not true to the claim      
371,5.0,                       i like the flavor  kinda pricey and takes a while to get

374,3.0,                       tastes exactly the same as filtered tap water  has a noticeable  metal  taste  i would definitely not describe it as smooth or soft  switching back to evian

608,3.0,                       i used a hydrion low ion test kit ph     to test the alkalinity of these waters my tap water  tested    phfiji water  tested    phglacial natural spring water  tested   ph  claim     on bottle evamor natural alkaline artesian water  tested     ph  claim     on bottle not sure if all the claims about high alkalinity water are true but nevertheless icelandic glacial misses the mark  if high alkalinity water is what you want and you can not afford an alkaline water machine then maybe you can justify the high price of the evamor water as far as my preference  fiji tastes the best out of this group but evian  which i did not test  i think tastes the best      
609,4.0,                       i haven t had this water for a while now  and somehow tasted different  hard to explain  kind of sweet  perhaps is the low acidity level

786,5.0,                       tastes like how water from the faucet used to taste    years ago before towns started adding toxic flouride and cancer causing chlorine to the water  look it up for yourself  a dentist said flouride in water is not on your teeth long enough to prevent cavities  so why is it in our water  hmm     
787,4.0,                       this was was okay  i bought a case of it and had my two sons and my husband try it and nobody was knocked dead over the flavor  like some of the reviews   it was just water to them   i like the taste  but it would never be worth the money   i like essentia better  for taste and price combined   i can had a case of     qt  size delivered  free ship with prime for          so it s like       a bottle   the essentia   and this was twice the money

829,5.0,                       first off let me say this iceland glacier is very good water  i had been using fiji water for a couple months  but sometimes noticed that is has a strong  plastic  taste depending on which bottle size i get  i also didn t like the fact that fiji water is so secretive about what all in in there  as they only list a few of the mineral content  while icelandic has a pdf on their site from the nsf that is a full water analysis report  icelandic is also a higher ph level i had purchased icelandic from a local store and liked it  so i decided to order the  l twelve count from amazon when it was delivered  i opened the box  but there was a black sticky tar like substance on the bottles i contacted amazon for a replacement  but it was out of stock  but amazon was still able to resolve this by issuing a credit because of that black liquid on the bottles  i m not sure if i ll order it again once amazon has it back in stock  or have to start buying it again from my local store      
830,5.0,                       love the shape of the bottle      
831,5.0,                       wonderful  wonderful  wonderful   need i say more        
832,4.0,                       i really like the taste of this water   i ve tried several popular brands  fuji tasted good but for some reason gives me headaches   this has a crisp aftertaste  i don t know how else to describe it   yes  i know it s just water  but there are noticeable differences   no chemical taste or bite to this  crisp and clean      
833,4.0,                       great taste      
834,5.0,                       love it

836,5.0,                       tastes great  hopefully this is the  real  deal  it had great flavor  we usually drink fiji or evian like this water better higher ph

854,4.0,                       this icelandic glacial natural spring water certainly tastes a lot better than the nasty city water that comes out of my tap   lol  it s a decent product   i gave it   stars because it s a bit expensive for the amount you get      
855,4.0,                       delicious but expensive      
856,5.0,                       for those who understand the different tastes that water bottle companies have  poland spring  aquafina  dasani   this water tops them all  it expensive  but worth it for special occasions  such a smooth taste  perfect if chilled to near freezing      
857,5.0,                       besst water in the world thankfully theres a new store local that sells it and it just opened     
858,3.0,                       i was really hoping this water would ignite my taste buds with a fresh  clean  and pure flavor and honestly there s nothing really too special about this water  the bottle is really cool looking but apart from that  this icelandic water taste the same as the water we pick up from walmart  i really wanted to love this water  but sadly i can only give it three stars      
859,3.0,                       the best water i ever had was at a water fountain in iceland  this product just does not come even close  it is not a bad taste but just not what i was expecting  a natural springs bottled water sold at dollartree for       and contains     ounces tastes as good  i am glad i could compare and most likely will not purchase this product again  i can not wait to return to iceland and sample some of that really good tasting water      
860,5.0,                       absolutely the purist      
861,5.0,                       crisp   sharp finish   best served ice   ice cold      
862,5.0,                       water tastes great   these smaller bottles are hard to find in my city   i was thrilled to find them on amazon  although a bit pricey  in the long run it was worth it   they definitely will not roll off a surface      
863,4.0,                       love this water  great quality and tastes like what water should taste like  only giving   stars because of the price point  i wish they were more affordable      
864,5.0,                       i think this is the best water i have ever tasted      
865,5.0,                       this is the best water ever   you can actually taste the difference from the other brands  great product and amazon was top notch in handling the sale and delivery      
866,5.0,                       the best bottled water  it s too expensive to drink primarily  but i like to splurge on it occasionally  it has such a crisp  clean  pure taste      
867,5.0,                       best tasting water ever  period  and i ve tested lots of them      
868,5.0,                       i enjoy drinking this water very much as i hate the taste of tap water  i order it by the case and drink it through slowly it s expensive  but i know that i am getting pure water  clean and clear  in fact it is so clean you may think something is off about the taste but that is because we have been conditioned to think the water we drink everyday is perfectly fine when it s not as clean as it can be  i want the best from my water and ig delivers      
869,5.0,                       best water on earth

880,4.0,                       this is a good bottled water but i think we like the fiji better so will continue to buy fiji      
881,5.0,                       i was told it was the best water they ever drank   i think the bigger bottles are even better   i would get bigger bottles      
882,5.0,                       great water   i wish it was cheaper though  i would buy this all time   it s treat to have on hand  especially after a long workout  so refreshing

886,5.0,                       best water on the planet     
887,3.0,                       water had an odd taste to it  very different from other bottled water     
888,5.0,                       best water ever   there isn t much more i can say except that i wish it wasn t so pricey      
889,5.0,                       there s nothing more my family loves than iceland glacial natural spring water  crisp  clean and pure in taste     even their cold tap water tastes much better than the ones in the states   it s a bit pricey  but every time i drink this  i remember iceland and glaciers   fell in love with this on my way there to visit   aside from this brand  i would only spend   for fiji water    but this is definitely our go to   i hope they will be shipped to my state where i can buy it locally instead of having to buy them online      
890,3.0,                       i m sure this is fine but after trying and i really prefer the eternal brand     
891,2.0,                       great taste and very high ph count but way too expensive     
892,5.0,                       amazingly refreshing   will be sure to keep a constant stock     
893,5.0,                       great light water        
894,5.0,                       best water     
895,3.0,                       excellent water  just not worth the price i think      
896,5.0,                       let me start by saying i was once a water skeptic  i am on an artisan well and have good water  and was a believer that  water is water  and why would anyone pay to buy it   well let me say  this particular water has changed my mind and i am a believer   i don t know if it is the high ph or the fact that it is glacial water  this is  hands down  the best water i have ever tasted   it has a clean  crisp finish  and i just simply love it   i got hooked on this because my husband who is a truck driver came home raving about it  he bought it on a whim at a truck stop  and once i tried it  i just had to order it   if you are of the belief that all water is the same  try this one   you will not be disappointed and you will probably be just as amazed as i was   love it  love it  love it      
897,1.0,                       because the ph is not anywhere near as advertised  the     liter bottle i opened was at best a          not       i tested it next to my evian water which is always reliably       very happy that i bought so much without testing it first      
898,5.0,                       this is the real deal for water      
899,5.0,                       great water   great looking bottle   it was very small size    very expensive     
900,5.0,                       it s the best water on the market  i love it and i hate water        
901,3.0,                       i like it but i don t like the fact that it s in a plastic bottle      
902,3.0,                       i got a large quart bottle driving thru ok  hott day  it was so cold and refreshing   best i ever had    really   then i ordered a    pack from amazon and it had that annoying slight plastic taste  that taste like its old     stars     
903,5.0,                       smooth tasting thirst quenching  i love it    plus sustainable bottle     
904,5.0,                       great tasting in a solid bottle     
905,4.0,                       i like the idea of this and does taste different in a good way but to be honest  your better off drinking your tap water  p     
906,5.0,                       great tasting water   ph level is perfect at         
907,5.0,                       very good

910,5.0,                       excellent flavor   very refreshing   a good purchase      
911,5.0,                       best water in the world    and ive tried most of them          
912,5.0,                       best tasting water  even better than fiji      
913,3.0,                       somehow the size is not what i expected  but it is ok  i still like this glacial spring water      
914,4.0,                       ok     
915,5.0,                       love the taste      
916,5.0,                       i like the taste of the water     
917,5.0,                       i tested the ph and it s a little lower than advertised  probably due to contamination from the plastic after storing it for too long  it s more like      but it s still basic  a lot of food is too acidic these days  and having an acidic body ph can make you unhealthy and more likely to develop cancer  this would be a good thing to drink if you want to neutralize your body  they might send you a similar generic brand for the water  but it s probably the same thing either way  highly recommended as far as bottled water goes      
918,5.0,                       it s good water  that s all i can say about it   but the bottle is really special i hate the new low plastic  recycle focused bottles that are being made  they squish in your hand and water can come flying out  or they get pushed out of shape in their  pack  and won t stand up with good balance  the  pack  is usually a thin piece of cardboard wrapped by a piece of plastic at least the same thickness as the bottle  many times  it s just the plastic wrapped around the bottles  no cardboard  what makes the thin plastic more recyclable than the thicker bottles  nothing  it s just a way of saving the manufacturer money while earning green stamps  you d have to be old to get that joke  from the public anyway  this bottle is much thicker  it s interesting to look at  and its packed in a cardboard box that you can recycle  even better  the bottom of the bottle is square  that shape makes it more stable  you re less likely to knock it over if you re a klutz like me  this particular sized bottle has more than enough water and is less top heavy than the next size up by the same company  see  klutz  mentioned above and you ll understand how that would be significant i refill the empty bottle from the tap for months  seriously  now what could be more recyclable than that  it s square shape is better than a round water bottle out of aluminum or plastic  it s almost klutz proof      
919,5.0,                       love this water      
920,5.0,                       simply love this water

929,4.0,                       not as much ph as i wanted      
930,5.0,                       nice taste to the water very good      
931,5.0,                       my favorite water         
932,5.0,                       the bottle speaks for itself  cute   but what s more is the     ml size   the svelte bottle fits in virtually any bag purse   great buy  great size  great price      
933,5.0,                       excellent   best water       
934,5.0,                       love this water   i am a self proclaimed water snob  not only does this water have a naturally occuring high ph value which is great for your health  but a very low dissolved solids listing   my new fav      
935,4.0,                       love  tastes wonderful     
936,5.0,                       came on time and is good water     
937,5.0,                       every branded water uses words like crisp and clean  but icelandic glacial is the only one i ve tasted that genuinely has an inherent crispness  it s hard to explain what that means  though i might describe it as having a hard edge profile in diametric opposition to fiji s soft and smooth profile  it s become one of my favorites i was glad to find icelandic glacial on amazon after buying it a couple times elsewhere online  since i buy a large share  if not most  of my consumables here it s a convenient one stop shop  had amazon finally added icelandic glacial to subscribe   save  i wondered   nope  not only no s s option  but it s actually gone missing entirely  sign up for an email reminder  that s it  outta luck c mon amazon  bring back icelandic glacial  pretty please  kthxbai      
938,1.0,                       i know this water comes from iceland but i didn t know that it takes business class ticket to fly here  with this price there is no other explanation it s water  not gasoline  c mon      
939,5.0,                       best water in the world     
940,5.0,                       i dislike the taste of tap water in my city  so much so that i add some type of flavor to it to get it down   my cats will not drink the tap water  so we have to purchase filtered water for them   the tap water will leave a stain in their bowl after it evaporates   we replaced the entire water intake pipes including the main line and this did nothing to improve the water quality   we drank a bottle of icelandic water in the austin airport lounge and seriously enjoyed its tastes   i usually drink inexpensive spring water to avoid drinking city water but decided to treat myself to a case of icelandic water  which so far i have not found in the atlanta markets  icelandic water tastes so good  that i stopped adding any flavors to a glass of water   i found myself easily drinking more water and giving up fruit and soda drinks   the increased hydration has greatly reduced stomach and muscle cramps  improved skin appearance and eliminated headaches   in comparison to the money i spent in rx and otc medicines each month  buying icelandic each month is less expensive   only complaint is that it can not be ordered on subscribe and save      
941,5.0,                       good     
942,5.0,                       great waterbury sadly the shipping cost was just as much as the water  not worth it     
943,5.0,                       i first had this water in all places the desert   a very dry day   but it was so refreshing and not just because of the place   often you drink water but are not refreshed   this is crisp but lastingtry it really it is special     
944,5.0,                       the water is good and in a stylish  convenient bottle  plus  i get to support iceland  the only country in the world not to submit to the international financial zombie bankers after the economic melt down  by drinking their water  i hope to gain some of the viking manliness      
945,5.0,                       this is the only water that my aspergers son will drink   we all love the taste of this water      
946,2.0,                       overpriced   i can get this water at my local deli for a cheaper per bottle price the water itself is fantastic though      
947,5.0,                       love this water it has a clean refreshing taste reminds of being in iceland      
948,5.0,                       happy     
949,1.0,                       don t waste your hard earned money    it states that it is     ph but on two different brands of ph strips it only measures a     no different than my filtered water    this company is a lie    i ve even tested several bottles  too expensive when i can get it out of my tap    please don t waste your money    the science tells the truth         
950,1.0,                       i started drinking this water because it was labeled as naturally alkaline  as i have a medical issue that reacts badly to acid   when i started having problems  i tested everything i drink  and this came out as acidic not alkaline  about       thanks  amazon  for accepting my return   i m switching to evian which i just tested at         which is much better         
951,5.0,                       i fell in love with this water on a trip to iceland   even if it is tap water or in the bottle  in iceland  it is all pure water formed thousands of years ago   the taste is really wonderful expensive i will admit but everyone needs a vice and this water is mine      
952,1.0,                       not as advertised  getting frustrated with amazon product descriptions      
953,1.0,                       very disappointed with what was sent went back to pierrier and pellegrino     
954,1.0,                       this water is great  i had previously bought this same water from amazon fresh and received the complete    bottles  after reordering i only received one bottle but was charged full price i must say however that amazon promptly agreed to refund me for the missing water      
955,2.0,                       just barely ok     
956,1.0,                       holy s   this is excellent water but i bought it way back in november when it was only     a case  i guess its only for rich people now  either that or global warming is melting their glaciers      
957,4.0,                       the icelanders have figured how to put water into plastic bottles   amazing        
958,1.0,                       item claims  natural ph level of       i tested twice upon receipt   level is only      don t buy if looking for alkaline high ph   fiji and evian are much higher and much much cheaper   submitted a request to return      
959,1.0,                       it tastes like filthy  contaminated tap water   i ve been drinking bottled water exclusively for many many years  i recently switched to fiji  but i heard good things about this water  so i decided to try it   worst decision ever      
960,1.0,                       i buy this water whenever i can and this last shipment did not taste like it usually does      
961,4.0,                       i m good the water     
962,2.0,                       cool water but not for         a bottle  to smalldrink vittel  for that price       
963,1.0,                       bottles wont fit into any cup holders     
964,2.0,                       the water was great  however  two cases were loaded into one box and was too heavy to lift      
965,1.0,                       first  i would like to state that i majored in chemistry and now i teach advanced chemistry now  let me tell you about this ph   the ph of this water when tested with a vernier ph probe was           this is actually considered acidic  not basic  alkaline   also  since the ph scale is logarithmic  that means that this water is approximately     times more acidic than advertised i purchased this water at the recommendation of my doctor to help with pregnancy induced heart burn   i also tested the ph of my tap water with the same probe   that tap water tested at      which would be better than this overpriced water for my heartburn before a representative posing as a customer states that the probe is faulty or not designed to measure the ph of water but instead the ph of urine or saliva  which i have seen suspiciously posted in regards to the use of ph strips on other rebuttal posts    don t   just don t   this product should be sued for false or misleading advertisement   at the very least  you need to take off the ph of     on the label and advertisements      
966,1.0,                       my tap water tastes better than this   has a dirty aftertaste   i bought this based on reviews   i find it hard to believe people really like this water      
967,1.0,                       very disappointed  tastes like tap water      
968,3.0,                       tastes like water       
969,4.0,                       wasn t impressed  wasn t upset  filled my fridge  i drank it  i was thirsty  then i was not  won t be buying again      
970,5.0,                       we vacationed in iceland for a week  on the plane  they gave us bottles of this water and told us to keep the bottle and refill during our stay i had read about how good the water is in iceland but really  how much better could it be than our water    we were skeptical  however  they are right  this water tastes amazing i buy it by the case when it goes on sale at our local store   i have done two  tests  with this water  we have a friend who works in the water business  i served him this water w o telling him just gave him a glass when he was over  after drinking it  he commented on how good it was  wanted to know if it was from our well then  just last week we had new friends over  she only drinks water  i have her a glass of this  not telling her anything about the water   she asked for a second glass and commented on how great the water tasted  this water is delicious  i put a bottle in the freezer for     hours to get it cold  and to have ice floating around      
971,3.0,                       this is hands down the best tasting water i ve ever had except maybe for water from a live stream in new zealand that i filled an empty bottle with whilst traveling  the flavor is clean with no funny aftertaste  that said  this costs me       bottle at the grocery store and amazon is selling it for       bottle  total ripoff   if the price were comparable to my grocery store  i would subscribe for life  until that happens  i ll keep buying it at the grocery store      
972,3.0,                       i have enjoyed islandic water for a long time but this last case has a very strong musty or earthy smell and slightly funny taste   expiration date isn t for another year so it can t be that i am hesitant about drinking more      
973,2.0,                       i ve been buying icelandic glacier water for a long time  due to spinal problems i thought why not get the water delivered and also the small bottle  box came messed up on one corner  one bottle was completely empty and    were smashed  the water tasted worse than tap water  this is not the same icelandic glacier i ve been drinking      
974,1.0,                       taste wise  the water is actually decent the reason i m giving this   star is because the product description is misleading  the bottle clearly states that the ph of the water is      i tested the ph of several bottles and to my surprise  the ph is actually somewhere in the ballpark of    which means this water is not slightly alkaline as advertised but is in fact acidic      
975,5.0,                       i know this isnt saying much  but this beats the tar out of the dasani water i was drinking before  there s absolutely zero unpleasant aftertaste  the bottles are huge  and it wont break the bank like fiji water  this is the first product i m going to use the sub and save option on  i recommend trying this if youre looking for a higher quality water to quench your thirst      
976,5.0,                       my whole family loves this water  the kids love it comes from a melted glacier so the call it frozen water   we all love the fresh clean taste of this thirst quenching water   i have trouble drinking regular city water since i have heighten taste buds  i can taste the chlorine in the water which tastes like drinking bleach  i love having this water  since i tend to get dehydrated a lot  because i am on the nitro patch and blood pressure medication  this is a delicious tasty water even the  kids love  to drink   i like natural spring water from fiji  and icelandic glacier water and aqua panna from italy  drj     
977,1.0,                       i am so sick of the lies that companies tell   i just received eight bottles of icelandic water   the icelandic water tastes awful  which is why i decided to test the ph  the ph came back about     which is very acidic  just as bad as dasani water  as you can see in the photo i took here  i tested the ph of evian water and put it next to the acidic ph test of the icelandic water  at least evian proves to be true to their claims      
978,5.0,                       i bought    bottles of different brands and types sources of water from all over the world because i wanted to find one that provided a  taste  i love  quenched my thirst with no after taste and had a great mouth feel   and  i didn t want to be swayed by the brand name  the packaging  the source of the water  etc   i had a friend help me set it up as a blind taste test   all water was cold   after multiple rounds of testing  icelandic came out on top as my favorite in every round   i love the taste of this water   love  it   when you do a taste test like this  it s pretty surprising how much difference there is in  waters    icelandic is so clean and smooth   no sulfur or chemical or salty or dirty or heavy taste feel   just perfect for me      
979,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i ve tried hudreds of different bottled waters and icelandic glacial is in my top    favorite   the ph is       it s one of the first bottled waters to be carbon neutral   it has a very pure taste  and it has a cool bottle with a glacier on the top      
980,5.0,                       for some reason  this brand tastes pure  clean and is easier to drink than any other water i have tasted   except in switzerland  where i used to live    i am trying to keep my body more alkaline rather than acidic  which is better for the blood vessels and other parts of the body      
981,5.0,                       i admit i didn t buy icelandic water off of amazon  but i ve had this water plenty of times  i first had it on my way to iceland when the airline gave it to us   icelandic air   and it was like heaven in a bottle  if i could take a shower in this stuff i would  the water in iceland in general is so crisp pure and clean  i swear when i drink only this water for a week my skin and system feels different and so much better      
982,5.0,                       i tried this last night for the first time and ill drink it forever now  as the first sip hit my throat i instantly thought of the vial of pure glacier water that bobby the waterboy carried that saved him and the game  this has got to be it   lol it is so cold and crisp that it almost hurts your throat  incredible       
983,5.0,                       size of bottles very convenient to tote instead of logging around the usual sizes  taste ok nothing impressive to say on flavor but not that bad  i will definitely buy again      
984,2.0,                       tastes very moldy  expensive   it did not make a good first impression         
985,1.0,                       did a taste test  tastes like tap water  other brands are better also  amazon doesn t seem to know how to ship the bottles  arrived damaged several times  weak     
986,5.0,                       love the purity and crispness of this water  plus has a high  ph level  i regularly drink figi water  but i thought i try something different  i prefer this more but it s  quite more expensive than figi  amazon prices fluctuate   so when the price  goes down and  or the site offers a coupon   i will  purchase      
987,5.0,                       this is the perfect drink to pair with a documentary about the melting of icelandic glaciers ironically packed in plastic bottles for the perfect evening of reflection about the need to have a package that lasts       years for a  beverage  consumed in a  few seconds and watching the world burn  or flood  oh and the ph is    very important     
988,3.0,                       this is the best tasting water i ve ever had  the problem is you used to get a box of    for the price that you now get    i ve seen it for       there s even a very crooked seller selling one bottle for      i unfortunately can t buy it at its current price     
989,4.0,                       if i was a millionaire  this would be stocked in my pantry at all times   unfortunately  fixed income is so limiting  i will have to wait until major coupon savings are once again available   excellent water  great taste and hydration  but cost prohibitive      
990,4.0,                       it has a very soft mouth feel   easy to drink and refreshing      
991,5.0,                       there is a huge difference in taste of this water when comparing to others such as fiji  evian       and smart water  will continue buying  however the price at my local fresh market is       for     liters so your paying close to a dollar more per bottle on here      
992,5.0,                       im normally an evian kinda gal  but i got a heads iup on a deal from  its hip to save  about this water and couldnt pass up trying it   i actually quite like it  it has a good clean taste and is cheaper than evian   i put it on my subscribe and save list  its just that good   i d recommend it      
993,5.0,                       it s pricey  but it is by far the best water i have found  i can get this locally much cheaper  however  i can get a case for     of the     liter bottles  and they put them on sale at times even cheaper      
994,5.0,                       i m a water snob of the highest order  i drink almost only water      of the time  and this one is definitely a treat      
995,5.0,                       nothing added and nothing taken away  feels good to drink all natural pure water with no added mineral or after tastes  which is exactly how it tastes   refreshing and clean       recommend this brand  they are also environmentally friendly and leave no carbon footprint      
996,5.0,                       truly the best water i have ever purchased   i know  some people think water is water   however  if you are buying and drinking water that is bottled in plastic  then this the product that you want   hard to describe    crisp pure taste without any aftertaste   good ph  not too high    just right  for those avoiding water that is too acidic   i m hooked and will be a customer for life      
997,1.0,                       i was totally psyched to love this water  treating my body to a great resource for better health  unfortunately  drinking this water caused severe intestinal distress   abdominal cramping  difficulties with elimination  when i stopped drinking it and drank my usual spring water  the symptoms disappeared  when i resumed drinking icelandic  the symptoms recurred  i appreciate that amazon has refunded what i paid for ordering this product      
998,1.0,                       this water literally tastes like dirt  after my first drink there was actual grit in my mouth  i bought   of these big bottles of water and now i am using it to boil my food  make coffee bc i don t want it to go to waste  it s freakin expensive water and the quality is terrible  please for the love of all things good and holy  do not buy this water      
999,5.0,                       best water out there  i love this water but i don t buy it for me  i buy this for my cat cause when he was a baby he wouldn t drink water and i had tried every kind of water out there and the vet said to keep looking  i found this water at one store that sells it in my area and he loved it  i have purchased this water for going on almost   years and it s pricey but its well worth it  i tried to put spring water in one of these bottles and pour it into my cats bowl and he knew the difference and wouldn t drink it lol  great quality and i ll continue to purchase this water with no hesitation      
1000,5.0,                       bought a bottle at the store as a novelty and was pleasantly surprised   the water is borderline sweet  though i wouldn t describe it as sweet   it tastes legitimately clean and healthy  i think there is something to be said for it   definitely doesn t just  taste like water  as some cynical reviews have said   it is multitudes better than dasani or other bottled waters i ve tried and infinitely better than the mineral ridden tap rust water in my area   the only thing i m confused by is the price  in my local giant eagle one bottle cost       seldom is giant eagle cheaper than amazon in my area   fix the price and i ll gladly purchase in quantity on subscription      
1001,5.0,                       great taste  naturally alkaline  this held with a drop test  the source of the water is attractive  most alkaline waters are man made  this is natural      
1002,5.0,                       i absolutely loved this water   we have well water that i don t really like drinking it   the other waters you buy in the grocery store taste like plastic to me   i ordered this and now i am spoiled to the pure taste   it is expensive in reference to the other waters you can buy out there but  i think it is worth every penny   alot of the waters are just out of a tap and i can do that at home   feel like i am being pampered by this water   love it       
1003,5.0,                       water was very good tasting and i tried it while amazon had it on a deal  to expensive though at regular price      
1004,5.0,                       god i love this water makin me feel like a rich b tch up in this b tch     
1005,2.0,                       bottles were all smashed down  water leaked everywhere      
1006,5.0,                       clean soft taste of water  believe it or not  there is a difference  filtered water has a slightly acidic taste to it  i had a blind test of various types of water and i could tell the difference indeed      
1007,2.0,                       doesn t work for heartburn at all   the ph isn t high enough for it to work on heartburn   decent tasting water  but ineffective for heartburn      
1008,2.0,                       not sure why but this is the only water that gives me a sort of heartburn when i drink it regularly  it s really a shame too because it taste good and quenches my thirst      
1009,3.0,                       this water tastes good  however i don t believe it s that much better  if any  then some of the other high  priced brands   the slight improved taste  in my opinion   does not justify the higher cost      
1010,5.0,                       great water expensive     
1011,5.0,                       this water is great tasting  right up there with waiakea at the top of the list of high quality bottled waters  and the size of these bottles is perfect for carrying      
1012,5.0,                       gives you insane amounts of energy     
1013,5.0,                       tastes so good  better when cold      
1014,5.0,                       it comes packed so well that it is almost impossible to open the box   the water is the best  however      
1015,4.0,                       don t really know if this is any better than any other water  but it does have a very clean  pure and refreshing taste  i would buy it again  but not often  because it would be too pricey      
1016,1.0,                       tap water has a higher ph  on the photo  the darker the green on the ph paper  the more alkaline the water  tap water is more alkaline than icelandic  do not be scammed by fake advertising      
1017,5.0,                       i hate this water  bought it on sale because i was curious  it tastes like nothing  and now all my other  filtered or bottled  waters taste like crap  this ruined me for other waters    it s basically a drug      
1018,5.0,                       living in south florida  you cannot believe how terrible the taste of water is  i discovered this water recently on my trip to iceland and absolutely love it  highly recommend

1021,5.0,                       excellent  clean tasting water   love the bottle design and the bottle size       fl oz    delivery via amazon prime   fabulous      
1022,5.0,                       icelandic water is hands down the best tasting water in my opinion      
1023,5.0,                       tastes like any other water to me but my wife can tell the difference between different waters and she loves this one

1074,5.0,                       the item is great but the driver arrived no mask and no gloves   this is the second prime truck deliverer to arrive unprotected   it is the law      
1075,5.0,                       this is expensive for the amount of water you get but well worth it when you taste the water  i have never had water as good as this except when i was skiing in the alps
