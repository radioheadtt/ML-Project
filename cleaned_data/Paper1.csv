0,5.0,                       a lot of people use copier paper in their ink jet printer and then wonder why their printer jams and breaks down early  i have learned the hard way that to get grief free  long life from my ink jet printers  it is best to use ink jet paper  the higher quality results are noticable  there is less dust given off that collects in the mechanism of the printer  and the printer lasts longer but more importantly  when i hand someone a document that i printed on this paper  it is not unusual to hear  oh  you use good paper   that makes me feel good      
1,5.0,                       this is a very reasonably priced general purpose white printer paper   it is  ultra white   and the paper works extremely well with especially hp printers  but probably any printers in terms of clean and accurate feeds and precision results   print quality is very crisp and clean  even photographs reproduce well on this paper   the price is excellent for this level of quality  and a paper of this type should always be used with better inkjet or laser printers made by hp and other manufacturers      
2,5.0,                       this is a great product  bright white  nice weight   my suggestion   do not order it with other items   when i did do so  twice   the shipping box was not sufficiently packaged to prevent damage from the heavy ream of paper to other items in the box  nor to itself  as it apparently flew around the inside of the shipping box during the shipping process   if you want the product  and hope for a positive outcome  my suggestion  order it solo   i won t order it from amazon with other items again   as an aside  amazon was great with providing me a refund      
3,2.0,                       caution   i received two broken   open on two paper package sides     one package had slight bent corners when i today just opened for use and one paper package was sealed in a re wrapped plastic bag thus knowing shipping broken loose package   this is the one with     bent folds in one corner at least     sheets  my issue is that i need it today and now     so i will keep   see pictures of what was in sealed box just opened today      hp paper  office ultra white    lb     x     ledger     bright      sheets     ream           made in the usa
4,2.0,                       i thought this paper would be at least servicable judged on reviews  however it is very thin and lackluster   i am a real estate broker and need to print reports for my customers and this paper produces reports that are poor quality  with ink bleeding through to the back and edges that curl up   it s just plain flimsy   it s actually the worst paper i have ever worked with  and i certainly expected better from the hp brand   i m assuming this paper was made decently in the past  however what they are now delivering must have suffered a severe drop in quality      
5,3.0,                       the product came messed up  the box used for shipping was way to big  not enough packing to hold it in place and got shaken  as it was for a specific project with a timeline  i used what i could  the rest got trashed  not usable   the product was as expected  that of it that survived  it works and the print is good  the paper is fine  but i will buy locally next time      
6,1.0,                       this is by far the worst printer paper i ve ever used  it absolutely will not print in my epson nx    without jamming  i m throwing away the ream of paper rather than risk breaking my printer with paper jam after paper jam  when i try printing with a sheet from another brand  i have no problem at all  as soon as i try using this again  i m back to constant jamming  this was a lesson learned the hard way      
7,5.0,                       the price of buying computer paper bulk on amazon really cannot be beat  as a teacher i use a lot of paper for printing  so i appreciate fair prices and good quality printing paper  hp has always been a brand i have gone to for computer accessories   because i know that i m going to get a quality item  i was excited when i saw that there was a coupon along with the product   and that definitely helped make up my mind to purchase this product      
8,3.0,                       could have been   stars   i would have given this purchase   stars  but one of the three reams had significant damage    a little over a third of the paper in that ream was unusable    had deep dents running the full length of the paper    so much so that you could feel it through the wrapper  the box it came in had a tear in it but did not go all the way through        
9,5.0,                       it came in a box and was protected well throughout the transition  it arrived before  pm  i am happy i have paper now loaded into my printer  now i don t have to worry  the paper quality is good and i can definitely tell it is really white  when it prints the ink doesn t bleed onto the back of the printing paper  i think this paper handles it well      
10,5.0,                       i have found that this paper is the most consistent for every day inkjet printer usage on the two hp envy photo units in the household   it is used mostly for black and white and pages such as emails and with highlight colors like the grocery shopping list from the grocery web site   it works well with images from screen captures and on line sites  even white on saturated black backgrounds when i can t avoid them   i rarely need to switch to photo quality paper and high quality print settings although hp provides on line ordering  i have found order management and fulfillment by amazon prime to be easier and also a cost benefit  along with elimination of inessential travel   this july          order was a re order of a            order of the same product   there is no problem keeping a supply for such an extended time  consuming on ream at a time      
11,5.0,                       i ve gone through a ton of printers   it seems right when their factory ink runs out  they start having issues   so i got tired of the bs and took the plunge and got an hp laser jet pro printer   of course  with crappy paper  the colors would be dull  the feel of the paper is sketchy  getting it to feed properly without jamming  especially in the heat of a laser printer  is all basically a flip of the coin    here s hoping it feeds   and feeds straight   and holds the ink   and doesn t smear so i got some hp paper figuring hp paper  hp printer  match made in heaven and i can finally stop feeling a twinge of anxiety as to if sending something to print will be the beginning of a battle with the printer  the ink  and the paper good news  this paper feels great  it feeds perfectly  just the right thickness of paper  and holds the ink perfectly   its not the least expensive paper you could buy on amazon   but hey  you get what you pay for   and to have prints you can rely on   this is your best bet      
12,4.0,                       okay print quality  great  amount of paper per pack  good  but  the way it arrived was just annoying  the packages  both packages  were destroyed  i m just glad that not  all  the paper wasn t ruined  a few of them we re dirty and needed to be wasted  i don t have the time to send them back to probably just to get more in the same condition so kept what i had  but next time  i ll buy more paper elsewhere      
13,1.0,                       i thought i was getting good paper with all the   star reviews here  but when i looked at a sheet  something seemed off about it at my office  we use staples brand    lb    brightness paper  the same specs as this hp paper   i went to my office and brought one sheet of the staples paper home so i could compare it with the hp paper i could definitely see a difference holding up the sheets against a light  the hp paper looked more  spotty  than the staples paper   just hold up a sheet against a light and you ll see what i mean   the staples paper is less spotty   also  the staples paper is more white  and the hp paper looks a bit purplish against a light also  i bought   of these reams  and like several other reviewers mentioned    of the reams had the packaging ripped open in the box      
14,5.0,                       where do i even begin  before my purchase of this paper i was lost  i was swimming in a world of sub par paper  flyers  assignments  bills  essays  all written on paper that was not up to par then i saw this case now i m a believer there is no going back  so crisp  so clean  it s like my eyes did not know what the color  white  reallt was before this paper came into my life  other colors have become more vibrant   and i m sure this has nothing to do with my recent eye appointment we are talking a     paper ratio here  people this paper makes me want to be a better person it was made with trees that make a difference and as we all know  paper is life  so buy it      
15,1.0,                       really bad paper  first time in   years of epson printer that it fouled up and jammed consistently  worked on my newer hp printer but honestly unacceptable  r we reaching era of proprietary paper       
16,1.0,                       do not buy this paper  i broke my good printer thinking it went bad trying to fix the paper feed  bought a new printer and was still getting the paper error  i figured both printer cannot be having the same issues  so i put a different set of paper in and it printed with no problem  now i wasted money and bought a new printer and broke a perfectly good printer when all along the issue was the paper  i would never buy paper online again     
17,5.0,                       pretty good paper haven t seen it do any bad things yet  all you do is buy it then ya open the fancy bad for the environment plastic it s in  dispose of properly for safety of human race  then you pull out a stack and put it in the paper slide on your printer  then you hack your computer make it print and bam it ll spit a non blank piece of paper at you for your delight also beware puppies like to steal your paper from the printer and rip it up but the paper works good for the too      
18,5.0,                       i can t fault the product   it is fine   unfortunately  don t try to buy only one   the product was shipped in one of those flimsy plastic mail envelopes   i doubt it even got outside of the gates before the paper wrapping around the ream split open   let s face it  everything get jostled around during shipping  so expecting something to not get tossed is not realistic   in the end  i had a package full of bent  dinged  ripped and unacceptable paper   i was able to salvage a surprisingly large amount  but     to     was still just not usable   it should have been shipped in a box      
19,3.0,                       i was so excited to use this because i have an hp printer  i was a little disappointed when i started using it  first impression was it is a little bit thin than what i expected  i was looking for quality paper to print all my notes and projects for school  the ink on it is alright  you can read it clearly  i am not sure if thats my hp printer that does that  what i hate the most  is that it jams my printer  some paper gets stuck and sometimes when i print  i get a double paper  you know when one blank paper sticks with the one printing  overall  i mean it does its job but i didnt expect these little circumstances for a high end brand paper pros   its the cheapest one available      
20,3.0,                       i was running out of paper so ordered a package with other essential items to consolidate shipments   have not used it as yet so cannot rate brightness  quality or value   until state governments completely lift corona virus restrictions  it is best to limit purchases to just essential items   feeling sad today when i was checking jeff bezos ceo of amazon and owner of washington post bias   all other google search results had positive headlines regarding dexamethasone a steroid that reduces covid    deaths    then there was washington post with the headline  live updates  fda yanks emergency authorization for drug touted by trump as covid    treatment   think i will switch online shopping to walmart and target to protest of washington post bias         
21,5.0,                       i just bought a brand new hp wireless printer   i became a printer paper snob due to my older sister sarah  this purchase it just made sense  it was a great deal  i m not gonna run out to the store to buy more printer paper  i can just continuously re order this bundle over and over again    once i find out how much i m actually going to use and in what time frame  i ll probably set up an auto ship  i taped it sure but i did open it and it is really good quality super thick paper which is great when your first time college freshman during a global pandemic doing distance learning  there s a lot of extra learning you gotta do  but what are the reasons i got an hp printer is because they ve always done as well in my family for as long as i can remember  and i really want to get the hp instant ink program going on  you only pay for as much printing as you do not the ink s cost  because if i did it that way i be completely broke all the time  i feel that these choices have been some of the best i ve ever made in my life let alone this year  and i strongly recommend everyone to do the same  it was completely genius idea     xoxo     
22,1.0,                       i ordered this product because it had good reviews  these cartridges are extremely difficult to insert   they are packaged oddly and have no instructions inasmuch as they don t look like the regular brothers cartridges   at first the printing was okay   then the black would not show up   i supposed that was the reason there are a few more black cartridges than any other colors   when i tried to eject the black cartridge it wouldn t budge   i had to eject the color beside it in order to get it out with difficulty  it was also odd that my computer did not warn me that my  printer was low on ink   anyway  even after changing cartridges  the black printing never showed  up or came in very light   i have finally found and ordered brothers cartridges  due to come in tomorrow  i only hope my printer isn t ruined   they warn you never to use any cartridges but brothers cartridges   i wish i had stuck to that      
23,5.0,                       this paper out performs other paper by a ratio of   to    paper is compatible with ink and graphite lead pencil  paper makes decent paper airplanes  one can even read things from the paper after writing and printing modifications to the paper s very classy complete eggshell white design  the invisible pattern works great i can t even see it  can roll phatty boom batty check and chong class spliffs  paper may be used to mail information thoughts pictures coloring and stickers to other people  next time you see the chicken heads clicking make sure to stop and say biiiatch i got the paper      
24,3.0,                       came well packaged and it s plain photo paper so printing any documents you really can t go wrong with plain paper  i ordered this paper because of its stated ability to hold vibrant color when printing with color  however  that is not what i experienced  if you re printing a normal document it comes out amazing but the colored ink tends to bleed with this paper  it also didn t turn out vibrant  small amounts of color may be fine but for anything with more than a word here or there in color this paper isn t the best      
25,5.0,                       i opened up my last ream of georgia pacific copy print paper  so it was time to restock  i don t print nearly as much as i used to  but it wouldn t do to run out  i came across this paper when i was browsing  and since it was selling at a discounted price  and i have hp printers  one deskjet and one laserjet  the deal seemed perfect  perhaps a little too perfect  so  because some reviewers had complained of paper arriving damaged  i only ordered two reams i needn t have worried  and probably should have ordered a couple of more while the getting was good  the packages arrived in perfect condition  i won t be opening the packages until i use up the rest of the paper i have open  probably several months  but when i do i ll update this review      
26,1.0,                       actually the printer paper deserves   stars   but how the product looks after shipping and when the package is opened   sorry  only   star because that is what a printer paper deserves which has bent edges and can t be used  it still can be used to light up the grill   a smoker or a campfire   so don t worry too much   i knew that it is a gamble   but i won t buy in the future definitely not by mail       
27,2.0,                       might be a good paper but would not know   the paper arrived in a box with another item and with no padding   both ends of wrapper were open   bent sheets   dirty on the ends to the point it is only usable as scratch paper   could not put in printer so don t know how it prints    waste of my money and time   no one cares enough to ship it properly protected   five cents of bubble wrapped would have kept it protected   instead i had to drive to a local store and buy a ream to continue to work   poor quality control all around      
28,3.0,                       i will never order a ream of paper again because people who pack for amazon put it in a box way too big so it jostled around  the main covering was ripped off it and many papers were bent  the worse part  it was exposed to moisture at some point because the whole ream had that ripple effect  i took the papers out that were not as bad and i am using them  it was not worth re ordering or fussing about  i just won t do it again that way  otherwise  the brightness was just fine  i am tossed up about value for money rating but it was a good price  just by the time it arrived to me the value was seriously depreciated  so  oh well    but  i love amazon so this will not stop me from buying other stuff      
29,1.0,                       received the hp printer paper office   lb     x       ream case        sheets  the case for the    reams of paper was split on most of the sides  had been re taped  i was expecting the worst  every ream of paper had the ream wrapping paper split and torn  it looks as if the paper is usable  but i m not sure  the condition of the product is something that i just don t expect from amazon      
30,4.0,                       this is the most completely sealed ream of paper that i have ever purchased  and in plastic no less   nearly impossible to open   after shredding the plastic wrapper into tiny pieces to gain access  a zip strip opener became visible   we will see if ream    is any easier to open knowing that this exists   i guess if you store your paper in a damp location  this might be a plus for you   the product itself is excellent  but so far i am not a fan of the packaging      
31,3.0,                       i thought i would try this paper to save money  i normally use hp all in one paper in my hp      all in one machine  and that works flawlessly   in comparison  this paper caused multiple pieces of paper to unintentionally feed out sometimes  so  instead of printing a   page document  i get   pages  two of which are blank  worse yet  sometimes the pages  that were supposed to print are not centered properly on the pages  and text gets cut off  my printer works perfectly with the more costly paper  with this paper  i have frequent frustration  waste and wasted extra time  this might work for your machine  but for me  i will pay extra for the paper that works      
32,1.0,                       when i removed the typing paper from the box the package was torn into   clearly a return product because you can tell it was cut across the top and down the side  paper was falling out   no idea if i have the correct amount of sheets   i realize this is just paper but very disappointed there is no quality check before shipping      
33,5.0,                       great price  and great quality   i mean  it s kind of hard to mess up printer paper  i bought a new printer last year  and i didn t use it that frequently my business started growing this year  so i found that i had to rely on my hp printer a lot more now  when my paper ran out  i checked on amazon to see what the options were usually amazon basics is the cheapest option  so i was surprised to see that hp had a better deal the print quality on this paper is great  and i haven t had any issues with it  it s great for printing shipping labels  and i would definitely purchase again      
34,3.0,                       when it arrives  the package broke and some of the paper got damaged a little bit  the paper inside is kind of as expected  but i think i should have used another brand or type of paper about this paper  thin  somehow transparent  white but not with too much brightness  it has everything that the paper needs to be  but just doesn t make me too happy after i printed things out by my epson ecotank et series printer i would just use it to print things that doesn t need to last long since i don t feel like to have these paper stapled together and use them forever  that is to say  if you would like to print out random things or temporary things  you could go for this paper      
35,3.0,                       the paper is so cheap that i decided to buy two   it s cheaper than the amazon self product   the package is poor to start with and when i open pne pack the package wrap paper tear all the way and all    paper are on the floor here and there   after collecting all papers  i tested on one page and the printing quality is poor and with shadows on the borderline   it may be the printer as well   i will try the amazon self product next time      
36,1.0,                       i bought this in feb  to keep my paper inventory stocked  i just had to print the same thing over   times and each time it came out of printer s mudged  this is not happening with the paper i had before  so it has to be the paper quality  it does not adhere   i have to do letters to professionals and it is completely frustrating that now i am literally out of paper because i cannot use this whole ream  and i can t return it because it was bought in feb and wrapping is tossed  don t buy this   don t risk it      
37,2.0,                       i would like to verify others  complaints about this paper  it s a stack of three reams in a cardboard box   the base of the box houses two reams completely  but the top ream extends out of the top of the box  the lid covers the rest  the part of the ream that sticks out of the bottom box slides around during shipping making the paper warp and crinkle  even if you decided to use the crinkled paper  it gets jammed in the printer  one would think that in       they would have such a simple and obvious problem figured out  my guess is that this paper isn t made or processed by anyone that is actually an hp employee  it probably gets farmed out to a contractor  it s amazing to me that hp either doesn t realize or doesn t care that when they put their brand name on something  they re the ones taking the hit for shoddy quality  dumb  smh      
38,3.0,                       this paper is a little thinner and  toothier  than the heavier  smoother    pound xerox paper i usually buy  which could explain why it jammed in my laser printer  it was a real bear getting it unwrapped from around the paper rollers and free up the printer so i could finish printing     however  it is a nice bright white color and the laser printer toner ink seems to adhere to its surface just fine  i would prefer a smoother surface  though later        edit this paper has jammed again in my hp laser printer  am knocking a star off my rating  they need to figure out how to make this paper heftier and smoother so it stops jamming up the printer      
39,2.0,                       the papers were little bend when i opened it but i used it anyways since it s for home   bright white  great price  great quality paperi gave it only   stars because it was bended   i can still use it because i bought these for home use  such as kids homework  colorsheet for the kids  pta announcement    but if it s formal occasion  i wouldn t be able to use bended paper even if the paper quality is great i will still order these paper again  because it s great price  lets hope some can be used for home and some use for formal occasion       
40,5.0,                       can t knock any points off this paper  it is great but i will say  for those  like me  that don t really print much and don t know anything about paper weighting  you ll probably want to get some thicker paper if you re printing standalone sheets if you re printing a lot of pages for a binder or something  this paper is ideal  thin  high quality  very bright  but it is quite flimsy  and that is entirely my fault for not knowing the difference      
41,3.0,                       i have nothing bad to say about the paper   hp paper is an excellent paper for general printing and copying using an ink jet printer   the issue we had was with the delivery   not sure who did the handling but by the time the box arrived it was  bent  and several of the paper reams were torn open   fortunately the paper itself was not damaged  surprised by that    i think the damage was due to the hp box being bound in a plastic strip that was used to carry the box from place to place   absolutely no  care  was taken to handle the package      
42,1.0,                       i paid for a ream of copy paper and expected to get it in a sealed package   instead i got a package that had been cut open and resealed with amazon stickers    i also arrived later than promised   i submitted  for a refund without return and will upgrade my bad opinion if that  does indeed  happen      
43,4.0,                       this paper was exactly as the description read  got what we wanted  works in print copying as we d expect as well  amazon delivered the next day as promised i am happily making better use of our new printer  hp  by adding this size paper to our stock  isn t it nice  in this world where so much junk is manufactured  there are a few companies that actually make a product  paper quality doesn t meet the price  it s expensive      
44,5.0,                       during the close down there was no place to purchase office supplies in pr  this brand of paper is of high quality and acceptable price  i had to wait for arrival as expected during the epidemic  but arrived as i was on my last rem of paper  i thank all involved that risk their health to provide service during this time  thank you     
45,4.0,                       i don t know if these are like castoffs or what  but as someone that was a teacher for    years  i ve sure seen my share of copier paper  this is the first time i have ever opened  smashed case  by the way  on one end  a case and all the paper on the inside  every single ream  was open on both ends  there wasn t any glue  so my guess is that these were mistakes  someone realized it  and that s why they are here  i don t know   if i were giving this a grade  it would get a c at best      
46,2.0,                       the paper is ok if you print black and white and don t highlight with the marker on the top  which i have to do for studying   but if you do it s a mess  paper doesn t absorb the inc even if you wait for an hour  highlighting turns into dirty block line instead of neon yellow  if you print colored version it s seen through the paper   really bad quality  will not buy it again      
47,5.0,                       when it comes to my personal life and my business i don t give a lot of time or thought to printer paper  i either have it or i don t  i never bought that there was a difference until i got this paper  clarity and brightness is a huge difference than the paper i was buying from walmart  the paper has a softness to it that makes it nice to actually handle if that s a thing  this will be my new go to paper supply for our business  we use it for our printer and we don t write on it so i can t tell you if it feathers are bleeds with different types of pens  for our needs this is definitely a win      
48,5.0,                       i did want to add that like may others have stated  my package arrived partially opened as well  however  it is only a corner  no pages are missing or damaged  the pages are wrapped in plastic  not paper  and are well protected  i will not drop a star for this  i will update the review when i actually use the paper  i have used hp paper in the past and have always found it to be of premium quality  i would expect nothing less from hp      
49,3.0,                       this is the second pack i bought via amazon s monthly subscription program  the first pack was nice and quality  so i decided to continue the subscription  however  the sheet in the second pack was noticeably thinner  which does not cause printing problems though  it s the sharp edge that easily gives my young children paper cuts on their hands and arms that concerns me  i will look for better alternatives in the future      
50,5.0,                       i would use this as your everyday print paper   it s not thick but definitely feels like the letters you get in your mailboxes at less than    i would definitely buy more   if you find your selves needing a lot of paper you should look for bunk deals that you can get cheaper than this if you re thinking about using this for your resume print i would recommend you to get a thicker paper      
51,5.0,                       i usually purchase every day printer paper from walmart or target but wanted to get a larger supply of paper to last me longer  as soon i started using the paper  i noticed an immediate difference in the brightness of the stuff i was printing off  this paper is also slightly thicker than the paper from walmart or target which is nice as its harder to see through to what is printed on the backside  this is now my go to printer paper      
52,3.0,                       i just ran out of paper   this work from home thing caught me off guard and i had to spent much on home office then i expected   i never use this brand before but for this pice tag  i have no complain   well made product      
53,4.0,                       this is a great value  the paper is thin  like a general use printer paper  the edge can be sharp so be careful  it does have a nice smooth finish  unlike most general use copy paper  this smooth finish may be problematic if you have not cleaned your printer s rollers in a long time because smoother paper is not so easy to grab  i enjoy the finish  so for me it is a plus  and the price can t be beat for my general home printing needs      
54,5.0,                       it s paper  two small teams come in an enormous four foot by four foot box  if you want to get a huge cardboard box for your kids to turn into a condominium or a barbie dream house  a rocket ship or even a school bus all you have to do is order two small reams of paper from amazon  apparently jeff be is doesn t mind paying     to ship    worth of paper  thanks  jeff      
55,2.0,                       my new epson printer jammed constantly with this paper   it s not the printer  when i switched to a heavier weight paper  it worked fine   not a good value for me  i had to throw away too many sheets and it took too much of my time to retrive fammed paper      
56,1.0,                       the outside package was in good shape but the actual paper wrapping was torn  see picture   it appears it was shipped that wayseveral pages was damages   i use a proportion that was good for a urgent printing job it is not worth my time to return it   next time it will be office depot     
57,5.0,                       this is nice paper  and the    weight is just right   however  i noticed that my ream has a minor problem   every so often the paper is wrinkled   at first i thought it was my printer doing it  but after examining the unused paper in the package  i discovered that it s a defect   it s not a problem for what i m printing  but i have never encountered it before with any paper      
58,5.0,                       thank you to amazon not whoever the vendor for selling this case at a reasonable price  i ve seen separate reams on this site and others offered for more than     order arrived quicker than expected  the quality of this paper is always good  it never jams in my printer and the ink adheres perfectly  no smudges  please continue  amazon  to offer this at an affordable price      
59,5.0,                       frankly i got caught up in reading paper reviews for way longer than i should have which lead me to doubts about buying the cheapest printer paper  this printer paper is great  it s just like all other printer paper i have ever used  perhaps i m not a printer paper connoisseur  but i ve never really noticed a difference in the paper i use in my printer  and this paper falls into that category  i only use this paper for personal use  so maybe if you need to have flashy paper to score the big account  i guess go with a fancy paper  if you re just printing stuff out for normal personal office use  this paper is the paper you are looking for     
60,5.0,                       i ordered this paper on   july        the paper is now about     gone   i am writing this review now because just today i was reloading my printer and thought   wow  this has lasted a long time  i should write a review  this is plain old paper  nothing fancy or sleek  but it is all you need in this day and age   if you want high quality paper  it is usually to take a resume to an interview or job fair or because you have a sales proposal or something else to provide a customer   the rest of what we print is usually just for editing  off screen  before we submit something electronically  for this type of printing the paper  and the value  cannot be beat in the past year and a half  this box of paper has helped my family as follows  i was able to edit my doctoral dissertation   though each chapter was submitted online  i had to edit them before submitting and i felt compelled to read my professor s comments  also provided online  on a printed document  the same goes with what i submitted to my dissertation committee   when the final submission was provided  i had to do a complete review before i submitted it  lordy  i did a lot of printing  my son was able to edit his college application essays  so he could edit them before submitting them online    so far  he has one college acceptance letter and is awaiting word from four more universities  our three kids printed all their class assignments  all in high school last year  my step daughter now attending community college    and more  i am sure again  given that most of us still need to read a hard copy document to edit  this paper is great oh  i ve read that a lot of folks with the lower ratings received their box in bad shape  so their problem was with the packaging   my box arrived in great condition and even if it hadn t  i have other boxes and bins i could have stored this paper in   that s why i was willing to take the chance and order it one and a half years later  i am still glad i did      
61,1.0,                       this paper is thicker than it should bemaybe it s a messed up shipment  but it jammed up my printer that s been working fine for several months i was printing a few pages   the next day when i put this paper in instead it jammed up my printer   now it s broken   hopefully they fix their next batches     
62,5.0,                       this was my first time ordering a ream of paper thru amazon  i was too lazy to get dressed and drive over to target  i was a little worried about how it would arrive  because    paper  anyways  it came in a box that came it tighly protected  the print quality of this particular paper is excellent  how it feels in the hand isn t sturdy  but it also isn t flimsy  it s right in between and that s good enough for me  i would definitely order this again      
63,5.0,                       item arrived exactly as described   perfect package no problems nor tears  shipped to amazon locker nearby which is also another great service   i am pleased with the value and price   i will order again  highly recommend this method of paper delivery   my last experienxe ordering paper from an ebay vendor didn t go well so turned here to amazon be sure to check out my amazon profile for more great content      
64,2.0,                       the paper is good    but two of them came in a large box and somehow one corner of the box was smashed  and the corners of one of the two got damaged too  those papers are now not great for my copier as it will get jammed  but if delivered properly  this is a great product  my other one is fine and i am happy with the quality of the paper and the price      
65,5.0,                       this paper has changed my life  it is the best white paper you can possible imagine  i ve been able to get my life back on track ever since i received this  my wife was close to leaving me but this was able to salvage our marriage  but really     it s paper  you can write  draw or print on      
66,5.0,                       i order this paper on saturday  july         and it arrived early a m  thursday  july         with standard shipping which ran a little more than        which is still very inexpensive considering the amount of paper received   the box arrived in a sturdy official hp box   while the box was a bit worn upon arrival  the paper arrived in great usable shape the first few top sheets were a little bent on one corner  but not badly and it really looks like they ll be okay once run through the printer  still have some old paper i m using up  so will post my printing experiences with it later  the paper is what i expected and is the same as what you would get in any store that sell s hp paper of this thickness and brightness   i use this thickness of paper heavily and for just about everything except resumes i ve bought paper of this thickness and brightness before for drafts of artwork   business letter s are fine with this too unless you are planning to use some kind of stamp embossing i m very happy with this purchase and will purchase it again if it s still available after our family uses up the       sheets   thanks for a great product at a great price   of course i would have been really thrilled if i could have gotten this with free shipping      
67,5.0,                       thankfully the wrapping of this paper is waterproof and completely sealed   the delivery driver left them in a spot where the package with the paper got soaked   i pulled the paper out and nothing was ruined   the paper prints well and doesn t get jammed   definitely worth the money      
68,2.0,                       i have a new mac and high speed epson et m     black and white printer i use a variety of hp papers because they claim they don t jam   this particular hp paper  office    jams   again and again therefore i will not buy it again or again   just a heads up      
69,4.0,                       for times when you need a hard copy for your own use and it s not going to be  archival  this is a great choice   print quality is clear for text   we use this with an inexpensive inkjet printer and it s perfectly adequate   it s cheap enough so you can let kids use it to draw on or use it for scratch paper too      
70,2.0,                       paper is like super thin  i would print things and just the ink alone would print over to the back and often tear the paper upon instant contact  even after putting it in a folder or binder the corners would be bent or completely ripped which i honestly don t even know how that could happen  i may give them another chance  let s see how the remainder of the batch goes      
71,4.0,                       i m an average consumer and need basic printer paper  this is the basic standard printer paper  the only complaint i have is that the ream comes wrapped in plastic  that plastic is forever waste  i will be looking for a different product that does not come wrapped in plastic  the plastic protects it but i m sure there s a different solution      
72,5.0,                       this paper was changed my life  i don t know what i would have done without the paper  i have never had paper before that was as good as this paper  it was just so papery and the perfect size  i could write on it or print on it  i could fold it and use of it for origami or paper airplanes  i could color pictures on it  i could cut it up in strips  it is simply perfect      
73,5.0,                       every time i try to print anything  my printer says this isn t the right paper   no  it s better paper   i usually take it out  shift again   try until it does print   i chose a light grey and it looks very classy   it isn t a thin  cheap rip off but a thick paper which looks impressive      
74,5.0,                       well  it s paper  lol   nothing for me to carry on about or criticize really   good price and good paper   i made a decision to review every single thing i purchase on amazon for the next year  so here ya go   honestly though   it beats going out to the store for one ream and it is more cost effecrive to get it from amazon as well      
75,2.0,                       this paper is not great  it prints ok  but is quite thin  you cannot use this for a double sided application without seeing hints of what s on the other side  i also would not recommend this paper for kids who are early writers  who tend to push down hard on the paper   the paper bunches up  and markers bleed through to the other side      
76,5.0,                       why go to the local big box store and pay extra  i end up buying it here  cheaper better quality and right in front of your door paper is paper  i ve got a different printer and different types of paper for photography but this works out        
77,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          hp printer paper     x         lb     ream       sheets      bright   made in usa   fsc certified copy paper   hp compatible       rthis is value for money  ideal for duplex printing as well  got   ream of paper of a  size      
78,5.0,                       i was a little nervous to buy printer paper off amazon because i was wondering if it would arrive crumpled  they shipped it in a box and it s perfect  i attached a pic to show its undamaged  very bright  good quality  sturdy paper  very good contrast with the ink      
79,3.0,                       the paper itself is great   my issue was how it was packed fir shipping  thrown on their sides with no support that the reams were bouncing around in the box and tore out of its wrapping so received them both with paper edges torn edges folded       
80,5.0,                       this printer paper is great  it s so white  you can tell that the paper isn t recycled and that s the kind of paper i go for  i will say that the paper is a little sharp  after printing some instructions on how to cut my own hair  i ended up getting a paper cut  i ll be fine  don t worry  great paper  will buy again  i ll be more careful next time  though      
81,5.0,                       this was cheaper than most places and was delivered to me   i d been putting off getting a ream since i used to buy paper by the case   i doubt there s a much better price paper ratio out there and the single ream came boxed and well shipped      
82,1.0,                       tears easily   can not erase if you write on it   really the worst paper i ve ever purchased   could not be the weight they say it is or is just very cheap in some other way   judging from the other reviews they must have changed the paper so i am force to just avoid the hp brand   a sad product from a once great brand name      
83,3.0,                       the paper is thin   when i print the full color page like a storybook or some pictures for my baby flashcard the color was in dark tone   the resolution seems low  not as same as the picture shown in the computer  i think with this paper i can just use for printing some single color like label or document with some simple color      
84,3.0,                       this paper is certainly inexpensive  but very thin  on my hp printer  the ink shows through on the other side  making   sided copying a no go except for the most informal of uses  if your kids waste a lot of paper  this product is o k  if you want to print documents  letters  term papers  manuscripts  it s not going to work well      
85,5.0,                       to not have to lug the box of paper from the shelf to the cart  to the register to the car to the home office  is a treat with delivery in general   but to also have the quality of the paper meet your needs and work as intended is even better   can t go wrong with authentic hp paper being delivered to your door      
86,5.0,                       i m using it for work  at a home setting  it s thinner than my previous ancient case but it s better  not as many paper cuts  overall i prefer it to most types i ve seen     
87,3.0,                       as far as printer paper goes  this is the thinnest i ve ever felt  and i worked in an office that went through literally tons of paper   it doesn t seem to be flimsy or fragile because of it  but it s certainly noticeably thin      
88,5.0,                       this paper was like any classic paper  i was able to print my work with no issues  it is nice quality  for the value it was lower than any other office supply stores in the area i will be getting my paper from here from now on      
89,4.0,                       the paper is slightly thinner than your good quality printer paper  kinda transparent    but i m not going to give it a horrible review because the price for the amount was good and i can still use it for printing and other purposes  it s not a loss for me  but i see what the other reviewers were saying      
90,1.0,                       it is super thin and keeps jamming  ruined my printer after having to take it apart to get the jammed pages out  it is super thin now and doesn t get pulled in properly  i used to always buy this paper  but they changed it  do not recommend anymore      
91,2.0,                       laser printer grabs     sheets at a time as the paper is unusually thin  this is the first time i ve seen with this printer  tossed     the paper already

93,5.0,                       i was looking for an economical option to refill my printing paper needs  the quality of the replacement paper was equal to or better than the original stock the price was great and provided and great value      
94,5.0,                       i will continue buying this paper from amazon   the price is great and so mucheasier than going to the store to buy it   less confusing since there are not    differenttypes of paper to have to choose from      
95,5.0,                       what can you say about paper  it s a good thickness  works well in our printer  has a good brightness to it  and was reasonably priced  this product came to us quickly  well packaged  and exactly as described  happy with the efficiency of this seller and the product  thanks      
96,5.0,                       i am on a budget because of returning to school the university requires       word papers or writing assignments and i print a lot of paper with other students this hp paper is inexpensive and prints up my homework papers with quality and quantity i cannot afford anything else for a starving student      
97,5.0,                       it was very soft and comfortable to my printer for its lack of anyone to keep it company on through the lonely nights without having paper  it recently went through a breakup and needed a refill  this paper restored its place in my home and society after being through a rough patch of no paper  the paper filled the hole in its ink wasting heart  all in all the paper printed quite nice  you should buy it      
98,3.0,                       during the pandemic  as a  shut in   i was desperate for printer paper to be delivered   although this is hewlett packard brand name  the quality is only so so   a better value for quality are the single packages that one can purchase at costco   those are much heavier bond paper      
99,5.0,                       the package of hp printer paper office   lb     x       ream      sheets  arrived quickly and is exactly as described  i use it for my laser printer and the print quality is great  the paper is not too thick and not too thin so i m very happy with it and will not hesitate to order it again      
100,5.0,                       this   lb     bright white paper is perfect for my epson desktop printer  solid product  just as if it were bought in an office products store  not a knock off brand  better price than i can find anywhere locally      
101,5.0,                       this is very good paper for the price  i normally will only buy a heavier paper but this was good enough in a budget time      
102,5.0,                       i bought myself a new s   ultra and i needed to find good protection for it   i like that the phone case is blk  clear and i can see the color of my phone  i am very satisfied with my purchase  good quality product and very affordable price   feels good to hold in hands   seems very protective   i really recommend      
103,5.0,                       just what i needed  i item arrived perfectly  i saw some other reviews that said they came damaged but took the risk  the pages are perfect for document printing  they have a nice weight to them and are bright white      
104,3.0,                       this is perfectly acceptable paper for normal day to day printing jobs   the paper weight is heavy enough that it doesn t tear not show print through the other side   i use it on my inkjet printer   for high quality printing  however  you d want something better but that fact doesn t detract from the conclusion that is is perfectly fine for day to day use      
105,5.0,                       right white office paper feeds easily in to buy a jet printer  the price was great at the quality is also very good  shipping was fast so i would definitely recommend this if you re looking for just plain copy paper     
106,5.0,                       i don t use a lot of paper so always go with a brand i trust and don t have issues with  this is a company that will always supply a paper i can trust will perform reliably without problems like jamming and smudges      
107,1.0,                       the paper keep jamming our hp printer and all the papers keep sticking together we have been wasting ink due to the papers sticking together  half of what we print ends up between two sheets i have had many types of printer paper and this feels cheap  just not a thick as most printer paper sold      
108,5.0,                       it was a very heavy box and left  squeezed  in to mailbox  i could barely get the heavy box out and then only able to get it into lobby  no way could i bring it upstairs  pulled muscles in my neck  okay now  i had to have a neighbor  luckily he was available  bring it up for me  these heavy items should be brought to front door and not left in mailbox  thank you for listening      
109,5.0,                       genuine hp printer paper  i can t believe they can sell it this cheap and ship it   as long as amzn keeps the price inters range thsi is my source for printer paper   genuine product  buy with confidence      
110,5.0,                       i used to buy this in store but the price went up and then it disappeared  i had to switch to a basic brand at best buy which was comparable  all of my paper is for filing legal pleadings and there s been no complaints  you don t want it to be too bright because it ll really strain your eyes trying to read all the text  there s not a lot to say about paper  remember  when it comes to pleadings  weight is enforced by court rules which is something to keep in mind      
111,5.0,                       this is the go to paper for the family s wireless printer  not only is it cheap but it s off high enough quality that no one has complained so far  saves a lot of driving around  too  knowing it s just a day or   from your doorstep      
112,2.0,                       the paper arrived in good condition  no complaints there  the paper quality is what s poor  it s thin and blotchy  i ve bought cheaper computer paper that was like    that was better quality  this would not be good paper to use in a professional  office  setting    you might be able to use it if your a student printing only text or give it to a child to color on       
113,3.0,                       a lot of this paper was ruined and unusable  the packaging was fine  but when i opened it the paper has been drenched in something green     sheets down the paper is still wrinkled  and printing looks unprofessional  i assume most of the paper will be fine  but i m rather disgruntled      
114,5.0,                       i just needed something that could be delivered  and usually go for value paper  unless i m doing a specific project or need better quality in general   this paper feels great  looks great  prints great      
115,5.0,                       i m not a paper connoisseur  but this paper has met my expectations by allowing my printer to print on it  it is very white  which is good for putting words on it with black ink  it seems to stack well  rectangle was also a very good choice of shape  i recommend it      
116,5.0,                       i order some paper for my printer  this paper came right away  it is soft yet stiff a beautiful shade of china white  i carefully opened the package read the directions and slid some into my printer  it had a wonderful new car type smell  once loaded my printer purred with delight  lights flashing  beeping and seconds latter a warm wonderful copy of my amazon credit card bill came out       
117,5.0,                       my hp printers have always loved hp papers  rarely have paper jams  which means better functioning printers in the long run  i also find hp s photo and other special papers to be very reliable      
118,5.0,                       this is a heavier stock than you would expect for the price and my  go to  for filling my printer the color is bright white  not mottled eggshell or transparent like you find in the lower quality papers      
119,5.0,                       this is great  in between paper   what i mean by that is  it isn t card stock but it isn t cheap or poor quality   if you need printer paper for standard printing jobs  not printing photos  etc   this will do the trick and the price is good      
120,5.0,                       i remember working at a computer lab and having to rip apart the packaging for the reams of paper  so annoying  because the printers would churn through a ream in about two hours or so  this is so much easier  because the paper is all in the box  and you just reach in and grab a bunch  it s even better  because i now work in an office  where our printer doesn t take a ream of paper at a time  so having no divided up reams is even more valuable for me  shipping was fine  it got here on time the paper itself is fine too  i m not printing anything in there that needs to be archived for the centuries  so i couldn t care less if the paper were thin  but it s not thin paper  it s plenty thick enough for my needs  it s also bright white  and i didn t notice any blemishes or issues with my laser printer at home or in the laser printer at the office      
121,2.0,                       i got snookered yet again by a picture of the product which does not accurately reflect what you are getting   the picture makes it look like a full sized box of paper   it s not   if your ordering from a smartphone you ve got to look at the details of how many reams you re getting exactly   it s only   reams  not ten   that is not a good value for          
122,1.0,                       dude this paper is so thin and cheap after i printed the ink was wet and looked smudged if i wanted this crap i could ve went to the dollar tree but i instead bought this thinking this for some quality paper     
123,4.0,                       if you purchase single reams of paper from amazon only purchase sheets covers in plastic  the paper covered ones do not stand a chance in amazon s bins   inbound stower for   years now       
124,5.0,                       the paper was good for the money  it actually came a day earlier than they told me which made me happy  when i opened the box the plastic package the paper came in was already opened  i m pretty sure there was not any paper missing and the paper itself was not damaged  but why was it opened      
125,3.0,                       this paper is bit of a mixed bag  it is extremely thin  and the packaging was ripped open when it arrived  it does do the job if all you need is inexpensive paper for everyday printing  however i wouldn t be using this for anything special      
126,5.0,                       it always gets picked up and printed  unless  of course  i have run over it with my wheelchair and imposed a crinkle   i have had problems with the feed on some of the other papers i have tried  but this one always behaves   i have been buying this paper for about   years and plan to continue      
127,4.0,                       i am confused that i received the printer paper   days after ordering it  it came in a box today  with something i just ordered   days ago  why did it take so long   where has it been      
128,5.0,                       didn t feel like going out into the covid so i just has amazon bring it to me on my amazon day  it actually came earlier than expected and the price and product quality is really good      
129,5.0,                       paper quality is good   i have noticed the color images come out better on this paper than ordinary paper   would highly recommend it one caveat   i have a hp printer as well  not sure how other company inks interact with hp paper     
130,2.0,                       the paper is bright white  has a nice quality  i was pretty happy with it until i started printing some double sided projects  the ink is completely visible through the paper  utterly useless   not sustainable at all      
131,5.0,                       each page of the     sheets are like caressing the surface of a placid lake  the magnitude of the brightness is as if a newborn star has been brought into existence  this paper illuminates the brightness colors and boldest blacks  as i anxiously await it s arrival through the rollers from the drum  i am born again  from coloring pages for my young child  to return labels for online purchases  this paper has been invaluable during our time at home  thank you  hp office     your blank paper is above all the rest      
132,5.0,                       exactly as described  same hp paper you could get at another retailer but when i check both prices i saved     getting it through amazon  huge bonus for a college student  myself  and a mom who homeschools her daughter since we go through a lot of paper weekly      
133,5.0,                       what can i say   it is good paper   i am most happy that i did not have to go to an office supply store or walmart just for a ream of paper   it was so nice to just order a quality ream of paper and have it on my doorstep so quickly   thank you     
134,2.0,                       in the recent batch i received  the paper quality has been inconsistent  some good smooth sheets and some uneven  rough  and dapple textured sheets  i would say       percent of the package is this inferior quality paper  it s evenly dispersed through the stack and makes me wonder if they are cutting cost by mixing subpar products i noticed this problem with the most recent order  within the last   months  but not before  i plan to stop ordering if the quality doesn t improve      
135,5.0,                       i am so glad i purchased this when i did  after the schools closed my grandkids came to stay with me  their school had assignments on line so i could print them out for them to complete  i usually get a   pack  glad i got the   pack instead      
136,4.0,                       solid  relieable paper for most printing needs  certainly is bright enough to make images stand out this    pound paper feels slightly heavier than other products that advertise they are    pounds  which is a good selling point for me  there few things i dislike more than limp paper that i need to file away or distribute  i ve ordered this product twice now and consider it my go to paper for office printing needs      
137,4.0,                       i love the fact that prime delivered the paper to my house the price could be cheaper but i will not complain because it is convenient i printed some papers today and it works well remember that costco sells paper in bulk  also  there are special promotions sometimes in officedepot where you can buy cheaply but most important of all  let s not waste paper  d     
138,4.0,                       i don t own a business  i don t do too much printing and i only bought one ream  the paper is good quality imo  prints well and no issue with my printer     star because the bottom edge of the ream had smallish dents like it got poked with something  i smoothed it out and have had no problems  but still annoying      
139,5.0,                       i was surprised by hp papers the first time i purchased it and have been satisfied by the results  the quality and brightness is great for presentations or kid s coloring pages  which we tend to do a lot of       
140,5.0,                       hp printer paper is an excellent quality of paper  we use it all of the time  the price is right and well with the lower price  plus the paper is bright for copies  would highly recommend this printer paper      
141,5.0,                       works great  printed      pages so far in my hp color laser printer and no jamming or issues with pages getting stuck together  paper is nice and bright  overall great value for the price      
142,4.0,                       for     it s an okay price  the brightness is good as well  i do think it s a bit too thin  so makes it quite see through  this is not the kind of copy paper you should print double sided because there is bleed through to the other side  but overall  good everyday copy paper      
143,2.0,                       incredibly flimsy and thin paper  i read another review that said this was quality paper but no way  if you don t care about it being flimsy then go for it since it s cheap but next time i ll pay more for better quality      
144,5.0,                       great quality and super fast shipping   just what i needed in a pinch   use to print out receipts for orders on my online shops   paper never jams and looks professional   love it      
145,5.0,                       this was a good price  the print quality as expected and the printing is crisp with my hp inkjet printer it s printer paper  i have a hard time getting too excited about it      
146,5.0,                       the hp produce is fine  good  in fact   i m giving   stars for the paper itself   delivery date was forecast to be after april   st and it arrived april  st  that would have been good except every single ream in the box had been  exploded      the wrapping was all torn on the edges  which makes home storage  unpacked with reams on different shelves  much harder   i would have rather gotten the box intact a couple few weeks later      
147,5.0,                       there s not much to say about printer paper   i just need something to save certain documents   don t need the highest quality   it seems to print fine   and it was cheap      
148,5.0,                       for the price i paid i m amazed at how much paper i got  way more than i would have got in store somewhere  i m pretty sure i m going to be good on printer paper for a year or more  the print quality is nice  paper itself is extremely clean and blank      
149,3.0,                       this paper jams easily in my hp printer  it is kept flat in a cabinet and i like in a very low humidity environment when it doesn t jam  i  do like the way even graphics look on the paper  the brighter white makes everything pop on the page      
150,5.0,                       i was pleasantly surprised with this copy paper quality   it s standard    lb   but the print is great quality for my inkjet printer   the paper is lightweight and silky      
151,4.0,                       good for everyday use and i got a really good deal  i paid a little under    for     pages which seems to be a good price to pay  ordering same ones on walmart was more expensive      
152,5.0,                       my hp     can be fussy about paper   i ve never had a problem with hp paper   i could have gotten it a little cheaper at sam s but that would have meant crowds and standing in line   this way it was delivered right to my door the very next day      
153,5.0,                       i bought this paper because it is hp quality  has a high brightness number  and a bit thicker than the last batch i bought  who knew paper  for printers  came in different brightness and thickness  the things one learns on the road through life  i will continue to buy this paper      
154,4.0,                       does not jam in my printer like other reviews have stated  but it is very thin paper  can see very easily thru it  i bought it because my kids are home schooled and we print alot      
155,3.0,                       it s flimsy  but i ve been spoiled by watermark card stock for years  the text looks good  but when   holding it with one hand you need to keep a good curve to keep it from flopping over your hand      
156,1.0,                       this paper is terrible for a printer   it is very thin and feeds multiple sheets at a time  sometimes up to   sheets  and the page prints partially on one sheet and partially on the next sheet   do you yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks for the heavier weight      
157,5.0,                       at first i thought it was just going to be some cheap paper  meaning the quality of the color and thickness was almost see through  i was wrong  i purchase to print out invoices as backup for taxes but ended using this paper forinvoices  company letters  etc     worth the price and much better quality in my opinion than office depot  best buy  etc        
158,3.0,                       was exactly as advertised  however  the team had been dropped and the corners were bent on every page in the ream  was not an issue for our device but had to substitute undamaged paper when we needed to print certain documents  the defect wasn t worth returning the item or asking for a refund but was inconvenient for sure      
159,5.0,                       too bad this is only   ream  i no longer have this item  i used all the sheets  you can purchase yourself  i reckon multiples could get expensive  my next reams of paper came from another supplier      
160,4.0,                       the packaging leaves a lot to be desired  but the quality is good for the price  i think the finish might be a little too smooth for my liking  but still no complaints for what it is      
161,5.0,                       can t beat the value and shipping to your front door   at only       per ream of     sheets is a hell of a buy   i ordered   reams of this paper         sheets for only        which includes shipping    reams is not a light shipment so this is a great bargain      
162,3.0,                       this paper is thin and it serves its purpose havent had any problems with it except my printer james a couple of times but could of been the printer which is an hp envy but both doing there job just fine     
163,3.0,                       i bought this paper to go with my hp deskjet printer since it s hp as well but the ink is smudging no matter how long it has been sitting for  i get my ink shipped to me directly from hp with the subscription i have with them  when i try to highlight things on the papers i print  the ink smudges along with it  i have papers that are a month old that i tested while typing this review and i ran my finger over the words and it s smudging  i don t know if it s an ink issue or a paper issue but it just is not acceptable      
164,1.0,                       i have hp      priner   this paper bad quality   so thin   some time  paper stuck in side the priner update          have to throw away  order wise   have to fix the priner all the time     
165,5.0,                          search amazon for     ct  ream of computer paper   select this item and pay   in two days pick package up off your porch see easy peasy all the way     
166,4.0,                       this paper is super thin which i guess makes sense considering the price  i ve just used it for scratch paper and notes  i wouldn t want to do heavy printing with this stuff      
167,2.0,                       this paper has a pink hue  it s subtle but noticeable   i will be using this only for scratch paper  as i do not want documents printed on paper that is off white      
168,5.0,                       this paper works like a charm in my canon black and white laser printer    no complaints at all   the paper is entirely loose   though   so be careful it doesn t spill out once the box is opened       
169,5.0,                       we really like this paper  the texture is perfect  we go through a lot of paper and haven t had any problems with it jamming or   pages going through at the same time  it doesn t smear either      
170,5.0,                       this paper is perfect for my needs  i don t need business quality but it seems like it is business quality  i m happy  i needed paper and hewlett packard produces decent paper      
171,5.0,                       i purchased this paper for working from home  i have not printed on it yet  so cannot rate it for that  not sure how to rate it  its paper and i can write on it so i am happy  i will order this again      
172,5.0,                       it was just the right price for the right kind of paper for my needs  no complaints  i now have      sheets for under        and delivered for free on amazon prime      
173,2.0,                       not sure about this bottom rung paper  it may have caused print heads to drag  because since using this paper my printer began pulling   or more sheets of paper     if you can buy the better quality  do so      
174,5.0,                       for the price  this is good quality paper for day to day printing the box has easy side access that is very convenient and well designed  i like that i don t have to keep opening up paper wrapped reams what you have to watch is the delivery   i have ordered this box a number of times  and sometimes the delivery service has been less than kind to the box   admittedly  it is a heavy item   but that doesn t mean they can toss the box around my advice    when the box arrives  give it a quick visual inspection   particularly for dents and cuts in the box   make sure they don t damage the paper inside usually everything is fine   that s a small bit of caution   you ll probably not have any trouble   the product itself is great      
175,5.0,                       it is great paper for my printing needs  i primarily use my printer to print basic paperwork or documents in black and white  it is worth the price and will last me a long time  i am an avid printer who prints out my books for school  so i ordered   of these   packages of paper     page count per package in each box     so   thumbs up for me but i can say that it all depends on personal preference too  i print from an epson workforce       i do not own an hp printer but this paper does the job  i have no problems with this paper         
176,5.0,                       great paper  great price we homeschool and print a lot  so it is great for printed text and pencil filled worksheets not so good for fountain pen writing      
177,5.0,                       nice  bright paper for my printer for a good price without having to leave the house  works well in my brother inkjet printer either one sided or two sided  no blurring  would buy again      
178,5.0,                       i was not surprised about the quality  it s good  but i was surprised i could order one ream of paper and get free shipping with prime  my gas and time savings paid for the product easily      
179,4.0,                       the paper itself is great  however  it seems all the corners have become damaged during shipping  i guess i will be buying in person vs online from now on      
180,4.0,                       would ve been better if the sheets were thicker  my hp printer fond it hard to pick up the paper when printing as it s too thin   most of the time  the printer tells me to reload paper into the printer  never hard this problem with the previous brand of paper i bought      
181,1.0,                       i bought this hp paper office   instead of my usual hp multipurpose    thinking the quality would be similar  unfortunately  the paper constantly jammed in my older hp printer  now i am back to the hp multipurpose    and the printer is purring along again      
182,5.0,                       with this ongoing pandemic  i m glad i can purchase all my school supplies at amazon for me and my daughter s online school  i used to buy this copy paper at walmart  thanks amazon      
183,5.0,                       hp never disappoints with their products and their paper is no exception  the cost of this paper is really nice as well  great quality prints  and the brightness of the prints is really great as well  highly recommended      
184,5.0,                       i buy this paper for my grandson so we can skype and he can show me how to draw lego men and minecraft guys   thanks for helping me make memories with him        
185,5.0,                       if you need it fast this works   good quality well packed  does not break through at corners   a little pricier than a retail store but worth it all the same      
186,5.0,                       it s well packaged  good quality paper  it hasn t caused any issues in my printer and doesn t seem to have any defects  it s just regular printer paper      
187,5.0,                       i think i paid less than half what it would have cost me to buy it at the local office depot and it was delivered to my front door  excellent quality for general office printing      
188,4.0,                       paper seemed a little thin at first  prints good  no smudges  feeds in the printer without problems  what more do you want from paper    it s paper  will buy gain if needed      
189,4.0,                       it is very cheap and of good quality  my daughter used it to paint   they like it very much      
190,1.0,                       bought the   pack trusting the hp quality   however  what was in all three reams was some good paper mixed in with cheap  thin paper   obvious different types of paper mixed together   what a disappointment   i hope hp does some quality control on this   i don t think anyone would like to get ripped off this way      
191,5.0,                       idk what you want me to say it s paper      when i print using this paper  the words stay where i put them  nor do the randomly disappear  honk honk      
192,5.0,                       the product was delivered a day before it was expected which surprised me considering how difficult somethings are during this time with the virus going around and everything  it worked for what i needed it for    i would recommend      
193,4.0,                       every thing is okay i think like because the paper is a bit thin  sometimes while print lots i seem to have a paper jam  the paper brightness is medium range but it s value for money     
194,5.0,                       these came very quickly  i m impressed at the quality of the paper especially for the price  i used in a canon pixma printer that used to get jammed a lot  have not had a single paper jam with this paper      
195,5.0,                       great overall quality and best price  better than walmart prices  not to thick or thin  just right  regular printing paper  ordered   more reams      
196,4.0,                       the only flaw in my opinion is that the box is just all loose paper i was expecting reams of paper and i don t like to have that box with all that list paper and it like that just my preference     
197,5.0,                       i work remotely  and conduct most of my business electronically  that said  i occasionally need to print documents  and this smaller box of paper is the perfect size because it doesn t require tons of space for storage  great quality  too      
198,2.0,                       good paper  shipper dumped box in a bigger box  threw some paper in the negligently taped box  arrived nearly open  hp paper box rolling around inside  paper edges damaged  when the paper is not tight and damaged  causes frequent printer jams  really dumb      
199,2.0,                       this review may be a bit miss leading because the paper is not the problem  the packaging is  this ream of paper arrived with the plastic wrapper split and a lot of the paper was loose in the box  some of it is useable but some is not because of jamming possibilities  its not cost effective to return it and not economical because only some can be used  this is the second time this happened  the first was with a ream of       x      i won t be ordering it again      
200,4.0,                       the paper itself is soft  which is a good thing  the down side is that the paper really is thin and really thin paper make it for your printer getting jammed  the printer kept on occasion taking   pages and it would get jammed      
201,3.0,                       although the product was very affordable and the delivery was quick  the paper is very thin   thinner than any other paper that i have used in the past  and i have used thousands      
202,5.0,                       i just needed a small amount of basic paper  not a ton   i found this and am pleasantly surprised   a great value   thank you a great value for the price        
203,5.0,                       i rarely use my printer these days  but always like to have some on hand  these are great for every day use  straight forward   to the point      
204,5.0,                       i m a housewife but i still have a need to print things or make copies of documents occasionally  the print quality of this paper is good and i got more pages for my money then i would have at my local store  i have a canon printer and this paper makes the ink look nice and clear      
205,5.0,                       the paper is solid quality and at less than      it is a steal of a deal  i just use the paper to edit my own papers and it serves its purpose  i will order again      
206,5.0,                       it has really premium performance on hp equipment  as well as on all other printer and copier equipment   colorlok technology provides more vivid colors  bolder blacks and faster drying     
207,3.0,                       the paper does what i need it do  but i was disappointed in how thin and flimsy it is  not the best quality  i mostly use it for kids activities and extra drawing paper and obviously it doesnt matter to them how thin the paper is  but slightly embarrassed about handing the parents a monthly activities calendar on this super flimsy paper      
208,4.0,                       cheap paper so expect it to feel cheap  i wouldn t use this if need to print out something nice but this is good for just every day use or scratch paper      
209,3.0,                           is where it s at  not this     garbo  bought this and it feels cheap  serves us right  we don t even know where the printer is though  dad agrees on quality  you want cheap paper  this is it      
210,5.0,                       this paper is the perfect weight and brightness for printing everyday documents that require filiing or mailing   great value and high quality printing papter     
211,5.0,                       our local shops no longer carry typing  printing paper   this makes a perfect alternative  delivered in   days  good quality  inexpensive  highly recommended      
212,4.0,                       paper quality  looks good little bit thinner than i expected but thats ok until they are working fine for me  only thing is price i felt they are over priced other than that they are ok  not so good but not so bad also      
213,5.0,                       i only use hp products with my hp printer   that s where i used it   i put it in my printer  it was easy to install and printed pages come out clean and crisp      
214,3.0,                       i have an epson printer and it did not like this paper  will have to switch back to that generic printer paper from target that it like      
215,5.0,                       i don t use much printer paper at home so getting one ream of great quality paper delivered at a price cheaper than going to walmart is fantastic      
216,3.0,                       i ordered   packs of this hp paper   when they arrived  all   had been already cut open   we ll keep them  but i probably won t order these again      
217,5.0,                       good quality papers    white color and perfect for household printing   have been using these for a while and they are cheap and good       
218,1.0,                       the pack i got has most of the pages glued together  probably whatever used for cover s paint leaked  not sure  the bottom line   this can t be used in any printer        
219,5.0,                       received my printer paper today and immediately started printing my tax returns  lol    crystal clear  thank you and fast shipping too      
220,4.0,                       the print quality of this paper is ok  i don t find that it s better than the generic brand i usually get at target  i found that the ink smears when i try to highlight it  even after printing days in advance the ink smears when highlighting it  that was my only issue with this paper      
221,5.0,                       i have no problems at all with this particular printer paper  it arrived fast and is perfect in brightness and quality  good product      
222,5.0,                       i was looking for paper for my printer and couldn t find  but this was a good deal super bright and crisp  good value with out buying a box full     
223,5.0,                       the print quality on this hp paper is great  no complaints about the brightness and value for the money was another plus  saves me a trip to the store      
224,5.0,                       well  not much you can say about paper  however  that said  this paper is bright  not too thin  and an excellent buy for the money  recommended      
225,5.0,                       we live in a small town  sometimes i cannot get printer paper locally  it is so easy and convenient to order this paper from amazon      
226,5.0,                       if your looking for a deal on printer or copy paper that gives you the bang for your buck in both quality and quantity you have to get this       pieces     packages in   box  auto refill available  love it for the moeny and quantity and no worries about quality with my printer i have the hp officejet      and im      satisfied     
227,2.0,                       is not a good quality paper     
228,5.0,                       i was pleased to purchase this quality printer paper at a discount  it works great in my epson workforce printer  no paper jams  no smears  just quality print      
229,5.0,                       delivered on time well packaged   hp a great brand for clarity and brightness   not sure about value for the money  but will buy every time     
230,5.0,                    este papel es genial la impresion sale n tida las hojas son super blancas calidad de impresion y brillo es una excelente  compra e inversi n        
231,5.0,                       packaging was not damaged  some said it was   i decided to had an order it wasn t very expensive and my package came in perfect condition and it s pretty good printing paper     
232,1.0,                       product arrived opened  with warped paper and water stained paper   i ordered another hp paper brand from another posting and same issue   don t buy this crappy damaged product      
233,5.0,                       i have an hp printer and needed paper  the price was really great and i couldn t pass it up  completely recommend hp paper for printing needs      
234,4.0,                       if you re a lefty like me  and have to use pencil to fill in notes  math problems  etc   i suggest a different paper as pencil smears everywhere      
235,2.0,                       one of the packages was either damaged or used  quality is ok for this price  i need it for my school  so i didn t mind the quality  i did mind the open package      
236,5.0,                       nothing to complain about  great for print  quality is v good  price is v good  can t go wrong  never a paper jam  always consistent quality      
237,5.0,                       i can tell you that it arrived via usps  couldn t fit into my mailbox  so i had to pick it up at my local post office  which wasn t a problem  i got exactly what was advertised  i was also glad that it was delivered usps  or any well known carrier  because with my purchase of glossy  x  by    it was delivered by some third or eighth rate carrier who basically tossed the package in the yard into a snowbank  the price fit my needs at the time and the paper was is quality  a good purchase      
238,4.0,                       well  i was expecting   reams   wrapped separately as shown in the picture   but the paper is all  loose  in a box  made me laugh out loud  i m using the cover of the box to hold a ream of paper until i need some for my printer  the rest is still in the box in the closet  i would have preferred wrapped reams  keeps them clean      
239,4.0,                       good value for the money but i found it cheaper in the store so i canceled my purchase but if you don t have any stores near you then this is a great deal     
240,5.0,                       product is a standard quality paper  it is great for the price  the only problem is the paper was delivered to the wrong address  basically my neighbor delivered it to me      
241,5.0,                       math works out to roughly        per sheet of paper  which is great value for the money compared to other reams you see on amazon  or even staples  add in free shipping and     day delivery  this is a great buy  there s not much to say about the paper itself other than the fact that it s   well   paper and it seems like the quality is there  no problems with jams and print quality is fine  good for everyday use      
242,4.0,                       the only copy paper that we buy   it prints so well and heavy enough for projects and everyday use   the multi pack is much more economical and i ordered that too but the shipping is   weeks out and we need paper now         
243,1.0,                       the paper is great but the package came without any protection for the paper  so it is damaged paper      
244,2.0,                       this paper is unbelievably thin  i had some from another store that was cheaper and better quality  i ll go back to buying that  print quality is not the best  idk  if you need cheap paper this is probably perfect for you      
245,5.0,                       it s paper the amount advertised and good quality  but it could probably be cheaper  unfortunately all the places in town are out of in store paper     
246,5.0,                       works well no jamming we like our boise x  paper a little better for print quality but good price and  no real complaints     
247,5.0,                       great deal    not sure how they can sell it this cheap   if you can wait a week or so  the price is worth the wait      
248,2.0,                       maybe i should have educated myself on the weight of the paper first   this stuff is very thin  so double sided printing means you see everything printed on the other side      
249,5.0,                       excellent paper for documents  photos and printing  the colors are glossy and nice   this paper is one of the best ever   you can print with these papers   and it get the job done right   every time       
250,1.0,                       this might sound odd as we ve never experienced this before but the paper smelled so bad once we took it out of the plastic that we had to keep it in our garage and then just put it in our recycling  i would not buy this brand again      
251,3.0,                    la hoja es buena  tienen brillo y es  til  pero el empaque ven a abierto  no se porque pero bueno por el precio que pague realmente no es tan malo        
252,1.0,                       box taped shut  papers loose in box and without ream wrappers      
253,1.0,                       opened  corner bent  and something brown scattered between papers  eww     
254,5.0,                       pandemic social distancing and local stock shortage has amazon s availability and delivery filling a need   thank you      
255,5.0,                       i needed printer paper now that i workfrom home and didn t want to pay a lot  this is perfect   cheap and gets the job done      
256,5.0,                       it s paper  use it for everything from printer to sketch pads  can t beat the price  nice add on to your order when you need something cheap to get free shipping      
257,5.0,                       this paper sizing is as advertised  the sheets are    x   inches and they work nicely in my printer  the brightness is as promised  though some sheets look to me like a       brightness in the daylight  but that is fine  in the dark these sheets of paper are not bright at all  but i still like them  they are a good value      
258,5.0,                       unlike my printer i never have had a problem using this paper  it is my go to choice and i can t see using any other      
259,2.0,                       product was good  it s paper      but delivery sucked   i usually don t complaint but this delivery sucked big time  it looks like they played soccer with the box  box was broken  reams of  paper were damaged and unsealed  see pictures        
260,5.0,                       just what we needed  we ve ordered this a few times and it s so convenient not to have to go to the store just for paper      
261,5.0,                       all around great printer paper at the right price point  i don t know what to say other than it works like it should      
262,5.0,                       i have used this paper in the past this is a reorder      i am quite satisfied with it  it has good weight  color and cost      
263,1.0,                       this paper is very thin  if you have   sheets on top of one another you can practically see right through it  very disappointing  i would not purchase again  amazon basics paper is much better      
264,5.0,                       was pleased to find this printer paper at such a great price during the prime day sales  the quality is that of your usual printer paper      
265,5.0,                       very good quality paper   because it is just a bit heavier thicker   it produces a very nice  archival quality product      
266,5.0,                       hp produces some of the finest printer paper i ve ever used   the price makes it an exceptional bargain as well      
267,5.0,                       what an easy way to purchase the paper i need   it arrived in a timely fashion  seems like good quality everyday paper for the printer  at a good price to boot   i m very happy with my purchase      
268,5.0,                       when a man reaches a crossroad  he must look deep into his soul and ask himself  will i use just any old paper in my printer  or will i go the extra mile  no matter what the cost  and print like no document has been printed since antiquity   thus  i opted for hp office     the cr me de la cr me of printing paper   a paper of such fine quality that you will never again give another brand of paper the time of day   god bless this paper        
269,4.0,                       we homeschool and use a ton of paper for printing worksheets  this is good paper but not the cheapest  i ordered through amazon because i needed it asap and it arrived quickly the next morning which was nice      
270,5.0,                       great printer paper  i need to print about a ream once a month and this helps save on costs  works well in my cannon laser printer      
271,5.0,                       the paper is thin but i don t copy on both sides and it s great for that reason so when i need more copy paper i will buy again     
272,5.0,                       this    brightness paper is good for everyday printing   tho i use a brighter paper when printing for presentations      
273,4.0,                       it s especially nice to be able to order these essentials  especially during difficult times like a pandemic      
274,5.0,                       consistantly excellent quality print  and does not jam  which some cheaper papers tend to do in our printers      
275,5.0,                       not much to say about a collection of papers  other than the quality is really good  and the price is really great      
276,5.0,                       perfectly good paper at a great price  used mainly for printing random emails  documents and kids pictures   so not professional stuff   but paper seems thick and quality to me      
277,5.0,                       we live in an area an hour away from office supplies   this was a great price and great paper for the home printer      
278,5.0,                       have used this product before  but usually purchase single reams at the local office supply  bought these because the single unit price was better than both the brick and mortar  and the multi unit price online      
279,4.0,                       i wanted thick paper to print on but this will do  i don t print much and this should last me like   years easily  so longer than the life of my printer

309,5.0,                       excellent value  came fast  esp considering these covid    times   and most of all  the packaging was excellent  so there was no damage  i ll order from here again      
310,2.0,                       cannot be used for duplex printing  worst paper i ve ever used honestly  i didn t know they made it this thin  would have similar results printing on toilet paper  print quality is bad and documents aren t legible if you use duplex printing      
311,5.0,                       by far the most affordable printer paper option on amazon  i have used this exact paper order for years      
312,1.0,                       this product has been very difficult to set up  and once it was set up it continues to hive us issues  it s quality of printing was fine but we have literally only been able to use a handful of times without paper jams or just other printer issues coming up   i need a family friendly printer that is easy to use and can be easily connected to print using the air printer  this one is not great at all and basically a waste of money now that i need to buy a new one       
313,5.0,                       paper works great in my printer  nice quality and doesn t seem to be cheap and super thin like others  will buy again      
314,5.0,                       i read a lot and its easier for me to print than to read everything from the screen   this paper is of good quality and inexpensive enough that it allows me to print most of what i read      
315,5.0,                       paper is a little thick and jams a bit more than other paper  but still a value for the money     
316,2.0,                       the price and quantity were good for me  the quality of the paper is not what i was hoping for the paper is a bit gray  not bright white as i had hoped and it is also pretty thin  it will do for now but i don t think i will be ordering this paper again      
317,5.0,                       not much to say about these papers   they work fine for me   use them to create inserts for ebay and amazon packaging   no complaints      
318,2.0,                       got it in the mail yesterday   didn t open it till today  and the i side package of paper was already open at the top and along the side  also some of it was wrinkled and bent  i went ahead and used it bc i needed to print off a somethings for an event  i did not sit there and count them to see if it was all there  would not recommend  only reason there is   stars is because prime got it to me fast      
319,5.0,                       the ream of paper was ok  but the package got destroyed by the carrier or warehouse   i do not want a replacement   seller was not necessarily at fault      
320,5.0,                    es mi segunda orden  y la verdad es que el precio y la calidad es muy buena   es perfecto para imprimir e incluso tomar notas         
321,2.0,                       the paper was okay  although the wrapping on a couple of the reams was busted  but why not use the normal ream size box instead of two boxes that didn t fit and required packing paper       
322,5.0,                       excellent quality   use for most printing needs and buy glossy paper to print photos or pictures      
323,5.0,                       michael wont be happy   but he lost another account best paper for regular printing and good price      
324,5.0,                       i must print to many quilt patterns   they take a lot of paper   nice to not have to run out and get some   i should stock up   lol     
325,5.0,                       high quality  low price paper that is fsc certified papers  the price per page was the best and shipping was super fast      
326,5.0,                       this is some premium paper  its nice and thick but not too thick  it just feels good in your hands when you are filing with this paper      
327,5.0,                       i like the quality of the paper  great value for money  will buy again after i finish this ream      
328,5.0,                       this is good quality paper at a great price  and who doesn t love when it gets delivered to your door and you don t have to worry about getting overpriced paper at the store and hauling it to the car  this is the only way that we purchase printer paper      
329,5.0,                       having purchased this product before  i knew what to expect  good value and fast shipping      
330,5.0,                       love the price  received in perfect condition  very happy with this purchase and you will too      
331,3.0,                       the value was great for a  new  ream of paper  but i am not so happy that the outer packaging came ripped  it clearly wasn t just shipping damage  because the box that it came in was in perfect condition  it looks like somebody started to rip it open  had second thoughts and maybe returned it  there would have been no way for it it rip the way it did normally  at least the paper inside was not damaged      
332,3.0,                       extremely disappointed in the product in how it arrived it i got the feeling it was opened and then resealed and the two reams were torn     
333,5.0,                       couldn t be happier  it was a nice white color  prints smooth  and the colors are nice and bright  so much easier than me driving     miles to the closest store to buy printer paper      
334,5.0,                       among those many different kinds of papers in my opinion  this is the best  pricewise and qualitywise  it would not be very noticeable but absorbing and embedding way is pretty neat and tidy      toug to explain lol     
335,5.0,                       great product for my needs  with homeschooling i have to print a lot of papers    great value and quality      
336,5.0,                       good value  i have found that at times the print smudges even after providing a significant amount of drying time  but overall good product

341,5.0,                       due to covid     i ve actually had to buy printing paper for the first time in a decade instead of just taking some from my offices  it does the job  what more can you ask for

353,3.0,                       when i opened the box paper was flying everywhere very poor packaging  but all the paper was in the box and of a pretty good quality it was just packed poorly

403,4.0,                       great for the value  but if you want brighter i say go with a different one      
404,5.0,                       i have only praise for this paper  never had a jam with it in my hp printer feels like a higher quality paper      
405,5.0,                       could not tell if instant ink paper was any different from this one  i already have instant ink from hp it is important to us the right paper  right ink  and right printer tired of rampant false advertising  especially knock offs sold as genuine      
406,4.0,                       the packaging was okay  it was a little dirty on one side and one corner of the papers was dented  other than that  the paper was fine  the print quality is okay   it s a little see through but that s not too big of a deal to me  overall  for    and overnight delivery  it was a great purchase

411,5.0,                       very nice paper quality and it arrived in perfect condition  it was a good price too      
412,5.0,                       expensive so    star on value  but doesn t jam  which is worth more than a couple extra boxes a ream  clear printing on inkjet  no smearing  i would not use anything else in my hp printers      
413,5.0,                       paper looks great and works as it should   for this price it did not pay to go out for it   very happy      
414,1.0,                       outer packaging was damaged  just opened boxes and paper in the inside is not usable  total waste of money      
415,5.0,                       the printer paper was of very good quality and the item arrived on time and in very good condition      
416,1.0,                       good product  but why is it so expensive  costs twice as much at amazon      
417,3.0,                       when you print  the paper does not come straight and have rolls because the printing makes it warm a bit  and the paper is very thin  bare in mind      
418,5.0,                       good paper for a good price   if you re not in a rush to get it  this is a great deal   it was here in   days      
419,1.0,                       paper gets jammed in a hp printer  this is a first for me if covid wasn t around  i would have just stick with cheap walmart paper to print receipts

527,5.0,                       really good quality  just a little expensive than other sales      
528,2.0,                       thinner paper for everyday use than i thought i would get if you use colours using an hp office jet printer paper could remain wetfor a long time   show signs of smooth creasing this paper is even worse for copying text it was used on an hp      plus office jetyou would do much better with standard printingpaper from one of the warehouse stores made by or for a company beginning with the letter x much more bang for your buck  a much thicker paper great for printing  faxing or copying on an hp           
529,4.0,                       i d give this   stars  but i try to save that for products that are better than i expected   this is copier paper   it works exactly as expected   it is a nice weight and color      
530,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          paper is fine  for the most part  the corners where the package was viciously tore open  however  is slightly damaged  it s a bit obsurd

535,4.0,                       it appears that amazon has resolved the problem of some companies shipping this product without placing it in a separate container  as reported in some earlier reviews   the  quickpack  box is an advertised feature of this product  any company that sells and ships it should be aware of this fact and pack it inside of a separate cardboard shipping box  that said  this is an average quality paper with a premium shipping cost  i only recommend this product for those who prefer the pull down side panel feature of the box itself      
536,5.0,                       this paper works well with my cannon printer i will buy it again

823,5.0,                       the quality is good  we need online courses every day     
824,5.0,                       pretty awesome  arrived fairly quick and prints well  might consider putting in a standing order      
825,5.0,                       good price for a high quality paper without having to buy a case at a tine  delivery time was very quick      
826,5.0,                       usual paper  but the packaging is ideal  the box opens up to reveal all sheets unbound   perfect way to avoid unwrapping all those reams of paper   i will buy this packaging style in the future      
827,1.0,                       the easy to open box without internal wrappers seems like a great idea except amazon ships the box without an outer box  so the box that you are stuck with is covered in grime and dirt when it arrives   if amazon would ship the box within another box to protect it from damage and dirt  this product would be a great idea   now i am stuck with a      sheet box of paper that is dented  torn  dusty  and partially covered in an unknown sticky black residue      
828,5.0,                       great value for money

949,5.0,                       i like the convenient  no fuss packaging of having loose paper in one big box instead of having to tear through stacks of paper the paper quality is good   paper doesn t stick clump like some other brands and ink doesn t smear i agree with the other reviewers that sometimes it arrives with the box beat up  it ships as it s own package and isn t protected by another box or wrapping     if you have this problem just contact amazon and they will fix the problem

1257,5.0,                       fine paper for value      
1258,5.0,                       good price and arrived quickly     
1259,5.0,                       this is okay paper but i would not repurchase it  for whatever unknown reason  my canon pixma printer did not like this paper  and routinely ate several sheets at a time  it s almost like the paper was too thin and slippery  could the problem be the printer rather than the new ream of paper  who knows   but it s never had that problem before      
1260,5.0,                       great paper  i use it for my small business and i love it  it came in a huge box with some paper wrapped around it  it arrived perfectly fine      
1261,5.0,                       good paper  i have re ordered      
1262,5.0,                       quality paper at a great price  my printer is happy and so am i     
1263,2.0,                       i received item     box it came in was not damaged    packaging paper was in was cut in the middle so about first    sheets or so were damaged with a slice in it or a marking where the slice would be was imprinted in the paper so could not use     
1264,5.0,                       good value     
1265,5.0,                       i use this for home printing  i don t do a large amount of printing at home  i wanted to save money on paper but didn t want the   ream box  this is a much better choice for home printing      
1266,5.0,                       i love the fact that it came so fast  it told me a set date and was there just like it said it would be  good quality of paper  definatly plan on purchasing again      
1267,5.0,                       good value     
1268,3.0,                       hook up directions leave a lot for desire  extremely lousy        
1269,5.0,                       it s paper don t know why people are hating on paper  i haven t experience any problems when printing with these  very nice bright white  get a lot of paper worth of your money      
1270,2.0,                       this is a somewhat disappointing paper from hp  when you open the box  you will notice first that the color is really not a good paper color and also that the color is not uniform  nor is the tone even across the face of the paper  which gives the appearance of a subtle blotchiness  there is a hint of grey in in the color  which makes it look a bit like newsprint  it s a real misnomer to call this  ulta white    kinda greyish  is more accurate the second thing you will notice is that the paper is thin  now  this is   lb paper  not     but it looks and feels thin lastly  this paper suffers from significant bleedthrough  which means that you cannot use it for double sided printing or copying i will use the three reams  since it would be a shame to return the paper and possibly waste it  but i won t order more  as one should print double sided whenever possible to save paper      
1271,4.0,                       the paper works fine with my hp inkjet printer what i like is how the paper is set in this box  there are no individual reams  this saves time cutting and opening reams of paper  i wasn t certain if i initially would like this idea but it works well i keep the paper within the carton  the carton opens  as shown  for easy access      
1272,5.0,                       this paper is great quality and very affordable on amazon  convenient and easy to purchase
